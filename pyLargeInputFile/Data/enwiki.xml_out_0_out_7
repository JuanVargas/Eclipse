h [[Belgrano Athletic Club]], the local rivals dominated Argentine football for more than a decade. The two clubs won all 13 league championships contested between 1899 and 1911.

Alumni participated in the inaugural Association Football League (AAFL) league in 1893, and played again in 1895 and 1900, under the name English High School. In 1901 they changed their name to Alumni, they continued to play in the league until the club were disbanded in 1911.

The club were disbanded for two main reasons, the first was the shortage of players caused by the fact that they rarely allowed players from outside the institution of the English High School. The second main reason was that the club was losing a lot of money and it seemed unlikely that they could fulfil their fixtures for 1912.

==Rugby union==
Kept as a social club for several years, Alumni started a youth [[rugby union]] team in 1951, which achieved good results. In 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires league]], reaching the second division. The club would later climb up to first division and win 5 titles; 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and in 2001.

In 2002, Alumni won its first [[Nacional de Clubes|Nacional]] title, defeating Jockey of Rosario 23-21 in the final.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
In traditional [[logic]], an '''axiom''' or '''postulate''' is a proposition that is not proved or demonstrated but considered to be either [[self-evidence|self-evident]], or subject to necessary [[Decision making|decision]]. That is to say, an axiom is a logical statement that is assumed to be true. Therefore, its truth is taken for granted, and serves as a starting point for deducing and inferring other (theory dependent) truths. 

In [[mathematics]], the term ''axiom'' is used in two related but distinguishable senses: [[#Logical axioms|&quot;logical axioms&quot;]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|&quot;non-logical axioms&quot;]]. In both senses, an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Unlike [[theorem]]s, axioms (unless redundant) cannot be derived by principles of deduction, nor are they demonstrable by [[mathematical proof]]s, simply because they are starting points; there is nothing else from which they logically follow (otherwise they would be classified as theorems).

Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be universally true (e.g., ''A'' and ''B'' implies ''A''), while non-logical axioms (e.g., {{nowrap|1= ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}) are actually defining properties for the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as [[arithmetic]]). When used in the latter sense, &quot;axiom,&quot; &quot;postulate&quot;, and &quot;assumption&quot; may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory. To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.

Outside logic and mathematics, the term &quot;axiom&quot; is used loosely for any established principle of some field.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;axiom&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{polytonic|ἀξίωμα}} (''axioma''), a [[verbal noun]] from the verb {{polytonic|ἀξιόειν}} (''axioein''), meaning &quot;to deem worthy&quot;, but also &quot;to require&quot;, which in turn comes from {{polytonic|ἄξιος}} (''axios''), meaning &quot;being in balance&quot;, and hence &quot;having (the same) value (as)&quot;, &quot;worthy&quot;, &quot;proper&quot;. Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.

The root meaning of the word 'postulate' is to 'demand'; for instance, [[Euclid]] demands of us that we agree that some things can  be done, e.g. any two points can be joined by a straight line, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, P.  Breakthroughs in Mathematics, 1963, New York: New American Library, pp&amp;nbsp;47&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting Euclid's books [[Proclus]] remarks that &quot;[[Geminus]] held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. L. Heath|Heath, T.]] 1956. The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements. New York: Dover. ''p200''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] translated 'postulate' as ''petitio'' and called the axioms  ''notiones communes'' but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.

==Historical development==
===Early Greeks===
The logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments (syllogisms, rules of inference), was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. [[tautology (logic)|Tautologies]] excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions ([[theorem]]s, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms ''axiom'' and ''postulate'' hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for [[Aristotle]] and [[Euclid]].

The ancient Greeks considered [[geometry]] as just one of several [[science]]s{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's [[posterior analytics]] is a definitive exposition of the classical view.

An “axiom”, in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that &lt;blockquote&gt;''When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a ''postulate''. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.

The classical approach is well illustrated by [[Euclid's Elements]], where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of &quot;common notions&quot; (very basic, self-evident assertions).

:;Postulates
:# It is possible to draw a [[straight line]] from any point to any other point.
:# It is possible to extend a [[line segment]] continuously in a straight line.
:# It is possible to describe a [[circle]] with any center and any radius.
:# It is true that all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.
:# (&quot;[[Parallel postulate]]&quot;) It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the [[polygon|interior angles]] on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] on that side on which are the [[angles]] less than the two right angles.

:;Common notions:
:# Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
:# If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
:# If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
:# Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
:# The whole is greater than the part.

===Modern development===
A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, [[propositional logic|propositions]], theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for [[primitive notion]]s, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. [[Alessandro Padoa]], [[Mario Pieri]], and [[Giuseppe Peano]] were pioneers in this movement.

Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. [[Field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[group (mathematics)|group theory]], [[topological space|topology]], [[linear space|vector spaces]]) without ''any'' particular application in mind. The distinction between an “axiom” and a “postulate” disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, [[hyperbolic geometry]] for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like “line” and “parallel” with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.

When mathematicians employ the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.

It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are “propositions that are regarded as true without proof.” Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.

Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and [[logic]] itself can be regarded as a branch of mathematics. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] are some of the key figures in this development.

In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any [[Class (set theory)|collection]] of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be [[consistent]]; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.

It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of [[Euclidean geometry]], and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.

In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]]. Here the emergence of [[Russell's paradox]], and similar antinomies of [[naive set theory]] raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.

The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms ([[peano arithmetic|Peano's axioms]], for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a [[corollary]], Gödel proved that the consistency of a theory like [[Peano arithmetic]] is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.

It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of [[natural number]]s, an [[infinite]] but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] for set theory. The [[axiom of choice]], a key hypothesis of this theory, remains a very controversial assumption. Furthermore, using techniques of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] ([[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Cohen]]) one can show that the [[continuum hypothesis]] (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.

===Other sciences===
Axioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in [[Theoretical Physics]]. In particular, the monumental work of [[Isaac Newton]] is essentially based on [[Euclid]]'s axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of [[spacetime]] and the physics taking place in it at any moment.

In 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Special Relativity]], and later-on by the [[General Relativity]].

Additional importance refers in the fourth decade of the 19th century to another paper of Albert Einstein and coworkers (see [[EPR paradox]]), almost immediately contradicted by [[Niels Bohr]], concerning the interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be [[Probability theory|probabilistic]], whereas according to Einstein it should be [[deterministic]]. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of &quot;theorems&quot; derived by it, seemed to be  identical.  Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics  &quot;hidden variables&quot; to enforrce determinism. However,  thirty years later, in  1964,  [[John Bell]] found a theorem involving complicated optical correlations (see [[Bell inequalities]]), which yielded measurably different results with Einstein's and Bohr's axioms, respectively. And it took roughly another twenty years, until an experiment of [[Alain Aspect]] got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].)

As a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;locality&quot; of experiments.

In any respect, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics it generally does not make sense  at all, neither to &quot;prove&quot; nor to &quot;disprove&quot; an axiom for a set of theorems, i.e. for a &quot;theory&quot; following from the axioms. In contrast, in physics a comparison with experiments makes always sense, since a [[Falsification|falsified]] physical theory needs [[modification]].

==Mathematical logic==
In the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: ''logical'' and ''non-logical'' (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between &quot;axioms&quot; and &quot;postulates&quot; respectively).

===Logical axioms===

These are certain [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] in a [[formal language]] that are universally [[validity|valid]], that is, formulas that are [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by every [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignment]] of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms ''at least'' some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in the language; in the case of [[predicate logic]] more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove [[logical truth]]s that are not tautologies in the strict sense.

====Examples====
=====Propositional logic=====

In [[propositional logic]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; can be any formulae of the language and where the included [[Logical connective|primitive connectives]] are only &quot;&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;&quot; for [[negation]] of the immediately following proposition and &quot;&lt;math&gt;\to\,&lt;/math&gt;&quot; for [[Entailment|implication]] from antecedent to consequent propositions:

#&lt;math&gt;\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \chi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi) \to (\psi \to \phi).&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are [[propositional variable]]s, then &lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B))&lt;/math&gt; are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.

Other axiom schemas involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;6. Other Axiomatizations&quot; of Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

These axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;3. First-Order Theories&quot; of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mathematical logic=====
&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom of Equality.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; be a [[first-order language]]. For each variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

This means that, for any [[Free variables and bound variables|variable symbol]] &lt;math&gt;x\,,&lt;/math&gt; the formula &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of &quot;primitive notions&quot;, either a precise notion of what we mean by &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt;  (or, for that matter, &quot;to be equal&quot;) has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol &lt;math&gt;=\,&lt;/math&gt;  has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example [[axiom scheme]], is that which provides us with what is known as '''Universal Instantiation''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Universal Instantiation.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; that is [[First-order logic#Rules of inference|substitutable]] for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

Where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; stands for the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; with the term &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; substituted for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[Substitution of variables]].) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim &lt;math&gt;P(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a &quot;proof&quot; of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''Existential Generalization''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Axiom scheme for Existential Generalization.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a term &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; that is substitutable for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi^x_t \to \exists x \, \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Non-logical axioms===

'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''[[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;3. First-Order Theories: Proper Axioms&quot; of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.&lt;!-- This turned out to be impossible{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]''); however recently this approach has been resurrected in the form of [[neo-logicism]].--&gt;

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical discourse.  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some groups, the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

Thus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''[[deductive system]]'''.

====Examples====
This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]] are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of [[axiomatic set theory]] like [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as [[Morse-Kelley set theory]] or set theory with a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]] allowing the use of a [[Grothendieck universe]] are used, but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as [[second-order arithmetic]].

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[Galois theory]].

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].

[[Combinatorics]] is an example of a field of mathematics which does not, in general, follow the axiomatic method.

=====Arithmetic=====
The [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[first-order arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, &quot;5. The Fixed Point Theorem. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem&quot; of Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

We have a language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \{0, S\}\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol and &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \lnot (Sx = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \forall y. (Sx = Sy \to x = y) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;((\phi(0) \land \forall x.\,(\phi(x) \to \phi(Sx))) \to \forall x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT}\,&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\ &lt;/math&gt; with one free variable.

The standard structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N} = \langle\N, 0, S\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\N\,&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[successor function]] and &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====
Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[Euclidean geometry|plane geometry]].  The axioms are referred to as &quot;4 + 1&quot; because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] (&quot;through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel&quot;) was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that no parallels through a point outside a line exist, that exactly one exists, or that infinitely many exist.  These choices give us alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to less than, exactly, or more than 180 degrees respectively and are known as [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]], Euclidean, and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries.

=====Real analysis=====
The object of study is the [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''Dedekind complete ordered field'', meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

===&lt;span id=&quot;role&quot;&gt;Role in mathematical logic&lt;/span&gt;===
====Deductive systems and completeness====
A '''[[deductive]] system''' consists, of a set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; of logical axioms, a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of non-logical axioms, and a set &lt;math&gt;\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}\,&lt;/math&gt; of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{if }\Sigma \models \phi\text{ then }\Sigma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

that is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is sometimes expressed as &quot;everything that is true is provable&quot;, but it must be understood that &quot;true&quot; here means &quot;made true by the set of axioms&quot;, and not, for example, &quot;true in the intended interpretation&quot;.  [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.

Note that &quot;completeness&quot; has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; such that neither &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of ''completeness of a deductive system'' and on the other hand that of ''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===
Early [[mathematician]]s regarded [[axiomatic geometry]] as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

{{Greek Alphabet|letter=alpha}}
{{WikisourceEBD1897|A (entry)}}
'''Alpha''' (uppercase '''Α''', lowercase '''α'''; {{lang-el|άλφα}}) is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 1. It was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[Aleph (letter)|Aleph]] [[Image:phoenician aleph.png|20px|Aleph]]. Letters that arose from Alpha include the Latin [[A]] and the Cyrillic letter [[A (Cyrillic)|А]].

In English the noun ''alpha'' is used as a synonym for &quot;beginning&quot;, or &quot;first&quot; (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Greek===
In [[Ancient Greek]], alpha was pronounced {{IPAblink|a}} when short and {{IPAblink|aː}} when long. Where there is ambiguity, long and short alpha may be written with a macron and breve: Ᾱᾱ, Ᾰᾰ.
* [[wikt:ὥρα#Ancient Greek|ὥρα]] = ὥρᾱ ''hōrā'' {{IPA-el|hɔ̌ːraː|}} &quot;a time&quot;
* [[wikt:γλῶσσα#Ancient Greek|γλῶσσα]] = γλῶσσᾰ ''glôssa'' {{IPA-el|ɡlɔ̂ːssa|}} &quot;tongue&quot;

In [[Modern Greek]], [[vowel length]] has been lost, and all instances of alpha represent the short {{IPA-el|a|}}.

====Shift to long e====
In the [[Attic Greek|Attic]]-[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect of Ancient Greek, long alpha {{IPAblink|aː}} fronted to {{IPAblink|ɛː}} ([[eta]]). In Ionic, the shift took place in all positions. In Attic, the shift did not take place after [[epsilon]], [[iota]], and [[rho]] (ε, ι, ρ; ''e, i, r''). In [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], long alpha is preserved in all positions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek grammar for colleges''. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm#30 paragraph 30] and [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_notes.htm#30D note].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Doric, Aeolic, Attic {{polytonic|χώρᾱ — Ionic χώρη}} &quot;country&quot;
*:{{unicode|chō&amp;#769;rā — chō&amp;#769;rē}}
*Doric, Aeolic {{polytonic|φᾱ&amp;#769;μᾱ — Attic, Ionic φήμη}} &quot;report&quot;
*:{{unicode|phā&amp;#769;mā — phē&amp;#769;mē}}

====Privative a====
[[Privative a]] is the [[Ancient Greek]] prefix ἀ- or ἀν- ''a-, an-'', added to words to negate them. It originates from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''{{PIE|n̥-}}'' ([[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] nasal) and is [[cognate]] with English ''un-''.

====Copulative a====
[[Copulative a]] is the Greek prefix ἁ- or ἀ- ''ha-, a-''. It comes from Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|sm&amp;#805;}}''.

===International Phonetic Alphabet===
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], a letter based on the lower case of alpha represents the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

===Upper case===
The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|Latin A]].

===Math and science===
{{main|Alpha (disambiguation)}}
The letter alpha represents various concepts in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], including [[alpha radiation]], [[angular acceleration]], [[alpha particle]]s and [[alpha carbon]]. Alpha also stands for [[thermal expansion coefficient]] of a [[Chemical compound|compound]] in [[physical chemistry]]. It is also commonly used in [[mathematics]] in [[algebra|algebraic solutions]] representing quantities such as angles. Furthermore, in mathematics, the letter alpha is used to denote the area underneath a normal curve in statistics when finding figures such as the null and alternative hypotheses. In zoology, is used to name the dominant individual in a wolf or dog pack.

==History and symbolism==
===Etymology===
Alpha was derived from ''aleph'', which in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] means &quot;[[ox]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=alpha alpha] on the Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Etymologicum Magnum]], alpha was derived from ''álphō'' (άλφω) &quot;to invent&quot;: thus alpha is the &quot;first invented letter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''άλφα:'' τό στοιχείον, παρά τό άλφω τό ευρίσκω: πρώτον γάρ τών άλλων στοιχείων ευρέθη:''Alpha'': the letter, from ''alpho'' &quot;I invent&quot;: for it was invented first before the other letters&lt;/ref&gt; The closest attested words are ''alphánō'' (αλφάνω) I yield, produce&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alphano&quot; /&gt; and the noun derived from it, ''alphē'' (αλφή) &quot;produce, gain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)lfh/|ἀλφή|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homer===
The [[Homer]]ic word ''alphesíboios''&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]], 
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0133%3Abook%3D18%3Acard%3D590 XVIII, 593]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entry {{LSJ|a)lfesi/boios|ἀλφεσίβοιος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with both the root ''alph-'' and &quot;ox&quot;. It is derived from ''alphánō''&lt;ref name=&quot;alphano&quot;&gt;Entry {{LSJ|a)lfa/nw|ἀλφάνω|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;to yield&quot;, &quot;earn&quot; and ''boûs'' &quot;ox&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Entry {{LSJ|bou{{=}}s|βοῦς|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence ''alphesíboios'' means &quot;bringing in&quot; or &quot;acquiring oxen&quot;.

===Plutarch===
[[Plutarch]], in ''[[Moralia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Symposiacs, Book IX, questions II &amp; III [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter9.html#section91 On-line text] at Adelaide library&lt;/ref&gt; presents a discussion on why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Ammonius asks Plutarch what he, being a [[Boeotia]]n, thinks of [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenicia]]n who reputedly settled in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, placing ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]] — which, unlike [[Hesiod]],&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, in ''[[Works and Days]]'' (see on [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0132:card=405 Perseus Project]), advises the early Greek farmers, &quot;First of all, get a house, then a woman and third, an ox for the plough.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the Phoenicians considered not the second or third, but the first of all necessities. 

&quot;Nothing at all,&quot;{{huh|is this an excessively literal translation?|date=May 2011}} Plutarch replied. He then added that he would rather be assisted by [[Lamprias]], his own grandfather, than by [[Dionysus]]' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. For Lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is &quot;alpha&quot;, because it is very plain and simple — the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue — and therefore this is the first sound that children make.

According to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]]. Oxen were also associated with the Moon in both early [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] religious symbolism, possibly due to the crescent shape of their horns.

===Alpha and Omega===
Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to or describe a variety of things, including the first or most significant occurrence of something. The New Testament has God declaring himself to be the &quot;[[Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot; ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8).

====Runes====
In the [[Runic alphabet]] of the [[Elder Futhark]] in received [[shamanic]] oral lore traditions from Scandinavia, the alphabet is a cycle rather than a linear progression and [[Ur (rune)|Ur]] commences the cycle that [[Fe (rune)|Fe]] closes and both are [[cattle]]. This is a correlate to Alpha and Omega.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Kenneth (1995). ''Rune Power: The Secret Knowledge of the Wise Ones''. Element Books Ltd. ISBN 1-85230-706-4; ISBN 978-1-85230-706-6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alvin Toffler''' (born October 4, 1928 in New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|1176736}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] and [[futurist]], known for his works discussing the [[digital revolution]], [[communication revolution]], [[corporate revolution]] and [[technological singularity]].

A former associate editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, his early work focused on technology and its impact (through effects like [[information overload]]). Then he moved to examining the reaction of and [[Social change|changes in society]]. His later focus has been on the increasing power of 21st century military hardware, weapons and technology proliferation, and [[capitalism]].

He founded Toffler Associates, a management consulting company, and was a visiting scholar at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], visiting professor at [[Cornell University]], faculty member of the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]], a White House correspondent, an editor of Fortune magazine, and a business consultant.&lt;ref name=&quot;MI&quot;&gt;[http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/events.taf?function=show&amp;cat=allconf&amp;EventID=GC03&amp;SPID=898&amp;level1=speakers&amp;level2=bio &quot;Alvin Toffler Speaker Biography&quot;] – [[Milken Institute]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toffler is married to [[Heidi Toffler]], also a writer and futurist. They live in the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] section of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], just north of [[Sunset Boulevard]].

The couple's only child, Karen Toffler, (1954–2000) died after more than a decade suffering from [[Guillain Barre Syndrome]] at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/11/classified/paid-notice-deaths-toffler-karen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanphotos/2415309182/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Alvin Toffler was born in New York city in 1928. He met his future wife, Heidi, at [[New York University]] where he was an English major and she was starting a graduate course in linguistics. Being radical students, they decided against further graduate work, moved to the [[Midwestern United States]], married, spending the next five years as blue-collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work. Heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked. Alvin became a millwright and welder.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATWPARTNERSHIP&quot;&gt;[http://www.alvintoffler.net/?fa=biospartnership &quot;Alvin and Heidi Toffler: Partnership] &amp;ndash; Toffler website&lt;/ref&gt;

Their hands-on practical labor experience got Toffler a position on a union-backed newspaper, a transfer to its Washington bureau, then three years as a correspondent covering Congress and the White House for a Pennsylvania daily. Meanwhile his wife worked at a specialized library for business and behavioral science.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATWPARTNERSHIP&quot;/&gt;

They returned to New York City when Fortune magazine invited Alvin to become its labor columnist, later having him write about business and management.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATWPARTNERSHIP&quot;/&gt;

After leaving Fortune magazine, Alvin Toffler was hired by IBM to do research and write a paper on the social and organizational impact of computers, leading to his contact with the earliest computer &quot;gurus&quot; and artificial intelligence researchers and proponents. [[Xerox]] invited him to write about its research laboratory and [[AT&amp;T]] consulted him for strategic advice. This AT&amp;T work led to a study of telecommunications which advised its top management for the company to break up more than a decade before the government forced AT&amp;T to break up.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATWPARTNERSHIP&quot;/&gt;

In the mid-60s the Tofflers began work on what would later become ''[[Future Shock]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATWPARTNERSHIP&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, with Tom Johnson, an American business consultant, they co-founded Toffler Associates, an advisory firm designed to implement many of the ideas the Tofflers have written on. The firm worked with businesses, NGOs, and governments in the U.S., South Korea, Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, Australia and other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATWPARTNERSHIP&quot;/&gt;

==His ideas==
Toffler explains, &quot;Society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest. Society needs people who work in hospitals. Society needs all kinds of skills that are not just cognitive; they're emotional, they're affectional. You can't run the society on data and computers alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s10440.htm Alvin Toffler interviewed by Norman Swann], Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National, &quot;Life Matters&quot;, 5 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Toffler also states, in ''Rethinking the Future'', that &quot;The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.&quot;

In his book ''[[The Third Wave (book)|The Third Wave]]'' Toffler describes three types of societies, based on the concept of 'waves' &amp;ndash; each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside.
* '''First Wave''' is the society after [[Neolithic Revolution|agrarian revolution]] and replaced the first [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures.
* '''Second Wave''' is the society during the [[Industrial Revolution]] (ca. late 17th century through the mid-20th century). The main components of the Second Wave society are [[nuclear family]], factory-type education system and the [[corporation]]. Toffler writes: &quot;The Second Wave Society is industrial and based on [[mass production]], [[mass distribution]], [[mass consumption]], [[mass education]], [[mass media]], mass [[recreation]], mass [[entertainment]], and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. You combine those things with [[standardization]], [[centralization]], concentration, and synchronization, and you wind up with a style of [[organization]] we call [[bureaucracy]].&quot;
* '''Third Wave''' is the [[post-industrial society]]. Toffler would also add that since the late 1950s most countries are moving away from a Second Wave Society into what he would call a Third Wave Society. He coined lots of words to describe it and mentions names invented by him ([[super-industrial society]]) and other people (like the [[Information Age]], [[Space Age]], [[Electronic computer|Electronic]] Era, [[Global Village]], [[technetronic]] age, scientific-technological revolution), which to various degrees predicted demassification, diversity, knowledge-based production, and the acceleration of change (one of Toffler's key maxims is &quot;change is non-linear and can go backwards, forwards and sideways&quot;).

In this [[post-industrial]] society, there is a lot of diversity in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] (&quot;[[subcultures]]&quot;).
[[Adhocracy|Adhocracies]] (fluid organizations) adapt quickly to changes.
[[Information]] can substitute most of the material resources (see [[ersatz]]) and becomes the main material for workers ([[cognitarian]]s instead of [[proletarian]]s), who are loosely affiliated.
[[Mass customization]] offers the possibility of cheap, personalized, production catering to small niches (see [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] production).

The gap between producer and consumer is bridged by technology using a so called [[configuration system]]. &quot;[[Prosumer]]s&quot; can fill their own needs (see [[open source]], [[assembly kit]], [[freelance]] work). This was the notion that new technologies are enabling the radical fusion of the producer and consumer into the ''prosumer''. In some cases ''prosuming'' entails a &quot;third job&quot; where the corporation &quot;outsources&quot; its labor not to other countries, but to the unpaid consumer, such as when we do our own banking through an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] instead of a teller that the bank must employ, or trace our own postal packages on the internet instead of relying on a paid clerk.

Since the 1960s, people have been trying to make sense out of the impact of new technologies and social change. Toffler's writings have been influential beyond the confines of scientific, economic and public policy discussions. [[Techno music]] pioneer [[Juan Atkins]] cites Toffler's phrase &quot;techno rebels&quot; in ''The Third Wave'' as inspiring him to use the word &quot;techno&quot; to describe the [[musical genre|musical style]] he helped to create.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jun/15/label-love-metroplex&lt;/ref&gt;

Toffler's works and ideas have been subject to various criticisms, usually with the same argumentation used against [[future studies|futurology]]: that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible. In the 1990s, his ideas were publicly lauded by [[Newt Gingrich]].

The development Toffler believes may go down as this era's greatest turning point is the creation of wealth in [[outer space]]. Wealth today, he argues, is created everywhere ([[globalisation]]), nowhere ([[cyberspace]]), and out there (outer space). [[Global positioning satellites]] are key to synchronising precision time and data streams for everything from [[cellphone]] calls to [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] withdrawals. They allow [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) [[productivity]] because of precise tracking. GPS is also becoming central to [[air-traffic control]]. And satellites increase agricultural productivity through tracking [[weather]], enabling more accurate [[weather prediction|forecasts]].

Two major predictions of Toffler's &amp;ndash; the [[paperless office]] and [[human cloning]] &amp;ndash; have yet to be realized.

Also influenced [[Timothy Leary]] (see Info-Psychology; New Falcon Press, 2004)

==Critical acclaim==
[[Accenture]], the management consultancy firm, has dubbed him the third most influential voice among business leaders, after [[Bill Gates]] and [[Peter Drucker]]. He has also been described in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as the &quot;world's most famous futurologist&quot;. [[People's Daily]] classes him among the 50 foreigners that shaped modern China.&lt;ref name=&quot;PeoplesDaily&quot;&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200608/03/eng20060803_289510.html 50 foreigners shaping China's modern development], 30 August 2006.

==Selected awards==
He is the recipient of several prestigious prizes, including the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey Foundation]] Book Award for Contributions to Management Literature, Officier de [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|L'Ordre des Arts et Lettres]], and appointments, including Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MI&quot;/&gt;

In late 2006, the Tofflers were recipients of [[Brown University]]'s Independent Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvintoffler.net/?fa=biosaffiliations Bios and Affiliations] &amp;ndash; Toffler website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Amazing Spider-Man''''' is an [[American comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]], featuring the adventures of the fictional [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. The series began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously until it was relaunched with a new numbering order in 1999. In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume. The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010.

==Publication history==
[[Spider-Man]] first appeared in the [[comic book]] ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1962). The series was canceled with that issue, but response to the character was so positive that a solo title, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', was launched with a March 1963 cover-date.

The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], and the pair produced 38 issues from 1963 to 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero.

''The Amazing Spider-Man'' is the character's flagship series, and the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until ''[[Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' in 1976. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced here, and it is where key events occur. The title was published continuously until #441 (Nov. 1998) when Marvel Comics relaunched it as vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999), but on Spider-Man's 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue #500 (Dec. 2003).

===The 1960s===
The initial years of the book, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager Peter Parker. Parker balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance [[photographer]] for ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' (under the bombastic editor-publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]) to help support himself and his frail [[Aunt May]]. At the same time, Parker dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Liz Allan]] at Midtown High School, while also embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, [[Betty Brant]].

By focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a [[protagonist]] and not a [[sidekick]]. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, [[Jack Kirby]], and Ditko's Spider-Man, slightly sinister yet affectionately cartoony,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.

Most of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue #1 (March 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson and his [[astronaut]] son [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], and the supervillain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. It also included the hero's first encounter with the superhero team [[The Fantastic Four]]. Issue #2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of [[Vulture (comics)|The Vulture]] and the beginning of Parker's freelance [[photography]] career at the newspaper ''The Daily Bugle''.
 &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Af issue 1.jpg|200px|left|thumb|]] --&gt;

The Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including [[Doctor Octopus]] in #3 (July 1963); the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and Betty Brant in #4 (Sept. 1963); the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] in #6 (Nov. 1963); [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] in #9 (March 1964); [[Mysterio]] in #13 (June 1964); the [[Green Goblin]] in #14 (July 1964); [[Kraven The Hunter]] in #15 (Aug. 1964); reporter [[Ned Leeds]] in #18 (Nov. 1964); the  [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] in #20 (Jan. 1965); and the [[Molten Man]] in #28 (Sept. 1965), an issue that also featured Parker's graduation from high school.

Parker began attending [[Empire State University]] in #31 (Dec. 1965), the issue which also featured the first appearances of friends and classmates [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]]. Harry's father, [[Norman Osborn]] first appeared in #23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson's country club but is not named nor revealed as Harry's father until #37 (June 1966). Probably the most celebrated issue of the Lee-Ditko run{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc &quot;If This Be My Destiny&quot;, and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery.
[[Image:AmazingSpiderMan23.jpg|thumb|left|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #23 (April 1965), featuring archnemesis the [[Green Goblin]]. Cover art by co-creator [[Steve Ditko]].]]
Although credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. However, a rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' [[Marveldatabase:Amazing Spider-Man 38|#38]] (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have been a source of controversy{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} ever since.

In successor penciler [[John Romita Sr.]]'s first issue, #39 (Aug. 1966), archnemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero.  Romita's Spider-Man – more muscular and heroic-looking than Ditko's – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[managing editor]] [[Joseph &quot;Robbie&quot; Robertson]] in #52 (Sept. 1967) and [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], father of Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], in #56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in #42, (Nov. 1966), although she first appeared  in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (Aug. 1964).

Lee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker's world by improving Parker's relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories also became more topical, addressing issues such as [[civil rights]], [[racism]], [[prisoners' rights]], the [[Vietnam War]], and political elections.

Issue #50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], who would become a major force as well in the superhero series ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]''. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in #41 (Oct. 1966), the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] in #46 (March 1967), the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] in #78 (Nov. 1969), and the Kingpin's son, [[Richard Fisk]], in #83 (April 1970).

===The 1970s===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Amazing Spider-Man 139.jpg|thumb|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #139 (Dec. 1974): Spider-Man vs. The Grizzly (1st appearance).]] --&gt;
Two spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' in 1972, and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' in 1976. The flagship title's second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain [[George Stacy]]. This was also the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by [[Gil Kane]], who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.

One such story took place in the controversial issues #96-98 (May–July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the [[Comics Code Authority]] with this story, in which Parker's friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after tripping on [[LSD]]. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the US [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.

The &quot;Six-Arm Saga&quot; of #100-102 (Sept.–Nov. 1971) introduced [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]]. The second installment was the first ''Amazing Spider-Man'' story not written by co-creator Lee, with  [[Roy Thomas]] taking over writing the book for several months before Lee returned to write #105-110 (Feb.-July 1972). Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old [[wunderkind]] [[Gerry Conway]], who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway's first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] in #113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler, although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.

The most memorable work of the Conway/Kane/Romita team was #121-122 (June–July 1973), which featured  the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in &quot;[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]&quot; (#121).  Her demise and the Goblin's apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man. The aftermath of the story also deepened both the characterization of [[Mary Jane Watson]] and her relationship with Parker.

By late 1973, Gil Kane was succeeded by [[Ross Andru]], whose run lasted nearly 60 issues, from 1973 to 1978. Issue #129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the [[Punisher]], who would become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. The Conway-Andru era also featured the first appearances of the [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]] in #124-125 (Sept.-Oct. 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (April 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father's role as the Green Goblin in #135-137 (Aug.-Oct.1974); and the original &quot;[[Clone Saga]]&quot;, containing the introduction of [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man's clone]], in #147-149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975).

[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and Gil Kane produced the title's 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before [[Len Wein]] became writer for two-and-a-half years. During Wein's tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged, J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison, and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein's last story on ''Amazing'' was a five-issue arc in #176-180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn’s psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton). [[Marv Wolfman]], Marvel's editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer, and in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson (who refused, in the following issue). [[Keith Pollard]] succeeded Ross Andru as artist shortly afterward, and with Wolfman introduced the likable rogue the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979). As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade, and remain a friend and occasional lover into the 2010s.

===The 1980s===
[[File:Issue252.jpg|thumb|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #252 (May 1984): Spider-Man's black costume debuts. Cover art by [[Ron Frenz]] &amp; [[Klaus Janson]].]]
''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the [[Burglar (comics)|burglar]] who killed Spider-Man's Uncle Ben. Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by [[Dennis O'Neil]], a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival [[DC Comics]], and penciler [[John Romita, Jr.]]. [[Roger Stern]], who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', took over ''Amazing'' in late 1981. During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains, and with Romita Jr. created the mysterious supervillain the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] in #238-239 (March–April 1983). Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin's secret identity, which continued throughout #244-245 and 249-251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 &amp; Feb.-April 1984).  One lasting change was the reintroduction of [[Mary Jane Watson]] as a much more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter's confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity.

By mid-1984, [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish the maturation in Parker and Watson's relationship, laying the foundation for the character's eventual wedding. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), with the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]], in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a [[symbiote]]; and the introduction of the female mercenary [[Silver Sable]] in #265 (June 1985).

Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz were both removed from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1986 by editor Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/adventures/frames/spidey.htm Digital Priest] (Owsley official site)&lt;/ref&gt; A succession of artists including [[Alan Kupperberg]], [[John Romita, Jr.]], and [[Alex Saviuk]] penciled the book from 1987 to 1988; Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part &quot;Gang War&quot; story (#284-288) that DeFalco plotted. Former ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' writer [[Peter David]] scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin (although this was [[retconned]] in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all).

[[David Michelinie]] took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290-292 (July-Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #21. Issue #298 (March 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star [[Todd McFarlane]], the first regular artist on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' since Frenz's departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man's look. His depiction – large-eyed, with wiry, contorted limbs, and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane's other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man's most wildly popular antagonists, the [[supervillain]] [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. Issue #299 (April 1988) featured Venom's first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue also featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.

Other notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315-317 (May–July 1989), with the return of Venom. After the editorial and creative turmoil that beset ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1987, the Michelinie/McFarlane team at the tail-end of the 1980s restored a sense of creative consistency and quality to the book, and set the tone for Spider-Man for the next decade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===The 1990s===
With a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]''. His  successor, [[Erik Larsen]], penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue #350, Larsen was succeeded by [[Mark Bagley]], who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on ''[[New Warriors]]'' in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996, with his art forming the basis for most Spider-Man licensed merchandise of the decade and onward.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Issues #361-363 (April–June 1992) introduced [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man. The series' 30th-anniversary issue, #365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker's parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in #388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie's last issue. His 1987–1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.

With #389, writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]], whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 &quot;[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]&quot; story arc and a 1991–1993 run on ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, ''Amazing'' stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in #400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May &amp;mdash; later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The &quot;[[Clone Saga]]&quot; culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and was later reversed in the &quot;Revelations&quot; story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.

The Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after #406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by ''The Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1-2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring [[Ben Reilly]]. The series picked up again with #407 (Jan. 1996), with [[Tom DeFalco]] returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including [[Ron Garney]], [[Steve Skroce]], [[Joe Bennett]], and [[Rafael Kayanan]], penciled the book until the final issue,  #441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).

===Relaunch and the 2000s===
Marvel began ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' anew with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999). [[Howard Mackie]] wrote the first 29 issues.  The relaunch proved controversial with the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the &quot;death&quot; of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed due to fan backlash.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Other elements included the introduction of a new Spider-Woman (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to John Byrne's controversial{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} &quot;[[Spider-Man: Chapter One]]&quot;, which launched at the same time as the reboot. Mackie's run ended with ''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2000'', which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.

With #30 (June 2001), [[J. Michael Straczynski]] took over as writer. While his arrival saw the title regain lost readers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Straczynski oversaw additional controversial{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} storylines &amp;mdash; most notably his lengthy &quot;Spider-Totem&quot; arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man's powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider's bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #37&lt;/ref&gt; and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50. Straczynski also gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.

Issue #30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume-two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. In October 2000, [[John Romita, Jr.]] succeeded [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] as artist. After vol. 2, #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for #500 (Dec. 2003), with vol. 2, #1-58 considered #442-499 of the original run. [[Mike Deodato, Jr.]] penciled the book from mid-2004 until 2006.

That year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline &quot;[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]&quot;, in which the superhero community is split over whether to conform to the federal government's new [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, &quot;[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]&quot;, written partially by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]], running through ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #544-545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24 (Nov. 2007) and ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here. the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] makes a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying [[Aunt May]] if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's six-and-a-half years as writer (from 2001 to 2007) on the title after 75 issues (including issues of ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' and ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' as part of crossovers).

Following this, Marvel made ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of &quot;back to basics&quot; story arcs under the banner of &quot;[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]&quot;. Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with [[domino effect]] differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]). The alternating regular writers were initially [[Dan Slott]], [[Bob Gale]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Fred Van Lente]], and [[Zeb Wells]], joined by a rotation of artists that included [[Chris Bachalo]], [[Phil Jimenez]], [[Mike McKone]], [[John Romita, Jr.]] and [[Marcos Martín]]. [[Joe Kelly]], [[Mark Waid]] and [[Roger Stern]] later joined the writing team and [[Barry Kitson]] the artist roster.

With issue #648 (January 2011), the series became a twice-monthly title with [[Dan Slott]] as sole writer. Eight additional pages were added per issue.

'''Antigua and Barbuda''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|En-us-Antigua and Barbuda.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|t|iː|ɡ|w|ə|_|æ|n|d|_|b|ɑr|ˈ|b|juː|d|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|local|æ|n|ˈ|t|iː|ɡ|ə|_|æ|n|d|_|b|ɑr|ˈ|b|juː|d|ə}}; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;bearded&quot;) is a twin-[[island nation]] lying between the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It consists of two major inhabited islands, [[Antigua]] and [[Barbuda]], and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guinea, Long, Maiden and [[York Island]]s and further south, the island of [[Redonda]]). Separated by a few nautical miles, Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the [[Leeward Islands]], part of the [[Lesser Antilles]], roughly at [[17th parallel north|17 degrees north]] of the [[Equator]]. 

Antigua and Barbuda is nicknamed &quot;Land of 365 Beaches&quot; due to the many beaches surrounding the islands. The [[British Empire]], which the country was formerly part of, has strongly influenced its governance, language, and culture.

==History==
{{Main|History of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Antigua was first settled by Archaic Age hunter-gatherer [[Amerindian]]s, erroneously referred to as [[Siboney]] or [[Ciboney]]. Carbon-dating has established that the earliest settlements started around 3100 BCE. They were succeeded by the Ceramic Age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower [[Orinoco River]].

The [[Arawaks]] introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous [[Antigua Black Pineapple]] (Moris cultivar of ''[[Ananas comosus]]''), [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potatoes]] (white with firmer flesh than the bright orange &quot;sweet potato&quot; used in the United States), [[chili pepper|chiles]], [[guava]], [[tobacco]] and [[cotton]].

The indigenous West Indians made excellent sea-going vessels which they used to sail the Atlantic and the Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks were able to colonize much of South America and the Caribbean Islands. Their descendants still live there, notably in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.

Most Arawaks left Antigua around 1100 CE; those who remained were later raided by the Caribs. According to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most of the West Indian Arawak nations, enslaving some and possibly cannibalizing others.

The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' does make it clear that the European invaders had some difficulty differentiating between the native peoples they encountered. As a result, the number and types of ethnic/tribal groups in existence at that time may have been much more varied and numerous than just the two mentioned in this article.

European and African diseases, malnutrition and slavery eventually killed most of the Caribbean's native population, although no researcher has conclusively proven any of these causes as the real reason for these deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogozinski&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|first=Jan |last=Rogozinski|publisher=Penguin Putnam, Inc.|date=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some historians{{Who|date=March 2011}} believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of deaths amongst enslaved natives. Others believe that the reportedly abundant, but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to severe malnutrition of the Amerindians, who were used to a diet fortified with protein from the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogozinski&quot;/&gt;

The island of Antigua, originally called &quot;Wa'ladli&quot; by Arawaks, is today called &quot;Land of Wadadli&quot; by locals. It is possible that Caribs called it &quot;Wa'omoni&quot;. [[Christopher Columbus]], while sailing by in 1493, may have named it Santa Maria la Antigua after an icon in the Spanish [[Seville Cathedral]]. The Spaniards did not colonize Antigua because it lacked fresh water but not aggressive Caribs.

The English settled on Antigua in 1632; [[Sir Christopher Codrington]] settled on Barbuda in 1684. [[Slavery]], established to run sugar plantations around 1684, was abolished in 1834. The British ruled from 1632 to 1981, with a brief [[France|French]] interlude in 1666.

The islands became an independent state within the [[Commonwealth Realm]] system on November 1, 1981, with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as the first [[Monarchy in Antigua and Barbuda|Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]]. The Right Honourable [[Vere Cornwall Bird]] became the first Prime Minister.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Antigua and Barbuda}}

[[File:ac-map.gif|thumb|250px|right|Map of Antigua and Barbuda.]]
The politics of Antigua and Barbuda take place within a framework of a [[Federation|federal]], [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[monarchy]], in which the [[Head of State]] is the [[Monarch]] who appoints the [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor General]] as vice-regal representative. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] is the present [[Monarch of Antigua and Barbuda|Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]], having served in that position since the islands' independence from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1981. The Queen is currently represented by Governor General [[Louise Lake-Tack|Dame Louise Lake-Tack]] (1944-) who became the first woman to hold this position. A Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]], currently [[Baldwin Spencer|Winston Baldwin Spencer]] (1948-).  The Prime Minister is the [[Head of Government]].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two Chambers of [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (17 members appointed by members of the government and the opposition party, and approved by the Governor-General), and the House of Representatives (17 members elected by [[first past the post]] (check this entry) to serve five-year terms). The Speaker of the House is author and former St. John's University professor (New York) D. Gisele Isaac (check), while the President of the Senate is educator [[Hazlyn Francis-Mason]].

The last elections held were on March 12, 2009, during which the [[Antigua Labour Party]] won seven seats, the [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] nine and the [[Barbuda People's Movement]] one.

Since 1949, the party system had been dominated by the [[populism|populist]] Antigua Labour Party. However, the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2004|Antigua and Barbuda legislative election of 2004]] saw the defeat of the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean. Prime Minister [[Lester Bird|Lester Bryant Bird]], who had succeeded his father [[Vere Cornwall Bird]], and Deputy Robin Yearwood had been in office since 1994.

The elder Bird was Prime Minister from 1981 to 1994 and Chief Minister of Antigua from 1960 to 1981, except for the 1971-1976 period when the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) defeated his party.  Vere Cornwall Bird, the nation's first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence.

The Judicial Branch is the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] (based in Saint Lucia; one judge of the Supreme Court is a resident of the islands and presides over the High Court of Justice). In addition, Antigua is a member of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]]. The Supreme Court of Appeal was the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] up until 2001, when the nations of the Caribbean Community voted to abolish the right of appeal to the Privy Council in favor of a Caribbean Court of Justice. Some debate between member countries repeatedly delayed the court's date of inauguration. As of March 2005 (check the status of this action), only Barbados was set to replace appeals to the Privy Council with appeals the Caribbean Court of Justice, which by  then had come into operation.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[Tourism]] dominates the economy, accounting for more than half of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP). Antigua is famous for its many luxury resorts. Weak tourist activity since early 2000 has slowed the economy, however, and squeezed the government into a tight fiscal corner.

Investment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy.  Major world banks with offices in Antigua include the Bank of America (Bank of Antigua), Barclays, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotia Bank. Financial-services corporations with offices in Antigua include PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]] has accused the Antigua-based [[Stanford International Bank]], owned by Texas billionaire [[Allen Stanford]], of orchestrating a huge fraud which may have bilked investors of some $8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/21stanford.html | work=The New York Times | title=Fraud Case Shakes a Billionaire's Caribbean Realm | first1=Clifford | last1=Krauss | first2=Julie | last2=Creswell | first3=Charlie | last3=Savage | date=February 21, 2009 | accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (check status 20100312)

The twin-island nation's [[agriculture|agricultural]] production is focused on its domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labor (economics)|labor]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work.

[[Manufacturing]] is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts and electronic components. Prospects for [[economic growth]] in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the [[United States]], from which about one-third of all tourists come.

Following the opening of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine by investor and attorney Neil Simon in 2003, a new source of revenue was established. The university employs many local Antiguans and the approximate 1000 students consume a large amount of the goods and services.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda}}

[[File:Antigua-Barbuda-demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005. Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

===Ethnicity ===
Antigua has a population of 85,632, mostly made up of people of [[West African]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] descent.  The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black or Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily East Indian and Asian).  Most Whites are of Irish or British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of [[Asians]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] make up the remainder of the population.

Behind the late 20th-century revival and redefinition of the role of Afro-Antiguans and Barbudans in the society's cultural life is a history of racial/ethnic tensions which systematically excluded non-Whites. Within the colonial framework established by the British soon after their initial settlement of Antigua in 1623, five distinct and carefully ranked racial/ethnic groups emerged.

At the top of this social structure were the [[United Kingdom|British]], who justified their hegemony with arguments of White Supremacy and civilizing missions. Amongst them were divisions between British Antiguans and non-creolized Britons, with the latter coming out on top. In short, this was a racial/ethnic hierarchy which gave maximum recognition to people and cultural practices of Anglican origin.

Immediately below the British were the mulattos, a mixed-race group of Afro-European origin. Mulattos, lighter in shade than most Africans, developed a complex system based on skin shade to distinguish themselves from the latter and to legitimate their claims to higher status. In many ways, they paralleled the British White Supremacy ideology.

In the middle of this social stratification were the Portuguese, 2,500 of whom migrated as workers from [[Madeira]] (a Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic, to the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula) between 1847 and 1852 because of a severe famine there. Many established small businesses and joined the ranks of the mulatto class. The British never really considered the Portuguese as Whites and did not allow them into their ranks. Amongst Antiguans and Barbudans of Portuguese descent, status differences were based on the varying degrees of assimilation into the dominant group's Anglicized practices.

Next to the bottom were Middle Easterners who began migrating to Antigua and Barbuda around the turn of the 20th century. Starting as itinerant traders, they soon worked their way into the social mix. Although Middle Easterners came from a variety of areas, as a group they are usually referred to as [[Syrians]].
[[File:Stjohnscathedralantigua.jpg|left|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, St. John's|St. John's Cathedral]]]]

Afro-Antiguans and Afro-Barbudans were at the bottom. Forced into slavery, Africans started arriving in Antigua and Barbuda in large numbers during the 1670s. Very quickly, they grew into the largest racial/ethnic group. Their entry into the local social structure was marked by a profound [[racialization]]: They ceased being [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], or Akan and became Negroes or Blacks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the 20th century, the colonial social structure gradually started to be phased out with the introduction of universal education and better economic opportunities. This process allowed Blacks to rise to the highest echelons of society and government.

In the last decade,{{when|date=December 2010}} Spanish-speaking immigrants from the [[Dominican Republic]] and Afro-Caribbean immigrants from [[Guyana]] and [[Dominique]] were added to this ethnic mosaic. They have entered at the social structure's bottom; it is still too early to predict their patterns of assimilation and social mobility.

Today, an increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Antiguan British|Antiguan Britons]]), [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from [[Dominica]], [[Guyana]] and [[Jamaica]], and, increasing, from the [[Dominican Republic]], [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Nigeria]]. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm |title=Background Note: Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Seventy-four percent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-09-15 |url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71445.htm |title=Antigua and Barbuda: International Religious Freedom Report 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Antiguans are [[Christianity|Christians]], with the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican denomination]] (about 44%) being the largest. Other Christian denominations present are [[Baptists]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwanet.org/default.aspx?pid=1118&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterians]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpcjackson.org/resources/church_history/Southern%20Presbyterian%20History/no.%201%20The%20Beginnings.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=VGF3wbzzy9QC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=presbyterians+barbodos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2P3Ose4LM9&amp;sig=S1CWqW0l4_swzcNAv6fcrzb6rAM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mKuKSvOxAYjosQPk4MHWDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]].

Non-Christian religions practiced in the islands include the [[Rastafari Movement]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

===Languages===
English is the official language, but many of the locals speak [[Antiguan Creole]]. The [[Barbudan]] accent is slightly different from the [[Antiguan]].

In the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole, but afterwards Antiguans began treating Antiguan Creole as a respectable aspect of their culture. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English.

Many of the words used in the [[Antiguan Creole|Antiguan dialect]] are derived from [[British English|British]] as well as [[African]] languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: &quot;Me nah go&quot; meaning &quot;I am not going&quot;. Another example is: &quot;Ent it?&quot; meaning &quot;Ain't it?&quot; which is itself dialectical and means &quot;Isn't it?&quot;. Common island [[proverb]]s often can be traced to Africa.

==Culture==
The culture is predominantly British: For example, cricket is the national sport and Antigua has produced several famous cricket players including Sir Vivian Richards, Anderson &quot;Andy&quot; Roberts, and Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Richardson. Other popular sports include football, boat racing and surfing ([[the Antigua Sailing Week]] attracts locals and visitors from all over the world).

American popular culture and fashion also have a heavy influence. Most of the country's media is made up of major United States networks. attention to Aailable at boutiques in St. John's and elsewhere, although many Antiguans prefer to make a special shopping trip to St. Martin, North America, or San Juan in Puerto Rico.

Family and religion play an important roles in the lives of Antiguans. Most attend religious services on Sunday, although there is a growing number of [[Seventh-day Adventists]] who observe the [[seventh-day Sabbath|Sabbath]] on Saturday.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The national Carnival held each August commemorates the abolition of slavery in the [[British West Indies]], although on some islands, Carnival may celebrate the coming of Lent. Its festive pageants, shows, contests and other activities are a major tourist attraction.

[[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[soca music]] are important in Antigua and Barbuda.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Corn and sweet potatoes play an important role in [[Antiguan cuisine]]. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, Dukuna (DOO-koo-NAH) is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. One of the Antiguan staple foods, fungi (FOON-ji), is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.

==Media==
Up until April 2010 there were two daily newspapers: [[Antigua Daily Observer|Daily Observer]] and [[which also published newspapers on other Caribbean islands. [[Antigua Sun]] has ceased operation in April. It has been in circulation for 13 years. Besides most American television networks, the local channel ABS TV 10 is available (it is the only station which shows exclusively local programs. There are also several local and regional radio stations.

==Sports==
{{See also|Cricket in the West Indies}}
[[File:Cricket ground.jpg|[[Antigua Recreation Ground]]|thumb]]
Like many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, ''[[cricket]]'' is the most popular sport. The [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] was hosted in the West Indies from March 11 to April 28, 2007. Antigua hosted eight matches at the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], which was completed on February 11, 2007 and can hold up to 20,000 people.
Antigua is a Host of [[Stanford Twenty20]] – [[Twenty20 Cricket]], a version started by [[Allen Stanford]] in 2006 as a regional cricket game with almost all Caribbean islands taking part. Antiguan [[Viv Richards]] scored the fastest Test Century and [[Brian Lara]] twice scored the World Test Record at the [[Antigua Recreation Ground]].

[[Association football]] is also a very popular sport. Antigua does have a [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|national football team]] but it is inexperienced. They have also formed a professional team, [[Antigua Barracuda FC]], which is slated to join the [[USL First Division]] in 2011.

''Athletics'' are popular. Talented athletes are trained from a young age, and Antigua and Barbuda has produced a few fairly adept athletes. [[Janill Williams]], a young athlete with much promise comes from [[Gray's Farm]], Antigua. [[Sonia Williams]] and [[Heather Samuel]] represented Antigua and Barbuda at the [[Olympic Games]]. Other prominent rising stars include [[Brendan Christian]] (100 m, 200 m), [[Daniel Bailey]] (100 m, 200 m) and [[James Grayman]] (high jump).

Antigua can boast of some excellent ''tennis'' players, most notably Brian Philip #1 and Roberto Esposito #2 on the island for under-18 tournaments, who both are also involved in under-18 ITF tournaments. Their coach's (Eli Armstrong) daughter Keishora Armstrong, who will be turning 13 later this year, is the under-18's champion on the girls' circuit.

The people of Antigua &amp; Barbuda enjoy a more-than-90% literacy rate. In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda adopted a national mandate to become the pre-eminent provider of medical services in the Caribbean. As part of this mission, Antigua and Barbuda is building the most technologically advanced hospital in the Caribbean, the [[Mt. St. John Medical Centre]]. The island of Antigua currently has two medical schools, the [[American University of Antigua, College of Medicine|American University of Antigua]] (AUA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auamed.org/ |title=American University of Antigua, College of Medicine |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2004, and The [[University of Health Sciences Antigua]] (UHSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhsa.ag/ |title=University of Health Sciences Antigua |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1982.

There is also a government owned state college in Antigua as well as the Antigua and Barbuda Institute of Information Technology (ABIIT). The University of the West Indies has a branch in Antigua for locals to continue University studies.

Antigua has two international primary/secondary schools Including (Alphabetically) CCSET International which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma and Island Academy which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also may other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools. Both international schools are relatively inexperienced with offering international degrees. CCSET international has existed for several years but only began offering an International Degree in 2007. While CCSET's graduating classes have consistently been awarded the OSSD this is somewhat controversial because CCSET students do not receive their diploma from CCSET directly as it is not able to grant OSSD credits instead they receive this diploma from one of CCSET's (constantly changing) partner schools based in Ontario. In contrast Island Academy has offered international degrees for much longer than CCSET but has been inconsistent with their program they have switched from offering the OSSD to the IB, back to the OSSD and finally back to the IB again in February 2009. Sense 2009 island Academy has not granted any IB diplomas to students.

'''Azincourt''' ({{IPA-fr|azɛ̃kuʁ}}; historically, '''Agincourt''' in [[English language|English]]) is a [[Commune of France|commune]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northern [[France]].

==Geography==
Situated 12 miles (20&amp;nbsp;km) north-west of [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise]] on the D71 road.

==Etymology==
''Aisincurt'' 1175.

Germanic masculine name ''Aizo, Aizino'' and early Northern French ''curt'' 'farm with a courtyard' (Late Latin ''cortem'')

No etymological and phonetical connection in French with [[Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle]] (''Egincourt'' 875), that is itself combined with another Germanic male's name ''*Ingin-''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Albert Dauzat]] et [[:fr:Charles Rostaing]], ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France'', éditions Larousse 1968. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Azincourt is famous as the site of the battle fought on 25 October 1415 in which the army led by King [[Henry V of England]] defeated the forces led by [[Charles d'Albret]] on behalf of [[Charles VI of France]], and recorded in English history as the [[Battle of Agincourt]].

Later on, when he became King in 1509, [[Henry VIII]] commended an English version of the Life of Henry V so that he could emulate him, on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against France would help him to impose himself on the European stage. In 1513, Henry VIII conclusively crossed the English Channel and stopped at Azincourt. He was notably accompanied by John Nevill.&lt;ref&gt;The House of Commons: 1509 - 1558, Volume 4; Stanley T. Bindoff, John S. Roskell, Lewis Namier, Romney Sedgwick, David Hayton, Eveline Cruickshanks, R. G. Thorne, P. W. Hasler (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places of interest==
The original battlefield museum in the village featured model knights made out of [[Action Man]] figures. However, this has now been replaced by a more professional exhibition space incorporating laser, video, slide shows, audio commentaries, and some interactive elements. The museum building is shaped like one of the many [[longbow]]s famously deployed at the battle by King Henry's [[archery|archer]]s. &lt;br&gt;The village holds a festival in every other year, commemorating the battle and featuring various stalls and displays. The latest was held on July 21 through July 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azincourt-alliance.org.uk/ Azincourt Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin towns==
Azincourt is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with the English village of [[Middleham]] in [[North Yorkshire]].

'''Albert Speer''', born '''Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-de|ˈʃpeːɐ̯|pron|De-Albert_Speer.ogg|}}; March&amp;nbsp;19, 1905 – September&amp;nbsp;1, 1981) was a German [[architect]] who was, for a part of [[World War II]], Minister of Armaments and War Production for the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Speer was [[Adolf Hitler]]'s chief architect before assuming ministerial office. As &quot;the Nazi who said sorry&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The title of a [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/548364 BBC2 documentary]&lt;/ref&gt; he accepted responsibility at the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg trials]] and in his memoirs for crimes of the Nazi regime. His level of involvement in the persecution of the [[Jews]] and his level of knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] remain matters of dispute.

Speer joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler commissioned him to design and construct a number of structures, including the [[Reich Chancellery]] and the ''[[Nazi party rally grounds|Zeppelinfeld]]'' stadium in [[Nuremberg]] where Party [[Nuremberg Rally|rallies]] were held. Speer also made plans to [[Welthauptstadt Germania|reconstruct Berlin]] on a grand scale, with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system.

As Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production, Speer was so successful that Germany's war production continued to increase despite massive and devastating [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]]. After the war, he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor]]. He served his full sentence, most of it at [[Spandau Prison]] in [[West Berlin]].

Following his release from Spandau in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]'', detailing his often close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, ''Infiltration'', about the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Speer died of natural causes in 1981 while on a visit to London, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=337.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Speer was born in [[Mannheim]], into a wealthy middle class family. He was the second of three sons of Albert and Luise Speer. In 1918, the family moved permanently to their summer home, Schloss-Wolfsbrunnenweg, in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry T. King]], deputy prosecutor at Nürnberg who later wrote a book about Speer, &quot;Love and warmth were lacking in the household of Speer's youth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|King|1997|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer was active in sports, taking up skiing and mountaineering. Speer's Heidelberg school offered [[rugby union|rugby football]], unusual for Germany, and Speer was a participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to become a [[mathematician]], but his father said if Speer chose this occupation he would &quot;lead a life without money, without a position, and without a future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmidt|1984|p=28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Speer followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=11–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer began his architectural studies at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] crisis of 1923 limited his parents' income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 when the crisis had abated, he transferred to the &quot;much more reputable&quot; [[Technical University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=63.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the [[Technical University of Berlin]] where he studied under [[Heinrich Tessenow]], whom Speer greatly admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=10–11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing his exams in 1927, Speer became Tessenow's assistant, a high honor for a man of 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=34–36.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Speer taught some of Tessenow's classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=71–73.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Munich, and continuing in Berlin, Speer began a close friendship, ultimately spanning over 50 years, with [[Rudolf Wolters]], who also studied under Tessenow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=33–34.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1922, Speer began to date Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987). The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, who felt that the Webers were socially inferior (Weber's father was a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers). Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years were to elapse before Margarete Speer was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=47–49.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joining the Nazis (1930–1934)===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146II-277, Albert Speer.jpg|left|thumb|Speer in 1933]]

Speer stated he was apolitical when he was a young man, and that he attended a Berlin Nazi rally in December&amp;nbsp;1930 at the urging of some of his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=79.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was surprised to find Hitler dressed in a neat blue suit, rather than the [[Sturmabteilung|brown uniform]] seen on Nazi Party posters, and was greatly impressed, not only with Hitler's proposals, but also with the man himself. Several weeks later he attended another rally:  this one was presided over by [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Speer was disturbed by the way Goebbels whipped the crowd into a frenzy. Despite this unease, Speer could not shake the impression Hitler had made on him. On March 1, 1931, he applied to join the Nazi Party and became member number 474,481.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=15–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer's first Nazi Party position was as head of [[National Socialist Motor Corps|the Party's motorist association]] for the Berlin suburb of [[Wannsee]]; he was the only Nazi in the town with a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer reported to the Party's leader for the [[Westend (Berlin)|West End of Berlin]], [[Karl Hanke]], who hired Speer—without fee—to redecorate a villa he had just rented. Hanke was enthusiastic about the resulting work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=21–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Speer surrendered his position as Tessenow's assistant because of pay cuts and moved to Mannheim, hoping to use his father's connections to get commissions. He had little success, and his father gave him a job as manager of the elder Speer's properties. In July&amp;nbsp;1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party prior to the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' [[Weimar_republic#Elections_of_July_1932|elections]]. While they were there, Hanke recommended the young architect to Goebbels to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters. Speer, who had been about to leave with his wife for a vacation in [[East Prussia]], agreed to do the work. When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler [[Machtergreifung|took office]] in January&amp;nbsp;1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=28–30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=22–25.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Nazis took control, Hanke recalled Speer to Berlin. Goebbels, the new Propaganda Minister, commissioned Speer to renovate [[Propagandaministerium|his Ministry's]] building on [[Wilhelmplatz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=25–26.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer also designed the 1933 [[May Day]] commemoration in Berlin. In ''Inside the Third Reich'', he wrote that, on seeing the original design for the Berlin rally on Hanke's desk, he remarked that the site would resemble a ''[[Schützenfest]]'' — a rifle club meet.&lt;ref name = &quot;flag&quot;/&gt; Hanke, now Goebbels' [[Secretary of State#Germany|State Secretary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=99.}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged him to create a better design. As Speer learned later, Hitler was enthusiastic about Speer's design (which used giant flags), though Goebbels took credit for it. Tessenow was dismissive: &quot;Do you think you have created something? It's showy, that's all.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;flag&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=26–27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-V00555-3, Obersalzberg, Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler.jpg|right|thumb|Speer and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] examine an architectural drawing]]

The organizers of the 1933 [[Nürnberg Rally|Nürnberg Nazi Party rally]] asked Speer to submit designs for the rally, bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time. Neither the organizers nor [[Rudolf Hess]] were willing to decide whether to approve the plans, and Hess sent Speer to Hitler's Munich apartment to seek his approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=100–01.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Speer entered, the new [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] was busy cleaning a pistol, which he briefly laid aside to cast a short, interested glance at the plans, approving them without even looking at the young architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=27–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work won Speer his first national post, as Nazi Party &quot;Commissioner for the Artistic and Technical Presentation of Party Rallies and Demonstrations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=49.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer's next major assignment was as liaison to the Berlin building trades for [[Paul Troost]]'s renovation of the Chancellery. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=101–03.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=106.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two men found much in common: Hitler spoke of Speer as a &quot;kindred spirit&quot; for whom he had always maintained &quot;the warmest human feelings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=42.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young, ambitious architect was dazzled by his rapid rise and close proximity to Hitler, which guaranteed him a flood of commissions from the government and from the highest ranks of the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=54.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer testified at Nürnberg, &quot;I belonged to a circle which consisted of other artists and his personal staff. If Hitler had had any friends at all, I certainly would have been one of his close friends.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=296.}} &quot;Wenn Hitler überhaupt Freunde gehabt hätte, wäre ich bestimmt einer seiner engen Freunde gewesen.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Architect of the Third Reich (1934–1939)===
{{Main|Nazi architecture}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-1130-502, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Lichtdom.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Cathedral of light]] above the [[Nazi party rally grounds|''Zeppelintribune'']]]]

When Troost died on January&amp;nbsp;21, 1934, Speer effectively replaced him as the Party's chief architect. Hitler appointed Speer as head of the Chief Office for Construction, which placed him nominally on Hess's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=60.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium—the [[Nürnberg]] [[Nazi party rally grounds|parade grounds]] seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda masterpiece ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. This huge work was capable of holding 340,000 people.&lt;ref name = &quot;vat59&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=59.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tribune (architecture)|tribune]] was influenced by the [[Pergamon Altar]] in [[Anatolia]], but was magnified to an enormous scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=55.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, many of whom were overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=131.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer surrounded the site with 130 [[anti-aircraft]] [[searchlight]]s. This created the effect of a &quot;[[cathedral of light]]&quot; or, as it was called by British [[Ambassador]] [[Nevile Henderson|Sir Neville Henderson]], a &quot;cathedral of ice&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;ice&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=58–59.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the only one that stood the test of time.&lt;ref name = &quot;ice&quot;/&gt;

Nürnberg was to be the site of many more official Nazi buildings, most of which were never built; for example, the [[Deutsches Stadion|German Stadium]] would have accommodated 400,000 spectators, while an even larger rally ground would have held half a million Nazis.&lt;ref name = &quot;vat59&quot;/&gt; While planning these structures, Speer invented the concept of &quot;[[ruin value]]&quot;: that major buildings should be constructed in such a way that they would leave aesthetically pleasing ruins for thousands of years into the future. Such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of the Third Reich, just as [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins were symbols of the greatness of those civilizations. Hitler enthusiastically embraced this concept, and ordered that all the Reich's important buildings be constructed in accord with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=55–56.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Tour Eiffel en 1937 contrast.png|thumb|Speer's German pavilion (left) facing the Soviet pavilion (right), 1937 World's Fair, Paris]]
Speer could not avoid seeing the brutal excesses of the Nazi regime. Shortly after Hitler consolidated power in the [[Night of the Long Knives]], Hitler ordered Speer to take workmen and go to the building housing the offices of [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]] [[Franz von Papen]] to begin its conversion into a security headquarters, even though it was still occupied by von Papen's officials. Speer and his group entered the building, to be confronted with a pool of blood, apparently from the body of [[Herbert von Bose]], von Papen's secretary, who had been killed there. Speer related that the sight had no effect on him, other than to cause him to avoid that room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hitler deprecated [[Werner March]]'s design for the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] as too [[Modern architecture|modern]], Speer modified the plans by adding a stone exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=65.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer designed the German Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale de Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]]. The German and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pavilion sites were opposite each other. On learning (through a clandestine look at the Soviet plans) that the Soviet design included [[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman|two colossal figures]] seemingly about to overrun the German site, Speer modified his design to include a cubic mass which would check their advance, with a huge eagle on top looking down on the Soviet figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.expo2000.de/expo2000/geschichte/detail.php?wa_id=13&amp;lang=1&amp;s_typ=28&amp;imag=3|title=The Paris World Exposition 1937: Monuments to dictatorship – the German and Soviet Pavilions|publisher=Website of [[Expo 2000]] (Hanover)|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both pavilions were awarded gold medals for their designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=81.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer would also receive, from [[Hitler Youth]] Leader and later fellow Spandau prisoner [[Baldur von Schirach]], the Golden Hitler Youth Honor Badge with oak leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Angolia|1978|p=194.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-018-03A, &quot;Germania&quot;, Modell &quot;Große Halle&quot;.jpg|thumb|left|The proposed huge ''[[Volkshalle]]'' for the new Berlin, as seen through the massive triumphal arch Speer envisioned.]]
In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as [[:de:Generalbauinspektor|General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital]] with the rank of undersecretary of state in the Reich government. The position carried with it extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government and made Speer answerable to Hitler alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=64.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made Speer a member of the ''Reichstag'', though the body by then [[Enabling Act of 1933|had little effective power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=144.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler ordered Speer to make plans to rebuild Berlin. The plans centered on a three-mile long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the ''Prachtstrasse'', or Street of Magnificence;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=140.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also referred to it as the &quot;North-South Axis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=141.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the north end of the boulevard, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]'', a huge assembly hall with a dome which would have been over {{convert|700|ft|m|-1}} high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At the southern end of the avenue would be a huge triumphal arch; it would be almost {{convert|400|ft|m|-1}} high, and able to fit the [[Arc de Triomphe]] inside its opening. The outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 led to the postponement, and eventual abandonment, of these plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the land for the boulevard was to be obtained by consolidating Berlin's railway system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=77.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the ''Prachtstrasse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Speer's father saw the model for the new Berlin, he said to his son, &quot;You've all gone completely insane.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=158.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K1216-501, Berlin, Neue Reichskanzlei, Marmorgalerie.jpg|thumb|Marble Gallery of the New Reich Chancellery]]
In January&amp;nbsp;1938, Hitler asked Speer to build a new Reich Chancellery on the same site as the existing structure, and said he needed it for urgent foreign policy reasons no later than his next New Year's reception for diplomats on January&amp;nbsp;10, 1939. This was a huge undertaking, especially since the existing Chancellery was in full operation. After consultation with his assistants, Speer agreed. Although the site could not be cleared until April, Speer was successful in building the large, impressive structure in nine months. The structure included the &quot;Marble Gallery&quot;: at 146 metres long, almost twice as long as the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Speer employed thousands of workers in two shifts. Hitler, who had remained away from the project, was overwhelmed when Speer turned it over, fully furnished, two days early.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=101–06.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In appreciation for the architect's work on the Chancellery, Hitler awarded Speer the Nazi [[Golden Party Badge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=137.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tessenow was less impressed, suggesting to Speer that he should have taken nine years over the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=110.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Chancellery was damaged by the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=273.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually dismantled by the Soviets, its stone used for a [[Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park)|war memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=351.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Chancellery project, the [[pogrom]] of [[Kristallnacht]] took place. Speer would make no mention of it in the first draft of ''Inside the Third Reich'', and it was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=164.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer was under significant psychological pressure during this period of his life. He would later remember:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Soon after Hitler had given me the first large architectural commissions, I began to suffer from anxiety in long tunnels, in airplanes, or in small rooms. My heart would begin to race, I would become breathless, the diaphragm would seem to grow heavy, and I would get the impression that my blood pressure was rising tremendously&amp;nbsp;... Anxiety amidst all my freedom and power!&lt;ref&gt;Diary entry made on Nov, 20, 1949. In: Speer, Albert (1975), Spandauer Tagebücher, p. 217. Berlin and Frankfurt am Main: Propyläen/Ullstein Verlag. ISBN 3-549-17316-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Wartime architect (1939–1942)===
[[File:Adolf Hitler in Paris 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Hitler visits Paris in 1940 with Speer (left) and sculptor [[Arno Breker]]]]
Speer supported the [[German invasion of Poland]] and [[World War II|subsequent war]], though he recognized that it would lead to the postponement, at the least, of his architectural dreams.&lt;ref name = &quot;squad&quot;/&gt; In his later years, Speer, talking with his biographer-to-be [[Gitta Sereny]], explained how he felt in 1939: &quot;Of course I was perfectly aware that [Hitler] sought world domination ... &lt;nowiki&gt;[A]&lt;/nowiki&gt;t that time I asked for nothing better. That was the whole point of my buildings. They would have looked grotesque if Hitler had sat still in Germany. All I ''wanted'' was for this great man to dominate the globe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=186.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer placed his department at the disposal of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=111–12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites.&lt;ref name = &quot;squad&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans, at Hitler's insistence, but failed to convince him of the need to suspend peacetime construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=176–78.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=180–81.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the ''Wehrmacht'' and ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', and developed a considerable organization to deal with this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=182.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Joseph Stalin]] proposed that Speer pay a visit to Moscow. Stalin had been particularly impressed by Speer's work in Paris, and wished to meet the &quot;Architect of the Reich&quot;. Hitler, alternating between amusement and anger, did not allow Speer to go, fearing that Stalin would put Speer in a &quot;rat hole&quot; until a new Moscow arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|2007|pp=66–67.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Speer came to doubt, despite Hitler's reassurances, that his projects for Berlin would ever be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|2007|p=69.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minister of Armaments==
===Appointment and increasing power===
On February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments [[Fritz Todt]] died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler's [[Wolf's Lair|eastern headquarters]] at [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]]. Speer, who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening, had accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin, but had canceled some hours before takeoff (Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because of exhaustion from travel and a late-night meeting with Hitler). Later that day, Hitler appointed Speer as Todt's successor to all of his posts. In ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer recounts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office, only doing so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that [[Hermann Göring]] raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers. Hitler instead presented Göring with the ''fait accompli'' of Speer's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=193–96.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Speer's accession to the office, the German economy, unlike the British one, was not fully geared for war production. Consumer goods were still being produced at nearly as high a level as during peacetime. No fewer than five &quot;Supreme Authorities&quot; had jurisdiction over armament production—one of which, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, had declared in November 1941 that conditions did not permit an increase in armament production. Few women were employed in the factories, which were running only one shift. One evening soon after his appointment, Speer went to visit a Berlin armament factory; he found no one on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=139–41.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H29758, Albert Speer im Flugzeug.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Speer travels by plane]]

Speer overcame these difficulties by centralizing power over the war economy in himself. Factories were given autonomy, or as Speer put it, &quot;self-responsibility&quot;, and each factory concentrated on a single product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=295.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by Hitler's strong support (the dictator stated, &quot;Speer, I'll sign anything that comes from you&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=143.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), he divided the armament field according to weapon system, with experts rather than civil servants overseeing each department. No department head could be older than 55—anyone older being susceptible to &quot;routine and arrogance&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|2007|p=76.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and no deputy older than 40. Over these departments was a central planning committee headed by Speer, which took increasing responsibility for war production, and as time went by, for the German economy itself. According to the minutes of a conference at ''Wehrmacht'' High Command in March&amp;nbsp;1942, &quot;It is only Speer's word that counts nowadays. He can interfere in all departments. Already he overrides all departments ... On the whole, Speer's attitude is to the point.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=142–44.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels would note in his diary in June 1943, &quot;Speer is still tops with the ''Führer''. He is truly a genius with organization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmidt|1984|p=75.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer was so successful in his position that by late 1943, he was widely regarded among the Nazi elite as a possible successor to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=376–77.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Speer had tremendous power, he was of course subordinate to Hitler. Nazi officials sometimes went around Speer by seeking direct orders from the dictator. When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the ''[[Gauleiter]]s'' (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained an exemption for their pet projects. When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar to optimize the use of German labor, Hitler, under the influence of [[Martin Bormann]], instead appointed [[Fritz Sauckel]]. Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing labor from the occupied nations — and did so, obtaining workers for (among other things) Speer's armament factories, using the most brutal methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=146–50.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December&amp;nbsp;10, 1943, Speer visited the underground [[Mittelwerk]] [[V-2 rocket]] factory that used [[concentration camp]] labor. Shocked by the conditions there (5.7 percent of the work force died that month), and to ensure the workers were in good enough shape to perform the labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=175–76.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer ordered improved conditions for the workers and the construction of the above-ground [[Mittelbau-Dora|Dora camp]]. In spite of these changes, half of the workers at Mittelwerk eventually died. Speer later commented, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[t]&lt;/nowiki&gt;he conditions for these prisoners were in fact barbarous, and a sense of profound involvement and personal guilt seizes me whenever I think of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=370.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J15733, Waffenvorführung, E. Milch, A. Speer.jpg|thumb|200px|Speer (right, with arms folded and swastika armband) looks on with Field Marshal [[Erhard Milch]] (left) during weapons testing.]]
By 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had gained air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and industry had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]] did not concentrate on industry, and Speer, with his improvisational skill, was able to overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of [[German tanks in World War II|tanks]] more than doubled in 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'''s [[Uboat|submarine]]s was reduced from one year to two months. Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944, by which time enough equipment to supply 270 army divisions was being produced—although the ''Wehrmacht'' had only 150 divisions in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=168–70.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January&amp;nbsp;1944, Speer fell ill with complications from an inflamed knee, and was away from the office for three months. During his absence, his political rivals (mainly Göring, and [[Martin Bormann]]), attempted to have some of his powers permanently transferred to them. According to Speer, SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] tried to have him physically isolated by having Himmler's personal physician [[Karl Gebhardt]] treat him, though his &quot;care&quot; did not improve his health. His wife and friends managed to have his case transferred to his friend Dr. [[Karl Brandt (Nazi physician)|Karl Brandt]], and Speer slowly recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roper|1992|pp=192–93.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Speer's rivals for power succeeded in having him deprived of responsibility for construction, and Speer promptly sent Hitler a bitter letter, concluding with an offer of his resignation. Judging Speer indispensable to the war effort, Field Marshal [[Erhard Milch]] persuaded Hitler to try to get his minister to reconsider. Hitler sent Milch to Speer with a message not addressing the dispute but instead stating that he still regarded Speer as highly as ever. According to Milch, upon hearing the message, Speer burst out, &quot;The ''[[Führer]]'' can kiss my ass!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=210.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a lengthy argument, Milch persuaded Speer to withdraw his offer of resignation, on the condition his powers were restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=207–12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April&amp;nbsp;23, 1944, Speer went to see Hitler who agreed that &quot;everything [will] stay as it was, [Speer will] remain the head of all German construction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1981|pp=232–33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Speer, while he was successful in this debate, Hitler had also won, &quot;because he wanted and needed me back in his corner, and he got me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=429.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of the Reich===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1206-511, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|''Reichsminister'' Speer rests on a doorstep]]

Speer's name was included on the list of members of a post-Hitler government drawn up by the conspirators behind the [[July 20 plot|July&amp;nbsp;1944 assassination plot]] to kill Hitler. The list had a question mark and the annotation &quot;to be won over&quot; by his name, which likely saved him from the extensive purges that followed the scheme's failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=224–26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February&amp;nbsp;1945, Speer, who had long concluded that the war was lost, was working to supply areas about to be occupied with food and materials to get them through the hard times ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=482.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 1945, Hitler issued his [[Nero Decree]], ordering a [[scorched earth]] policy in both Germany and the occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=250–51.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's order, by its terms, deprived Speer of any power to interfere with the decree, and Speer went to confront Hitler, telling him the war was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=486–92.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler gave Speer 24 hours to reconsider his position, and when the two met the following day, Speer answered, &quot;I stand unconditionally behind you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|pp=4–6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he demanded the exclusive power to implement the Nero Decree, and Hitler signed an order to that effect. Using this order, Speer worked to persuade generals and ''Gauleiters'' to evade the Nero Decree and avoid needless sacrifice of personnel and destruction of industry that would be needed after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=498–504.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer managed to reach a relatively safe area near [[Hamburg]] as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time.&lt;ref name = &quot;visit&quot;/&gt; Speer stated at Nuremberg, &quot;I felt that it was my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes.&lt;ref name = &quot;visit&quot;/&gt; Speer biographer Gitta Sereny notes, &quot;Psychologically, it is possible that this is the way he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=529.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sereny goes on to note that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=528–531.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, Speer left the ''Führerbunker'', with Hitler curtly bidding him farewell. Speer toured the damaged Chancellery one last time before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg.&lt;ref name = &quot;visit&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=263–70.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April&amp;nbsp;29, the day before his suicide, Hitler prepared his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|final political testament]]. That document specified that Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, [[Karl Saur|Karl-Otto Saur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=234.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hitler's death, Speer offered his services to the so-called [[Flensburg government|Flensburg Government]], headed by Hitler's successor, [[Karl Dönitz]], and took a significant role in that short-lived regime. On May&amp;nbsp;15, the Americans arrived and asked Speer if he would be willing to provide information on the effects of the air war. Speer agreed, and over the next several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May&amp;nbsp;23, two weeks after the surrender of German troops, the Allies arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=273–81.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer was taken to several internment centers for Nazi officials and interrogated. In September&amp;nbsp;1945, he was told that he would be tried for [[war crime]]s, and several days later, he was taken to Nuremberg and incarcerated there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=561.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer was [[indictment|indicted]] on all four possible counts: first, participating in a common plan or [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] for the accomplishment of [[crime against peace]], second, planning, initiating and waging [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]] and other crimes against peace, third, war crimes, and lastly, [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=285.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In political life, there is a responsibility for a man's own sector. For that he is of course fully responsible. But beyond that there is a collective responsibility when he has been one of the leaders. Who else is to be held responsible for the course of events, if not the closest associates around the Chief of State?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=516.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An observer at the trial, journalist and author [[William L.

[[Image:1946-10-08 21 Nazi Chiefs Guilty.ogv|thumb|right|200px|October 17, 1946 newsreel of [[Nuremberg Trials]] sentencing]]
Speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, though he was acquitted on the other two counts. On October&amp;nbsp;1, 1946, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name = &quot;judgment&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=281–82.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While three of the eight judges (two Soviet and [[Francis Biddle|one American]]) initially advocated the death penalty for Speer, the other judges did not, and a compromise sentence was reached &quot;after two days' discussion and some rather bitter horse-trading&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's judgment stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... in the closing stages of the war &lt;nowiki&gt;[Speer]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was one of the few men who had the courage to tell Hitler that the war was lost and to take steps to prevent the senseless destruction of production facilities, both in occupied territories and in Germany. He carried out his opposition to Hitler's scorched earth program ... by deliberately sabotaging it at considerable personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=306.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twelve of the defendants were sentenced to death (including Bormann, in absentia) and three acquitted; only seven of the defendants were sentenced to imprisonment.&lt;ref name = &quot;judgment&quot;/&gt; They remained in the cells at Nuremberg as the Allies debated where, and under what conditions, they should be incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=596.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
{{Main|Spandau Prison}}
:''For additional detail on Speer's time at Spandau Prison, see [[Rudolf Wolters#Spandau years]]''
[[File:6th Inf Regt Spandau Prison 1951.jpg|thumb|right|Speer spent most of his sentence at [[Spandau Prison]].]]
On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all former high officials of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|pp=65–67.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what would become [[West Berlin]], where they would be designated by number, with Speer given Number Five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|pp=66–67.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half an hour a day, and were not permitted to address each other or their guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=309–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control; the [[Allied Control Council|four occupying powers]] took overall control on a monthly rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=602.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer considered himself an outcast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=244.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer made a deliberate effort to make as productive a use of his time as possible. He wrote, &quot;I am obsessed with the idea of using this time of confinement for writing a book of major importance ... That could mean transforming prison cell into scholar's den.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=75.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs, and mail was severely limited and censored. However, as a result of an offer from a sympathetic orderly, Speer was able to have his writings, which eventually amounted to 20,000 sheets, sent to Wolters. By 1954, Speer had completed his memoirs, which became the basis of ''Inside the Third Reich'', and which Wolters arranged to have transcribed onto 1,100 typewritten pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fest 1999 p=316&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=316.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to send letters and financial instructions, and to obtain writing paper and letters from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=310–11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His many letters to his children, all secretly transmitted, eventually formed the basis for ''Spandau: The Secret Diaries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=672.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the draft memoir complete and clandestinely transmitted, Speer sought a new project. He found one while taking his daily exercise, walking in circles around the prison yard. Measuring the path's distance carefully, Speer set out to walk the distance from Berlin to Heidelberg. He then expanded his idea into a worldwide journey, visualizing the places he was &quot;traveling&quot; through while walking the path around the prison yard. Speer ordered guidebooks and other materials about the nations through which he imagined he was passing, so as to envision as accurate a picture as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=316–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meticulously calculating every meter traveled, and mapping distances to the real-world geography, he began in northern Germany, passed through Asia by a southern route before entering Siberia, then crossed the [[Bering Strait]] and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence 35 kilometers south of [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=447.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer devoted much of his time and energy to reading. Though the prisoners brought some books with them in their personal property, Spandau Prison had no library so books were sent from Spandau's municipal library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=69.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1952 the prisoners were also able to order books from the Berlin central library in [[Wilmersdorf]].&lt;ref name = &quot;library&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=195.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer was a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books in the first three years at Spandau alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Release and later life==
[[File:Speerproperty.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Speer property on Wolfsbrunnenweg, Heidelberg, as seen in 2010]]
[[File:A speer grab.JPG|thumb|The grave in Heidelberg]]
Speer's release from prison was a worldwide media event, as reporters and photographers crowded both the street outside Spandau and the lobby of the Berlin hotel where Speer spent his first hours of freedom in over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=320–21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Speer said little, reserving most comments for a major interview published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in November&amp;nbsp;1966, in which he again took personal responsibility for crimes of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=333–34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoning plans to return to architecture (two proposed partners died shortly before his release),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1976|p=441.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he revised his Spandau writings into two [[autobiography|autobiographical]] books, and later researched and published a third work, about Himmler and the SS. His books, most notably ''Inside the Third Reich'' (in German, ''Erinnerungen'', or ''Reminiscences''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Spandau: The Secret Diaries'', provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of the Nazi era, and have become much valued by historians. Speer was aided in shaping the works by [[Joachim Fest]] and [[Wolf Jobst Siedler]] from the publishing house Ullstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=329–30.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Speer found himself unable to re-establish his relationship with his children, even with his son [[Albert Speer, Jr.|Albert]], who had also become an architect. According to Speer's daughter Hilde, &quot;One by one my sister and brothers gave up. There was no communication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=664–665.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of his bestselling books, Speer donated a considerable amount of money to Jewish charities. According to Siedler, these donations were as high as 80% of his royalties. Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection, and for fear of being called a hypocrite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=348.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1953, when Wolters strongly objected to Speer referring to Hitler in the memoirs draft as a criminal, Speer had predicted that were the writings to be published, he would lose a &quot;good many friends&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fest 1999 p=316&quot;/&gt; This came to pass, as following the publication of ''Inside the Third Reich'', close friends, such as Wolters and sculptor [[Arno Breker]], distanced themselves from him. [[Hans Baur]], Hitler's personal pilot, suggested, &quot;Speer must have taken leave of his senses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=345–46.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters wondered that Speer did not now &quot;walk through life in a [[hair shirt]], distributing his fortune among the victims of National Socialism, forswear all the vanities and pleasures of life and [[John the Baptist|live on locusts and wild honey]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=328–29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb1997&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=354.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did an extensive, in-depth interview for the June 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, in which he stated, &quot;If I didn't see it, then it was because I didn't want to see it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=329.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1973, Speer made his first trip to Britain, flying to London under an assumed name&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb1997&quot;/&gt; to be interviewed on the [[BBC]] ''Midweek'' programme by [[Ludovic Kennedy]]. Upon arrival, he was detained for almost 8 hours at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] when British immigration authorities discovered his true identity. The [[Home Secretary]], [[Robert Carr]], allowed Speer into the country for 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Leigh |title=Delay, then Albert Speer is allowed in |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/185/973/13016515w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS67729752&amp;dyn=25!xrn_41_0_CS67729752&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=oxfshlib |work=[[The Times]] |publisher= |date=October 24, 1973 |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in London eight years later to participate in the BBC ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme, Speer suffered a [[stroke]] and died on September&amp;nbsp;1, 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb&quot;/&gt; Speer had formed a relationship with a German-born Englishwoman, and was with her at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=362–63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even to the end of his life, Speer continued to question his actions under Hitler. In his final book, ''Infiltration'', he asks, &quot;What would have happened if Hitler had asked me to make decisions that required the utmost hardness?&amp;nbsp;... How far would I have gone?&amp;nbsp;... If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so?&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;question&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1981|pp=12–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer leaves the questions unanswered.&lt;ref name = &quot;question&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy and controversy==
The view of Speer as an unpolitical &quot;miracle man&quot; is challenged by a [[Yale University|Yale]] historian [[Adam Tooze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tooze|2006|loc=Chapter 17: Albert Speer: 'Miracle Man'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2006 book, ''[[The Wages of Destruction]]'', Tooze, following Gitta Sereny, argues that Speer's ideological commitment to the Nazi cause was greater than he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tooze|2006|pp=553.}} [[Cf.]] {{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=79–80.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooze further contends that an insufficiently challenged Speer &quot;mythology&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tooze|2006|p=577.}} &quot;The simple story spun by Speer, that the German war economy up to 1941 was an inefficient sink for labour and raw materials and that it was only after December 1941, by means of the Fuehrer's decree and Speer's inspired leadership, that it was awakened to the need for efficiency, is clearly a myth [and] the statistics usually invoked to support this description of the pre-Speer era simply do not stand up to detailed scrutiny.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (partly fostered by Speer himself through politically-motivated, tendentious use of statistics and other propaganda)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tooze|2006|p=555.}}&lt;/ref&gt; had led many historians to assign Speer far more credit for the increases in armaments production than was warranted and give insufficent consideration to the &quot;highly political&quot; function of the so-called armaments miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tooze|2006|p=556.}} &quot;[G]iven the highly political function of the 'armaments miracle' the historical record of the Speer Ministry must be approached with a very wary eye. Too many historians have been far too uncritical in the acceptance of Speer's rhetoric of rationalization, efficiency and productivism. . . . And this critique is more than mere nit-picking. It goes to the very heart of Speer's ideological vision of the war economy, as a limitless flow of output released by energetic leadership and technological genius.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legacy was the ''Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerstörter Städte'' (Working group on Reconstruction of destroyed cities), authorized by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities to make them more livable in the age of the automobile.&lt;ref Name= &quot;GDurth&quot;&gt;Träume in Trümmern, (&quot;Dreams in rumbles&quot;) by Werner Durth and Niels Gutschow, Vieweg Friedr. + Sohn Ver (1988) ISBN 3-528-08706-4&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations.&lt;ref Name= &quot;GDurth&quot;/&gt; The ''Arbeitsstab'''s recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and ''Arbeitsstab'' members became prominent in the rebuilding.&lt;ref Name= &quot;GDurth&quot;/&gt;

===Actions regarding the Jews===
As General Building Inspector, Speer was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement.&lt;ref name = &quot;Berlinjews&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=116.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1939 onwards, the Department used the [[Nuremberg Laws]] to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing.&lt;ref name = &quot;Berlinjews&quot;/&gt; Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=120.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress.&lt;ref name = &quot;memo&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=119.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists,&lt;ref name = &quot;memo&quot;/&gt; as does the ''Chronicle'' of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.&lt;ref name = &quot;archives&quot;/&gt;

Following his release from Spandau, Speer presented to the [[German Federal Archives]] an edited version of the ''Chronicle'', stripped by Wolters of any mention of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=339–343.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[David Irving]] discovered discrepancies between the edited ''Chronicle'' and other documents, Wolters explained the situation to Speer, who responded by suggesting to Wolters that the relevant pages of the original ''Chronicle'' should &quot;cease to exist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|pp=226–27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters did not destroy the ''Chronicle'', and, as his friendship with Speer deteriorated, allowed access to the original ''Chronicle'' to doctoral student [[:de:Matthias Schmidt|Matthias Schmidt]] (who, after obtaining his doctorate, developed his thesis into a book, ''Albert Speer: The End of a Myth'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=359–61.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer considered Wolters' actions to be a &quot;betrayal&quot; and a &quot;stab in the back&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|2007|p=196.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ''Chronicle'' reached the Archives in 1983, after both Speer and Wolters had died.&lt;ref name = &quot;archives&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|p=124.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge of the Holocaust===
Speer maintained at Nuremberg and in his memoirs that he had no knowledge of the Holocaust. In ''Inside the Third Reich'', he wrote that in mid-1944, he was told by Hanke (by then ''Gauleiter'' of [[Lower Silesia]]) that the minister should never accept an invitation to inspect a [[concentration camp]] in neighboring [[Upper Silesia]], as &quot;he had seen something there which he was not permitted to describe and moreover could not describe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=375–76.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer later concluded that Hanke must have been speaking of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and blamed himself for not inquiring further of Hanke or seeking information from Himmler or Hitler:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These seconds &lt;nowiki&gt;[when Hanke told Speer this, and Speer did not inquire]&lt;/nowiki&gt; were uppermost in my mind when I stated to the international court at the Nuremberg Trial that, as an important member of the leadership of the Reich, I had to share the total responsibility for all that had happened. For from that moment on I was inescapably contaminated morally; from fear of discovering something which might have made me turn from my course, I had closed my eyes&amp;nbsp;... Because I failed at that time, I still feel, to this day, responsible for Auschwitz in a wholly personal sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=376.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much of the controversy over Speer's knowledge of the Holocaust has centered on his presence at the [[Posen Conference]] on October&amp;nbsp;6, 1943, at which Himmler [[Posen speeches|gave a speech]] detailing the ongoing Holocaust to Nazi leaders. Himmler said, &quot;The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth&amp;nbsp;... In the lands we occupy, the Jewish question will be dealt with by the end of the year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|pp=167–68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler seems to address him directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=168.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer mentions his own address to the officials (which took place earlier in the day) but does not mention Himmler's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=184–85.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|pp=312–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze eagle from the german rechs chancellery.jpg|thumb|Bronze eagle from Speer's Chancellery, now in the [[Imperial War Museum]]]]
In 1971, American historian Erich Goldhagen published an article arguing that Speer was present for Himmler's speech. According to Fest in his biography of Speer, &quot;Goldhagen's accusation certainly would have been more convincing&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Goldhagen&quot;/&gt; had he not placed supposed incriminating statements linking Speer with the Holocaust in quotation marks, attributed to Himmler, which were in fact invented by Goldhagen.&lt;ref name = &quot;Goldhagen&quot;/&gt; In response, after considerable research in the German Federal Archives in [[Koblenz]], Speer said he had left Posen around noon (long before Himmler's speech) in order to journey to Hitler's headquarters at Rastenburg.&lt;ref name = &quot;Goldhagen&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1999|pp=185–87.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Inside the Third Reich'', published before the Goldhagen article, Speer recalled that on the evening after the conference, many Nazi officials were so drunk that they needed help boarding the special train which was to take them to a meeting with Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Speer|1970|p=313.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his biographers, [[Dan van der Vat]], suggests this necessarily implies he must have still been present at Posen then, and must have heard Himmler's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Vat|1997|p=169.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Goldhagen's article, Speer had alleged that in writing ''Inside the Third Reich'', he erred in reporting an incident that happened at another conference at Posen a year later, as happening in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sereny|1995|p=397.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of Auschwitz after two of his assistants toured the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were murdered. The documents supposedly bore annotations in Speer's own handwriting. Speer biographer [[Gitta Sereny]] stated that, due to his workload, Speer would not have been personally aware of such activities.&lt;ref name = &quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;

The debate over Speer's knowledge of, or complicity in, the Holocaust made him a symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have (or claimed not to have had) an active part in the regime's atrocities. As film director [[:de:Heinrich Breloer|Heinrich Breloer]] remarked, &quot;[Speer created] a market for people who said, 'Believe me, I didn't know anything about [the Holocaust]. Just look at the ''Führer's'' friend, he didn't know about it either.{{'&quot;}}&lt;ref name = &quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt;

'''Allioideae''' is the [[botanical name]] of a [[monocot]] subfamily of [[flowering plants]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Amaryllidaceae]], [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Asparagales]]. It was formerly treated as a separate family, '''Alliaceae'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;crf2009&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=M.W.|last2=Reveal |first2=J.L.|last3=Fay |first3=M.F. |year=2009 |title=A subfamilial classification for the expanded asparagalean families Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=132–136|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00999.x|lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subfamily name is derived from the [[Binomial nomenclature|generic name]] of the [[Biological type|type]] [[genus]], ''[[Allium]]''.

Successive revisions of the influential [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG) classification have changed the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the family. In the [[APG system|1998]] version, Alliaceae were a distinct family; in the [[APG II system|2003]] version, combining the Alliaceae with the Agapanthaceae and the Amaryllidaceae ''sensu stricto'' was recommended but optional; in the [[APG III|2009]] version, only the broad circumscription of the Amaryllidaceae is allowed, with the Alliaceae reduced to a subfamily, Allioideae.&lt;ref name=&quot;crf2009&quot;&gt;Mark W. Chase, James L. Reveal, and Michael F. Fay. &quot;A subfamilial classification for the expanded asparagalean families Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae&quot;. ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''161'''(2):132–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that quite a few of the plants that were once included in family Alliaceae have been assigned to the family [[Themidaceae]] in all of the [[Biological classification|classifications]] by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG]]. 

Some of the [[species]] of ''[[Allium]]'' are important [[Food#Plants|food plants]] for example [[onion]]s (''Allium cepa''), [[chives]] (''A. schoenoprasum''), [[garlic]] (''A. sativum'' and ''A. scordoprasum''), and [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]]s (''A. porrum'').&lt;ref name=&quot;seberg2007&quot;&gt;Ole Seberg. 2007. &quot;Alliaceae&quot; pages 340=341.

The largest genera are ''Allium'' (260-690 species), ''Nothoscordum'' (25), and ''Tulbaghia'' (22).&lt;ref name=&quot;rahn1998&quot;/&gt; Some of the generic limits are not clear.

Allioideae is divided into three [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]]: Allieae, Tulbaghieae, and Gilliesieae.&lt;ref name=&quot;crf2009&quot;/&gt; Allieae contains two genera: ''Allium'' and ''Milula''.

In 1985, [[Rolf Dahlgren|Dahlgren]], Clifford, and Yeo defined their Alliaceae to include all of the genera that are now there, plus ''[[Agapanthus]]'' and a group of genera that are now placed in Themidaceae, or its equivalent, the subfamily [[Brodiaeoideae]] of [[Asparagaceae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dahlgren1985&quot;&gt;Rolf M.T.

ISBN 978-0-387-13655-4.&lt;/ref&gt; They divided Alliaceae into three subfamilies: Agapanthoideae, Allioideae, and Gilliesioideae. Agapanthoideae consisted of ''Agapanthus'' and ''Tulbaghia''. Allioideae contained two tribes: Brodiaeeae and a broadly defined Allieae. Gilliesioideae was composed of about half of the genera now placed in Gilliesieae, the rest being assigned to Allieae.

In 1996, a [[molecular phylogenetic]] study of the [[RuBisCO|rbcL]] [[gene]] showed that ''Agapanthus'' was misplaced in Alliaceae, and the authors excluded it from the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;fay1996&quot;&gt;Michael F. Fay and Mark W. Chase. 1996. &quot;Resurrection of Themidaceae for the ''Brodiaea'' alliance, and recircumscription of Alliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, and Agapanthoideae&quot;. ''Taxon'' '''45'''(3):441-451. (see ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; They also raised Brodiaeeae to family [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] as Themidaceae. They reduced the tribe Allieae to two genera, ''Allium'' and ''Milula'', and transferred the rest of Allieae to Gilliesieae. This is the circumscription which the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group accepted in the [[APG system|APG]] classification of 1998 and which later became known as Alliaceae sensu stricto.

In the [[APG II system]] of 2003, Alliaceae could be recognized sensu stricto or sensu lato, as mentioned above. Soon after the publication of APG II, the [[ICBN]] [[Conserved name|conserved]] the name Amaryllidaceae for the family that had been called Alliaceae sensu lato in APG II.

When the [[APG III system]] was published in 2009, the alternative circumscriptions were discontinued and Alliaceae was no longer recognized. Alliaceae sensu stricto became the subfamily [[Allioideae]] of Amaryllidaceae sensu lato.&lt;ref name=&quot;crf2009&quot;/&gt; Some [[botanist]]s have not strictly followed the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group and have recognized the smaller version of Alliaceae at family rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;seberg2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;takhtajan2009&quot;&gt;Armen L. Takhtajan (Takhtadzhian). ''Flowering Plants'' second edition (2009). Springer Science+Business Media. ISBN 978-1-4020-9608-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asteraceae''' or '''Compositae''', also referred to as the '''aster''', '''daisy''', or '''sunflower family''', is the largest [[family (biology)|family]] of [[vascular plant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;&gt;Stevens, P. F. ''Angiosperm Phylogeny Website'' http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The family has more than 22,750 currently accepted species, spread across 1620 genera, and 12 subfamilies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Panero &amp; Crozier&quot;&gt;Panero, J.L. and Crozier, B.S. ''Tree of Life - Asteraceae'' http://tolweb.org/Asteraceae/20780&lt;/ref&gt; The largest genera are ''[[Senecio]]'' (1,500 species), ''[[Vernonia]]'' (1,000 species), ''[[Cousinia]]'' (600 species) and ''[[Centaurea]]'' (600 species). 

Most members of the Asteraceae are herbaceous, but a significant number are also shrubs, vines and trees.  The family is distributed throughout the world, and is most common in the [[arid]] and semi-arid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkley et al.&quot;&gt;Barkely, T.M., Brouillet, L., Strother, J.L. 2006. ''Flora of North America - Asteraceae&quot; http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=10074&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economically important products come from composites, including [[cooking oil]]s, [[lettuce]], [[sunflower seed]]s, [[artichoke]]s, [[sweetening agent]]s, and [[tea]]s.  Several genera are also very popular with the [[horticulture|horticultural]] community, these include [[marigold (common)|marigold]]s, [[chrysanthemum]]s, [[dahlia]]s, [[zinnia]]s, and [[helenium]]s.

==Etymology==

The name ''Asteraceae'' is derived from the type genus ''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'', which is a Greek term, meaning &quot;star&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aster&lt;/ref&gt;  While Compositae, an older but still valid name,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm International Code of Botanical Nomenclature Art. 18.5]&lt;/ref&gt; means ''composite'' and refers to the characteristic [[inflorescence]], a special type of [[pseudanthium]] found in only a few other [[angiosperm]] families. The study of this family is known as [[synantherology]].

==Distribution==

Daisies have a worldwide distribution, being found everywhere except [[Antarctica]]. They are especially numerous in tropical and subtropical regions (notably [[Central America]], eastern [[Brazil]], the [[Andes]], the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], [[southern Africa]], [[central Asia]], and [[southwestern China]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Panero &amp; Crozier&quot;/&gt;

==Taxonomy==

The Compositae was first described in 1792 by the [[Germans|German]] botanist [[Paul Dietrich Giseke]].&lt;ref&gt;Solbrig, O.T. 1963. Subfamilial Nomenclature of Compositae. Taxon 12: 229-235 http://www.jstor.org/pss/1216917&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally two subfamilies were recognised: ''[[Asteroideae]]'' (or ''Tubuliflorae'') and ''[[Cichorioideae]]'' (or ''Liguliflorae''). The latter has been shown to be extensively [[paraphyletic]], and has now been divided into 11 subfamilies, but the former still stands. The [[phylogenetic tree]] presented below is based on Panero &amp; Funk (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Panero J. L. and V. A. Funk. 2002. [http://botany.si.edu/bdg/pdf/Panero&amp;Funk2002.pdf Toward a phylogenetic subfamilial classification for the Compositae (Asteraceae)]. Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. 115: 909-922.&lt;/ref&gt; The diamond denotes a very poorly supported [[cladistics|node]] (&lt;50% bootstrap support), the dot a poorly supported node (&lt;80%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;/&gt;

It is noteworthy that the four subfamilies [[Asteroideae]], [[Cichorioideae]], [[Carduoideae]] and [[Mutisioideae]] comprise 99% of the specific diversity of the whole family (approximately 70%, 14%, 11% and 3% respectively).

Because of the [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] complexity exhibited by this family, agreeing on appropriate generic circumscriptions has often been difficult for Asteraceae [[taxonomist]]s.  As a result several of these genera have required multiple revisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judd&quot;&gt;Judd &amp; al., Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Asteraceae are mostly [[herb]]aceous plants, but some shrubs, [[tree]]s and [[Vine|climber]]s do exist. Daisies are generally easy to distinguish from other plants, mainly because of their characteristic [[inflorescence]] and many shared [[apomorphy|apomorphies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Judd&quot;/&gt; However, many closely related species in this family are notoriously difficult to identify to the species level.

===Roots and Stems===
Daisy roots are usually [[taproot]]s, and sometimes fibrous.  Stems are generally erect, but sometimes prostrate to ascending.  Some species have underground stems in the form of [[caudex|caudices]] or [[rhizome]]s, these can be fleshy or woody depending on the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkley et al.&quot;/&gt;

===Leaves===
The [[leaf|leaves]] and the stems very often contain secretory canals with [[resin]] or [[latex]] (particularly common among the Cichorioideae). The leaves can be [[phyllotaxis|alternate]], [[phyllotaxis|opposite]], or [[phyllotaxis|whorled]]. They may be simple, but are often deeply [[leaf#Morphology|lobed]] or otherwise [[leaf#Morphology|incised]], often [[leaf#Morphology|conduplicate]] or [[leaf#Morphology|revolute]]. The margins can be entire or dentate.

===Flowers===
[[File:Carduus flowerdiagram.png|thumb|left|Flower diagram of ''[[Carduus]]'' (Carduoideae)]]
The most evident characteristic of Asteraceae is perhaps their [[inflorescence]]: a specialised ''[[Head (botany)|capitulum]]'', technically called a ''calathid'' or ''calathidium'', but generally referred to as ''flower head'' or, alternatively, simply ''capitulum''.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, G. 1966. A dictionary of botany, including terms used in bio-chemistry, soil science, and statistics. LCCN 66 0 25447&lt;/ref&gt; The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called the ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].

The capitulum of the Asteraceae has evolved many characteristics that make it look superficially like a single flower. This type of flower-like inflorescence is fairly widespread amongst angiosperms, and has been given the name of ''[[pseudanthium|pseudanthia]]''.

[[File:Bidens flwr.jpg|thumb|A typical Asteraceae flower head (here ''[[Bidens torta]]'') showing the individual flowers]]
Many [[bract]]s form an [[involucral bract|involucre]] under the basis  of the capitulum; these are called &quot;phyllaries&quot;, or &quot;involucral bracts&quot;. They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious texture. The bracts can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).

Each floret may itself be subtended by a bract, called a &quot;palea&quot; or &quot;receptacular bract&quot;. These bracts as a group are often called &quot;[[chaff]]&quot;. The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.

[[File:Sunflower macro wide.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of disk florets.]]The florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme &amp;ndash; above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioidea has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme &amp;ndash; all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).

The [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present, it is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.

There are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, expelled with a sort of pump mechanism (''nüdelspritze'') or a brush.

The [[pistil]] is made of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes; stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]].

===Fruits and Seeds===
[[File:Kih-silberdistel.jpg|thumb|right|Seeds are dispersed by the wind in ''[[Carlina]]'']]
The fruit of the Asteraceae is [[achene]]-like, and is called a '''cypsela''' (plural ''cypselae''). Although there are two fused [[carpel]]s, there is only one locule, and only one [[seed]] per fruit is formed. It may sometimes be winged or spiny because the '''pappus''', which is derived from [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] tissue often remains on the fruit (for example in [[dandelion]]). In some species, however, the pappus falls off (for example in ''[[Helianthus]]''). Cypsela [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] is often used to help determine plant relationships at the genus and species level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | pages = 569–594 | url = http://apt.allenpress.com/aptonline/?request=get-abstract&amp;issn=0026-6493&amp;volume=092&amp;issue=04&amp;page=0569 | title = Morphology Of Cypselae In Subtribe Arctotidinae (Compositae–Arctotideae) And Its Taxonomic Implications | author = R. J. McKenzie, J. Samuel, E. M. Muller, A. K. W. Skinner, and N. P. Barker | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | month = December | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mature [[seed]]s usually have little [[endosperm]] or none.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judd&quot;/&gt;

===Metabolites===
Asteraceae generally store energy in the form of [[inulin]].  They produce iso/chlorogenic acid, [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactones]], pentacyclic triterpene alcohols, various [[alkaloid]]s, [[acetylene]]s (cyclic, aromatic, with vinyl end groups), [[tannin]]s. They have [[terpene|terpenoid]] [[essential oils]] which never contain [[iridoid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Epizoochoria NRM.jpg|thumb|Epizoochory in ''[[Bidens tripartita]]'']]
Asteraceae are especially common in open and dry environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judd&quot;/&gt;

Many members of the Asteraceae are [[pollination|pollinated]] by insects, which explains their value in attracting [[beneficial insects]], but [[pollination syndrome|anemophyly]] is also present (e.g. ''[[Ragweed|Ambrosia]]'', ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'').  There are many [[apomixis|apomictic]] species in the family.

Seeds are ordinarily dispersed intact with the fruiting body, the cypsela.  Wind dispersal is common (''[[Seed dispersal#Wind|anemochory]]'') assisted by a hairy pappus. Another common variation is ''[[Seed dispersal#Dispersal by animals|epizoochory]]'', in which the dispersal unit, a single cypsela (e.g. ''[[Bidens]]'') or entire capitulum (e.g. ''[[Arctium]]'') provided with hooks, spines or some equivalent structure, sticks to the fur or plumage of an animal (or even to clothes, like in the photo) just to fall off later far from its mother plant.

==Evolution==
Diversification of Asteraceae appears to have taken place roughly 42-36 million years ago, the stem group perhaps being up to 49 million years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;/&gt;

It is still unknown whether the precise cause of their great success was the development of the highly specialised [[capitulum]], their ability to store energy as [[fructan]]s (mainly [[inulin]]), which is an advantage in relatively dry zones, or some combination of these and possibly other factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens&quot;/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Field of sunflowers.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sunflower]]s are a commonly cultivated member of Asteraceae]]
[[File:RIMG0152 uf.JPG|thumb|225px|left|]]
Commercially important plants in the Asteraceae include the food crops ''[[Lactuca sativa]]'' (lettuce), ''[[Cichorium]]'' (chicory), ''[[Cynara scolymus]]'' (globe artichoke), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' (sunflower), ''[[Smallanthus sonchifolius]]'' (yacón), ''[[Carthamus tinctorius]]'' (safflower) and ''[[Helianthus tuberosus]]'' (Jerusalem artichoke).  

Other commercially important species include Compositae used as herbs and in herbal teas and other beverages.  Chamomile, which comes from two different species, the annual ''[[Matricaria recutita]]'' or German chamomile, and the perennial ''[[Chamaemelum nobile]]'', also called Roman chamomile.  ''[[Calendula]]'', also called the pot marigold is grown commercially for herbal teas and the potpourri industry.  Echinacea (''[[Echinacea purpurea]]''), used as a medicinal tea.  Winter tarragon, also called Mexican mint marigold, ''[[Tagetes lucida]]'' is commonly grown and used as a tarragon substitute in climates where tarragon will not survive.  Finally, the wormwood genus ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' includes [[absinthe]] (''A. absinthium'') and [[tarragon]] (''A. dracunculus'').

Industrial use of Compositae is also known.  Common in all commercial poultry feed, marigold (''[[Tagetes patula]]'') is grown primarily in Mexico. Marigold oil, extracted from ''[[Tagetes minuta]]'' is used by the metric ton in the cola and cigarette industry.   

Plants in Asteraceae are medically important in areas that don't have access to Western medicine. They are also commonly featured in medical and phytochemical journals because the [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactone]] compounds contained within them are an important cause of [[allergic contact dermatitis]]. Allergy to these compounds is the leading cause of allergic contact dermatitis in florists in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology| last=Odom| first=Richard B.| coauthors=William D.

Many members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry. Some examples are ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'', ''[[Gerbera]]'', ''[[Calendula]]'', ''[[Dendranthema]]'', ''[[Argyranthemum]]'', ''[[Dahlia]]'', ''[[Tagetes]]'', ''[[Zinnia]]'' and many others.

Many members of Asteraceae are copious [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] producers and are useful for evaluating [[pollinator]] populations during their bloom. ''[[Centaurea]]'' (knapweed), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' (domestic sunflower), and some species of ''[[Solidago]]'' (goldenrod) are major &quot;[[honey]] plants&quot; for [[beekeeper]]s. ''Solidago'' produces relatively high protein [[pollen]], which helps [[honey bee]]s overwinter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Some members of the Asteraceae are economically important as weeds.  Notable in the United States are the ragwort,  ''[[Senecio jacobaea]]'', groundsel ''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'' and ''[[Taraxacum]]'' (dandelion).  

The genera ''[[Tanacetum]]'', ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'' and ''[[Pulicaria]]'' contain species with insecticidal properties.

''[[Parthenium argentatum]]'' (guayule) is a source of [[hypoallergenic]] [[latex]].

The '''Apiaceae''' or '''Umbelliferae''' (both names are allowed by the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|ICBN]]) is a family of usually aromatic [[plant]]s with hollow stems, commonly known as '''umbellifers'''. It includes [[angelica]], [[anise]], [[arracacha]], [[asafoetida]], [[caraway]], [[carrot]], [[celery]], [[centella asiatica]], [[chervil]], [[cicely]], [[coriander]]/[[cilantro]], [[cumin]], [[dill]], [[fennel]], [[hemlock]], [[lovage]], [[Queen anne's lace|Queen Anne's Lace]], [[parsley]], [[parsnip]], [[sea holly]], the now extinct [[silphium]], and other relatives. It is a large family with about 300 [[genus|genera]] and more than 3,000 [[species]]. The earlier name Umbelliferae derives from the [[inflorescence]] being generally in the form of a compound &quot;umbel&quot;, and has the same root as the word &quot;[[umbrella]]&quot;. The botanical subspeciality that studies Apiaceae is sometimes called ''sciadophytography''.

==Description==
The small flowers are [[symmetry (biology)|radially symmetrical]] with 5 small [[sepal]]s, 5 [[petal]]s and 5 [[stamen]]s.

The family includes some highly [[toxic]] plants, such as [[Conium|hemlock]]. Many plants in this family, such as [[wild carrot]], have [[estrogen]]ic properties and have been used as [[folk medicine]] for [[birth control]]. Most notable for this use is the extinct giant fennel, [[silphium]]. The cultivated plants in this category are almost all considered good [[companion plant]]s, as the umbrella of tiny flowers attracts omnivorous [[beneficial insect]]s, especially [[ladybugs]], parasitic wasps and predatory flies, which then will hunt insect pests on nearby crops.

The family is closely related to [[Araliaceae]] and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Some recent systems include Araliaceae in an expanded Apiaceae but this has not been widely followed. ''Hydrocotyle'' and ''Trachymene'', traditionally included in Apiaceae, are now generally included in Araliaceae.

Notable members include ''Anethum graveolens'' - [[Dill]], ''Anthriscus cerefolium'' - [[Chervil]], ''Angelica'' spp. - [[angelica]], ''Apium graveolens'' - [[celery]], ''Arracacia xanthorrhiza'' - [[arracacha]], ''Carum carvi'' - [[caraway]], ''Centella asiatica'' - [[gotu kola]] (pennywort), ''Conium maculatum'' - [[conium|poison hemlock]], ''Coriandrum sativum'' - [[coriander]], ''Cuminum cyminum'' - [[cumin]], ''Daucus carota'' - [[carrot]], ''Eryngium'' spp. - [[eryngium maritimum|Sea holly]], ''Foeniculum vulgare'' - [[fennel]], ''Ferula Assafoetida'' - [[asafoetida]], ''Ferula gummosa'' - [[galbanum]], ''Myrrhis odorata'' - [[cicely]], ''Pastinaca sativa'' - [[parsnip]], ''Petroselinum crispum'' - [[parsley]], ''Pimpinella anisum'' - [[anise]], ''Levisticum officinale'' - [[lovage (plant)|lovage]]

==Cultivation==
Many members of this plant group are cultivated, for various purposes. The plant structure includes a [[tap root]], which can be large enough to be useful in food, for example [[parsnip]]s, [[carrot]]s, and [[Hamburg parsley]]. Plants of this category also are adapted to conditions that encourage heavy concentrations of [[essential oil]]s, so that some are used as flavorful or aromatic herbs, such as parsley, cilantro, and dill. The plentiful seeds of the umbers, likewise, are sometimes used in cuisine, as with coriander, fennel, cumin, and caraway.

===Companion Plants===
Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a [[companion plant]]. In large part, this is because the tiny flowers forming the umbels, for which the group is named, are perfectly suited for [[ladybug]]s, [[parasitic wasp]]s, and predatory [[flies]], which actually drink nectar when not reproducing. They then will prey upon insect pests on nearby plants.

Some of the plants are herbs that produce enough scent to possibly dilute the odors of nearby plants, or the [[pheromone]]s emitted by insects that find those plants, which would otherwise attract more pests.

{{Neuron map|Neuron}}

An '''axon''' is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], that conducts [[action potential|electrical impulses]] away from the neuron's [[cell body]] or soma.

An axon is one of two types of [[protoplasm]]ic protrusions that extrude from the cell body of a neuron, the other type being [[dendrite]]s.  Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites usually receive signals while axons usually transmit them).  All of these rules have exceptions, however.

Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites.  No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, K.-W. (1976) Receptive fields, geometry and conduction block of sensory neurones in the CNS of the leech. J. Physiol. (Lond) 263:513-538.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most axons branch, in some cases very profusely.

Axons make contact with other cells—usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells—at junctions called [[synapse]]s.  At a synapse, the membrane of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap.  Some synaptic junctions appear partway along an axon as it extends—these are called ''en passant'' (&quot;in passing&quot;) synapses.  Other synapses appear as terminals at the ends of axonal branches.  A single axon, with all its branches taken together, can [[innervate]] multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals.

== Anatomy ==

Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the [[nervous system]], and as bundles they help make up [[nerve]]s. Individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about 1[[micrometre|μm]] across), but may be up to several feet in length. The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the [[sciatic nerve]], which run from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the big toe of each foot. These single-cell fibers of the sciatic nerve may extend a meter or even longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaftb.org/dnaftb/6/concept/index.html DNA From The Beginning, section 6: 	Genes are real things., &quot;Amination&quot; section, final slide]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[vertebrate]]s, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in [[myelin]], which is formed by either of two types of [[glia|glial cells]]: [[Schwann cell]]s ensheathing [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] neurons and [[oligodendrocyte]]s insulating those of the [[central nervous system]]. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the sheath known as [[nodes of Ranvier]] occur at evenly-spaced intervals.  The myelination enables an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called [[saltatory conduction|saltation]]. The demyelination of axons is what causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease [[Multiple Sclerosis]].
The axons of some neurons branch to form '''axon collaterals''', that can be divided into a number of smaller branches called '''telodendria'''. Along these the bifurcated impulse travels simultaneously to signal more than one other cell.

===Initial Segment===
The initial segment of the axon is unmyelinated and is thought to be the usual site of [[action potential]] intiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Nodes of Ranvier===
{{Main|Nodes of Ranvier}}
Nodes of Ranvier are unmyelinated segments of the axon where [[action potential]]s are amplified and transmitted down the axon.

==Physiology==
The [[physiology]] can be described by the [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]], extended to vertebrates in Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations. Peripheral nerve fibers can be classified based on axonal conduction velocity, mylenation, fiber size etc. For example, there are slow-conducting unmyelinated [[C fiber]]s and faster-conducting myelinated [[A delta fiber|Aδ fiber]]s. More complex mathematical modeling continues to be done today. There are several types of sensory- as well as motorfibers. Other fibers not mentioned in table are e.g. fibers of the [[autonomic nervous system]]

===Motor=== &lt;!-- Motor fiber types redirects here--&gt;

===Sensory=== &lt;!--Sensory fiber types redirects here--&gt;
Different [[sensory receptors]] are innervated by different types of nerve fibers. [[Proprioceptor]]s are innervated by type Ia, Ib and II sensory fibers, [[mechanoreceptor]]s by type II and III sensory fibers and [[nociceptors]] and [[thermoreceptors]] by type III and IV sensory fibers.

==Growth and development==
[[Image:Axon two photon.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Axon of 9 day old mouse with growth cone visible.]]
Growing axons move through their environment via the [[growth cone]], which is at the tip of the axon. The growth cone has a broad sheet like extension called [[lamellipodia]] which contain protrusions called [[filopodia]]. The filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment. [[Actin]] plays a major role in the mobility of this system.
Environments with high levels of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s or CAM's create an ideal environment for axonal growth. This seems to provide a &quot;sticky&quot; surface for axons to grow along. Examples of CAM's specific to neural systems include [[Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule|N-CAM]], neuroglial CAM or [[NgCAM]], [[TAG-1]], [[MAG (neural)|MAG]], and [[Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]], all of which are part of the [[immunoglobulin]] superfamily. Another set of molecules called [[extracellular matrix adhesion molecule]]s also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along. Examples of these molecules include [[laminin]], [[fibronectin]], [[tenascin]], and [[perlecan]]. Some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellents. Others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects.

Cells called [[guidepost cells]] assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth. These cells are typically other, sometimes immature, neurons.

==History==
Some of the first intracellular recordings in a nervous system were made in the late 1930s by K. Cole and H. Curtis. [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] also employed the [[squid giant axon]] (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the [[action potential]], leading the formulation of the [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]].
Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for this work in 1963.
The formulas detailing axonal conductance were extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations. Erlanger and Gasser earlier developed the classification system for peripheral&lt;ref&gt;[[Sansom B]], &quot;Reflex  Isolation&quot; http://www.sansomnia.com&lt;/ref&gt; nerve fibers, based on axonal conduction velocity, [[myelin]]ation, fiber size etc.
Even recently our understanding of the biochemical basis for action potential propagation has advanced, and now includes many details about individual [[ion channel]]s.

==Injury==
{{Main|Nerve injury}}
In order of degree of severity, injury to a nerve can be described as [[neuropraxia]], [[axonotmesis]], or [[neurotmesis]].
[[Concussion]] is considered a mild form of [[diffuse axonal injury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/pmr/topic212.htm eMedicine - Traumatic Brain Injury: Definition, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology : Article by Segun T Dawodu, MD, FAAPMR, FAANEM, CIME, DipMI(RCSed)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{alphabet}}
{{Aramaeans}}

The '''Aramaic alphabet''' is adapted from the [[Phoenician alphabet]] and became distinctive from it by the 8th century BCE. The letters all represent [[consonant]]s, some of which are ''[[matres lectionis]]'', which also indicate long [[vowel]]s.

The Aramaic [[alphabet]] is historically significant, since virtually all [[modern]] [[Middle East]]ern writing systems use a [[Writing system|script]] that can be traced back to it, as well as numerous [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] writing systems of Central and East Asia. This is primarily due to the widespread usage of the Aramaic language as both a ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the official language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]], and its successor, the  [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Among the scripts in modern use, the [[Hebrew alphabet]] bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic [[Writing system|script]] of the 5th century BCE, with an identical letter inventory and, for the most part, nearly identical letter shapes.

Writing systems that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels (like the Aramaic one) or indicate them with added diacritical signs, have been called  [[abjad]]s by [[Peter T. Daniels]] to distinguish them from later alphabets, such as Greek, that represent vowels more systematically.  This is to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet, which implies that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary (as argued by Gelb) or an incomplete or deficient alphabet (as most other writers have said); rather, it is a different type.

==History==
===Origins===
The earliest inscriptions in the [[Aramaic language]] use the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. Over time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. Aramaic gradually became the ''lingua franca'' throughout the Middle East, with the script at first complementing and then displacing [[Assyrian cuneiform]] as the predominant writing system.

===Achaemenid period===
Around 500 BCE, following the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] conquest of Mesopotamia under [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], [[Old Aramaic]] was adopted by the conquerors as the &quot;vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic&lt;!-- pp 250–261 --&gt;&lt;!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp 251–252--&gt;|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250–261}} p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was inevitably influenced by [[Old Persian]].

For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Imperial Aramaic—or near enough for it to be recognisable—would remain an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. The Aramaic script would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I. Abteilung 1|location=Boston|publisher=Adamant|pages=249ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of thirty Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] have been recently discovered. An analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BCE. Achaemenid administration of Bactria and [[Sogdiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria|series=Studies in the Khalili Collection|last1=Naveh|first1=Joseph|last2=Shaked|first2=Shaul|isbn=1-874-78074-9|publisher=Khalili Collections|location=Oxford|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its widespread usage led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing the [[Hebrew language]]. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of Phoenician (the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]).

===Aramaic-derived scripts===
Since the evolution of the Aramaic alphabet out of the Phoenician one was a gradual process, the division of the world's alphabets into those derived from the Phoenician one directly and those derived from Phoenician via Aramaic is somewhat artificial. In general, the alphabets of the Mediterranean region (Anatolia, Greece, Italy) are classified as Phoenician-derived, adapted from around the 8th century BCE, while those of the East (the Levant, Persia, Central Asia) are considered Aramaic-derived, adapted from around the 6th century BCE from the Imperial Aramaic script of the Achaemenid Empire.

After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the unity of the Imperial Aramaic script was lost, diversifying into a number of descendant cursives.

The [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Nabataean alphabet]]s, as they stood by the [[Roman era]], were little changed in style from the Imperial Aramaic alphabet.

A [[Cursive Hebrew]] variant developed from the early centuries AD, but it remained restricted to the status of a variant used alongside the non-cursive. By contrast, the cursive developed out of the Nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing Arabic, evolving into the [[Arabic alphabet]] as it stood by the time of the early [[Islamic conquests|spread of Islam]].

The development of cursive versions of Aramaic also led to the creation of the [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Palmyrenean alphabet|Palmyrenean]] and [[Mandaic alphabet]]s. These scripts formed the basis of the historical scripts of Central Asia, such as the [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]] and [[Mongolian script|Mongolian]] alphabets.

The  [[Old Turkic script]] evident in epigraphy from the 8th century likely also has its origins in the Aramaic script

===Modern===
Today, [[Biblical Aramaic]], Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the Aramaic language of the [[Talmud]] are written in the Hebrew alphabet. [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects are written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is written in the [[Mandaic alphabet]].

Due to the near-identity of the Aramaic and the classical Hebrew alphabets, Aramaic text is mostly typeset in standard Hebrew script in scholarly literature.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{note|SinNote}}Arabic س ''sīn'' derives only its position in the [[Abjad numerals|traditional abjadi order]] in the Arabic alphabet from ''samekh''; its shape is derived from ''shīn'' as a function of a [[sound change]] from [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-West or Central Semitic]] to [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

===Matres lectionis===
{{Main|Mater lectionis}}

The letters Waw and Yudh, put following the consonants that were followed by the vowels ''u'' and ''i'' (and often also ''o'' and ''e''), are used to indicate the long vowels ''û'' and ''î'' respectively (often also ''ô'' and ''ê'' respectively). These letters, which stand for both consonant and vowel sounds, are known as ''matres lectionis''. The letter Alaph, likewise, had some of the characteristics of a ''mater lectionis'': in initial positions, it indicated a specific consonant called glottal stop (followed by a vowel), and, in the middle of the word and word finally, it often also stood for the long vowels ''â'' or ''ê''. Among Jews, influence of Hebrew spelling often led to the use of He instead of Alaph in word final positions. The practice of using certain letters to hold vowel values spread to child writing systems of Aramaic, such as Hebrew and Arabic, where they are still used today.

==Unicode==
The Aramaic alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2.

The Unicode block for Imperial Aramaic is U+10840&amp;ndash;U+1085F:

&quot;'''American shot'''&quot; is a translation of a phrase from [[France|French]] [[film criticism]], &quot;''plan américain''&quot; and refers to a medium-long (&quot;knee&quot;) [[Shot (filming)|film shot]] of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex [[dialogue]] scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.

The French critics thought it was characteristic of [[Cinema of the United States|American films]] of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of ''cheaper'' American movies, such as [[Charlie Chan]] mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.

[[Howard Hawks]] legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. It became his trademark style.

==Presentation==
ADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection or vaccination. Major symptoms include [[fever]], [[headache]], drowsiness, [[non-epileptic seizure|seizure]]s and [[coma]]. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenembaum et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.&lt;ref&gt;Allmendinger A, Krauthamer A, Spektor V. [http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/case-studies/content/article/113619/1493546 Case of the month.] Diagnostic Imaging. 2009;31(12):10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted [[first-line treatment]] is high doses of intravenous [[corticosteroid]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahar et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; such as [[methylprednisolone]] or [[dexamethasone]], followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of [[prednisolone]]. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenembaum et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anlar B, Basaran C, Kose G, et al. 2003 194–9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale RC, de Sousa C, Chong WK, Cox TC, Harding B, Neville BG 2000 2407–22&quot; /&gt; and tend to show poorer outcomes{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}. Other antiinflamatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as [[plasmapheresis]], high doses of intravenous [[immunoglobulin]] (IVIg),&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahar et al. 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shahar E, Andraus J, Savitzki D, Pilar G, Zelnik N |title=Outcome of severe encephalomyelitis in children: effect of high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins |journal=J.

These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used, or fail to show an effect.

There is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Straussberg R, Schonfeld T, Weitz R, Karmazyn B, Harel L |title=Improvement of atypical acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins |journal=Pediatr.

In a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IVIg; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe [[peripheral neuropathy]]- were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahar et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feasby T, Banwell B, Benstead T, ''et al.'' |title=Guidelines on the use of intravenous immune globulin for neurologic conditions |journal=Transfus Med Rev |volume=21 |issue=2 Suppl 1 |pages=S57–107 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17397768 |doi=10.1016/j.tmrv.2007.01.002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ravaglia S, Piccolo G, Ceroni M, et al. 2007 1518–23&quot; /&gt; This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to a IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.

==Prognosis==
Full recovery is seen in  50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as [[Modified Rankin Scale|mRS]] or [[Expanded Disability Status Scale|EDSS]]), average time to recover is one to six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menge et al. 2007&quot; /&gt; The mortality rate may be as high as 5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menge et al. 2007&quot; /&gt; Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lin CH, Jeng JS, Hsieh ST, Yip PK, Wu RM |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: a follow-up study in Taiwan |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=162–7 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17028121 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2005.084194 |pmc=2077670}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever, or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present.

===Motor deficits===
Residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to [[ataxia]] and [[hemiparesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenembaum et al. 2007&quot; /&gt;

===Neurocognitive===
Patients with demyelinating illnesses, such as MS, have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Foong J, Rozewicz L, Quaghebeur G, ''et al.'' |title=Executive function in multiple sclerosis.

Another study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacobs RK, Anderson VA, Neale JL, Shield LK, Kornberg AJ |title=Neuropsychological outcome after acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: impact of age at illness onset |journal=Pediatr.

Using a pathological definition instead, they would be apart (plaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined).

'''Ataxia''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''α-'' [used as a negative prefix] + ''-τάξις'' [order], meaning &quot;lack of order&quot;) is a [[neurology|neurological]] [[neurological sign|sign]] and [[symptom]] that consists of gross lack of [[Motor coordination|coordination]] of [[muscle]] movements.  Ataxia is a non-specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. The term &quot;dystaxia&quot; is a rarely used synonym.

The International Ataxia Awareness Day is observed on September 25 each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleNational Ataxia Foundation - International Ataxia Awareness Day&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ataxia.org/events/international-ataxia-awareness-day.aspx |title=National Ataxia Foundation - International Ataxia Awareness Day |accessdate=2008-03-25 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Cerebellar===
The term [[cerebellar ataxia]] is used to indicate ataxia that is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits, such as antagonist [[hypotonia]], [[asynergy]], [[dysmetria]], [[dyschronometria]], and [[dysdiadochokinesia]]. How and where these abnormalities manifest themselves depends on which cerebellar structures have been damaged, and whether the lesion is bilateral or unilateral.

* '''Dysfunction of the [[vestibulocerebellum]]''' impairs the balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, in order to gain a wider base and to avoid [[titubation]] (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a positive [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes.
* '''Dysfunction of the [[spinocerebellum]]'''  presents itself with a wide-based &quot;drunken sailor&quot; gait (called truncal ataxia)&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumenfeld|first=H|title=Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases|year=2002|publisher=Sinauer Associates|pages=670-671}}&lt;/ref&gt;, characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps.
* '''Dysfunction of the [[cerebrocerebellum]]''' presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary, planned movements by the extremities (called appendicular ataxia).&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld/&gt; These include:
**[[intention tremor]] (coarse trembling, accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements, possibly involving the head and eyes as well as the limbs and torso);
**peculiar writing abnormalities (large, unequal letters, irregular underlining);
**a peculiar pattern of [[dysarthria]] (slurred speech, sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite a regular rhythm).
**inability to perform rapidly alternating movements, known as [[dysdiadochokinesia]]. This could involve rapidly switching from [[pronation]] to [[supination]] of the forearm. Movements become more irregular with increases of speed.&lt;ref name=Schmitz&gt;{{Schmitz, T.J. (2007). Examination of Coordination. In O'Sullivan, S. B., &amp; Schmitz, T. J. (2007). Physical rehabilitation (pp. 193-225). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**inability to judge distances or ranges of movement. This is known is [[dysmetria]] and is often seen as undershooting, [[hypometria]], or overshooting, [[hypermetria]], the required distance or range to reach a target. This is sometimes seen when a patient is asked to reach out and touch someone's finger or touch their own nose.&lt;ref name=Schmitz /&gt; 
**the rebound phenomenon, also known as the loss of the check reflex is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia. For example, when a patient is flexing their elbow isometrically against a resistance. When the resistance is suddenly removed without warning, the patient's arm may swing up and even strike themselves. With an intact check reflex, the patient will check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement.&lt;ref name=Schmitz /&gt;

===Sensory===
The term [[sensory ataxia]] is employed to indicate ataxia due to loss of [[proprioception]], the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts. This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s. 

Sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady &quot;stomping&quot; gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.

[[Physicians]] can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient's finger will tend to &quot;fall down&quot; and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the &quot;ataxic hand&quot;).

===Vestibular===
The term vestibular ataxia is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.

==Causes==
The three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation.

===Focal lesions===
Any type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumour]], [[multiple sclerosis]]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum, sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord (and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]), vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]).

===Exogenous substances===
Exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is [[ethanol]], which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Other examples include prolonged use of various prescription drugs, SSRI's more so Tricyclic antidepressants in higher doses (e.g. most [[antiepileptic drugs]] have cerebellar ataxia as a possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, [[cannabis]] ingestion&lt;ref name=&quot;Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |title= Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-03 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various other recreational drugs (e.g. [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[dextromethorphan]], all of which are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s that produce a dissociative state at high doses).  Exposure to high levels of [[methylmercury]], through consumption of fish with high mercury concentrations, is also a known cause of ataxia and other neurological disorders&lt;ref&gt;Díez, Sergei (2009). Human Health Effects of Methylmercury Exposure, p. 111-132 ''in'' Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology Volume 198. Springer Publishers, New York. http://www.springerlink.com/content/wxl42tn2n27715p3/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation poisoning===
Ataxia can be induced as a result of severe [[Acute radiation syndrome|acute radiation poisoning]] with an absorbed dose of more than 30 Grays.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency===
[[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Vitamin B12 deficiency|deficiency]] may cause, among several neurological abnormalities, overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia.

===Causes of isolated sensory ataxia===
[[Peripheral neuropathy|Peripheral neuropathies]] may cause generalised or localised sensory ataxia (e.g. a limb only) depending on the extent of the neuropathic involvement. Spinal disorders of various types may cause sensory ataxia from the lesioned level below, when they involve the dorsal columns.

===Non-hereditary cerebellar degeneration===
Non-hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic [[ethanol abuse]], [[paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration]], [[high altitude cerebral oedema]], [[coeliac disease]], [[normal pressure hydrocephalus]] and [[cerebellitis]].

===Hereditary ataxias===
Ataxia may depend on [[hereditary]] disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum and/or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include [[autosomal dominant]] ones such as [[spinocerebellar ataxia]], [[episodic ataxia]], and [[dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy]], as well as [[autosomal recessive]] disorders such as [[Friedreich's ataxia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and [[Niemann Pick disease]], [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), and [[abetalipoproteinaemia]]. An example of X-linked ataxic condition is the rare [[fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome]].

===Arnold-Chiari malformation===
[[Arnold-Chiari malformation]] is a malformation of the [[Human brain|brain]]. It consists of a downward displacement of the [[cerebellar tonsils]] and the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] through the [[foramen magnum]], sometimes causing [[hydrocephalus]] as a result of obstruction of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] outflow.

===Wilson's Disease===
[[Wilson's Disease]] is an [[autosomal]]-[[recessive gene]] disorder whereby an alteration of the ATP7B gene results in an inability to properly excrete copper from the body.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, J.M. (2010). [http://www.birminghammodis.com/handbook/Chapter12.pdf &quot;Wilson’s Disease&quot;]. In C. E. Clarke, &amp; D. J. Nicholl (Eds.), ''Birmingham Movement Disorders Coursebook''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Copper accumulates in the nervous system and liver and can cause ataxia as well as other [[neurological]] and organ impairments.&lt;ref&gt; Haldeman-Englert, C. (2010). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001789/ &quot;Wilson’s Disease&quot;]. PubMed Health. Retrieved 29 April 2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause. Treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia, but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely. Recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury (such as [[stroke]] or a [[benign tumour]]), compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;can rehabilitation help&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=S.M.|coauthors=Bastian A.J.|title=Can rehabilitation help ataxia?| journal=Neurology| year=2009| volume=73| issue=22|pages=1818–1819}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;systematic review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trujillo-Martin|first=MM.|coauthors=Serrano-Aguilar P., Monton-Alvarez F., Carrillo-Fumero R.|title=Effectiveness and safety of treatments for degenerative ataxias: a systematic review|journal=Movement Disorders| year=2009| volume=24| issue=8| pages=1111–1124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through [[physical therapy]] and [[occupational therapy]] to reduce [[disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perlman|first=S.L.|title=Ataxias|journal=Clinics in Geriatric Medicine|year=2006|volume=22|issue=4|url=http://www.cinahl.com/cgi-bin/refsvc?jid=701&amp;accno=2009312274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include: 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), idebenone, amantadine, physostigmine, L-carnitine or derivatives, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, vigabatrin,phosphatidylcholine, acetazolamide, 4-aminopyridine, buspirone, and a combined coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E antioxidant therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;systematic review&quot;/&gt;  [[Physical therapy]] requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating [[motor learning]] for retraining specific functional motor patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ilg|first=G.|coauthors=Synofzik M, Bro¨tz D, Burkard S, Giese MA, Scho¨ls L.|title=Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease| journal=Neurology| year=2009|volume=73|pages=1823–1830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gait, coordination, and balance training are large components of therapy. Training will likely need to be intense and focused, as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb training.&lt;ref name=&quot;stroke ataxia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=L.|coauthors=Senesac C., McGuirk T., Woodbury M., Howland D., Davis S., Patterson T.|title=Response to intensive upper extremity therapy by individuals with ataxia from stroke|journal=Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation|year=2008|volume=15|issue=3|pages=262–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their therapy consisted of [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] which resulted in improvements of their arm function.&lt;ref name =&quot;stroke ataxia&quot; /&gt;  Treatment will likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking. Gait aids (such as a cane or walker) can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with a balance impairment or poor coordination. Severe ataxia may eventually call for the use of a wheelchair.

In order to obtain better results, possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia; for example muscle weakness and decreased endurance which would lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns.

==Other uses of the term==
The term &quot;ataxia&quot; is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process. Examples include '''optic ataxia''' (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects. Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex. The posterior parietal cortex is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention.  Optic ataxia is usually part of [[Balint's syndrome]], but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Vallar, MD, Spatial Neglect, Balint-Holmes’ and Gerstmann’s Syndromes, and Other Spatial Disorders CNS Spectr. 2007;12(7):527-536&lt;/ref&gt;), and '''ataxic respiration''' (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the [[medulla oblongata]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abdul Alhazred''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by [[United States|American]] horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. He is the so-called &quot;Mad [[Arab]]&quot; credited with authoring the imaginary book ''Kitab al-Azif'' (the ''[[Necronomicon]]''), and as such an integral part of [[Cthulhu Mythos]] lore.

==Name==
The name ''Abdul Alhazred'' is a pseudonym that Lovecraft created in his youth, which he took on after reading ''[[1001 Arabian Nights]]'' at the age of about five years. The name was invented either by Lovecraft, or by Albert Baker, the Phillips' family lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, p. 7, ''The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Abdul]]'' is a common Arabic name component (but never a name by itself; additionally the ending -ul and the beginning Al- are redundant), but ''Alhazred'' may allude to ''Hazard'', a pun on the book's destructive and dangerous nature, or a reference to Lovecraft's ancestors by that name.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Lovecraft, a Biography''. Ballantine, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=REG&amp;db=glencoe&amp;id=I6863 Rootsweb page on Lovecraft's family tree, showing his Hazard ancestry.]&lt;/ref&gt; It might also have been a pun on &quot;all-has-read&quot;, since Lovecraft was an avid reader in youth,&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, &quot;Alhazred, Abdul&quot;, ''The Lovecraft Lexicon'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another possibility, raised in an essay by the Swedish fantasy writer and editor, Rickard Berghorn, is that the name ''Alhazred'' was influenced by references to two historical authors whose names were Latinized as ''Alhazen'': Alhazen ben Josef, who translated Ptolemy into Arabic; and [[Alhazen|Abu 'Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham]], who wrote about optics, mathematics and physics. Ibn al-Haytham is said to have pretended to be mad to escape the wrath of a ruler.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alephbok.se/alhazen_alhazred.html Rickard Berghorn &quot;Alhazen och Alhazred&quot; (Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abdul Alhazred'' is not a real [[Arabic name]], and seems to contain the Arabic definite article morpheme ''al-'' twice in a row (anomalous in terms of [[Arabic grammar]]). The more proper Arabic form might be ''Abd-al-Hazred'' or ''Abdul Hazred''. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations, his name has appeared as ''Abdullah {{Unicode|Al[[ḥ]]a[[ẓ]]red}}'' (عبدالله الحظرد): Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ḥaẓra}}''حظر = &quot;he fenced in&quot;, &quot;he prohibited&quot;. Hazred could come from the [[Persian language|Persian]] or Arabic word &quot;Hazrat&quot; meaning Great Lord with a twist that makes it sound like &quot;red&quot; and &quot;hazard&quot; both indicative of danger. However Abdul is a common Arabic prefix meaning &quot;Servant of the&quot; and &quot;Al&quot; is Arabic for &quot;the&quot;, and if &quot;hazra&quot; means &quot;he prohibited&quot;, &quot;he fenced in&quot; or &quot;Great Lord&quot;, then the name would mean &quot;Servant of the Prohibited&quot;, &quot;Servant of the Fenced in&quot;, or &quot;Servant of the Great Lord&quot; which would make sense considering his role, even if it is not a proper Arabic name.

Similarly, an article (written from an in-universe perspective) in the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' [[roleplaying game]] speculates that it may be a corruption of ''Abd Al-Azrad'', which it claims translates to ''The Worshipper of the Great Devourer''.

The phrase &quot;mad Arab&quot;, sometimes with both words capitalized in Lovecraft's stories, is used so commonly before Alhazred's name that it almost constitutes a title. A reference to the &quot;Mad Arab&quot; in [[Cthulhu Mythos]] fiction is invariably a synonym for Abdul Alhazred. However due to [[political correctness]] later writers sometimes preface Alhazred with words such as &quot;monk&quot; (such as in the [[Chick Publications|Chick]] parody tract [http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=135 &quot;Who will be Eaten First?&quot;] by [[Howard Hallis]]) or &quot;scholar&quot; replacing Arab to avoid any possible racist overtones.

==Biography==
===H. P. Lovecraft===
{{wikisource|History of the Necronomicon}}
According to Lovecraft's &quot;History of the Necronomicon&quot; (written 1927, first published [[1938 in literature|1938]]), Alhazred was:

:a mad poet of [[Sanaá]], in [[Yemen]], who is said to have flourished during the period of the [[Umayyad|Ommiade]] [[caliph]]s, circa 700 A.D. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]] and the subterranean secret of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of [[Arabia]]&amp;mdash;the [[Rub' al Khali|Roba El Khaliyeh]] or &quot;Empty Space&quot; of the ancients&amp;mdash;and &quot;[[Al-Dahna Desert|Dahna]]&quot; or &quot;Crimson&quot; desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in [[Damascus]].

In 730, while still living in Damascus, Alhazred supposedly wrote a book of ultimate evil in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''al-Azif'', which would later become known as the ''Necronomicon''. Those who have dealings with this book usually come to an unpleasant end, and Alhazred was no exception. Again according to Lovecraft's &quot;History&quot;:

:Of his final death or disappearance (738 A.D.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by [[Ibn Khallikan|Ebn Khallikan]] (12th cent. biographer) to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to have seen the fabulous [[Iram of the Pillars|Irem]], or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of [[The Nameless City|a certain nameless desert town]] the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. He was only an indifferent [[Muslim|Moslem]], worshipping unknown entities whom he called [[Yog-Sothoth]] and [[Cthulhu]].

===August Derleth===

[[August Derleth]] later made alterations to the biography of Alhazred, such as redating his death to 731. Derleth also changed Alhazred's final fate, as described in his [[short story]] &quot;[[The Trail of Cthulhu|The Keeper of the Key]]&quot;, first published in May [[1951 in literature|1951]]. In the story, [[The Trail of Cthulhu#Laban Shrewsbury|Professor Laban Shrewsbury]] (a recurring Derleth character) and his assistant at the time, [[The Trail of Cthulhu#Nayland Colum|Nayland Colum]], discover Alhazred's burial site.

While the two are heading a caravan from [[Salalah]], [[Oman]], they cross the border into [[Yemen]] and find the unexplored desert area that the ''Necronomicon'' calls &quot;Roba el Ehaliyeh&quot; or &quot;Roba el Khaliyeh&quot; — presumably a reference to the [[Empty Quarter]] or &quot;Rub al Khali&quot;.

At the center of the area they discover the [[Nameless City]] (the setting of the Lovecraft story of the same name) and in Derleth's text the domain of the [[Great Old One]] [[Hastur]]. Shrewsbury, an old agent of Hastur and the devoted enemy of Hastur's half-brother, Cthulhu, crosses its gates in search of Alhazred's burial site.

He indeed finds Alhazred's [[burial chamber]] and learns of his fate. Alhazred had been kidnapped in [[Damascus]] and brought to the Nameless City, where he had earlier studied and learned some of the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s lore. As punishment for betraying their secrets, Alhazred was tortured. Then they blinded him, severed his tongue and executed him.

Although the entrance to the chamber warns against disturbing him, Shrewsbury opens Alhazred's [[sarcophagus]] anyway, finding that only rags, bones, and dust remain of Alhazred. However, the sarcophagus also contains Alhazred's personal, incomplete copy of the ''Necronomicon'', written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Shrewsbury then uses [[necromancy]] to recall Alhazred's spirit and orders it to draw a map of the world as he knew it. After obtaining the map, which reveals the location of [[R'lyeh]] and other secret places, Shrewsbury finally lets Alhazred return to his eternal rest.

==In non-Mythos fiction==

Like his creation the ''Necronomicon'', Alhazred is often referenced in works that are not generally considered part of the Cthulhu Mythos, either as a subtle nod to Lovecraft or to create a connection to his world. In ''[[King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow|King's Quest VI]]'', a character named after Alhazred appears as an evil [[vizier]].

In the yet-to-be released [[Diablo III]], a travelling scholar named &quot;Abd al-Hazir&quot; functions as the fictional narrator for many of the game's features.  Given the similarities in the two characters names, professions, written works and generally dark subject matter, it is likely that Lovecraft's Alhazred provided the main inspiration for al-Hazir.

The [[Mercyful Fate]] albums ''[[Time (Mercyful Fate album)|Time]]'' and ''[[Into the Unknown (Mercyful Fate album)|Into the Unknown]]'' reference Alhazred.

The MMORPG Wizard101 features a Krok called Alhazred who teaches Balance magic.

In the soundtrack of the movie 'Sheitan', the track 'Batards de barbares' &lt;ref&gt;Clip on youtube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFfkLFPmi48&lt;/ref&gt; is from an imaginary hardcore rap band composed of Dimitriu, the 'Child of the East' and Abdul Alhazred, 'the Mad Arab' . This one is played by Hi-Tekk from 'La Caution'.

'''Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace''' (10 December 1815&amp;nbsp;– 27 November 1852), born '''Augusta Ada Byron''', was an [[United Kingdom|English]] writer chiefly known for her work on [[Charles Babbage]]'s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the [[analytical engine]]. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first [[algorithm]] intended to be processed by a machine; as such she is sometimes portrayed in popular culture as the &quot;World's First [[Computer Programmer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Annals of the History of Computing&quot;&gt;J. Fuegi and J. Francis, &quot;Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'&quot;. ''[[IEEE Annals of the History of Computing]]'' 25 #4 (October–December 2003): 16–26. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887 Digital Object Identifier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/ada-bio.html |title=Ada Byron, Lady Lovelace| accessdate = 11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the only [[Legitimacy_(law)|legitimate]] child of the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] (with [[Anne Isabella Milbanke]]), but had no relationship with her father, who died when she was nine. As a young adult she took an interest in mathematics, and in particular Babbage's work on the analytical engine. Between 1842 and 1843 she translated an article by Italian mathematician [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the engine, which she supplemented with a [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|set of notes]] of her own. These notes contain what is considered the first [[computer program]]&amp;mdash;that is, an algorithm encoded for processing by a machine. Though Babbage's engine was not built until 1989-91, Lovelace's notes are important in the early [[history of computers]]. She also foresaw the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage himself, focused only on these capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Fuegi and Francis 2003 pp. 19, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Ada Augusta Byron was born on December 10, 1815, she was the only child of the poet Lord Byron, 6th Lord Byron and his wife, Anne Isabella &quot;Annabella&quot; Milbanke, Baroness Wentworth.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Ada'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Byron, and many of those who knew Byron, expected that the baby would be &quot;the glorious boy&quot;, and there was some disappointment at the contrary news.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turney p. 35&quot;&gt;Turney 1972 p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; She was named after Byron's half-sister, [[Augusta Leigh]], and was called &quot;Ada&quot; by Byron himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein, Ada p. 17&quot;&gt;Stein, ''Ada'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Margaret Sarah Carpenter]]]]
On 16 January 1816, Annabella, at Byron's behest, left for her parents' home at [[Kirkby Mallory]] taking one-month-old Lovelace with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turney p. 35&quot;/&gt; Although English law gave fathers full custody of their children in cases of separation, Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Ada'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April, Byron signed the Deed of Separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 1972 pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; Byron did not have a relationship with his daughter and he died in 1824 when she was nine; her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turney p. 138&quot;&gt;Turney 1972 p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Annabella, became Baroness Wentworth in her own right in 1856, being then the sole remaining representative of the Wentworth Viscounts.

Lovelace was often ill, dating from her early childhood. At the age of eight she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein, Ada p. 17&quot;/&gt; In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of the [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831 she was able to walk with crutches.

Throughout her illnesses, Lovelace continued her education.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Ada'', pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Lord Byron was one of the reasons that Lovelace was taught [[mathematics]] from an early age. Lovelace was privately schooled in mathematics and [[science]] by [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] and [[Mary Somerville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolley | first = Benjamin | year = 2002 | month = February | title = The Bride of Science: Romance, Reason, and Byron's Daughter | url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071388605/ | accessdate = 20 January 2009 | isbn = 0-333-72436-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her later tutors was the noted mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her remarkable mathematical abilities began to emerge,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turney p. 138&quot;/&gt; and her interest in mathematics dominated her life even after her marriage. In a letter to Lovelace's mother, De Morgan suggested that Lovelace's skill in mathematics could lead her to become &quot;an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Ada'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron]], daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]], who died in 1822 at the age of five. She did, however, have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh. Augusta Leigh purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when she was introduced at Court.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 1972 p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult years===
Lovelace knew [[Mary Somerville]], noted researcher and scientific author of the 19th century, who introduced her to Charles Babbage on 5 June 1833. Other acquaintances were [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Michael Faraday]].

By 1834, Lovelace was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people and was described by most people as being dainty. However, [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Lord Byron's friend, was the exception and he described her as &quot;a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 1972 pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Lovelace made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to the influence of her mother, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turney p. 139&quot;&gt;Turney 1972 p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 1835 she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King, 8th Baron King]], later [[Earl of Lovelace|1st Earl of Lovelace]] in 1838. Her full title for most of her married life was &quot;The Right Honourable the Countess of Lovelace&quot;. Their residence was a large estate at Ockham Park, in [[Ockham, Surrey]], along with another estate and a home in London. They had three children; [[Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham|Byron]] born 12 May 1836, Anne Isabella (called Annabella, later [[Lady Anne Blunt]]) born 22 September 1837 and [[Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace|Ralph Gordon]] born 2 July 1839. Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lovelace experienced &quot;a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turney p. 139&quot;/&gt;

In 1841, Lovelace and [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh|Medora Leigh]] (daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Lovelace's mother that Byron, her father, was also Medora's father.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 1972 p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1841, Lovelace wrote to her mother: &quot;I am not in the least ''astonished''. In fact you merely ''confirm'' what I have for ''years and years'' felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 1972 p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: &quot;I fear ''she'' is ''more inherently'' wicked than ''he'' ever was&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1961 p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prevent Lovelace's mother from attempting to destroy her daughter's image of her father, but instead drove her to attack Byron's image with greater intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 1972 p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Babbage===
Ada Lovelace met and corresponded with [[Charles Babbage]] on many occasions, including socially and in relation to Babbage's [[Difference Engine]] and [[Analytical Engine]]. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and writing skills. He called her &quot;The Enchantress of Numbers&quot;. In 1843 he wrote of her:&lt;ref&gt;Toole 1998, Acknowledgments.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Forget this world and all its troubles and if&lt;br /&gt;
possible its multitudinous Charlatans&amp;nbsp;— every thing&lt;br /&gt;
in short but the Enchantress of Numbers.}}

{{anchor|Ada_Byron's_notes_on_the_analytical_engine}}During a nine-month period in 1842–43, Lovelace translated Italian mathematician [[Luigi Menabrea]]'s memoir on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menabrea1843&quot;&gt;Menabrea 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; The notes are longer than the memoir itself and include (Section G), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]] with the Engine, which would have run correctly had the Analytical Engine been built. Based on this work, Lovelace is now widely credited with being the first [[computer programmer]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Annals of the History of Computing&quot;/&gt; and her method is recognised as the world's first [[computer program]].&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, J. (2011), ''The Information: a History, a Theory, a Flood,'' London, Fourth Estate, pp116-118&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biographers debate the extent of her original contributions. Dorothy Stein, author of ''Ada: A Life and a Legacy'', contends that the programs were mostly written by Babbage himself.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Ada'', pp. 92–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage wrote the following on the subject, in his ''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'' (1864).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Passages from the life of a philosopher |first=Charles|last=Babbage|year=1864|page=136|isbn=0-8135-2066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I then suggested that she add some notes to Menabrea's memoir, an idea which was immediately adopted. We discussed together the various illustrations that might be introduced: I suggested several but the selection was entirely her own. So also was the algebraic working out of the different problems, except, indeed, that relating to the numbers of Bernoulli, which I had offered to do to save Lady Lovelace the trouble. This she sent back to me for an amendment, having detected a grave mistake which I had made in the process.}}

The level of impact of Lovelace on Babbage's engines is difficult to resolve from Babbage's writings due to Babbage's tendency not to acknowledge (either orally or in writing) the influence of other people in his work.

Lovelace died at the age of thirty-six, on 27 November 1852,&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: December 1852 1a * MARYLEBONE&amp;nbsp;— Augusta Ada Lovelace&lt;/ref&gt; from [[uterine cancer]] and [[bloodletting]] by her physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Baum 1986 pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in [[Hucknall]], [[Nottingham]].

==First &quot;computer program&quot;==
In 1842 Charles Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his analytical engine. [[Federico Luigi, Conte Menabrea|Luigi Menabrea]], a young [[Italy|Italian]] [[engineer]], and future [[prime minister of Italy]], wrote up Babbage's lecture in [[French language|French]], and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève]] in October 1842.

Babbage asked the Countess of Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into [[English language|English]], subsequently requesting that she augment the notes she had added to the translation. Lady Lovelace spent most of a year doing this.  These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]'' and ''Taylor's [[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] &quot;AAL&quot;.

In 1953, over one hundred years after her death, Lady Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and Lady Lovelace's notes as a description of a [[computer]] and [[software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Fuegi | last2 = Francis | year = 2003 | pages = 16–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, the Countess describes an [[algorithm]] for the analytical engine to compute [[Bernoulli number]]s. It is considered the first algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and for this reason she is often cited in popular culture to be the first [[computer programmer]]. However, some authorities disagree with this perspective{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, as the analytical engine was a mechanical, rather than electronic, design for a computer and was never actually constructed to completion during Lovelace's lifetime. It has also been argued that the algorithm itself was not a program as such, and that Lovelace's notes were a continuation of Babbage's original work.

The computer language [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], created on behalf of the [[United States Department of Defense]], was named after Lovelace. The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980, and the [[United States Military Standard|Department of Defense Military Standard]] for the language, &quot;MIL-STD-1815&quot;, was given the number of the year of her birth. Since 1998, the [[British Computer Society]] has awarded a [[Lovelace Medal|medal]] in her name&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=nav.5822 | title = Lovelace Lecture &amp; Medal | publisher = BCS | accessdate = 2 March 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students of computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Leeds | url = http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/bcswomen | title = Undergraduate Lovelace Colloquium, BCSWomen | accessdate = 6 March 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular media, Lady Lovelace has been portrayed in the film ''[[Conceiving Ada]]'' and the [[steam punk]] [[novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]].

==Commemoration==
In 2009 and 2010, 24 March was commemorated by some as '''Ada Lovelace Day''', a day to celebrate the achievements of women in technology and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://findingada.com/about/ |title= What is Ada Lovelace Day?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:August Derleth portrait in later life.png|thumb|August Derleth.]]
'''August William Derleth''' (February 24, 1909 &amp;ndash; July 4, 1971) was an American writer and anthologist. Though best remembered as the first publisher of the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and for his own contributions to the so-called [[Cthulhu Mythos]] genre of [[Horror fiction|horror]], as well as his founding of the publisher [[Arkham House]] (which did much to bring supernatural fiction into print in hardcover in the US that had only been readily available in the UK), Derleth was a leading American [[Regionalism (literature)|regional writer]] of his day, as well as prolific in several other genres, including  [[historical fiction]], [[poetry]], [[detective fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[biography]].

A 1938 [[Guggenheim Fellow]], Derleth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious ''Sac Prairie Saga'', a series of fiction, historical fiction, poetry, and non-fiction naturalist works designed to memorialize life in the Wisconsin he knew. Derleth can also be considered a pioneering naturalist and conservationist in his writing.

==Life==
The son of William Julius Derleth and Rose Louise Volk, Derleth grew up in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;captimes2&quot;&gt;&quot;August Derleth Services Wednesday in Sauk City,&quot; ''Capital Times,'' July 6, 1971, p. 24, col. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in local parochial and public high school. Derleth wrote his first fiction at age 13. He was interested most in reading, and he made three trips to the library a week. He would save his money to buy books (his personal library exceeded 12,000 later on in life). Some of his biggest influences were [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essays, [[Walt Whitman]], [[H. L. Mencken]]'s [[The American Mercury]], [[Samuel Johnson]]'s [[The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Walter Scott]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s [[Walden]].

Forty rejected stories and three years later, according to anthologist Jim Stephens, he sold his first story, &quot;Bat's Belfry&quot;, to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Derleth wrote throughout his four years at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], where he received a [[Bachelor's Degree|B.A.]] in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;captimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Author August Derleth Dies|date=July 5, 1971|publisher=''Capital Times''|page=1, col. 6|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also served briefly as associate editor of Minneapolis-based [[Fawcett Publications]] ''[[Mystic Magazine]]''.

Returning to Sauk City in the summer of 1931, Derleth worked in a local canning factory and collaborated with childhood friend [[Mark Schorer]] (later Chairman of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] English Department). They rented a cabin, writing Gothic and other horror stories and selling them
to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Derleth won a place on the O'Brien Roll of Honor for ''Five Alone'', published in ''Place of Hawks'', but was first found in ''Pagany'' magazine.

As a result of his early work on the ''Sac Prairie Saga'', Derleth was awarded the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship; his sponsors were Helen C. White, Nobel Prize-winning novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] and poet [[Edgar Lee Masters]] of ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]'' fame. 

In the mid-1930s, Derleth organized a Ranger's Club for young people, served as clerk and president of the local [[Board of education|school board]], served as a parole officer, organized a local men's club and a [[parent-teacher association]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.derleth.org/autobiog.htm Derleth, August. &quot;An Autobiography.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also lectured in American regional literature at the University of Wisconsin and was a contributing editor of ''Outdoors Magazine''.

With longtime friend [[Donald Wandrei]], Derleth in 1939 founded [[Arkham House]].  Its initial objective was to publish the works of H.P Lovecraft, with whom Derleth had corresponded since his teenage years. At the same time, he began teaching a course in American Regional Literature at the University of Wisconsin.

In 1941, he became literary editor of ''[[The Capital Times]]'' newspaper in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], a post he held until his resignation in 1960. His hobbies included fencing, swimming, chess, [[philately]] and comic-strips (Derleth reportedly deployed the funding from his Guggenheim Fellowship to bind his comic book collection, most recently valued in the millions of dollars, rather than to travel abroad as the award intended.).  Derleth's true [[avocation]], however, was hiking the terrain of his native Wisconsin lands, and observing and recording nature with an expert eye.

Derleth once wrote of his writing methods, &quot;I write very swiftly, from 750,000 to a million words yearly, very little of it pulp material.&quot;

He was married April 6, 1953, to Sandra Evelyn Winters.  They divorced six years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;captimes1&quot; /&gt;  Derleth retained custody of the couple's two children, April Rose and Walden William. April earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1977. She became majority stockholder, President, and CEO of Arkham House in 1994. She remained in that capacity until her passing. She was known in the community as a naturalist and humanitarian. April passed away on March 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: April R. Derleth|url=http://www.sfsite.com/news/2011/03/22/obituary-april-r-derleth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.arkhamhouse.com/]

In 1960, Derleth began editing and publishing a magazine called ''Hawk and Whippoorwill'', dedicated to [[poetry|poems]] of man and nature.

Derleth died of a massive and sudden heart attack on July 4, 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Author August Derleth Dies|date=July 5, 1971|publisher=''Capital Times''|page=1, col. 6|quote=August Derleth, 62, famed Wisconsin author and publisher, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack.|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried in St. Aloysius Cemetery in Sauk City.&lt;ref name=&quot;captimes2&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:August Derleth in his office.jpeg|thumb|350px|Derleth at his typewriter.]]
Derleth wrote more than 150 short stories and more than 100 books during his lifetime.

===The ''Sac Prairie Saga''===
Derleth wrote an expansive series of novels, short stories, journals, poems, and other works about Sac Prairie (whose prototype is [[Sauk City]]). Derleth intended this series to comprise up to 50 novels telling the projected life-story of the region from the 19th century onwards, with analogies to [[Balzac]]'s ''[[La Comédie humaine|Human Comedy]]'' and [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.

This, and other early work by Derleth, made him a well known figure among the regional literary figures of his time: early [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Hamlin Garland]] and [[Zona Gale]], as well as Sinclair Lewis, the latter both an admirer and critic of Derleth.

As Edward Wagenknecht writes in ''Cavalcade of the American Novel'': &quot;What Mr. Derleth has that is lacking...in modern novelists generally, is a country. He belongs. He writes of a land and a people that are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. In his fictional world, there is a unity much deeper and more fundamental than anything that can be conferred by an ideology. It is clear, too, that he did not get the best, and most fictionally useful, part of his background material from research in the library; like Scott, in his Border novels, he gives, rather, the impression of having drunk it in with his mother's milk.&quot;

Jim Stephens, editor of ''An August Derleth Reader'', (1992), argues: &quot;what Derleth accomplished....was to gather a Wisconsin mythos which gave respect to the ancient fundament of our contemporary life.&quot;

The author inaugurated the ''Sac Pairie Saga'' with four novellas comprising ''Place of Hawks'', published by Loring &amp; Mussey in 1935. At publication, ''[[The Detroit News]]'' wrote: &quot;Certainly with this book Mr. Derleth may be added to the American writers of distinction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wandrei|first=Donald|title=100 books by August Derleth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c6ENAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Certainly+with+this+book+Mr.+Derleth+may+be+added+to+the+American+writers+of+distinction%22|accessdate=February 14, 2011|year=1962|publisher=[[Arkham House]]|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derleth's first novel, ''Still is the Summer Night'', was published two years later by the famous [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Charles Scribners']] editor [[Maxwell Perkins]], and was the second in his Sac Pairie Saga.

''Village Year'', the first in a series of journals–meditations on nature, Midwestern village American life, and more–was published in 1941 to praise from ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'': &quot;A book of instant sensitive responsiveness...recreates its scene with acuteness and beauty, and makes an unusual contribution to the Americana of the present day.&quot; The ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' observed that &quot;Derleth...deepens the value of his village setting by presenting in full the enduring natural background; with the people projected against this, the writing comes to have the quality of an old Flemish picture, humanity lively and amusing and loveable in the foreground and nature magnificent beyond.&quot; James Grey, writing in the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|St. Louis Dispatch]]'' concluded, &quot;Derleth has achieved a kind of prose equivalent of the ''Spoon River Anthology''.&quot;

In the same year, ''Evening in Spring'' was published by Charles Scribners &amp; Sons. This work Derleth considered among his finest. What ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]'' called &quot;this beautiful little love story,&quot; is an autobiographical novel of first love beset by small town religious bigotry. The work received critical praise: ''[[The New Yorker]]'' considered it a story told &quot;with tenderness and charm,&quot; while the ''Chicago Tribune''  concluded: &quot;It's as though he turned back the pages of an old diary and told, with rekindled emotion, of the pangs of pain and the sharp, clear sweetness of a boy's first love.&quot; Helen Constance White, wrote in ''The Capital Times'' that it was &quot;...the best articulated, the most fully disciplined of his stories.&quot;

These were followed in 1943 with ''Shadow of Night,'' a Scribners' novel of which ''[[Chicago Sun-Times|The Chicago Sun]]'' wrote: &quot;Structurally it has the perfection of a carved jewel...A psychological novel of the first order, and an adventure tale that is unique and inspiriting.&quot;

In November 1945, however, Derleth's work was attacked by his one-time admirer and mentor, Sinclair Lewis. Writing in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Lewis said, &quot;It is a proof of Mr. Derleth's merit that he makes one want to make the journey and see his particular Avalon: The [[Wisconsin River]] shining among its islands, and the castles of Baron Pierneau and Hercules Dousman.  He is a champion and a justification of regionalism.  Yet he is also a burly, bounding, bustling, self-confident, opinionated, and highly sweatered young man with faults so grievous that a melancholoy perusal of them may be of more value to apprentices than a study of his serious virtues.  If he could ever be persuaded that he isn't half as good as he thinks he is, if he would learn the art of sitting still and using a blue pencil, he might become twice as good as he thinks he is–which would about rank him with Homer.&quot; Derleth good humoredly reprinted the criticism along with a photograph of himself sans sweater, on the back cover of his 1948 country journal: ''Village Daybook''.

A lighter side to the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' is a series of quasi-autobiographical short stories known as the &quot;Gus Elker Stories,&quot; amusing tales of country life that [[Peter Ruber]], Derleth's last editor, said were &quot;...models of construction and...fused with some of the most memorable characters in American literature.&quot; Most were written between 1934 and the late 1940s, though the last, &quot;Tail of the Dog&quot;, was published in 1959 and won the ''Scholastic Magazine'' short story award for the year. The series was collected and republished in ''Country Matters'' in 1996.

&quot;Walden West,&quot; published in 1961, is considered by many Derleth's finest work.  This prose meditation is built out of the same fundamental material as the series of Sac Prairie journals, but is organized around three themes: &quot;the persistence of memory...the sounds and odors of the country...and Thoreau's observation that the 'mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.'&quot;  A blend of nature writing, philosophic musings, and careful observation of the people and place of &quot;Sac Prairie.&quot; Of this work, George Vukelich, author of &quot;North Country Notebook,&quot; writes: &quot;Derleth's ''Walden West'' is...the equal of Sherwood Anderson's ''Winesburg,Ohio'', Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'', and Edgar Lee Masters' ''Spoon River Anthology''.&quot;  This was followed eight years later by &quot;Return to Walden West,&quot; a work of similar quality, but with a more noticeable environmentalist edge to the writing, notes critic [[Norbert Blei]].

A close literary relative of the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' was Derleth's ''Wisconsin Saga'', which comprises several historical novels.

===Detective and mystery fiction===
Detective fiction represented another substantial body of Derleth's work. Most notable among this work was a series of 70 stories in affectionate pastiche of [[Sherlock Holmes]], whose creator, Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], he admired greatly. These included one published novel as well (''Mr. Fairlie's Final Journey''). The series features a (Sherlock Holmes-styled) British detective named [[Solar Pons]], of [[Praed Street]] in London. The series was greatly admired by such notable writers and critics of mystery and detective fiction as [[Ellery Queen]] ([[Frederic Dannay]]), [[Anthony Boucher]], [[Vincent Starrett]] and [[Howard Haycraft]].

In his 1944 volume ''The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes'', Ellery Queen wrote of Derleth's ''The Norcross Riddle'', an early Pons story: &quot;How many budding authors, not even old enough to vote, could have captured the spirit and atmosphere with as much fidelity?&quot; Queen adds, &quot;...and his choice of the euphonic Solar Pons is an appealing addition to the fascinating lore of Sherlockian nomenclature.&quot;  Vincent Starrett, in his foreword to the 1964 edition of ''The Casebook of Solar Pons'', wrote that the series is &quot;...as sparkling a galaxy of Sherlockian pastiches as we have had since the canonical entertainments came to an end.&quot;

Despite close similarities to Doyle's creation, Pons lived in the post-[[World War I]] era, in the decade of the 1920s. Though Derleth never wrote a Pons novel to equal ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'', editor Peter Ruber wrote: &quot;...Derleth produced more than a few Solar Pons stories almost as good as Sir Arthur's, and many that had better plot construction.&quot;

Although these stories were a form of diversion for Derleth, Ruber, who edited ''[[The Original Text Solar Pons Omnibus Edition]]'' (2000), argued: &quot;Because the stories were generally of such high quality, they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery ficton, rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless imitators of Sherlock Holmes.&quot;

Some of the stories were self-published, through a new imprint called &quot;[[Mycroft &amp; Moran]]&quot;, an appellation of humorous significance to Holmesian scholars.  For approximately a decade, an active supporting group was the Praed Street Irregulars, patterned after the [[Baker Street Irregulars]].

In 1946, Conan Doyle's two sons made some attempts to force Derleth to cease publishing the Solar Pons series, but the efforts were unsuccessful and eventually withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.batteredbox.com/AugustDerlethMycroft/FinalAdventureSolarPond.htm  ''THE FINAL ADVENTURES OF SOLAR PONS'', by August Derleth, Introduction by Peter Ruber]&lt;/ref&gt;

Derleth's mystery and detective fiction also included a series of works set in Sac Prairie and featuring Judge Peck as the central character.

===Youth and children's fiction===
Derleth wrote many and varied children's works, including biographies meant to introduce younger readers to explorer [[Jacques Marquette|Fr. Marquette]], as well as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].  Arguably most important among his works for younger readers, however, is the ''Steve and Sim Mystery Series''.  The ten-volume series is set in Sac Prairie of the 1920s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the ''Sac Prairie Saga'', as well as an extension of Derleth's body of mystery fiction.  Robert Hood, writing in the ''New York Times'' said: &quot;Steve and Sim, the major characters, are twentieth-century cousins of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; Derleth's minor characters, little gems of comic drawing.&quot; The first novel in the series, ''The Moon Tenders'', does, in fact, involve a rafting adventure down the [[Wisconsin River]], which led regional writer [[Jesse Stuart]] to suggest the novel was one that &quot;older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth.&quot; The connection to the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' was noted by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'': &quot;Once again a small midwest community in 1920s is depicted with perception, skill, and dry humor.&quot;

===Arkham House and the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;===
[[File:August Derleth portrait in youth.png|thumb|Derleth near the time he began working on the Cthulhu Mythos]]
Derleth was a correspondent and friend of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] – when Lovecraft wrote about &quot;le Comte d'Erlette&quot; in [[List of Works by H. P. Lovecraft|his fiction]], it was in homage to Derleth.  Derleth invented the term &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; to describe the fictional universe described in the series of stories shared by Lovecraft and other writers in his circle. Derleth's own writing emphasized the struggle between good and evil, in line with his own [[Christianity|Christian]] world view and in contrast with Lovecraft's depiction of an amoral universe. Derleth also treated Lovecraft's [[Old Ones]] as representatives of elemental forces, creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework.

When Lovecraft died in 1937, Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]] assembled a collection of Lovecraft's stories and tried to get them published. Existing publishers showed little interest, so Derleth and Wandrei founded [[Arkham House]] in 1939 for that purpose. The name of the company derived from Lovecraft's fictional town of [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]], which features in many of his stories. In 1939 Arkham House published ''[[The Outsider and Others]]'', a huge collection that contained most of Lovecraft's known short stories. Derleth and Wandrei soon expanded Arkham House and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book, ''[[Someone in the Dark]]'', a collection of some of Derleth's own horror stories, was published  in 1941.

Following Lovecraft's death, Derleth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by Lovecraft. These were published in ''Weird Tales'' and later in book form, under the byline &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and August Derleth&quot;, with Derleth calling himself a &quot;posthumous collaborator.&quot; This practice has raised objections in some quarters that Derleth simply used Lovecraft's name to market what was essentially his own fiction; [[S. T. Joshi]] refers to the &quot;posthumous collaborations&quot; as marking the beginning of &quot;perhaps the most disreputable phase of Derleth's activities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, ''H. P. Lovecraft: A Life'', Necronomicon Press 1996, p.638.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] fans and critics, such as [[Dirk W. Mosig]]&lt;ref&gt;Mosig, &quot;H. P. Lovecraft: Myth Maker&quot; (1976), collected in ''Mosig at Last'', Necronomicon Press 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[S. T. Joshi]],&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, ''H. P. Lovecraft: A Life'', Necronomicon Press 1996, pp. 403-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard L. Tierney]]&lt;ref&gt; &quot;The Derleth Mythos&quot; in Meade &amp; Penny Frierson (eds), ''HPL'' (1972) &lt;/ref&gt; were dissatisfied with Derleth's invention of the term ''Cthulhu Mythos'' (Lovecraft himself used ''Yog-Sothothery'') and his belief that Lovecraft's fiction had an overall pattern reflecting Derleth's own Christian world view.

Nevertheless, Derleth's founding of Arkham House and his successful effort to rescue Lovecraft from literary obscurity are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field. For instance, [[Ramsey Campbell]] has acknowledged Derleth's encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing career,&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''The Count of Thirty'' (Necronomicon Press 1993), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirby McCauley]] has cited Derleth and Arkham House as an inspiration for his own anthology, ''[[Dark Forces (book)|Dark Forces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby McCauley, Introduction, ''Dark Forces'' (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  Arkham House and Derleth published ''Dark Carnival'', the first book by [[Ray Bradbury]], as well. [[Brian Lumley]] cites the importance of Derleth to his own Lovecraftian work, and contends in a 2009 introduction to Derleth's work that he was &quot;...one of the first, finest, and most discerning editors and publishers of macabre fiction.&quot;

Important as was Derleth's work to rescue H.P. Lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of Lovecraft's death, Derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own; still frequently anthologized.  The best of this work, recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories–most of which were originally published in ''Weird Tales'', illustrates Derleth's original abilities in the genre.  While Derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts, the compilers of these four anthologies, including Ramsey Campbell, note that the stories still resonate after more than fifty years.

In 2009, [[The Library of America]] selected Derleth’s story ''The Panelled Room'' for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales.

===Other works===
Although Derleth was not a trained historian, he wrote many historical novels, as part of both the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' and the ''Wisconsin Saga''.  He also wrote history; arguably most notable among these was ''The Wisconsin: River of a Thousand Isles'', published in 1942.  The work was one in a series entitled &quot;The Rivers of America&quot;, conceived by writer Constance Lindsay Skinner in the [[Great Depression]] as a series that would connect Americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation. Skinner wanted the series to be written by artists, not academicians. Derleth, while not a professional historian, was, according to former Wisconsin state historian William F. Thompson, &quot;...a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals... .&quot;  In the foreword to the 1985 reissue of the work by [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], Thompson concluded: &quot;No other writer, of whatever background or training, knew and understood his particular 'corner of the earth' better than August Derleth.&quot;

Derleth wrote several volumes of poems, as well as biographies of [[Zona Gale]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].

He also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early 20th century comics, such as ''[[Buster Brown]]'', ''[[Little Nemo in Slumberland]]'', and ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'', as well as a book of children's poetry entitled ''A Boy's Way''. Derleth also wrote under the [[nom de plume]]s Stephen Grendon, Kenyon Holmes and Tally Mason.

Derleth's papers and comic book collection (valued at a considerable sum upon his death) were donated to the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] in Madison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=9140&amp;search_term=derleth Derleth, August, 1909 - 1971&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alps from space.png|thumb|right|260px|The Alps from space in 2002.]]
The '''Alps''' ({{lang-de|Alpen}}; {{lang-it|Alpi}}; {{lang-lmo|Alp}}; {{lang-fr|Alpes}}; {{lang-oc|Aups/Alps}}; {{lang-rm|Alps}}; {{lang-sl|Alpe}})  is one of the great [[mountain range]] systems of [[Europe]], stretching from [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]] in the east through [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Germany]] to [[France]] in the west.

The highest mountain in the Alps is [[Mont Blanc]], at {{Convert|4810.45|m|ft|0}},&lt;ref name=&quot;smh4810.45&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/environment/mont-blanc-shrinks-by-45cm-in-two-years-20091106-i0kk.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Mont Blanc shrinks by 45cm in two years | date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Italian–French border. All the main peaks of the Alps can be found in the [[list of mountains of the Alps]] and [[list of Alpine peaks by prominence]].

==Etymology==

The English name ''Alps'' was taken via [[French language|French]] from [[Latin]] ''Alpes'', which may be ultimately cognate with Latin ''albus'' (&quot;white&quot;). The German ''Albe'', ''Alpe'' or ''Alp'' (f., [[Old High German]] ''alpâ'', plural ''alpûn''), the Occitan ''Alp''/''Aup''&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Mistral]], ''Lou Tresor dóu Felibrige'': &quot;AUP, ALP: Alpe, haute montagne particulièrement propre à faire paître les troupeaux&quot;, high mountain particularly suited for grazing herds.&lt;/ref&gt; and the French ''Alpage'' or ''Alpe'' in the singular mean &quot;[[alpine pasture]]&quot;, and only in the plural may also refer to the mountain range as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm]], ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'', s.v. &quot;Albe&quot;, &quot;Alpe&quot;. The original meaning being &quot;white&quot; (in reference to the [[permanent snow]]. The term may be common [[Italo-Celtic]], since [[Celtic languages]] also have terms for high mountains derived from ''alp''. German ''Alpen'' is the accusative in origin, but was made the nominative in Modern German, whence also ''Alm''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the Alps}}


The highest peak of the Western Alps is [[Mont Blanc]], at {{Convert|4810.45|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh4810.45&quot; /&gt; The highest peak of the Eastern Alps is [[Piz Bernina]] at {{convert|4049|m|ft|0}}. [[Monte Rosa]] at {{convert|4634|m|ft|0}}. and [[Ortler]],&lt;ref&gt;Excluding the [[Piz Zupò]] and [[Piz Roseg]] located in the Bernina range, close to Piz Bernina.&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|3905|m|ft|0}}, are the second-highest, respectively.

The '''Eastern Alps''' is commonly subdivided according to the different [[lithology]] (rock composition) of the more central parts of the Alps and the groups at its northern and southern fringes:

* [[Northern Limestone Alps]] (from the [[Wienerwald]] to [[Bregenzerwald]]), including the [[Flyschzone]]; peaks up to {{convert|3000|m|ft|-1}}
* [[Central Eastern Alps]] (Austria, Switzerland); peaks up to {{convert|4050|m|ft|-1}}
* [[Southern Limestone Alps]] (Austria, Italy, Slovenia)
The border between the Central Alps and the Southern Limestone Alps is the [[Periadriatic Seam]]. The Northern Limestone Alps are separated from the Central Eastern Alps by the [[Greywacke zone]].

The '''Western Alps''' is commonly subdivided with respect to [[geography]]:
* [[Ligurian Alps]]
* [[Maritime Alps]]
* [[Cottian Alps]]
* [[Dauphiné Alps]]
* [[Graian Alps]]
* [[Chablais Alps]]
* [[Pennine Alps]]
* [[Bernese Alps]]
* [[Lepontine Alps]]
* [[Glarus Alps]]
* [[Appenzell Alps]].
Series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chain of the Alps, including the [[French Prealps]]. (See [[Geography of the Alps|Alpine geography]].)

The geologic subdivision is different and makes no difference between the Western and Eastern Alps: the [[Helvetic nappes|Helveticum]] in the north, the [[Penninic nappes|Penninicum]] and [[Austroalpine nappes|Austroalpine system]] in the center and, south of the Periadriatic Seam, the [[Southern Alps (geology)|Southern Alpine system]] and parts of the [[Dinarides]] (see [[Geology of the Alps|Alpine geology]]). Geographically, the [[Jura Mountains]] do not belong to the Alps; geologically, however, they do.

===Main chain===
{{main|Main chain of the Alps}}
[[File:Hauteroute.jpg|thumb|The watershed between Italy and Switzerland (View from [[Tête Blanche]], Pennine Alps)]]
The secondary chain of the Alps follows the [[drainage divide|watershed]] from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Wienerwald]], passing over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to [[Col de Tende]] it runs westwards, before turning to the northwest and then, near the [[Colle della Maddalena]], to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-northeast, a heading it follows until its end near [[Vienna]].

===Principal passes===
{{main|Principal passes of the Alps}}

The Alps does not form an impassable barrier; It has been traversed for war and [[commerce]], and later by [[pilgrim]]s, students and tourists. Crossing places by road, train or foot are called ''passes''. These are depressions in the mountains into which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones.

==Four-thousanders==
{{see also|List of Alpine Four-thousanders}}
The [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] (UIAA) has defined a list of 82 &quot;official&quot; Alpine 4,000-metre (13,123&amp;nbsp;ft) summits. The list contains many subpeaks with little [[Topographic prominence|prominence]], but important for [[mountaineering]]. Here are the twelve [[four-thousanders]] with at least 1&amp;nbsp;km prominence.

[[Karl Blodig]] was the first person to climb all the major four-thousand metre peaks, circa 1900.

==Geology and orogeny==
{{main|Geology of the Alps|Alpine orogeny}}
&lt;!-- Copied from &quot;Geology of the Alps&quot;: can't this be done automatically? --&gt;
The Alps form a part of a [[Tertiary]] [[orogeny|orogenic]] belt of mountain chains, called the [[Alpide belt]], that stretches through southern Europe and Asia from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] all the way to the [[Himalayas]]. This belt of mountain chains was formed during the [[Alpine orogeny]]. A gap in these mountain chains in central Europe separates the Alps from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] off to the east. Orogeny took place continuously and [[tectonics|tectonic]] [[subsidence]] is to blame for the gaps in between.

[[File:MassifMontBlanc7438.JPG|thumb|left|The cristalline basement of the [[Mont Blanc Massif]]]]
The Alps arose as a result of the collision of the [[African plate|African]] and [[Eurasian plate|European]] [[tectonic plate]]s, in which the western part of the [[Tethys Ocean]], which was formerly in between these continents, disappeared. Enormous [[Compressive stress|stress]] was exerted on [[sediment]]s of the [[Tethys Ocean]] basin and its [[Mesozoic]] and early [[Cenozoic]] [[Stratum|strata]] were pushed against the stable [[Eurasia]]n landmass by the northward-moving [[Africa]]n landmass. Most of this occurred during the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] epochs. The pressure formed great recumbent folds, or ''[[nappe]]s'', that rose out of what had become the [[Tethys Sea]] and pushed northward, often breaking and sliding one over the other to form gigantic [[thrust fault]]s. [[basement (geology)|Crystalline basement]] rocks, which are exposed in the higher central regions, are the rocks forming [[Mont Blanc]], the [[Matterhorn]], and high peaks in the [[Pennine Alps]] and [[Hohe Tauern]].

The formation of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is a more recent development, and does not mark the northern shore of the African landmass.

==Climate==
{{main|Climate of the Alps|High Alps}}

The Alps is split into five climate zones, each with a different kind of environment. The climate, plant life and animal life vary on different sections or zones of the mountain. 

[[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|right|Pine trees above the [[Aletsch Glacier]], [[Valais]]]]

# The section of the Alps that is above 3,000 metres is called the névé zone.  This area, which has the coldest climate, is permanently coated with compressed snow.  Plants are therefore scarce in the névé zone.
# The [[alpine tundra|alpine zone]] lies between the height of 2,000 and 3,000 metres.  This zone is less cold than in the névé zone.  Wildflowers and grasses grow here.
# Just below the alpine zone is the [[subalpine zone]], 1,500 to 2,000 metres high.  Forests of fir trees and spruce trees grow in the subalpine zone as the temperature slowly goes up.
# At about 1,000 to 1,500 metres high is the arable zone.  Millions of oak trees sprout in this area.  This is also where farming takes place.
# Below 1,000 metres are the lowlands.  Here, a larger variety of plants are produced.  Aside from plants, villages are also in the lowlands because the temperature is more bearable for both humans and animals.

The Alps is a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain. Elevations around the world which have cold climates similar to those found in [[polar region|polar]] areas have been called [[Alpine climate|Alpine]]. A rise from [[sea level]] into the upper regions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] causes the [[temperature]] to decrease (see [[adiabatic lapse rate]]). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of heat, often accompanied by the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in the form of [[snow]] or [[rain]].

==Political and cultural history==
{{main|History of the Alps}}

[[File:Innsbr.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Inn river|Inn]] valley at [[Innsbruck]], Tyrol]]
Little is known of the early dwellers of the Alps, save from scanty accounts preserved  by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historians and geographers.  A few details have come down to us of the conquest of many of the Alpine tribes by [[Augustus]]. Also, recent research into [[Mitochondrial DNA]] indicates that MtDNA [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|Haplogroup K]] very likely originated in or near the southeastern Alps approximately 12–15,000 years ago.

During the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC, the [[Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal]] successfully [[Hannibal crossing the Alps|crossed the Alps]] along with an army numbering 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel&quot;&gt;Lancel, Serge, ''Hannibal'', p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=6uVh2FH-LF4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA71,M1 71]&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in [[ancient warfare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel&quot;/&gt;

Much of the Alpine region was gradually settled by [[Germanic tribes]] ([[Langobards]], [[Alemanni]], [[Bavarii]]) from the 6th to the 13th centuries, the latest expansion corresponding to the [[Walser]] migrations.

Not until after the final breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the 10th and 11th century can the local history of the Alps be traced out.

==Exploration==
{{main|Exploration of the High Alps}}

The higher regions of the Alps were long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys even when Alpine travellers (as distinguished from Alpine climbers) began to visit these valleys. The two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were H.B. de Saussure (1740–1799) in the [[Pennine Alps]] and the Benedictine monk of [[Disentis]] [[Placidus a Spescha]] (1752–1833), most of whose ascents were made before 1806 in the valleys at the sources of the [[Rhine]].

==Travel and tourism==
{{see|Tourism in Austria|Tourism in Switzerland|Tourism in Slovenia}}
[[File:St.Bartholomä.jpg|thumb|left|[[Königssee]], Bavaria]]
The Alps are popular both in summer and in winter as a destination for sightseeing and sports. [[Winter sports]] (Alpine and Nordic skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing, snowshoeing, ski tours) can be practised in most regions from December to April. In summer, the Alps are popular with hikers, mountain bikers, paragliders, mountaineers, while many alpine lakes attract swimmers, sailors and surfers. The lower regions and larger towns of the Alps are well served by [[motorways]] and [[main road]]s, but higher [[mountain pass|passes]] and by-roads can be treacherous even in summer. Many passes are closed in winter. A multitude of airports around the Alps (and some within), as well as long-distance rail links from all neighbouring countries, afford large numbers of travellers easy access from abroad. The Alps typically see more than 50 million visitors a year.

==Flora==
{{main|Flora of the Alps}}
A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief [[deciduous]] trees—[[oak]], [[beech]], [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[sycamore maple]].  These do not reach exactly to the same elevation, nor are they often found growing together; but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the presence of wild herbaceous vegetation.  This limit usually lies about {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1}} above the sea on the north side of the Alps, but on the southern slopes it often rises to {{convert|1500|m|ft|-1}}, sometimes even to {{convert|1700|m|ft|-1}}.

This region is not always marked by the presence of the characteristic trees. Human interference has nearly exterminated them in many areas, and, except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, forests of deciduous trees are rarely found. In many districts where such woods once existed, they have been replaced by the [[Scots pine]] and [[Norway spruce]], which are less sensitive to the ravages of goats who are the worst enemies of such trees.

Above the forestry, there is often a band of short pine trees (''[[Pinus mugo]]''), which is in turn superseded by dwarf [[shrub]]s, typically ''[[Rhododendron ferrugineum]]'' (on acid soils) or ''[[Rhododendron hirsutum]]'' (on alkaline soils). Above this is the [[alpine meadow]], and even higher, the vegetation becomes more and more sparse. At these higher altitudes, the plants tend to form isolated cushions. In the Alps, several species of flowering plants have been recorded above {{convert|4000|m|ft|-1}}, including ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]'', ''[[Androsace alpina]]'' and ''[[Saxifraga biflora]]''.

'''Albert Camus''' ({{IPA-fr|albɛʁ kamy|-|Albert Camus.ogg}}; 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French author, journalist, and key philosopher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/|Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Existentialism |First published Mon 23 Aug 2004; substantive revision Mon 11 Oct 2010|lines=5,6 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the 20th-century. In 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons within the Revolutionary Union Movement, which was opposed to some tendencies of the Surrealist movement of [[André Breton]].

Camus was awarded the 1957 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]  &quot;for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1957|publisher=Nobelprize|date=7 October 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1957/|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], and the first African-born writer to receive the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lennon |first=Peter |title=''Camus and His Women'' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1997/oct/15/biography.albertcamus |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=15 October 1997 |accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the shortest-lived of any Nobel literature laureate to date, having died in an automobile accident just over two years after receiving the award.

Although often cited as a proponent of [[existentialism]], the philosophy with which Camus was associated during his own lifetime, he rejected this particular label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon|title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=074251241X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 1945, Camus rejected any ideological associations: &quot;No, I am not an existentialist. [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and I are always surprised to see our names linked...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Les Nouvelles littéraires&quot;, 15 November 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, his views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He wrote in his essay &quot;[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]&quot; that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of [[nihilism]] while still delving deeply into individual freedom.

== Early years ==

Albert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in [[Dréan]] (then known as Mondovi) in [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]] to a [[Pied-Noir]] settler family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91464/Albert-Camus |title=Albert Camus&amp;nbsp;— Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pied-Noir was a term used to refer to European colonists of French Algeria until [[Algerian independence]] in 1962. His mother was of Spanish descent and was half-deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Lottman 1979, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;  His father Lucien, a poor agricultural worker, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]], while serving as a member of the [[Zouave]] infantry regiment. Camus and his mother lived in poor conditions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]].

In 1923, the bright boy was accepted into the [[lycée]] and eventually he was admitted to the [[University of Algiers]]. After he contracted [[tuberculosis]] (TB) in 1930, he had to end his [[Association football|football]] activities (he had been a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the university team) and reduce his studies to part-time. To earn money, he also took odd jobs: as private tutor, car parts clerk and assistant at the [[Meteorological]] Institute. He completed his ''licence de philosophie'' (BA) in 1935; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on [[Plotinus]], ''Néo-Platonisme et Pensée Chrétienne'' (Neo-Platonism and Christian Thought), for his ''diplôme d'études supérieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] thesis). {{French literature (small)}}

Camus joined the [[French Communist Party]] in the spring of 1935, seeing it as a way to &quot;fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria.&quot; He did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read ''Das Kapital'', but did write that &quot;[w]e might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot;&gt;Todd, O ''Albert Camus: A Life'', pp. 37, 250, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1998; Carroll &amp; Graf, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of the [[Algerian People's Party]] (''Le Parti du Peuple Algérien''), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades. As a result, in 1937 he was denounced as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] and expelled from the party. Camus went on to be associated with the French [[anarchism|anarchist]] movement.

The anarchist [[Andre Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the ''Cercle des Étudiants Anarchistes'' (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''Le Libertaire'', ''La révolution Proletarienne'' and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]''(Worker Solidarity) (the organ of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]])(National Confederation of Labor). Camus stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. He again allied with the anarchists in 1956, first in support of the workers’ uprising in [[Poznan]], Poland, and then later in the year with the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].

In 1934, he married Simone Hie, a [[morphine]] addict, but the marriage ended as a consequence of infidelities on both sides. In 1935, he founded ''Théâtre du Travail'' (Worker's Theatre), renamed ''Théâtre de l'Equipe'' (Team's Theatre) in 1937. It lasted until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper, ''Alger-Républicain''. His work included an account of the peasants who lived in [[Kabylie]] in poor conditions, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, ''Soir-Republicain''. He was rejected by the French army because of his TB.

In 1940, Camus married [[Francine Faure]], a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved her, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after Francine gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, on 5 September 1945, he continued to joke to friends that he was not cut out for marriage. Camus conducted numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress [[Maria Casares]]. In the same year, Camus began to work for ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' magazine. In the first stage of [[World War II]], the so-called [[Phoney War]], Camus was a [[pacifism|pacifist]]. In Paris during the Wehrmacht occupation, on 15 December 1941, Camus witnessed the execution of [[Gabriel Péri]]; it crystallized his revolt against the Germans. He moved to [[Bordeaux]] with the rest of the staff of ''Paris-Soir''. In the same year he finished his first books, ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. He returned briefly to [[Oran]], Algeria in 1942.

== Literary career ==

During the war Camus joined the [[French Resistance]] cell ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the ''[[pseudonym|nom de guerre]]'' ''Beauchard''. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943 and was in Paris when [[the Allies]] liberated the city, where he reported on the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 8 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition to the United States' dropping [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bomb in Hiroshima]]. He resigned from ''Combat'' in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. It was then that he became acquainted with Jean-Paul Sartre.

After the war, Camus began frequenting the [[Café de Flore]] on the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned [[left-wing politics|left]], politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] and eventually alienated Sartre.

In 1949 his TB returned and Camus lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951 he published ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed him and he began to translate plays.

Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' and incorporated into many of his other works, such as ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Plague]]''. Despite his split from his &quot;study partner&quot;, Sartre, some still argue that Camus falls into the [[existentialist]] camp. He specifically rejected that label in his essay &quot;Enigma&quot; and elsewhere (see: ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus''). The current confusion arises in part because many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of Camus's ''practical'' ideas (see: ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''). But, his personal understanding of the world (e.g. &quot;a benign indifference&quot;, in ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress (e.g. vanquishing the &quot;adolescent furies&quot; of history and society, in ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'') undoubtedly set him apart.

In the 1950s Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952 he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain as a member under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. In 1953 he criticized [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods to crush a workers' strike in [[East Berlin]]. In 1956 he protested against similar methods in Poland (protests in [[Poznań]]) and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October.

[[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.1.JPG|thumb|The monument to Camus built in the small town of [[Villeblevin]], France where he died in an automobile accident on 4 January 1960]]

Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment.

[[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|thumb|left|The bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France. The plaque reads: &quot;From the General Council of the Yonne Department, in homage to the writer Albert Camus whose remains laid in vigil at the Villeblevin town hall on the night of 4 to 5 January 1960.&quot;]]

When the [[Algerian War]] began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''[[pied-noir]]s'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'.&lt;ref&gt;''Actuelles III: Chroniques Algeriennes'', 1939–58&lt;/ref&gt; Although favouring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the ''pied-noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.

From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''. In 1957 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] &quot;for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times&quot;, not for his novel ''[[The Fall (novel)|The Fall]]'', published the previous year, but for his writings against capital punishment in the essay &quot;[[Reflections on the Guillotine|Réflexions sur la Guillotine]]&quot; (Reflections on the Guillotine). When he spoke to students at the [[University of Stockholm]], he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals.

== Revolutionary Union Movement and Europe ==

As he wrote in ''L'Homme révolté'' (in the chapter about &quot;The Thought on Midday&quot;, Camus was a follower of the ancient Greek 'Solar Tradition' (la ''pensée solaire''). In 1947–48 he founded the Revolutionary Union Movement (''Groupes de liaison internationale'' – GLI)&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot; /&gt; a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (''Syndicalisme révolutionnaire''). According to Olivier Todd, in his biography, 'Albert Camus, une vie', it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the Surrealist movement of André Breton. For more, see the book : ''Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement révolutionnaire internationale'' by Christian Gras).

His colleagues were Nicolas Lazarévitch, [[Louis Mercier]], Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, Jean de Boë (see the article: &quot;Nicolas Lazarévitch, Itinéraire d'un syndicaliste révolutionnaire&quot; by Sylvain Boulouque in the review Communisme, n° 61, 2000). His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of André Breton.

From 1943, Albert Camus had correspondence with [[Altiero Spinelli]] who founded the [[European Federalist Movement]] in Milan—see [[Ventotene Manifesto]] and the book &quot;Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati&quot;, Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus.

In 1944 Camus founded the &quot;French Committee for the European Federation&quot; (''Comité Français pour la Féderation Européene'' – CFFE) declaring that Europe &quot;can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation.&quot;

From 22–25 March 1945, the first conference of the European Federalist Movement was organised in Paris with the participation of Albert Camus, George Orwell, [[Emmanuel Mounier]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[André Philip]], [[Daniel Mayer]], [[François Bondy]] and Altiero Spinelli (see the book ''The Biography of Europe'' by Pan Drakopoulos). This specific branch of the [[European Federalist Movement]] disintegrated in 1957 after [[Winston Churchill]]'s ideas about the European integration rose to dominance.

== Death ==

Camus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46 in a car accident near [[Sens]], in a place named ''Le Grand Fossard'' in the small town of [[Villeblevin]]. In his coat pocket lay an unused train ticket. He had planned to travel by train with his wife and children, but at the last minute accepted his publisher's proposal to travel with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raimes.com/seminar.htm |title=KIAD MA in Fine Art: a student run seminar |publisher=Raimes.com |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|Albert Camus' gravestone]]
The driver of the [[Facel Vega]] car, Michel Gallimard, his publisher and close friend, also died in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=de Gaudemar |first=Antoine |title= This one's had a good start born in the middle of a move |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1994/apr/16/fiction.albertcamus |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=16 April 1994 |accessdate=21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, [[Lourmarin]], Vaucluse, Côte d'Azur, France.

He was survived by his wife and twin children, Catherine and Jean, who hold the copyrights to his work.

Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled ''[[A Happy Death]]'' (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'''s Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''[[The First Man]]'' (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in [[Algeria]].

== Summary of Absurdism ==

Many writers have addressed the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd is and what comprises its importance. For example, [[Sartre]] recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while [[Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching God rationally. Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a &quot;philosopher of the absurd&quot;. He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus''). To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the '''Paradox of the Absurd''', when referring to &quot;Camus' Absurd&quot;.

His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''The Two Sides Of The Coin'') in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''Nuptials''), in 1938. In these essays Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life as [[The Stranger (novel)|''L'Étranger'' (''The Stranger'')]]. In the same year he released [[The Myth of Sisyphus|''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus'')]], a literary essay on the Absurd. He also wrote a play about [[Caligula]], a Roman Emperor, pursuing an absurd logic. The play was not performed until 1945.

The turning point in Camus' attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Libération'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libertés'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres à un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death]]''.

== Ideas on the Absurd ==

In his essays Camus presented the reader with dualisms: happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. His aim was to emphasize the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality. He did this not to be morbid, but to reflect a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In ''Le Mythe'', this dualism becomes a paradox: We value our lives and existence so greatly, but at the same time we know we will eventually die, and ultimately our endeavours are meaningless. While we can live with a dualism (''I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come''), we cannot live with the paradox (''I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless''). In ''Le Mythe'', Camus was interested in how we experience the Absurd and how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?

In ''Le Mythe'', Camus suggests that 'creation of meaning', would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort. But Camus wants to know if he can live with what logic and lucidity has uncovered – if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more. Creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem. He gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap. The alternative option, namely suicide, would entail another kind of leap, where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms (the human being). Camus points out, however, that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life, and that it simply evades the problem yet again. Camus concludes, that we must instead 'entertain' both death and the absurd, while never agreeing to its terms.  

Meursault, the absurdist hero of ''L'Étranger,'' has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed. Caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, while Camus possibly suggests that Caligula's absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts Meursault's final moments.

Camus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected nihilism as a valid response. &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning.&quot; ''Second Letter to a German Friend'', December 1943.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Camus' understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus, though they are most likely sources of 'relative' versus 'absolute' meaning.

=== Religious beliefs and Absurdism ===

While writing his thesis on [[Plotinus]] and Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], Camus became very strongly influenced by their works, especially that of St. Augustine. In his work, ''Confessions'' (consisting of 13 books), Augustine promotes the idea of a connection between God and the rest of the world. Camus identified with the idea that a personal experience could become a reference point for his philosophical and literary writings. Although he considered himself an [[atheist]], Camus later came to tout the idea that the absence of religious belief can simultaneously be accompanied by a longing for &quot;salvation and meaning&quot;. This line of thinking presented an ostensible paradox and became a major thread in defining the idea of absurdism in Camus' writings.&lt;ref&gt;Influence of Saint Augustine on Camus http://www.infloox.com/influence?id=3d7cfff&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition to totalitarianism ==

Throughout his life, Camus spoke out against and actively opposed [[totalitarianism]] in its many forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0397camu.php |title=Interview with Catherine Camus |publisher=Spikemagazine.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, Camus was active within the French Resistance to the German occupation of France during World War II, even directing the famous Resistance journal, ''Combat''. On the French collaboration with [[Nazi]] occupiers he wrote:

: Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:becLSqP2AvMJ:query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html%3Fres%3D9806EED9113FF93AA25751C1A961958260%26sec%3D%26spon%3D%26pagewanted%3Dall+Now+the+only+moral+value+is+courage,+which+is+useful+here+for+judging+the+puppets+and+chatterboxes&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk |title=In Camus' notebooks and letters, as quoted in ',Albert Camus A Life', By Olivier Todd |publisher=64.233.183.104 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus' well-known falling out with Sartre is linked to this opposition to totalitarianism. Camus detected a reflexive totalitarianism in the [[mass politics]] espoused by Sartre in the name of radical [[Marxism]]. This was apparent in his work ''L'Homme Révolté'' (''The Rebel'') which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics. Camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the [[Soviet Union]], a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech, ''[[The Blood of the Hungarians]]'', commemorating the anniversary of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army.

=== In ''The Stranger'' ===

In ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'', Albert Camus characterizes his justification of the absurd through the experiences of a protagonist who simply does not conform to the system. His inherent honesty disturbs the status quo; Meursault's inability to lie cannot seamlessly integrate him within society. This, in turn, threatens the simple fabric of human mannerisms expected in a structurally ordered society. Consequently, the punishment for his crime is not decided on the basis of murder, but rather for the startling indifference toward his mother's recent death. Even after a conflicting spiritual discussion with a pastor inciting Meursault to consider a possible path towards redemption, the latter still refuses to &quot;accept&quot; salvation and symbolizes his ultimatum by embracing the &quot;gentle indifference of the world&quot; – an act which only furthers his ostracism from a society incapable of realizing his seemingly inhumane behaviour.

=== In ''The Plague'' ===

The [[Plague (disease)|plague]] is an undeniable part of life. As posited in ''The Plague'', it is omnipresent, just like death was always an impeding factor in ''The Stranger''. Albert Camus once again questions the meaning of the moral concepts justifying humanity and human suffering within a religious framework. For Camus, the rationale behind Christian doctrine is useless; as mortal beings, we cannot successfully rationalize the impending and inescapable death sentence forced upon every human. The plague, which befalls Oran, is a concrete and tangible facilitator of death. Ultimately, the plague enables people to understand that their individual suffering is meaningless. As the epidemic &quot;evolves&quot; within the seasons, so do the citizens of Oran, who instead of willfully giving up to a disease they have no control over, decide to fight against their impending death, thus unwillingly creating optimism in the midst of hopelessness. This is where Camus channels his thoughts behind the importance of solidarity: although the plague is still primarily an agent of death, it provides the uncanny opportunity for people to realize that individual suffering is absurd. In the midst of complete suffering, the challenging response adopted by the majority of the citizens of Oran demonstrates an inexplicable humanistic connection between distraught and distant characters. Only by making the choice to fight an irreversible epidemic are people able to create the ever-lacking meaning to a life destined for execution from the moment of its creation.

== Football ==

Camus was once asked by his friend Charles Poncet which he preferred, football or the theatre. Camus is said to have replied, &quot;Football, without hesitation.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rhybma&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camus-society.com/camus-football.html |title=Albert Camus and football |publisher=The Albert Camus Society of the UK|accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus played as goalkeeper for [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] (RUA won both the [[North African Champions Cup]] and the [[North African Cup]] twice each in the 1930s) junior team from 1928–30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotpawn.com/board/showthread.php?threadid=2803 |title=General : Yan!! Camus |publisher=RedHotPawn.com |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.muohio.edu/shermalw/honors_2001_fall/honors_papers_2000/lattal.html |title=Ashley Lattal's Paper: Albert Camus |publisher=Users.muohio.edu |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In match reports Camus would often attract positive comment for playing with passion and courage. Any aspirations in football disappeared at age 17, upon contracting tuberculosis—then incurable, Camus was bedridden for long and painful periods.

When Camus was asked in the 1950s by an alumni sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, his response included the following:

: After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RUA.&lt;ref name = &quot;rhybma&quot;/&gt;

Camus was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays, the principle of sticking up for your friends, of valuing bravery and fair-play. Camus' belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over-complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are, potentially to serve their own needs.

'''Agatha Christie''', [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]], (15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976), was a British  [[crime writer]] of [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], and [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. She also wrote [[romance novel|romances]] under the name '''Mary Westmacott''', but she is best remembered for her 80 detective novels—especially those featuring [[Hercule Poirot]] and [[Miss Jane Marple]]—and her successful West End theatre plays.

According to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'', Christie is the best-selling writer of books of all time and, with [[William Shakespeare]], the best-selling author of any kind. She has sold roughly four [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] copies of her novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117776459.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1|title=Agatha Christie gets a clue for filmmakers|last=Flemming|first=Michael|date=15 February 2000|publisher=Variety|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Index Translationum]], Christie is the most translated individual author, with only the collective corporate works of [[Walt Disney Productions]] surpassing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://databases.unesco.org/xtrans/stat/xTransStat.a?VL1=A&amp;top=50&amp;lg=0|title=Statistics on whole Index Translationum database|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her books have been translated into at least 103 languages.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' (Sterling Pub. Co., 1976), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie's stage play ''[[The Mousetrap]]'' holds the record for the longest initial run: it opened at the [[Ambassadors Theatre]] in London on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1952 and as of 2011 is still running after more than 23,000 performances. In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s highest honour, the [[Mystery Writers of America#Grand Master Award|Grand Master Award]], and in the same year ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' was given an [[Edgar Award]] by the MWA for Best Play. Most of her books and [[short story|short stories]] have been filmed, some many times over (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' and ''[[4.50 From Paddington]]'' for instance), and many have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics.

In 1968, Booker Books, a subsidiary of the agri-industrial conglomerate [[Booker-McConnell]], bought a 51 percent stake in [[Agatha Christie Ltd.|Agatha Christie Limited]], the private company that Christie had set up for tax purposes. Booker later increased its stake to 64 percent. In 1998, Booker sold its shares to [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]], a company whose portfolio also includes the literary estates of [[Enid Blyton]] and [[Dennis Wheatley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chorion.co.uk/ |title=Chorion |publisher=Chorion |date= |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a 5,000-word story entitled ''The Incident of the Dog's Ball'' was found in the attic of the author's daughter. This story was the original version of the novel ''[[Dumb Witness]]''. It was published in Britain in September 2009 in John Curran's ''Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years Of Mysteries'', alongside another newly discovered Poirot story called ''The Capture of Cerberus'' (a story with the same title, but a different plot, to that published in ''The Labours Of Hercules'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/jun/05/two-unpublished-poirot-stories-found |title=Two unpublished Poirot short stories found|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=5 June 2009|accessdate=12 September 2010 | location=London | first1=Maev | last1=Kennedy | first2=Katie | last2=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November 2009, [[Reuters]] announced that ''The Incident of the Dog's Ball'' will be published by ''The [[Strand Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rueters 2009-11-10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=Burton Frierson|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5A95OG20091110|title=Lost Agatha Christie story to be published|publisher=Reuters|date=10 November 2009|accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
===Early life and first marriage===
Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born in [[Torquay]], Devon, England, UK. Her mother, Clarissa Margaret Boehmer, was the daughter of a [[British Army]] captain&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Janet. ''Agatha Christie, A Biography''. (Page 2) Collins, 1984 ISBN 0-00-216330-6&lt;/ref&gt; but had been sent as a child to live with her own mother's sister, who was the second wife of a wealthy American. Eventually Margaret married her stepfather's son from his first marriage, Frederick Alvah Miller, an American stockbroker. Thus, the two women Agatha called &quot;Grannie&quot; were sisters. Despite her father's nationality as a &quot;New Yorker&quot; and her aunt's relation to the [[J.P. Morgan|Pierpont Morgans]], Agatha never claimed United States citizenship or connection.&lt;ref&gt;Wagoner, Mary S. ''Agatha Christie''. (Page 26) Twayne Publishers, 1986 ISBN 0-8057-6936-6, 978-0-8057-6936-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Agatha was the youngest of three. The Millers had two other children: Margaret Frary Miller (1879–1950), called Madge, who was 11 years Agatha's senior, and Louis {{lang|en|Montant}} Miller (1880–1929), called Monty, 10 years older than Agatha. Later, in her autobiography, Agatha would refer to her brother as &quot;an amiable [[Wiktionary:scapegrace|scapegrace]] of a brother&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brief Biography of Agatha Christie [http://www.sfu.ca/english/Gillies/Engl38301/christiebio.html Christie Bio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agatha described herself as having had a very happy childhood. While she never received any formal schooling, she did not lack an education. Her mother believed children should not learn to read until they were eight, but Agatha taught herself to read at four. Her father taught her mathematics via story problems, and the family played question-and-answer games much like today's [[Trivial Pursuit]]. She had piano lessons, which she liked, and dance lessons, which she did not. When she could not learn French through formal instruction, the family hired a young woman who spoke nothing but French to be her nanny and companion. Agatha made up stories from a very early age and invented a number of [[imaginary friend]]s and [[paracosm]]s. One of them, &quot;The School&quot;, with a dozen or so imaginary young women of widely varying temperaments, lasted well into her adult years. &lt;ref&gt;Christie, ''Autobiography'', first two sections.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]], she worked at a hospital as a nurse; she liked the profession, calling it &quot;one of the most rewarding professions that anyone can follow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; She later worked at a hospital [[pharmacy]], a job that influenced her work, as many of the murders in her books are carried out with [[poison]].

Despite a turbulent courtship, on Christmas Eve 1914 Agatha married Archibald Christie, an [[aviator]] in the [[Royal Flying Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie, pp. 215, 237&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had one daughter, [[Rosalind Hicks]]. They divorced in 1928, two years after Christie discovered her husband was having an affair.

Her first novel, ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]],'' came out in 1920. During her marriage to Christie, Agatha published six novels, a collection of short stories, and a number of short stories in magazines.

===Disappearance===
In late 1926, Agatha's husband, Archie, revealed that he was in love with another woman, Nancy Neele, and wanted a divorce. On 8 December 1926 the couple quarreled, and Archie Christie left their house Styles in [[Sunningdale]], Berkshire, to spend the weekend with his mistress at [[Godalming]], Surrey. That same evening Agatha disappeared from her home, leaving behind a letter for her secretary saying that she was going to [[Yorkshire]]. Her disappearance caused an outcry from the public, many of whom were admirers of her novels. Despite a massive manhunt, she was not found for 11 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=MRS.

On 19 December 1926 Agatha was identified as a guest at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel (now the [[Old Swan Hotel]]&lt;ref&gt;The Harrogate [[Hydrotherapy|Hydropathic]] hotel, nowadays the Old Swan Hotel, was also known as the Swan Hydro, because of its location on Swan Road, on the site of an earlier Old Swan Hotel. [http://www.harrogate.gov.uk/pdf/History%20of%20Harrogate.pdf A Brief History of Harrogate]&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Harrogate]], Yorkshire, where she was registered as 'Mrs Teresa Neele' from [[Cape Town]]. Agatha gave no account of her disappearance. Although two doctors had diagnosed her as suffering from [[psychogenic fugue]], opinion remains divided as to the reasons for her disappearance. One suggestion is that she had suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] brought about by a natural propensity for depression, exacerbated by her mother's death earlier that year and the discovery of her husband's infidelity. Public reaction at the time was largely negative, with many believing it a [[publicity stunt]] while others speculated she was trying to make the police believe her husband had killed her.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil, ''Why did mystery writer Agatha Christie mysteriously disappear?'' The Chicago Reader, 4/2/82. [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/361/why-did-mystery-writer-agatha-christie-mysteriously-disappear] Accessed 19 May 2008. In her autobiography, Agatha strongly suggests that she had a nervous breakdown. When hearing another woman recount similar symptoms, she said she replied, &quot;I think you had better be very careful; it is probably the beginning of a nervous breakdown.&quot; Christie, ''Autobiography'', 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Jared Cade interviewed numerous witnesses and relatives for his sympathetic biography, ''Agatha Christie and the Missing Eleven Days'', and provided a substantial amount of evidence to suggest that Christie planned the entire disappearance to embarrass her husband, never thinking it would escalate into the melodrama it became.&lt;ref&gt;Agatha Christie and the Missing Eleven Days, Jared Cade, Publisher: Peter Owen Ltd, 1997, ISBN 978-0-7206-1280-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage and later life===
[[Image:Hotel_Pera_Palace_-_Istanbul.jpg|thumb|Agatha Christie's room at the Hotel Pera Palace, where she wrote ''Murder on the Orient Express''.]] [[File:AgathaChristie BluePlague.jpg|thumb|An Agatha Christie blue plaque. No.58 Sheffield Terrace, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, London]]
In 1930, Christie married archaeologist [[Max Mallowan]] (Sir Max from 1968) after joining him in an archaeological dig. Their marriage was especially happy in the early years and remained so until Christie's death in 1976.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; In 1977, Mallowan married his longtime associate, Barbara Parker.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;

Christie frequently used settings which were familiar to her for her stories. Christie's travels with Mallowan contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East. Other novels (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'') were set in and around Torquay, where she was born. Christie's 1934 novel ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' was written in the [[Hotel Pera Palace]] in [[Istanbul]], Turkey, the southern terminus of the railway. The hotel maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author.&lt;ref&gt;jbottero; &quot;Agatha Christie's Hotel Pera Palace&quot; http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/51232/ 5 June 2008 23:08:11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greenway Estate]] in Devon, acquired by the couple as a summer residence in 1938, is now in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

Christie often stayed at [[Abney Hall]] in [[Cheshire]], which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts. She based at least two of her stories on the hall:  the short story ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'', which is in the story collection of the same name, and the novel ''[[After the Funeral]]''. &quot;Abney became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all the servants and grandeur which have been woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stoneygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney in various forms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Agatha Christie: A Reader's Companion&amp;nbsp;–Vanessa Wagstaff and Stephen Poole, Aurum Press Ltd. 2004. Page 14. ISBN 1-84513-015-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], Christie worked in the pharmacy at [[University College Hospital]], London, where she acquired a knowledge of poisons that she put to good use in her post-war crime novels. For example, the use of [[thallium]] as a poison was suggested to her by UCH Chief Pharmacist Harold Davis (later appointed Chief Pharmacist at the UK Ministry of Health), and in ''[[The Pale Horse]]'', published in 1961, she employed it to dispatch a series of victims, the first clue to the murder method coming from the victims’ loss of hair. So accurate was her description of thallium poisoning that on at least one occasion it helped solve a case that was baffling doctors.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Thallium poisoning in fact and fiction&quot; http://www.pharmj.com/pdf/comment/pj_20061125_onlooker.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To honour her many literary works, she was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1956 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40669|supp=yes|startpage=11|date=30 December 1955|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, she became the President of the [[Detection Club]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Biography: Agatha Christie&quot; Retrieved 22 February 2009; http://www.illiterarty.com/authors/biography-agatha-christie&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1971 New Year Honours she was promoted [[Dame Commander]] of the Order of the British Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45262|supp=yes|startpage=7|date=31 December 1970|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; three years after her husband had been [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his archeological work in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44600|supp=yes|startpage=6300|date=31 May 1968|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the few married couples where both partners were honoured in their own right. From 1968, due to her husband's knighthood, Christie could also be [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] as Lady Agatha Mallowan, or simply Lady Mallowan.

From 1971 to 1974, Christie's health began to fail, although she continued to write. In 1975, sensing her increasing weakness, Christie signed over the rights of her most successful play, ''The Mousetrap'', to her grandson.&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;Thompson, Laura. ''Agatha Christie: An English Mystery''. London: Headline Review. 2008. ISBN 978-0-7553-1488-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, using experimental textual tools of analysis, Canadian researchers have suggested that Christie may have begun to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or other dementia.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston, Anne. “[http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/04/02/the-ultimate-whodunit/ The ultimate whodunit],” ''[[Maclean's|Maclean’s]]''. 2 April 2009.

Agatha Christie died on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her [[Winterbrook]] House in the north of [[Cholsey]] [[civil parish|parish]], adjoining [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in [[Oxfordshire]] (formerly part of Berkshire). She is buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey.

Christie's only child, Rosalind Margaret Hicks, died, also aged 85, on 28 October 2004 from natural causes in [[Torbay]], Devon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |title=Deaths England and Wales 1984–2006 |publisher=Findmypast.com |date= |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie's grandson, Mathew Prichard, was heir to the copyright to some of his grandmother's literary work (including ''[[The Mousetrap]]'') and is still associated with Agatha Christie Limited.

==Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple==
Agatha Christie's first novel ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' was published in 1920 and introduced the long-running character detective [[Hercule Poirot]], who appeared in 33 of Christie's novels and 54 short stories.

Her other well known character, [[Miss Marple]], was introduced in ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Tuesday Night Club|The Tuesday Night Club]]'' in 1927 (short story) and was based on women like Christie's grandmother and her &quot;cronies&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBCdustyClues&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mills |first=Selina |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7612000/7612534.stm |title=BBC:Dusty clues to Christie unearthed |publisher=BBC News |date=15 September 2008 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'', intended as the last cases of these two great detectives, Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.

Like [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] with [[Sherlock Holmes]], Christie was to become increasingly tired of her detective Poirot. In fact, by the end of the 1930s, Christie confided to her diary that she was finding Poirot “insufferable,&quot; and by the 1960s she felt that he was &quot;an ego-centric creep.&quot; However, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Agatha Christie&amp;nbsp;– Her Detectives and Other Characters&quot; Retrieved 22 February 2009 http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, it is interesting to note that the Belgian detective’s titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s.

Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording, recently rediscovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this:  &quot;Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBCdustyClues /&gt;

Poirot is the only fictional character to have been given an obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', following the publication of ''Curtain'' in 1975.

Following the great success of ''Curtain'', Dame Agatha gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series&amp;nbsp;— for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' despite the fact he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died. Miss Marple fared better than Poirot, since after solving the mystery in ''Sleeping Murder'' she returns home to her regular life in [[St. Mary Mead]].

On an edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] claimed that Agatha Christie told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter and then decided who the most unlikely suspect was. She would then go back and make the necessary changes to &quot;frame&quot; that person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4&amp;nbsp;–Factual&amp;nbsp;–Desert Island Discs -Brian Aldiss|last=Aldiss|first=Brian|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence of Christie's working methods, as described by successive biographers, contradicts this claim.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Formula and plot devices==
Almost all of Agatha Christie’s books are [[whodunit]]s, focusing on the British [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class|upper]] classes. Usually, the detective either stumbles across the murder or is called upon by an old acquaintance, who is somehow involved. Gradually, the detective interrogates each suspect, examines the scene of the crime and makes a note of each clue, so readers can analyze it and be allowed a fair chance of solving the mystery themselves. Then, about halfway through, or sometimes even during the final act, one of the suspects usually dies, often because they have inadvertently deduced the killer's identity and need silencing. In a few of her novels, including ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'' and ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', there are multiple victims. Finally, the detective organises a meeting of all the suspects and slowly denounces the guilty party, exposing several unrelated secrets along the way, sometimes over the course of thirty or so pages. The murders are often extremely ingenious, involving some convoluted piece of deception. Christie’s stories are also known for their taut atmosphere and strong psychological suspense, developed from the deliberately slow pace of her prose.

Twice, the murderer surprisingly turns out to be the [[unreliable narrator]] of the story.

In five stories, Christie allows the murderer to escape justice (and in the case of the last three, implicitly almost approves of their crimes); these are ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'' and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''. (When Christie adapted ''Witness'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed.) There are also numerous instances where the killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but instead dies (death usually being presented as a more 'sympathetic' outcome), for example ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'',  ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[Nemesis]]'', and ''[[Secret Adversary]]''. In some cases this is with the collusion of the detective involved. ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'', and arguably ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'', end with the question of whether formal justice will be done unresolved.

==Critical reception==

Agatha Christie was revered as a master of [[suspense]], [[plot (narrative)|plot]]ting, and [[characterization|characterisation]] by most of her contemporaries{{Says who|date=December 2009}}. Fellow crime writer [[Anthony Berkeley Cox]] was an admitted fan of her work, once saying that nobody can write an Agatha Christie novel but the authoress herself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

However, she does have her detractors, most notably the American novelist [[Raymond Chandler]], who criticised her in his essay, &quot;[[The Simple Art of Murder]]&quot;, and the American literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]], who was dismissive of Christie and the detective fiction genre generally in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' essay, &quot;Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edmund. “Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?” ''The New Yorker''. 20 January 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have criticized Christie on political grounds, particularly with respect to her conversations about and portrayals of Jews.  [[Christopher Hitchens]], in his autobiography, describes a dinner with Christie and her husband, Max Mallowan, which became increasingly uncomfortable as the night wore on, and where &quot;The anti-Jewish flavour of the talk was not to be ignored or overlooked, or put down to heavy humour or generational prejudice. It was vividly unpleasant...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Christopher Hitchens]]|title=Hitch-22|publisher=Hachette}}.  Hitchens goes on to critique Christie's writing style as well, opining &quot;There must be some connection between the general nullity of Christie's prose and the tendency of her detectives to take Jewishness as a symptom of crime.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five years after her death, critic [[Johann Hari]] notes &quot;In its ugliest moments, Christie’s conservatism crossed over into a contempt for Jews, who are so often associated with rationalist political philosophies and a ‘cosmopolitanism’ that is antithetical to the Burkean paradigm of the English village. There is a streak of anti-Semitism running through the pre-1950s novels which cannot be denied even by her admirers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hari&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=Johann Hari|title=Agatha Christie – radical conservative thinker|date=3 October 2003|url=http://www.johannhari.com/2003/10/04/agatha-christie-radical-conservative-thinker}}.  Hari gives several examples.  &quot;‘The Mysterious Mr Quinn’ has an ugly passage about &quot;men of Hebraic extraction, sallow
men with hooked noses, wearing flamboyant jewellery.&quot; ‘Peril At End House’ has a character referred to as &quot;the long-nosed Mr Lazarus&quot;, of whom somebody says, &quot;he’s a Jew, of course, but a frightfully decent one.&quot; Against this, it is worth pointing out that her novel ‘Giant’s Bread’ (written under the pseudonym of Mary Westmacott) features an extremely sympathetic portrait of the Levinnes, a Jewish family who suffer from anti-Semitism in England. Christie’s hostility to Jews was, I suspect, more political than personal (and no less reprehensible for that).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotyping==
Christie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters  into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to [[Italian people|Italians]], Jews, and non-Europeans. For example, in the first editions of the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' (1930), in the short story &quot;The Soul of the Croupier,&quot; she described &quot;Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery&quot;; in later editions the passage was edited to describe &quot;sallow men&quot; wearing same.  To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie often characterised the &quot;foreigners&quot; in such a way as to make the reader understand and sympathise with them; this is particularly true of her Jewish characters, who are seldom actually criminals.  (See, for example, the character of Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Portrayals==
Christie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television.

Several biographical programs have been made, such as the 2004 [[BBC television]] programme entitled ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'', in which she is portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]].

Christie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including the 1979 film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (with Vanessa Redgrave, where she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband) and the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode &quot;[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]&quot; (with [[Fenella Woolgar]], her disappearance being the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown due to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien). Others, such as 1980 Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (not to be confused with the 1986 comedy by the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kojak Budapesten&quot; 1990. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081006/plotsummary&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 TV play, ''Murder by the Book'', Christie herself ([[Dame Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of [[Liar-Soft]]'s 2008 [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth]] ~What a beautiful tomorrow~'', Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders' by Max Allan Collins.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Christie has also been parodied on screen, such as in the film ''Murder by Indecision'', which featured the character &quot;Agatha Crispy&quot;.

'''''The Plague''''' (''Fr.'' '''''La Peste''''') is a novel by [[Albert Camus]], published in 1947, that tells the story of medical workers finding solidarity in their labour as the Algerian city of [[Oran]] is swept by a plague. It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of [[destiny]] and the [[human condition]]. The characters in the book, ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives, all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace.

The novel is believed to be based on the cholera epidemic that killed a large percentage of Oran's population in 1849 following French colonization, but the novel is placed in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Magill 1989:683&lt;/ref&gt;  Oran and its environs were struck by disease multiple times before Camus published this novel.  According to a [http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/13/10/1459.htm research report] by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Oran was decimated by the plague in 1556 and 1678, but outbreaks after European colonization, in 1921 (185 cases), 1931 (76 cases), and 1944 (95 cases), were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel.  

''The Plague'' is considered an [[existentialist]] classic despite Camus' objection to the label.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (in Thody, 1970):345.  In an interview on 15 November 1945, Camus said, &quot;No, I am not an existentialist.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forsdick 2007:119&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative tone is similar to [[Franz Kafka|Kafka's]], especially in ''[[The Trial]],'' where individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings, the material often pointedly resonating as stark [[allegory]] of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition. Camus included a dim-witted character misreading ''[[The Trial]]'' as a mystery novel as an oblique [[homage]]. The novel has been read as a [[metaphor]]ical treatment of the [[French resistance]] to [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation during World War II.

Although Camus's approach in the book is severe, his narrator emphasizes the ideas that we ultimately have no control, irrationality of life is inevitable, and he further illustrates the human reaction towards the &quot;absurd&quot;. ''The Plague'' represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]], a theory which Camus himself helped to define.

==Plot summary==
The text of ''The Plague'' is divided into five parts.

===Part one===
In the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially going unnoticed by the populace, begin to die in the streets.  A hysteria develops soon after, causing the local newspapers to report the incident.  Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the [[bubonic plague]].  

The main character, Dr. Bernard Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge, M. Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever. Dr. Rieux consults his colleague, Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town.  They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory, but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death.  However, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic.  

Authorities are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take.  Official notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation.  A &quot;special ward&quot; is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days.  As the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken.  Homes are quarantined, corpses and burials are strictly supervised.  A supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is only enough to treat existing cases and the country's emergency reserves are depleted.  When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared.

===Part two===
The town is sealed off.  The town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended.  The use of telephone lines is restricted only to &quot;urgent&quot; calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town.  The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters.  

One character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his lover in Paris after city officials refused his request to leave.  He befriends some criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city.  Another character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God for the citizens' sinful nature. His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves and who would not have done so under normal circumstances.  Cottard, a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide yet fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler.  Meanwhile, Dr. Rieux, a vacationer Jean Tarrou, and a civil servant Joseph Grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital. 

Rambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that others in the city, including Dr. Rieux, also have loved ones outside the city that they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind.  He then decides to join Tarrou and Dr. Rieux to help fight the epidemic.

===Part three===

In mid-August, the situation continues to worsen. People try to escape the town, but some are shot by armed sentries. Violence and looting break out on a small scale, and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew. Funerals are conducted with more and more speed, no ceremony, and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased. The inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation; despondent, they waste away emotionally as well as physically.

===Part four===

In September and October, the town remains at the mercy of the plague. Rieux hears from the sanatorium that the condition of his wife is worsening. He also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work. Cottard, on the other hand, seems to flourish during the plague, because it gives him a sense of being connected to others, since everybody faces the same danger. Cottard and Tarrou attend a performance of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Eurydice]]'', but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance.

Rambert finally has a chance to escape, but he decides to stay, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left.

Towards the end of October, Castel's new anti-plague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of Othon's young son, who suffers greatly, as Paneloux, Rieux, and Tarrou look on in horror.

Paneloux, who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague, gives a second sermon. He addresses the problem of an innocent child's suffering and says it is a test of a Christian's faith, since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything. He urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague.

A few days after the sermon, Paneloux is taken ill. His symptoms do not conform to those of the plague, but the disease still proves fatal.

Tarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps, where they meet Othon. When Othon's period of quarantine ends, he elects to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son. Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life, and the two men go swimming together in the sea. Grand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers. But Grand makes an unexpected recovery, and deaths from the plague start to decline.

===Part five===

By late January, the plague is in full retreat, and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates. Othon, however, does not escape death from the disease. Cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic, from which he has profited by shady dealings. Two government employees approach him, and he flees. Despite the ending of the epidemic, Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after a heroic struggle. Rieux's wife also dies.

In February, the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities. Rambert is reunited with his wife. Rieux reveals that he is the narrator of the chronicle and that he tried to present an objective view of the events.

Cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home. He is arrested. Grand begins working on his sentence again. Rieux reflects on the epidemic and reaches the conclusion that there is more to admire than to despise in humans.

==Characters in &quot;The Plague&quot;==

*'''The Narrator''': presents himself at the outset of the book as witness to the events and privy to documents, but does not identify himself with any character until the ending of the novel. 

*'''Asthma Patient''': The asthma patient receives regular visits from Dr. Rieux. He is a seventy-five-year-old Spaniard with a rugged face, who comments on events in Oran that he hears about on the radio and in the newspapers.

*'''Dr. Castel''': Dr. Castel is one of Rieux's medical colleagues and is much older than Rieux. He realizes after the first few cases that the disease is bubonic plague and is aware of the seriousness of the situation. He labors hard to make an anti-plague serum, but as the epidemic continues, he shows increasing signs of wear and tear.

*'''Cottard''': Cottard lives in the same building as Grand. He does not appear to have a job, and is described as having private means, although he describes himself as &quot;a traveling salesman in wines and spirits.&quot; Cottard is an eccentric figure, silent and secretive, who tries to hang himself in his room. Afterwards, he does not want to be interviewed by the police, since he has committed a crime by attempting suicide, and fears arrest.

Cottard's personality changes after the outbreak of plague. Whereas he was aloof and mistrustful before, he now becomes agreeable and tries hard to make friends. He appears to relish the coming of the plague, and Tarrou thinks this is because he finds it easier to live with his own fears now that everyone else is in a state of fear, too. Cottard takes advantage of the crisis to make money by selling contraband cigarettes and inferior liquor.

When the epidemic ends, Cottard's moods fluctuate. Sometimes he is sociable, but at other times he shuts himself up in his room. Eventually, he loses his mental balance and shoots at random at people on the street. The police arrest him.

*'''Garcia''': Garcia is a man who knows the group of smugglers in Oran. He introduces Rambert to Raoul.

*'''Gonzales''': Gonzales is the smuggler who makes the arrangements for Rambert's escape.

*'''Joseph Grand''': Joseph Grand is a fifty-year-old clerk for the city government. He is tall and thin and always wears clothes a size too large for him. Poorly paid, he lives an austere life, but he is capable of deep affection. In his spare time, Grand polishes up his Latin, and he is also writing a book, but he is such a perfectionist that he continually rewrites the first sentence and can get no further. One of his problems in life is that he can rarely find the correct words to express what he means. Grand tells Rieux that he married while still in his teens, but overwork and poverty took their toll (Grand did not receive the career advancement that he had been promised), and his wife Jeanne left him. He tried but failed to write a letter to her, and he still grieves for his loss.

Grand is a neighbor of Cottard, and it is he who calls Rieux for help, when Cottard tries to commit suicide. When the plague takes a grip on the town, Grand joins the team of volunteers, acting as general secretary, recording all the statistics. Rieux regards him as &quot;the true embodiment of the quiet courage that inspired the sanitary groups.&quot; Grand catches the plague himself and asks Rieux to burn his manuscript. But then he makes an unexpected recovery. At the end of the novel, Grand says he is much happier; he has written to Jeanne and made a fresh start on his book.

*'''Louis''': Louis is one of the sentries who takes part in the plan for Rambert to escape.

*'''Marcel''': Marcel, Louis's brother, is also a sentry who is part of the escape plan for Rambert.

*'''M. Michel''': M. Michel is the concierge of the building in which Rieux lives. An old man, he is the first victim of the plague.

*'''Jacques Othon''':Jacques Othon is M. Othon's young son. When he contracts the plague, he is the first to receive Dr. Castel's anti-plague serum. But the serum is ineffective, and the boy dies after a long and painful struggle.

*'''M. Othon''': M. Othon is a magistrate in Oran. He is tall and thin and, as Tarrou observes in his journal, &quot;his small, beady eyes, narrow nose, and hard, straight mouth make him look like a well-brought-up owl.&quot; Othon treats his wife and children unkindly, but after his son dies of the plague, his character softens. After he finishes his time at the isolation camp, where he is sent because his son is infected, he wants to return there, because this would make him feel closer to his lost son. But before Othon can do this, he contracts the plague and dies.

*'''Father Paneloux''': Father Paneloux is a learned, well-respected Jesuit priest. He is well known for having given a series of lectures in which he championed a pure form of Christian doctrine and chastised his audience about their laxity. During the first stage of the plague outbreak, Paneloux preaches a sermon at the cathedral. He has a powerful way of speaking, and he insists to the congregation that the plague is a scourge sent by God to those who have hardened their hearts against him. But Paneloux also claims that God is present to offer succor and hope. Later, Paneloux attends at the bedside of Othon's stricken son and prays that the boy may be spared. After the boy's death, Paneloux tells Rieux that although the death of an innocent child in a world ruled by a loving God cannot be rationally explained, it should nonetheless be accepted. Paneloux joins the team of volunteer workers and preaches another sermon saying that the death of the innocent child is a test of faith. Since God willed the child's death, so the Christian should will it, too. A few days after preaching this sermon, Paneloux is taken ill. He refuses to call for a doctor, trusting in God alone. He dies. Since his symptoms did not seem to resemble those of the plague, Rieux records his death as a &quot;doubtful case.&quot;

*'''The Prefect''': The Prefect believes at first that the talk of plague is a false alarm, but on the advice of his medical association, he authorizes limited measures to combat it. When these do not work, he tries to avoid responsibility, saying he will ask the government for orders. After this, he does take responsibility for tightening up the regulations relating to the plague and issues the order to close the town.

*'''Raymond Rambert''': Raymond Rambert is a journalist who is visiting Oran to research a story on living conditions in the Arab quarter of the town. When the plague strikes, he finds himself trapped in a city with which he feels he has no connection. He misses his wife who is in Paris, and he uses all his ingenuity and resourcefulness to persuade the city bureaucracy to allow him to leave. When this fails, he contacts smugglers, who agree to help him to escape for a fee of ten thousand francs. But there is a hitch in the arrangements, and by the time another escape plan is arranged, Rambert has changed his mind. He decides to stay in the city and continue to help fight the plague, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he pursued a merely private happiness. He now feels that he belongs in Oran and that the plague is everyone's business, including his.

*'''Raoul''': Raoul is the man who agrees, for a fee of ten thousand francs, to arrange for Rambert to escape. He introduces Rambert to Gonzales.

*'''Dr. Richard''': Dr. Richard is chairman of the Oran Medical Association. He is slow to recommend any action to combat the plague, not wanting to arouse public alarm. He does not even want to admit that the disease is the plague, referring instead to a &quot;special type of fever.&quot;

*'''Dr. Bernard Rieux''': Dr. Bernard Rieux is the narrator of the novel, although this is only revealed at the end. Tarrou describes him as about thirty-five-years-old, of moderate height, dark-skinned, with close-cropped black hair. At the beginning of the novel, Rieux's wife, who has been ill for a year, leaves for a sanatorium. It is Rieux who treats the first victim of plague and who first uses the word plague to describe the disease. He urges the authorities to take action to stop the spread of the epidemic. However, at first, along with everyone else, the danger the town faces seems unreal to him. He feels uneasy but does not realize the gravity of the situation. Within a short while, he grasps what is at stake and warns the authorities that unless steps are taken immediately, the epidemic could kill off half the town's population of two hundred thousand within a couple of months.

During the epidemic, Rieux heads an auxiliary hospital and works long hours treating the victims. He injects serum and lances the abscesses, but there is little more that he can do, and his duties weigh heavily upon him. He never gets home until late, and he has to distance himself from the natural pity that he feels for the victims; otherwise, he would not be able to go on. It is especially hard for him when he visits a victim in the person's home, because he knows that he must immediately call for an ambulance and have the person removed from the house. Often the relatives plead with him not to do this, since they know they may never see the person again.

Rieux works to combat the plague simply because he is a doctor and his job is to relieve human suffering. He does not do it for any grand, religious purpose, like Paneloux (Rieux does not believe in God), or as part of a high-minded moral code, like Tarrou. He is a practical man, doing what needs to be done without any fuss, even though he knows that the struggle against death is something that he can never win.

*'''Mme. Rieux''': Mme. Rieux is Dr. Rieux's mother, who comes to stay with him when his sick wife goes to the sanatorium. She is a serene woman who, after taking care of the housework, sits quietly in a chair. She says that at her age there is nothing much left to fear.

*'''Jean Tarrou''': Jean Tarrou arrived in Oran some weeks before the plague broke out, for unknown reasons. He is not there on business, since he appears to have private means. Tarrou is a good-natured man who smiles a lot. Before the plague came, he liked to associate with the Spanish dancers and musicians in the city. He also keeps a diary, full of his observations of life in Oran, which Rieux incorporates into the narrative.

It is Tarrou who first comes up with the idea of organizing teams of volunteers to fight the plague. He wants to do this before the authorities begin to conscript people, and he does not like the official plan to get prisoners to do the work. He takes action, prompted by his own code of morals; he feels that the plague is everybody's responsibility and that everyone should do his or her duty. What interests him, he tells Rieux, is how to become a saint, even though he does not believe in God.

Later in the novel, Tarrou tells Rieux, with whom he has become friends, the story of his life. His father, although a kind man in private, was also an aggressive prosecuting attorney who tried death penalty cases, arguing strongly for the death penalty to be imposed. As a young boy, Tarrou attended one day of a criminal proceeding in which a man was on trial for his life. However, the idea of capital punishment disgusted him. After he left home before the age of eighteen, his main interest in life was his opposition to the death penalty, which he regarded as state-sponsored murder. However, years of activism, and fighting for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side of the [[Spanish Civil War]] have left him disillusioned.

When the plague epidemic is virtually over, Tarrou becomes one of its last victims, but puts up a heroic struggle before dying.

==Themes==
{{Original research|date=June 2010}}
*'''Exile and Separation'''

The theme of exile and separation is embodied in two characters, Rieux and Rambert, both of whom are separated from the women they love. The theme is also present in the many other nameless citizens who are separated from loved ones in other towns or from those who happened to be out of town when the gates of Oran were closed. In another sense, the entire town feels in exile, since it is completely cut off from the outside world. Rieux, as the narrator, describes what exile meant to them all:

{{Quote|That sensation of a void within which never left us, that irrational longing to hark back to the past or else to speed up the march of time, and those keen shafts of memory that stung like fire.}}

Some, like Rambert, are exiles in double measure since they are not only cut off from those they want to be with but they do not have the luxury of being in their own homes.

The feeling of exile produces many changes in attitudes and behaviors. At first, people indulge in fantasies, imagining the missing person's return, but then they start to feel like prisoners, drifting through life with nothing left but the past, since they do not know how long into the future their ordeal may last. And the past smacks only of regret, of things left undone. Living with the sense of abandonment, they find that they cannot communicate their private grief to their neighbors, and conversations tend to be superficial.

Rieux returns to the theme at the end of the novel, after the epidemic is over, when the depth of the feelings of exile and deprivation is clear from the overwhelming joy with which long parted lovers and family members greet each other.

For some citizens, exile was a feeling more difficult to pin down. They simply desired a reunion with something that could hardly be named but which seemed to them to be the most desirable thing on Earth. Some called it peace. Rieux numbers Tarrou among such people, although he found it only in death.

This understanding of exile suggests the deeper, metaphysical implications of the term. It relates to the loss of the belief that humans live in a rational universe in which they can fulfill their hopes and desires, find meaning, and be at home. As Camus put it in The Myth of Sisyphus, &quot;In a universe that is suddenly deprived of illusions and of light, man feels a stranger. His is an irremediable exile.&quot;

*'''Solidarity, Community, and Resistance'''

The ravages of the plague in Oran vividly convey the absurdist position that humans live in an indifferent, incomprehensible universe that has no rational meaning or order, and no transcendent God. The plague comes unannounced and may strike down anyone at any time. It is arbitrary and capricious, and it leaves humans in a state of fear and uncertainty, which ends only in death. In the face of this metaphysical reality, what must be the response of individuals? Should they resign themselves to it, accept it as inevitable, and seek what solace they can as individuals, or should they join with others and fight back, even though they must live with the certainty that they cannot win? Camus's answer is clearly the latter, embodied in the characters of Rieux, Rambert, and Tarrou. Rieux's position is made clear in part II in a conversation with Tarrou. Rieux argues that one would have to be a madman to submit willingly to the plague. Rather than accepting the natural order of things — the presence of sickness and death — he believes one must fight against them. He is aware of the needs of the community; he does not live for himself alone. When Tarrou points out that &quot;[his] victories will never be lasting,&quot; Rieux admits that he is involved in a &quot;never ending defeat,&quot; but this does not stop him from engaging in the struggle.

Rieux is also aware that working for the common good demands sacrifice; he cannot expect personal happiness. This is a lesson that Rambert learns. At first he insists that he does not belong in Oran, and his only thought is returning to the woman he loves in Paris. He thinks only of his own personal happiness and the unfairness of the situation in which he has been placed but gradually comes to recognize his membership in a larger human community, which makes demands on him that he cannot ignore. Ultimately he realizes he cannot face his lover if it is as a coward.

Tarrou lives according to an ethical code that demands that he act in a way that benefits the whole community, even though, in this case, he risks his life by doing so. Later in the novel, when Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life, he adds a new dimension to the term ”plague.“ He views it not just as a specific disease or simply as the presence of an impersonal evil external to humans. For Tarrou, plague is the destructive impulse within every person, the will and the capacity to do harm, and it is everyone's duty to be on guard against this tendency within themselves, lest they infect someone else with it. He describes his views to Rieux:

{{Quote|What's natural is the microbe. All the rest — health, integrity, purity (if you like) — is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter. The good man, the man who infects hardly anyone, is the man who has the fewest lapses of attention.}}

*'''Religion'''

In times of calamity, people often turn to religion, and Camus examines this response in the novel. In contrast to the humanist beliefs of Rieux, Rambert, and Tarrou, the religious perspective is given in the sermons of the stern Jesuit priest, Father Paneloux. While the other main characters believe there is no rational explanation for the outbreak of plague, Paneloux believes there is. In his first sermon, given during the first month of the plague, Paneloux describes the epidemic as the &quot;flail of God,&quot; through which God separates the wheat from the chaff, the good from the evil. Paneloux is at pains to emphasize that God did not will the calamity: &quot;He looked on the evil-doing in the town with compassion; only when there was no other remedy did He turn His face away, in order to force people to face the truth about their life&quot; In Paneloux's view, even the terrible suffering caused by the plague works ultimately for good. The divine light can still be seen even in the most catastrophic events, and a Christian hope is granted to all.

Paneloux's argument is based on the theology of St. Augustine, on which he is an expert, and it is accepted as irrefutable by many of the townspeople, including the magistrate, Othon. But it does not satisfy Rieux. Camus carefully manipulates the plot to bring up the question of innocent suffering. Paneloux may argue that the plague is a punishment for sin, but how does he reconcile that doctrine with the death of a child? The child in question is Jacques Othon, and Paneloux, along with Rieux and Tarrou, witnesses his horrible death. Paneloux is moved with compassion for the child, and he takes up the question of innocent suffering in his second sermon. He argues that because a child's suffering is so horrible and cannot easily be ex-plained, it forces people into a crucial test of faith: either we must believe everything or we must deny everything, and who, Paneloux asks, could bear to do the latter? We must yield to the divine will, he says; we cannot pick and choose and accept only what we can understand. But we must still seek to do what good lies in our power (as Paneloux himself does as one of the volunteers who fights the plague).

When Paneloux contracts the plague himself, he refuses to call a doctor. He dies according to his principles, trusting in the providence of God and not fighting against his fate. This is in contrast to Tarrou, who fights valiantly against death when his turn comes.

It is clear that Camus's sympathy in this contrast of ideas lies with Rieux and Tarrou.

==Style==
{{Original research|date=June 2010}}
===Point of View===

This story is told through the character Rieux. However, Rieux does not function as a first-person narrator. Rather he disguises himself, referring to himself in the third person and only at the end of the novel reveals who he is. The novel thus appears to be told by an unnamed narrator who gathers information from what he has personally seen and heard regarding the epidemic, as well as from the diary of another character, Tarrou, who makes observations about the events he witnesses.
The reason Rieux does not declare himself earlier is that he wants to give an objective account of the events in Oran. He deliberately adopts the tone of an impartial observer. Rieux is like a witness who exercises restraint when called to testify about a crime; he describes what the characters said and did, without speculating about their thoughts and feelings, although he does offer generalized assessments of the shifting mood of the town as a whole. Rieux refers to his story as a chronicle, and he sees himself as an historian, which justifies his decision to stick to the facts and avoid subjectivity. This also explains why the style of The Plague often gives the impression of distance and detachment. Only rarely is the reader drawn directly into the emotions of the characters or the drama of the scene.

===Allegory===

An allegory is a narrative with two distinct levels of meaning. The first is the literal level; the second signifies a related set of concepts and events. The Plague is in part a historical allegory, in which the plague signifies the German occupation of France from 1940 to 1944 during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2007:165&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many aspects of the narrative that make the allegory plain. The town Oran, which gets afflicted by pestilence and cut off from the outside world, is the equivalent of France.  Camus draws from his own experience of isolation during the war in writing ''The Plague''.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2007:167&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens are slow to realize the magnitude of the danger because they do not believe in pestilence or that it could happen to them, just as the French were complacent at the beginning of the war. They could not imagine that the Germans, whom they had defeated only twenty years previously, could defeat them in a mere six weeks, as happened when France fell in June 1940.

The different attitudes of the characters reflect different attitudes in the French population during the occupation. Some were the equivalent of Paneloux and thought that France was to blame for the calamity that had befallen it. They believed that the only solution was to submit gracefully to an historical inevitability — the long-term dominance of Europe by Germany. Many people, however, became members of the French Resistance, and they are the allegorical equivalents of the voluntary sanitary teams in the novel, such as Tarrou, Rambert, and Grand, who fight back against the unspeakable evil (the Nazi occupiers).
Some French collaborated with the Germans. In the novel, they are represented by Cottard, who welcomes the plague and uses the economic deprivation that results from it to make a fortune buying and selling on the black market.

Other details in the novel can be read at the allegorical level. The plague that carries people off unexpectedly echoes the reality of the occupation, in which people could be snatched from their homes by the Gestapo and imprisoned or sent to work as slave labor in German-controlled territories or simply killed. The facts of daily life in the plague-stricken city resemble life in wartime France: the showing of reruns at the cinemas, the stockpiling of scarce goods, nighttime curfews and isolation camps (these paralleling the German internment camps). The scenes at the end of the novel, when Oran's gates are reopened, recall the jubilant scenes in Paris when the city was liberated in 1944.
In some places, Camus makes the allegory explicit, as when he refers to the plague in terms that describe an enemy in war: &quot;the epidemic was in retreat all along the line; victory was won and the enemy was abandoning his positions.&quot;

===Symbolism===

Imagery of the sea is often used in Camus's works to suggest life, vigor, and freedom. In The Plague, a key description of Oran occurs early, when it is explained that the town is built in such a way that it &quot;turns its back on the bay, with the result that it's impossible to see the sea, you always have to go to look for it.&quot; Symbolically, Oran turns its back on life. When the plague hits, the deprivation of this symbol of freedom becomes more pronounced, as the beaches are closed, as is the port. In summer, the inhabitants lose touch with the sea altogether: &quot;for all its nearness, the sea was out of bounds; young limbs had no longer the run of its delights.&quot;
A significant episode occurs near the end of part IV, when Tarrou and Rieux sit on the terrace of a house, from which they can see far into the horizon. As he gazes seaward, Tarrou says with a sense of relief that it is good to be there. To set a seal on the friendship between the two men, they go for a swim together. This contact with the ocean is presented as a moment of renewal, harmony, and peace. It is one of the few lyrical episodes in the novel: &quot;[T]hey saw the sea spread out before them, a gently heaving expanse of deep-piled velvet, supple and sleek as a creature of the wild.&quot;
Just before Rieux enters the water, he is possessed by a &quot;strange happiness,&quot; a feeling that is shared by Tarrou. There is a peaceful image of Rieux lying motionless on his back gazing up at the stars and moon, and then when Tarrou joins him they swim side by side, &quot;with the same zest, the same rhythm, isolated from the world, at last free of the town and of the plague.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applied ethics''' is, in the words of Brenda Almond, co-founder of the Society for Applied Philosophy,  &quot;the philosophical examination, from a moral standpoint, of particular issues in private and public life that are matters of moral judgment&quot;. It is thus a term used to describe attempts to use philosophical methods to identify the morally correct course of action in various fields of human life. [[Bioethics]], for example, is concerned with identifying the correct approach to matters such as euthanasia, or the allocation of scarce health resources, or the use of human embryos in research. [[Environmental ethics]] is concerned with questions such as the duties of humans towards landscapes or species. [[Business ethics]] concerns questions such as the limits on managers in the pursuit of profit, or the duty of 'whistleblowers' to the general public as opposed to their employers. As such, it is a study which is supposed to involve practitioners as much as professional philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Almond, 'Applied Ethics', in Mautner, Thomas, Dictionary of Philosophy, Penguin 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied ethics is distinguished from [[normative ethics]], which concerns what people should believe to be right and wrong, and from [[meta-ethics]], which concerns the nature of moral statements.

An emerging typology for applied ethics (Porter, 2006) uses six domains to help improve organizations and social issues at the national and global level:

* Decision ethics, or ethical theories and ethical decision processes
* Professional ethics, or ethics to improve professionalism
* Clinical ethics, or ethics to improve our basic health needs
* Business ethics, or individual based morals to improve ethics in an organization
* Organizational ethics, or ethics among organizations
* Social ethics, or ethics among nations and as one global unit

==Modern approach==
Much of applied ethics is concerned with just three theories:

# [[utilitarianism]], where the practical consequences of various policies are evaluated on the assumption that the right policy will be the one which results in the greatest happiness
# [[deontological ethics]], notions based on 'rules' i.e. that there is an obligation to perform the 'right' action, regardless of actual consequences (epitomized by Kant's notion of the [[Categorical Imperative]])
# [[virtue ethics]], derived from Aristotle's and Confucius's notions, which asserts that the right action will be that chosen by a suitably 'virtuous' agent.

One modern approach which attempts to overcome the seemingly impossible divide between deontology and utilitarianism is [[case-based reasoning]], also known as [[casuistry]].  Casuistry does not begin with theory, rather it starts with the immediate facts of a real and concrete case.  While casuistry makes use of ethical theory, it does not view ethical theory as the most important feature of moral reasoning.  Casuists, like Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Abuse of Casuistry'' 1988), challenge the traditional [[paradigm]] of applied ethics.  Instead of starting from theory and applying theory to a particular case, casuists start with the particular case itself and then ask what morally significant features (including both theory and practical considerations) ought to be considered for that particular case.  In their observations of medical ethics committees, Jonsen and Toulmin note that a consensus on particularly problematic moral cases often emerges when participants focus on the facts of the case, rather than on [[ideology]] or [[theory]].  Thus, a Rabbi, a Catholic priest, and an agnostic might agree that, in this particular case, the best approach is to withhold extraordinary medical care, while disagreeing on the reasons that support their individual positions.  By focusing on cases and not on theory, those engaged in moral debate increase the possibility of agreement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About||the philosophical term|Value (ethics)|the Akrobatik album|Absolute Value (album)}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' (or '''modulus''') |''a''| of a [[real number]] ''a'' is the numerical value of ''a'' without regard to its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. So, for example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.

Generalizations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example an absolute value is also defined for the [[complex number]]s, the [[quaternion]]s, [[ordered ring]]s, [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[vector space]]s. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[distance]], and [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] in various mathematical and physical contexts.

[[Image:Absolute value.svg|thumb|360px|The [[graph of a function|graph]] of the absolute value function for real numbers.]]

==Terminology and notation==
[[Jean-Robert Argand]] introduced the term &quot;module&quot; 'unit of measure' in French in 1806 specifically for the ''complex'' absolute value&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0691027951 Nahin], [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Argand.html O'Connor and Robertson], and [http://functions.wolfram.com/ComplexComponents/Abs/35/ functions.Wolfram.com.]; for the French sense, see [[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Littré]], 1877&lt;/ref&gt; and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent &quot;modulus&quot;.&lt;ref name=oed /&gt; The term &quot;absolute value&quot; has been used in this sense since at least 1806 in French&lt;ref&gt;[[Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot|Lazare Nicolas M. Carnot]], ''Mémoire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans l'espace'', p. 105 [http://books.google.com/books?id=YyIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA105 at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1857 in English.&lt;ref&gt;James Mill Peirce, ''A Text-book of Analytic Geometry'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=RJALAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 at Google Books].  The oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907. The term &quot;absolute value&quot; is also used in contrast to &quot;relative value&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The notation |&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;| was introduced by [[Karl Weierstrass]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Higham, ''Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences'', SIAM. ISBN 0-89871-420-6, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for ''absolute value'' include &quot;the numerical value&quot;&lt;ref name=oed /&gt; and &quot;the magnitude&quot;.&lt;ref name=oed /&gt;

The same notation is used with sets to denote [[cardinality]]; the meaning depends on context.

==Definition and properties==
===Real numbers===
For any [[real number]] ''a'' the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of ''a'' is denoted by |&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;| (a [[vertical bar]] on each side of the quantity) and is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen from the above definition, the absolute value of ''a'' is always either [[positive number|positive]] or [[0 (number)|zero]], but never [[negative number|negative]].

From an [[analytic geometry]] point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's [[distance]] from zero along the [[real number line]], and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed the notion of an abstract  [[distance function]] in mathematics can be seen to be a generalization of  the absolute value of the difference (see [[#Distance|&quot;Distance&quot;]] below).

Since the [[square-root]] notation without sign represents the ''positive'' square root, it follows that

:{|
|-
| style=&quot;width: 250px&quot; | &lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Stewart, James B. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Calculus: concepts and contexts | year=2001 | publisher=Brooks/Cole | location=Australia  | isbn=0-534-37718-1 | pages=}}, p. A5&lt;/ref&gt;

The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties:

:{|
|-
| style=&quot;width: 250px&quot; |&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;width: 100px&quot; | &lt;math&gt;(2)&lt;/math&gt;
| Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a| = 0 \iff a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(3)&lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|ab| = |a||b|\,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(4)&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Multiplicativeness]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a+b|  \le |a| + |b|  &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(5)&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Subadditivity]]
|}

Other important properties of the absolute value include:

:{|
|-
| style=&quot;width:250px&quot; |&lt;math&gt;|-a| = |a|\,&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;width: 100px&quot; | &lt;math&gt;(6)&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Symmetry]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(7)&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Identity of indiscernibles]] (equivalent to positive-definiteness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b|  \le |a - c| +|c - b|  &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(8)&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a/b| = |a| / |b| \mbox{ (if } b \ne 0) \,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(9)&lt;/math&gt;
|Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativeness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a-b| \ge ||a| - |b|| &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;(10)&lt;/math&gt;
|(equivalent to subadditivity)
|}

If b &gt; 0, two other useful properties concerning inequalities are:
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \le b \iff -b \le a \le b &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge b \iff a \le -b \mbox{ or } b \le a &lt;/math&gt;

These relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|x-3| \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -9 \le x-3 \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -6 \le x \le 12 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Absolute value is used to define the [[absolute difference]], the standard metric on the real numbers.

===Complex numbers===
[[Image:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value of a complex number ''z'' is the distance ''r'' from ''z'' to the origin. It is also seen in the picture that ''z'' and its [[complex conjugate]] &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;''z''&lt;/span&gt; have the same absolute value.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

Since the [[complex number]]s are not [[Totally ordered set|ordered]], the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalized for a complex number. However the identity given in equation (1) above:
:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
can be seen as motivating the following definition.

For any complex number

:&lt;math&gt;z = x + iy,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where  ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of ''z'' is denoted |''z''| and is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|z| =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the absolute value of a real number ''x'' is equal to its absolute value considered as a complex number since:

:&lt;math&gt; |x + i0| = \sqrt{x^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to the geometric interpretation of the absolute value for real numbers, it follows from the [[Pythagorean theorem]] that the absolute value of a complex number is the distance in the [[complex plane]] of that complex number from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], and more generally, that the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers.

The complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in (2)–(10) above. In addition, If

:&lt;math&gt; z = x + i y = r (\cos \phi + i \sin \phi ) \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{z} = x - iy&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''z'', then it is easily seen that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} |z| &amp; = r, \\ |z| &amp; = |\overline{z}|\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;|z| = \sqrt{z\overline{z}},&lt;/math&gt;

with the last formula being the complex analogue of equation (1) mentioned above in the real case.

The absolute square of ''z'' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|z|^2 = z\overline{z} = x^2 + y^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the positive reals form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, we may think of absolute value as an [[endomorphism]] of the [[multiplicative group]] of the complex numbers.

==Absolute value functions==
The real absolute value function is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere. It is [[derivative|differentiable]] everywhere except for ''x'' = 0.  It is [[monotonic function|monotonically decreasing]] on the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;(−∞, 0]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and monotonically increasing on the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, ∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since a real number and its negative have the same absolute value, it is an [[even function]], and is hence not [[invertible]].

The [[complex number|complex]] absolute value function is continuous everywhere but (complex) differentiable ''nowhere''; it violates the [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]].

Both the real and complex functions are [[idempotent]].

It is a [[nonlinear]] function.

It is also a [[convex function|convex]] function.

===Derivatives===
The [[derivative]] of the real absolute value function is the [[signum function]],  sgn(''x''), which is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sgn (x) = \frac{x}{|x|},&lt;/math&gt;

for ''x'' ≠ 0.  The absolute value function is not differentiable at ''x'' = 0. For applications in which a well-defined derivative may be needed, however, the [[subderivative]] is well defined at zero. Where the absolute value function of a real number returns a value without respect to its sign, the signum function returns a number's sign without respect to its value. Therefore ''x'' = sgn(''x'')abs(''x'').

The signum function is a form of the [[Heaviside step function]] used in signal processing, defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; u(x) =
  \begin{cases} 0,           &amp; x &lt; 0
             \\ \frac{1}{2}, &amp; x = 0
             \\ 1,           &amp; x &gt; 0,
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the value of the Heaviside function at zero is conventional.  So for all nonzero points on the [[real number line]],

:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \frac{\sgn(x) +1}{2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value function has no concavity at any point, the sign function is constant at all points. Therefore the second derivative of |''x''| with respect to ''x'' is zero everywhere except zero, where it is undefined.

The absolute value function is also integrable. Its [[antiderivative]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\int|x|dx=\frac{x|x|}{2}+C,&lt;/math&gt;

as evidenced by the following (using integration by parts and the fact that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''x''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;{\int|x|dx=x|x|-\int\frac{x^2}{|x|}dx= x|x|-\int|x|dx\iff 2\int|x|dx = x|x| \iff \int|x|dx =\frac{x|x|}{2}+C.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Distance==
The absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the [[distance]] from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.

The standard [[Euclidean distance]] between two points

:&lt;math&gt;a = (a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b = (b_1, b_2, \dots , b_n) &lt;/math&gt;

in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen to be a generalization of |&amp;thinsp;''a'' − ''b''&amp;thinsp;|, since if ''a'' and ''b'' are real, then by equation (1),
:&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = \sqrt{(a - b)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

While if

:&lt;math&gt; a = a_1 + i a_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; b = b_1 + i b_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

are complex numbers, then

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The above shows that the &quot;absolute value&quot; distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively.

The properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a [[distance function]] as follows:

A real valued function ''d'' on a set ''X'' × ''X'' is called a ''distance function'' (or a ''metric'') on ''X'', if it satisfies the following four axioms:&lt;ref&gt;These axioms are not minimal; for instance, non-negativity can be derived from the other three: 0 = ''d''(''a'', ''a'') ≤ ''d''(''a'', ''b'') + ''d''(''b'', ''a'') = 2''d''(''a'', ''b'').&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
|-
|style=&quot;width:250px&quot; | &lt;math&gt;d(a, b) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
|Identity of indiscernibles
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = d(b, a) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Symmetry
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b)  \le d(a, c) + d(c, b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Triangle inequality
|}

==Generalizations==
===Ordered rings===
The definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can easily be extended to any [[ordered ring]]. That is, if ''a'' is an element of an ordered ring ''R'', then the '''absolute value''' of ''a'', denoted by |&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;|, is defined to be:

:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0, \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where −''a'' is the [[additive inverse]] of ''a'', and 0 is the additive [[identity element]].

===Fields===
The fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in (2)–(5) above, can be used to generalize the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.

A real-valued function ''v'' on a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' is called an '''[[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]]''' (also a ''modulus'', ''magnitude'', ''value'', or ''valuation'') if it satisfies the following four axioms:

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) = 0 \iff a = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(ab) = v(a) v(b) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Multiplicativeness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a+b)  \le v(a) + v(b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality
|}

Where '''0''' denotes the additive [[identity element]] of ''F''. It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativeness that ''v''('''1''') = 1, where '''1''' denotes the multiplicative identity element of ''F''. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.

If ''v'' is an absolute value on ''F'', then the function ''d'' on ''F'' × ''F'', defined by ''d''(''a'', ''b'') = ''v''(''a'' − ''b''), is a metric and the following are equivalent:

* ''d'' satisfies the [[ultrametric]] inequality ''d''(''x'', ''y'') &amp;lt; max{''d''(''x'', ''z''), ''d''(''y'', ''z'')}.

* &lt;math&gt; \big\{ v\Big({\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n } \mathbf{1}\Big) : n \in \mathbb{N} \big\} &lt;/math&gt; is [[bounded set|bounded]] in '''R'''.

* &lt;math&gt; v\Big({\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n } \mathbf{1}\Big) \le 1 \text{ for every } n \in \mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; v(a) \le 1 \Rightarrow v(1+a) \le 1 \text{ for all } a \in F.&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; v(a + b) \le \mathrm{max}\{v(a), v(b)\} \text{ for all } a, b \in F.&lt;/math&gt;

An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be '''non-Archimedean''', otherwise it is said to be [[Archimedean field|Archimedean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shechter&quot;&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0126227608/?keywords=absolute%20value&amp;v=search-inside Schechter, p 260-261].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vector spaces===
{{Main|Norm (mathematics)}}
Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalize the notion to an arbitrary vector space.

A real-valued function on a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a field ''F'', represented as ||''V''||, is called an '''absolute value''' (or more usually a '''norm''') if it satisfies the following axioms:

For all ''a'' in ''F'', and '''v''', '''u''' in ''V'',

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\|  \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\| = 0 \iff \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|a \mathbf{v}\| = |a| \|\mathbf{v}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive homogeneity or positive scalability
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\| \le \|\mathbf{v}\| + \|\mathbf{u}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality
|}

The norm of a vector is also called its ''length'' or ''magnitude''.

In the case of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the function defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\|(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is a norm called the [[Euclidean norm]]. When the real numbers '''R''' are considered as the one-dimensional vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the absolute value is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], and is the ''p''-norm for any ''p''. In fact the absolute value is the &quot;only&quot; norm on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the sense that, for every norm ||&amp;thinsp;·&amp;thinsp;|| on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ||&amp;thinsp;''x''&amp;thinsp;|| = ||&amp;thinsp;1&amp;thinsp;||&amp;thinsp;·&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''x''&amp;thinsp;|. The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an [[inner product space]]. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the [[complex plane]] is identified with the [[Euclidean plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Smooth approximation==
The absolute value function does not have a derivative at ''x''=0. Sometimes, a smooth approximation is required that has to be smooth at ''x''=0. One of such approximations is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;|x| \approx \frac{2x}{\pi} \mathrm{arctan}(kx)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k''&gt;0. The approximation improves as ''k'' increases. ''k''=10 is good for many practical purposes.

An '''analog'''  or  '''analogue signal'''  is any [[continuous function|continuous]] [[Signal (circuit theory)|signal]] for which the time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., analogous to another time varying signal. It differs from a [[digital signal]] in terms of small fluctuations in the signal which are meaningful. Analog is usually thought of in an [[electricity|electrical]] context; however, [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]], [[pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], and other systems may also convey analog signals.

An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an [[aneroid barometer]] uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. Electrically, the property most commonly used is [[voltage]] followed closely by [[frequency]], [[Electric current|current]],  and [[electric charge|charge]].

Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as [[sound]], [[light]], [[temperature]], position, or [[pressure]], and is achieved using a [[transducer]]. An analog signal is one where at each point in time the value of the signal is significant, where as a digital signal is one where at each point in time, the value of the signal must be above or below some discrete threshold{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, [[sound]]) strike the diaphragm of a [[microphone]] which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone, or the voltage produced by a condensor microphone.  The voltage or the current is said to be an &quot;analog&quot; of the sound.

An analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution.  In practice an analog signal is subject to noise and a finite [[slew rate]].  Therefore, both analog and digital systems are subject to limitations in resolution and bandwidth. As analog systems become more complex, effects such as non-linearity and noise ultimately degrade analog resolution to such an extent that the performance of digital systems may surpass it.  Similarly, as digital systems become more complex, errors can occur in the digital data stream.  A comparable performing digital system is more complex and requires more bandwidth than its analog counterpart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  In analog systems, it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs.  However, in digital systems, degradation can not only be detected but corrected as well.

==Advantages==
The main advantage is the fine definition of the analog signal which has the potential for an infinite amount of signal resolution.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Digital Signal Processing: Instant access.&quot; Butterworth-Heinemann – Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to digital signals, analog signals are of higher density.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Concise Dictionary of Computing.&quot; Penguin Reference – Penguin Books – pages 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage with analog signals is that their processing may be achieved more simply than with the digital equivalent. An analog signal may be processed directly by analog components,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Digital Signal Processing: Instant access.&quot; Butterworth-Heinemann – pages 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; though some processes aren't available except in digital form.

==Disadvantages==
The primary disadvantage of analog signaling is that any system has [[Noise (physics)|noise]] – i.e., random unwanted variation. As the signal is copied and re-copied, or transmitted over long distances, these apparently random variations become dominant. Electrically, these losses can be diminished by shielding, good connections, and several cable types such as [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] or [[twisted pair]].

The effects of [[signal noise|noise]] create signal loss and distortion. This is impossible to recover, since amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise (distortion/interference) as well. Even if the resolution of an analog signal is higher than a comparable digital signal, the difference can be overshadowed by the noise in the signal.

Most of the analog systems also suffer from [[generation loss]].

==Modulation==
Another method of conveying an analog signal is to use [[modulation]]. In this, some base signal (e.g., a [[sinusoidal]] [[carrier wave]]) has one of its properties modulated: [[amplitude modulation]] involves altering the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage [[wave]]form by the source information, [[frequency modulation]] changes the [[frequency]]. Other techniques, such as changing the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the base signal also work.

[[Analog circuit]]s do not involve [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantisation]] of information into digital format. The concept being measured over the circuit, whether sound, light, pressure, temperature, or an exceeded limit, remains from end to end.

See [[digital]] for a discussion of ''digital vs. analog''.

'''Hercule Poirot''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɜr|ˈ|k|juː|l|_|p|w|ɑr|ˈ|oʊ}}; {{IPA-fr|ɛʁkyl pwaʁo}}) is a fictional French speaking [[Belgian people|Belgian]] detective created by [[Agatha Christie]]. Along with [[Miss Marple]], Poirot is one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, appearing in 33 novels and 51 short stories published between 1920 and 1975 and set in the same era.

Poirot has been portrayed on radio, on screen, for films and television, by various actors, including [[John Moffat (actor)|John Moffatt]], [[Albert Finney]], [[Peter Ustinov|Sir Peter Ustinov]], [[Ian Holm|Sir Ian Holm]], [[Tony Randall]], [[Alfred Molina]] and [[David Suchet]].

==Overview==
===Influences===
His name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time: [[Marie Belloc Lowndes]]' Hercule Popeau and [[Frank Howel Evans]]' Monsieur Poirot, a retired Belgian police officer living in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5054 |title=Agatha Christie (1890–1976) |accessdate=6 September 2006 |author=Chris Willis, London Metropolitan University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hercule Poirot's initials replicate that of the sauce which he happens to like, [[HP Brown Sauce]], as he comments in ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'': ''&quot;Ah yes, that is correct my initials do appear to be the same as such a fine delicacy, a good English creation&quot;.''
A more obvious influence on the early Poirot stories is that of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. In ''An Autobiography'' Christie admits, &quot;I was still writing in the  [[Sherlock Holmes]] tradition – eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a [[Inspector Lestrade|Lestrade]]-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced as the &quot;Introduction&quot; to Christie, Agatha. ''Hercule Poirot: The complete short stories'' (Harper Collins, 1999) p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; For his part Conan Doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[C. Auguste Dupin]], and his anonymous narrator, and basing his character Sherlock Holmes on [[Joseph Bell]], who in his use of &quot;ratiocination&quot; prefigured Poirot's reliance on his &quot;little grey cells&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See [[C. Auguste Dupin#Literary influence and significance]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Poirot also bears a striking resemblance to [[A. E. W. Mason]]'s fictional detective—[[Inspector Hanaud]] of the French Sûreté—who, first appearing in the 1910 novel ''[[At the Villa Rose (novel)|At the Villa Rose]]'', predates the writing of the first Poirot novel by six years. In chapter four of the second Inspector Hanaud novel, ''[[The House of the Arrow (novel)|The House of the Arrow]]'' (1924), Hanaud declares sanctimoniously to the heroine, &quot;You are wise, Mademoiselle…For, after all, I am Hanaud. There is only one.&quot;

Christie's Poirot was a francophone [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]], likely a [[Wallonia|Walloon]].&lt;ref&gt;Article ''Poirot'' : ''Nickname or variant on Poriaux(x) or Poireau'' in Jules Herbillon, Jean Germain,''Dictionnaire des noms de famille en Belgique romane'',Crédit communal, Bruxelles, 1996, p. 656. ISBN 978-2-87193-228-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the models mentioned above, Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 but not published until 1920. Not only was his Belgian nationality interesting because of Belgium's occupation by Germany (which provided a valid explanation of why such a skilled detective would be out of work and available to solve mysteries at an English country house&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;), but also at the time of Christie's writing, it was considered patriotic to express sympathy with the Belgians,&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Peterson (1939). ''Propaganda for War: The Campaign against American Neutrality, 1914–1917''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt; since the invasion of their country had constituted Britain's ''[[casus belli]]'' for entering World War I, and British wartime propaganda emphasized the &quot;[[Rape of Belgium]]&quot;.

===Popularity===
Poirot's first appearance was in ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' (published 1920) and his last in [[Curtain (novel)|''Curtain'']] (published 1975, the year before Christie died). On publication of the latter, Poirot was the only fictional character to be given an obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]; 6 August 1975 &quot;Hercule Poirot is Dead; Famed Belgian Detective&quot;.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.agathachristie.com/story-explorer/characters/poirot/ |title= Official Agatha Christie Website|accessdate=5 September 2006 |author= |date= | publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1930, Agatha Christie found Poirot &quot;insufferable&quot;, and by 1960 she felt that he was a &quot;detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep&quot;. Yet the public loved him, and Christie refused to kill him off, claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked, and what the public liked was Poirot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5054 |title= Agatha Christie (1890–1976) |accessdate=6 September 2006 |author=Chris Willis, London Metropolitan University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearance and personal attributes===
Here is how [[Captain Arthur Hastings]] first describes Poirot:
:&quot;He was hardly more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. Even if everything on his face was covered, the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible.

: The neatness of his attire was almost incredible; I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

This is how Agatha Christie describes Poirot in ''The Murder on the Orient Express'' in the initial pages:

: &quot;By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young Belgian lieutenant, resplendent in uniform, conversing with a small man (Hercule Poirot) muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache.&quot;

In the later books, the limp is not mentioned, which suggests it may have been a temporary wartime injury. Poirot has dark hair, which he dyes later in life&lt;ref&gt;as Hastings discovers in ''The A.B.C. Murders'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; (though many of his screen incarnations are portrayed as bald or balding), and green eyes that are repeatedly described as shining &quot;like a cat's&quot; when he is struck by a clever idea.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. &quot;For about ten minutes [Poirot] sat in dead silence […] and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener&quot; ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent mention is made of his patent-leather shoes, damage to which is frequently a subject of (for the reader, comical) misery on his part.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. &quot;Hercule Poirot looked down at the tips of his patent-leather shoes and sighed.&quot; &quot;The Apples of the Hesperides&quot; (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; Poirot's appearance, regarded as fastidious during his early career, is hopelessly out of fashion later in his career.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. &quot;And now here was the man himself. Really a most impossible person – the wrong clothes – button boots! an incredible moustache! Not his – Meredith Blake's kind of fellow at all.&quot; ''Five Little Pigs'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Poirot's most significant personal attributes is the sensitivity of his stomach:

:&quot;The plane dropped slightly. &quot;''Mon estomac'',&quot; thought Hercule Poirot, and closed his eyes determinedly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Death in the Clouds'', Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

He suffers from sea sickness,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;My stomach, it is not happy on the sea&quot; ''Evil under the Sun'', Chapter 8, iv&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Death in the Clouds'' believes that his air sickness prevents him from being more alert at the time of the murder.  Later in his life, we are told:

: &quot;Always a man who had taken his stomach seriously, he was reaping his reward in old age. Eating was not only a physical pleasure, it was also an intellectual research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Poirot is extremely punctual and carries a [[turnip pocket watch]] almost to the end of his career.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;he walked up the steps to the front door and pressed the bell, glancing as he did so at the neat wrist-watch which had at last replaced an old favourite – the large turnip-faced watch of early days. Yes, it was exactly nine-thirty. As ever, Hercule Poirot was exact to the minute.&quot; &quot;The Dream&quot; (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also fastidious about his personal finances, preferring to keep a bank balance of 444&amp;nbsp;pounds, 4 shillings, and 4 pence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Mine''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===

In ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', Poirot operates as a fairly conventional, clue-based detective, depending on logic, which is represented in his vocabulary by two common phrases: his use of &quot;[[Grey matter|the little grey cells]]&quot; and &quot;order and method&quot;. Irritating to Hastings is the fact that Poirot will sometimes conceal from him important details of his plans, as in [[The Big Four (novel)|''The Big Four'']] where Hastings is kept in the dark throughout the climax. This aspect of Poirot is less evident in the later novels, partly because there is rarely a [[narrator]] so there is no one for Poirot to mislead.

As early as ''Murder on the Links'', where he still largely depends on clues, Poirot mocks a rival &quot;bloodhound&quot; detective who focuses on the traditional trail of clues that had been established in detective fiction by the example of Sherlock Holmes: footprints, fingerprints and cigar ash. From this point on he establishes himself as a psychological detective who proceeds not by a painstaking examination of the crime scene, but by enquiring either into the nature of the victim or the psychology of the murderer. Central to his behaviour in the later novels is the underlying assumption that particular crimes are only committed by particular types of people.

Poirot's methods focus on getting people to talk. Early in the novels, he frequently casts himself in the role of &quot;Papa Poirot&quot;, a benign confessor, especially to young women. Later he lies freely in order to gain the confidences of other characters, either inventing his own reason for being interested in the case&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It has been said of Hercule Poirot by some of his friends and associates, at moments when he has maddened them most, the he prefers lies to truth and will go out of his way to gain his ends by elaborate false statements, rather than trust to the simple truth.&quot; ''Five Little Pigs'', Book One, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; or a family excuse&lt;ref&gt;e.g. &quot;After a careful study of the goods displayed in the window, Poirot entered and represented himself as desirous of purchasing a rucksack for a hypothetical nephew.&quot; ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; for pursuing a line of questioning.
:&quot;To this day Harold is not quite sure what made him suddenly pour out the whole story to a little man to whom he had only spoken a few minutes before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Stymphalean Birds&quot; (first published as &quot;The Vulture Women&quot; in 1939)&lt;/ref&gt;
Poirot is also willing to appear more foreign or vain than he really is in an effort to make people underestimate him. He admits as much:
: &quot;It is true that I can speak the exact, the idiomatic English. But, my friend, to speak the broken English is an enormous asset. It leads people to despise you. They say – a foreigner – he can't even speak English properly. […] Also I boast! An Englishman he says often, &quot;A fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much. […] And so, you see, I put people off their guard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Three Act Tragedy'', final chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later novels Christie often uses the word ''mountebank'' when Poirot is being assessed by other characters, showing that he has successfully passed himself off as a [[charlatan]] or fraud.

All these techniques help Poirot attain his principal target: &quot;For in the long run, either through a lie, or through truth, people were bound to give themselves away …&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''After the Funeral'', Chapter 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

After solving a case Poirot has the habit of collecting all people involved into a single room and explaining them the reasoning that led him to the solution, and revealing that the murderer is one of them.

== Recurring characters ==
===Arthur Hastings===
{{Main|Arthur Hastings}}
Hastings, a former British Army officer, first meets Poirot during Poirot's years as a police officer in Belgium and almost immediately after they both arrive in England.  He becomes Poirot's lifelong friend and appears in many of the novels and stories. Poirot regards Hastings as a poor private detective, not particularly intelligent, yet helpful in his way of being fooled by the criminal and for his tendency to unknowingly &quot;stumble&quot; onto the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |author=Bunson, Matthew |title=Hastings, Captain Arthur, O.B.E. |encyclopedia=The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hastings marries and has four children – two sons and two daughters.

Hastings is a man who is capable of great bravery and courage, facing death unflinchingly when confronted by [[The Big Four (novel)|''The Big Four'']] and possessing unwavering loyalty towards Poirot. However, when forced to choose between Poirot and his wife in that novel, he initially chooses to betray Poirot to the Big Four so that they would not torture and kill his wife. Later, though, he tells Poirot to draw back and escape the trap.

The two are an airtight team until Hastings meets and marries Dulcie Duveen, a beautiful music hall performer half his age. They later emigrate to Argentina, leaving Poirot behind as a &quot;very unhappy old man.&quot;  Poirot and Hastings are reunited in ''Curtain: Poirot's Last Case,'' having been earlier reunited in ''The ABC Murders'' and ''Dumb Witness'' when Hastings arrives in England for business.

===Ariadne Oliver===
{{Main|Ariadne Oliver}}
The detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Agatha Christie, she isn't overly fond of the detective she is most famous for creating – in Ariadne's case the [[Finland|Finnish]] sleuth [[Sven Hjerson]]. We never learn anything about her husband, but we do know that she hates alcohol and public appearances, and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of ''[[Hallowe'en Party]]''. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of the clothes and hats she wears. She has a maid called Maria who prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.

She has authored over fifty-six novels and she has a great dislike of people taking and modifying her story characters. She is also the only one in Poirot's universe to have noted that &quot;''It’s not natural for five or six people to be on the spot when B is murdered and all have a motive for killing B.''&quot; She first met Poirot in the story ''Cards on the Table'' and has been bothering him ever since.

===Miss Lemon===
Poirot's secretary, Miss Felicity Lemon, has few human weaknesses. The only two mistakes she is ever recorded making are a typing error during the events of ''Hickory Dickory Dock'' and the mis-mailing of an electricity bill, although in her defence she was worried about strange events surrounding her sister at the time. Poirot described her as being &quot;''Unbelievably ugly and incredibly efficient. Anything that she mentioned as worth consideration usually was worth consideration''.&quot; She is an expert on nearly everything and plans to create the perfect filing system. She also once worked for the government agent-turned-philanthropist, [[Parker Pyne]]. Whether this was during one of Poirot’s numerous retirements or before she entered his employment is unknown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  In ''[[The Agatha Christie Hour]]'', she was portrayed by British actress [[Angela Easterling]], while in ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'', she was portrayed by singer and guitarist [[Pauline Moran]].

===Chief Inspector Japp===
{{Main|Chief Inspector Japp}}
Japp is an Inspector from [[Scotland Yard]] and appears in many of the stories, trying to solve the cases Poirot is working on. Japp is an outgoing, loud and sometimes inconsiderate man by nature and his relationship with the bourgeois Belgian is one of the stranger aspects of Poirot’s world. He first met Poirot in Belgium, 1904, during the Abercrombie Forgery and later that year joined forces again to hunt down a criminal known as Baron Altara. They also meet in England where Poirot often helps Japp solve a case and lets him take the credit in return for special favours. These favours usually entail being supplied with cases that would interest him.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Arthur Hastings in Chapter 9 of ''The Big Four''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'', Japp was portrayed by [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]].

== Hercule Poirot's life ==
{{In-universe|date=October 2009}}
&quot;I suppose you know pretty well everything there is to know about Poirot's family by this time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sheppard in Chapter 21 of ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd''&lt;/ref&gt; Christie made a point of having Poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background in order to assist him in obtaining information relevant to a particular case. In chapter 21 of ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', for example, Poirot talks about a mentally disabled nephew: this proves to be a ruse so that he can find out about homes for the mentally unfit, and in ''Dumb Witness'', Poirot tells of an elderly invalid mother as a pretence to investigate the local nurses.

The character was in the Brussels police force by 1893.&lt;ref&gt;as mentioned in ''Peril at End House'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; A brief passage in ''The Big Four'' furnishes possible information about Poirot's birth or at least childhood in or near the town of [[Spa, Belgium]]: &quot;But we did not go into Spa itself. We left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills, till we reached a little hamlet and an isolated white villa high on the hillside.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Big Four'', Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; Christie strongly implies that this &quot;quiet retreat in the Ardennes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Big Four, Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; near Spa is the Poirot family home. Christie is purposefully vague, as Poirot is thought to be elderly even in the early Poirot novels, and in ''An Autobiography'' she admitted that she already imagined him to be an old man in 1920. At the time, of course, she had no idea she would be going on writing Poirot books for many decades to come.

Christie wrote that Poirot is a Roman Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hercule Poirot was a Catholic by birth.&quot; &quot;The Apples of the Hesperides&quot; (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; and gave her character a strong sense of Catholic morality later in works.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Taken at the Flood'', Book II, Chapter 6 Poirot goes into church to pray and happens across a suspect with whom he briefly discusses ideas of sin and confession.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie wrote little of Poirot’s childhood though in ''Three Act Tragedy'' she writes that he comes from a large family with little wealth.

===Poirot’s police years===
:&quot;Gustave […] was not a policeman. I have dealt with policemen all my life and I ''know''. He could pass as a detective to an outsider but not to a man who was a policeman himself.&quot; — Hercule Poirot in &quot;The Erymanthian Boar&quot; (1940).

As an adult, Poirot joined the Belgian police force. Very little mention is made in Christie's work about this part of his life, but in &quot;The Nemean Lion&quot; (1939) Poirot himself refers to a Belgian case of his in which &quot;a wealthy soap manufacturer […] poisoned his wife in order to be free to marry his secretary&quot;. We do not know whether this case resulted in a successful prosecution or not; moreover, Poirot is not above lying in order to produce a particular effect in the person to whom he is speaking, so this evidence is not reliable.

Inspector Japp gives some insight into Poirot's career with the Belgian police when introducing him to a colleague:
:&quot;You've heard me speak of Mr Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I worked together – the Abercrombie forgery case – you remember he was run down in Brussels. Ah, those were the days Moosier. Then, do you remember &quot;Baron&quot; Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in Antwerp – thanks to Mr. Poirot here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;
Perhaps this is enough evidence to suggest that Poirot's police career was a successful one.

In the short story ''The Chocolate Box'' (1923) Poirot provides [[Captain Arthur Hastings]] with an account of what he considers to be his only failure. Poirot admits that he has failed to solve a crime &quot;innumerable&quot; times:
:&quot;I have been called in too late. Very often another, working towards the same goal, has arrived there first. Twice I have been struck down with illness just as I was on the point of success.&quot;
Nevertheless, he regards the case in &quot;The Chocolate Box&quot;, which took place in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;The date is given in ''Peril at End House'', Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt; as his only actual failure of detection. Again, Poirot is not reliable as a narrator of his personal history and there is no evidence that Christie sketched it out in any depth.

It was also in this period that Poirot shot a man who was firing from a roof onto the public below.&lt;ref&gt;''Curtain: Poirot's Last Case'', Postscript&lt;/ref&gt;

Poirot had retired from the Belgian police force by the time he met Hastings in 1916 on the case retold in ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles''.

=== Career as a private detective ===
:&quot;I had called in at my friend Poirot's rooms to find him sadly overworked. So much had he become the rage that every rich woman who had mislaid a bracelet or lost a pet kitten rushed to secure the services of the great Hercule Poirot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Double Sin&quot; (original version published in 1928)&lt;/ref&gt;
During World War I, Poirot left [[Belgium]] for [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as a [[refugee]]. It was here, on 16 July 1916, that he again met his lifelong friend, Captain Arthur Hastings, and solved the first of his cases to be published: ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles''.&lt;ref&gt;It is clear that Hastings and Poirot are already friends when they meet in Chapter 2 of the novel, because Hastings tells Cynthia that he has not seen him for &quot;some years&quot;. The date of 1916 for the case, and the fact that Hastings had met Poirot in Belgium, is given in ''Curtain: Poirot's Last Case'', Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After that case Poirot apparently came to the attention of the British secret service, and undertook cases for the British government, including foiling the attempted abduction of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Recounted in &quot;The Kidnapped Prime Minister&quot;. The events in the story are immediately connected with the First World War, and feature an &quot;Allied Conference&quot; at [[Versailles]] that is probably meant to be understood as the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Conference]] of 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; Readers were told that the British authority learned about Poirot's keen investigative ability from certain Belgian royals.

After the war Poirot became a free agent and began undertaking civilian cases. He moved into what became both his home and work address, 56B [[Florin Court|Whitehaven Mansions]], [[Charterhouse Square]], [[Smithfield, London]] W1.&lt;ref&gt;(Coordinates 51.520948,-0.098619) Hastings first visits the flat at Whitehaven Mansions when he returns to England in June 1935 from South America. ''The A.B.C. Murders'', Chapter 1 (It is a plot point in the novel that the flat is at Whitehaven Mansions because a letter to Poirot is misaddressed.) In ''Cat Among the Pigeons'', Chapter 17, III, the address is given as &quot;228 Whitehouse Mansions&quot;. Given the similarity in the names it is not impossible that the same address was meant. In ''The Clocks'', Chapter 14, the address is given as 203, Whitehaven Mansions.&lt;/ref&gt; It was chosen by Poirot for its symmetry. (This building was in fact built in 1936, decades later than Poirot fictionally moved in.) His first case was &quot;The Affair at the Victory Ball&quot;, which saw Poirot enter the high society and begin his career as a [[private detective]].

Between the world wars, Poirot travelled all over Europe and the Middle East investigating crimes and murders. Most of his cases happened during this period and he was at the height of his powers at this point in his life. ''The Murder On the Links'' saw the Belgian pit his grey cells against a French murderer. In the Middle East he solved the cases of ''Death on the Nile'', and ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' with ease and even survived ''An Appointment with Death''. As he passed through Eastern Europe on his return trip, he solved ''The Murder on the Orient Express''. However he did not travel to the Americas or Australia, probably due to his sea sickness.
:&quot;It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The ''mal de mer'' – it is horrible suffering!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Poirot, in &quot;The Kidnapped Prime Minister&quot; (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff, a glamorous jewel thief. The history of the Countess is, like Poirot's, steeped in mystery. She claims to have been a member of the Russian aristocracy before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and suffered greatly as a result, but how much of that story is true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff has told several wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.
:&quot;It is the misfortune of small, precise men always to hanker after large and flamboyant women.  Poirot had never been able to rid himself of the fatal fascination that the Countess held for him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Capture of Cerebus&quot; (1947) The first sentence quoted is also a close paraphrase of something said to Poirot by Hastings in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although letting the Countess escape is morally questionable, that impulse to take the law into his own hands was far from unique. In ''The Nemean Lion'', he sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, and saved her from having to face justice by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who himself was plotting murder and was unwise enough to let Poirot discover this. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff before her dog kidnapping campaign came to an end. In ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'' he allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then ensured the truth was never known to spare the feelings of the murderer's relatives. In ''The Augean Stables'' he helped the government to cover up vast corruption.

It could be suggested that in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' Poirot allows the murderers to escape justice as well, after he discovers that twelve different people stabbed the victim – Mr. Ratchett – in his sleep. This is because they were only carrying out the sentence of death that he would have faced had he not been acquitted on a technicality. It may also be because, since 12 people stabbed the victim, none was certain who delivered the killing blow. Ultimately a falsehood is made up to tell the police and the 12 perpetrators are allowed to go free.

After his cases in the Middle East, Poirot returned to Britain. Apart from some of the so-called &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot; (see next section) he very rarely travelled abroad during his later career.

=== Retirement ===
:&quot;That’s the way of it. Just a case or two, just one case more – the Prima Donna’s farewell performance won’t be in it with yours, Poirot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Burton in the Preface to ''The Labours of Hercules'' (1947).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of confusion about Poirot's retirement. Most of the cases covered by Poirot's private detective agency take place before his retirement to grow [[Squash (plant)|marrows]], at which time he solves ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. It has been said that twelve cases related in ''The Labours of Hercules'' (1947) must refer to a different retirement, but the fact that Poirot specifically says that he intends to grow marrows indicates that these stories also take place before ''Roger Ackroyd'', and presumably Poirot closed his agency once he had completed them. There is specific mention in &quot;The Capture of Cerberus&quot; to the fact that there has been a gap of twenty years between Poirot's previous meeting with Countess Rossakoff and this one. If the ''Labours'' precede the events in ''Roger Ackroyd'', then the Roger Ackroyd case must have taken place around twenty years ''later'' than it was published, and so must any of the cases that refer to it.  One alternative would be that having failed to grow marrows once, Poirot is determined to have another go, but this is specifically denied by Poirot himself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clocks'', Chapter 13: in response to the suggestion that he might take up gardening in his retirement, Poirot answers &quot;Once the vegetable marrows, yes – but never again&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in &quot;The Erymanthian Boar&quot;, a character is said to have been turned out of Austria by the Nazis, implying that the events of [[The Labours of Hercules]] took place after 1937. Another alternative would be to suggest that the Preface to the ''Labours'' takes place at one date but that the labours are completed over a matter of twenty years. None of the explanations is especially attractive.

In terms of a rudimentary chronology, Poirot speaks of retiring to grow marrows in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four'' (1927), which places that novel out of published order before Roger Ackroyd. He declines to solve a case for the Home Secretary because he is retired in Chapter One of ''Peril at End House'' (1932). He is certainly retired at the time of ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1935) but he does not enjoy his retirement and comes repeatedly out of it thereafter when his curiosity is engaged. Nevertheless, he continues to employ his secretary, Miss Lemon, at the time of the cases retold in ''Hickory Dickory Dock'' and ''Dead Man's Folly'', which take place in the mid-1950s. It is therefore better to assume that Christie provided no authoritative chronology for Poirot's retirement, but assumed that he could either be an active detective, a consulting detective or a retired detective as the needs of the immediate case required.

One thing that is consistent about Poirot's retirement is that his fame declines during it, so that in the later novels he is often disappointed when characters (especially younger characters) recognize neither him nor his name:
:&quot;I should, perhaps, Madame, tell you a little more about myself. I am ''Hercule Poirot''.&quot;
: The revelation left Mrs Summerhayes unmoved.
: &quot;What a lovely name,&quot; she said kindly. &quot;Greek, isn't it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post World War II ===
:&quot;He, I knew, was not likely to be far from his headquarters. The time when cases had drawn him from one end of England to the other was past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, in Chapter One of ''The Big Four''&lt;/ref&gt;

Poirot is less active during the cases that take place at the end of his career. Beginning with ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1934), Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a sub-genre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the periphery of events. In novels such as ''Taken at the Flood'', ''After the Funeral'' and ''Hickory Dickory Dock'' he is even less in evidence, frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character. In ''Cat Among the Pigeons'' Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought. Whether this was a reflection of his age or of the fact that Christie was by now heartily sick of him it is difficult to assess. There is certainly a case for saying that ''[[Crooked House]]'' (1949) and ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (1957), which are not Poirot novels at all but so easily could have been, represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of Poirot himself within the Poirot sequence.

Towards the end of his career it becomes clear that Poirot's retirement is no longer a convenient fiction. He assumes a genuinely inactive lifestyle during which he concerns himself with studying famous unsolved cases of the past and reading detective novels. He even writes a book about mystery fiction in which he deals sternly with [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Wilkie Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Third Girl'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a more appropriate puzzle, he solves such inconsequential domestic problems as the presence of three pieces of orange peel in his umbrella stand.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clocks'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Poirot (and, it is reasonable to suppose, his creator)&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pale Horse'', Chapter 1, the novel's narrator, Mark Easterbrook, disapprovingly describes a typical &quot;Chelsea girl&quot; in much the same terms that Poirot uses in Chapter 1 of ''Third Girl'', suggesting that the condemnation of fashion is authorial.&lt;/ref&gt; becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up and coming generation's young people. In ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', he investigates the strange goings on in a student hostel, while in the ''Third Girl'' he is forced into contact with the smart set of Chelsea youths. In the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties, he proves himself once again, but has become heavily reliant on other investigators (especially the private investigator, Mr. Goby) who provide him with the clues that he can no longer gather for himself.
: &quot;''You're too old''. Nobody told me you were so old. I really don't want to be rude but – there it is. ''You're too old''. I'm really very sorry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Norma Restarick to Poirot in ''Third Girl'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, during this time his physical characteristics also change dramatically, and by the time Arthur Hastings meets Poirot again in Curtain, he looks very different from his previous appearances, having become thin with age and with obviously dyed hair.

=== Death ===
Poirot dies from complications of a heart condition at the end of ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain: Poirot's Last Case]]'', where he moves his [[amyl nitrite]] pills out of his reach, possibly out of guilt because he was forced to become the murderer in ''Curtain'', although it was for the benefit of others. The 'murderer' he was hunting had never expressly killed anyone himself, but subtly and psychologically, he had manipulated others to kill for him. Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted since he never killed anyone in the eyes of the law. It is revealed at the end of ''Curtain'' that he fakes his need for a wheelchair (he wants to fool people into believing that he is suffering from [[arthritis]] to give the impression that he is more infirm than he is). His last recorded words are &quot;''Cher ami!''&quot;, spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room, though Poirot did speak subsequently to the 'murderer'. Poirot is then buried at Styles. His funeral is arranged by his best friend Hastings and his daughter, Judith, with Hastings reasoning that &quot;Here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country. He was to lie here at the last.&quot;

While Poirot's actual death and funeral occurred in &quot;Curtain&quot;, years after his retirement from active investigation, it was not the first time Hastings attended the funeral of his best friend. In &quot;The Big Four&quot; (1927) Poirot feigned his death and subsequent funeral in order to launch a surprise attack on the Big Four.

==Major novels==
{{Main|Hercule Poirot in literature}}
The Poirot books take readers through the whole of his life in England, from the first book (''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]''), where he is a refugee staying at Styles, to the last Poirot book (''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''), where he visits Styles once again before his death. In between, Poirot solves cases outside England as well, including his most famous case, ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934).

Hercule Poirot became famous with the publication, in 1926, of ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', whose surprising solution proved controversial. The novel is still among the most famous of all detective novels: [[Edmund Wilson]] alludes to it in the title of his well-known attack on detective fiction, &quot;Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot;  Aside from ''Roger Ackroyd'', the most critically acclaimed Poirot novels appeared from 1932 to 1942, including such acknowledged classics as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The ABC Murders]]'' (1935), ''[[Cards on the Table]]'' (1936), and ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937).  The last of these, a tale of multiple homicide upon a Nile steamer, was judged by the celebrated detective novelist [[John Dickson Carr]] to be among the ten greatest mystery novels of all time.

The 1942 novel ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' (aka ''Murder in Retrospect''), in which Poirot investigates a murder committed sixteen years before by analysing various accounts of the tragedy, is a ''[[Rashomon (movie)|Rashomon]]''-like performance that critic and mystery novelist [[Robert Barnard]] called the best of the Christie novels.

==Portrayals==
===Stage===
The first actor to portray Hercule Poirot was [[Charles Laughton]]. He appeared on the West End in 1928 in the play ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]'' which had been adapted by [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] from the novel ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''.

===Film===
====Austin Trevor====
[[Austin Trevor]] debuted the role of Poirot on screen in the 1931 British film ''[[Alibi (1931 film)|Alibi]]''. The film was based on the stage play. Trevor reprised the role of Poirot twice, in ''[[Black Coffee (1931 film)|Black Coffee]]'' and ''[[Lord Edgware Dies (1934 film)|Lord Edgware Dies]]''. Trevor said once that he was probably cast as Poirot simply because he could do a French accent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poirot.us/ptvfilm.html TV &amp; Film page] at the Hercule Poirot Central website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie S. Hiscott]] directed the first two films, with [[Henry Edwards (actor)|Henry Edwards]] taking over for the third.

====Albert Finney====
[[Albert Finney]] played Poirot in 1974 in the cinematic version of ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]''. It was a very faithful adaptation of the novel. Finney is, so far, the only actor to receive an [[Academy Award]] nomination for playing Poirot, though he did not win.

====Peter Ustinov====
[[File:Ustinov is Poirot.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter Ustinov]] as Poirot in ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'']]
[[Peter Ustinov]] played Poirot a total of six times, starting with ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978). He reprised the role in ''[[Evil Under the Sun (1982 film)|Evil Under the Sun]]'' (1982) and ''[[Appointment with Death (film)|Appointment with Death]]'' (1988).

When Christie's daughter, [[Rosalind Hicks]], observed to Ustinov that Poirot did not look like him, Ustinov quipped &quot;He does now!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapdig.com/?title=Hercule_Poirot Web page] at mapdig.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared again as Poirot in three [[made-for-television]] movies: ''[[Thirteen at Dinner]]'' (1985), ''[[Dead Man's Folly]]'' (1986), and ''[[Three Act Tragedy|Murder in Three Acts]]'' (1986). Unlike earlier adaptations that were set during the time in which the novels were written, however, these TV movies were set in the contemporary era. The first of these was based on ''[[Lord Edgware Dies]]'' and was made by [[Warner Brothers]]. It also starred [[Faye Dunaway]] and David Suchet as Inspector Japp, just before he himself began to play the famous detective. (Ironically, it is reputed that David Suchet highlights his performance as Japp to be &quot;possibly the worst performance of [his] career.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strandmag.com/suchet.htm Web page] on [[David Suchet]] at strandmag.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====
* [[Tony Randall]], ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965) (Film, also known as ''The ABC Murders''). This was more a satire on Poirot than a straightforward adaptation, and was greatly changed from the original. Much of the story, set in contemporary times, was played for comedy, with Poirot investigating the murders while evading the attempts by Hastings ([[Robert Morley]]) and the police to get him out of England and back to Belgium.
* [[Dudley Jones]], ''[[The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It]]'' (1977), a spoof of [[Sherlock Holmes]] by [[John Cleese]].

===Animated===
In 2004, [[NHK]] (a Japanese TV network) produced a 39 episode anime series titled ''[[Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple]]'', as well as a [[manga]] series under the same title released in 2005.

The series, adapting several of the best-known Poirot and Marple stories, ran from 4 July 2004 through 15 May 2005, and has since been shown in repeated reruns on [[NHK]] and other networks in Japan. Poirot was voiced by [[Kōtarō Satomi|Satomi Kōtarō]] and Miss Marple was voiced by [[Kaoru Yachigusa|Yachigusa Kaoru]].

===Radio===
There have been a number of radio adaptations of the Poirot stories, most recently twenty seven of them on [[BBC Radio 4]] (and regularly repeated on [[BBC 7]]), starring [[John Moffat (actor)|John Moffatt]] ([[Maurice Denham]] and [[Peter Sallis]] have also played Poirot on [[BBC Radio 4]], Mr. Denham in ''[[The Mystery of the Blue Train]]'' and Mr. Sallis in ''[[Hercule Poirot's Christmas]]'').

===Parodies and references===

[[File:HPCC.jpg|thumb|Poirot, as he appeared in volume 3 of ''[[Case Closed]]'']]

In Neil Simon's ''[[Murder By Death]]'', James Coco plays a character named &quot;Milo Perrier&quot; who is a parody of Poirot.  The film also features parodies of [[Charlie Chan]], [[Sam Spade]], [[Nick and Nora Charles]], and [[Miss Marple]].

Poirot was also parodied in ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' episode &quot;[[Daylight Robbery on the Orient Express]]&quot;.

The British television show ''[[Count Duckula]]'' features a parody of Hercule Poirot (in passing) known as Mr. Hercules Parrot, arm in arm with a character called Miss Marbles.

An episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' featured [[Yakko Warner]] as &quot;Hercule Yakko&quot;. The episode involved the theft of a diamond on a cruise ship, involving much of the series' cast as suspects.

In the movie ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'', Hercule Poirot ([[Hugh Laurie]]) is about to blame a weapons-packing [[Emma Bunton]], but after she flashes him an innocent smile, Poirot instead accuses an innocent man of the crime.

In ''[[Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened]]'', Poirot appears as a young boy on the train transporting Holmes and Watson. Holmes helps the boy in opening a puzzle-box, with Watson giving the boy advice about using his &quot;little grey cells&quot;, giving the impression that Poirot first heard the line here. Poirot would go on to use the &quot;little grey cells&quot; line countless times throughout Agatha Christie's fiction.

In an episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', [[Jason Alexander]] played Hercule Poirot, believed by the Muppets to be [[Hercules]] Poirot, with superhuman powers.

The Belgian brewery Brasserie Ellezelloise makes a highly rated stout called ''Hercule''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasserie-ellezelloise.be/bieres-uk.shtml#L%27Hercule |title=The Brasserie Ellezelloise's Hercule |publisher=Brasserie-ellezelloise.be |date= |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a moustachioed caricature of Hercule Poirot on the label.

[[Dave Stone]] has created two parodies of Poirot named Dupont. The first, Andre Dupont, appears in the ''[[Detective-Judge Armitage]]'' story ''Dowager Duchess of Ghent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tattooine/sputnik/53/armitage.htm/ |title=Armitage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, Emile Dupont, appears in the [[Bernice Summerfield]] novel ''[[Ship of Fools (Stone novel)|Ship of Fools]]''.

The &quot;decipherer of enigmas&quot; in [[José Carlos Somoza]]'s novel ''[[The Athenian Murders]]'' is named Herakles Pontor.

In the English version of ''[[Geronimo Stilton]]'' series, the main protagonist has a friend named &quot;Hercule Poirat&quot;.

In the final host segment of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'''s episode &quot;[[The Rebel Set]]&quot;, Tom Servo dresses up as Poirot and impersonates him in an attempt to discover the identity of B-movie actor Merritt Stone.

In the anime and manga series ''[[Detective Conan]]'', [[Mouri Kogoro]]'s detective agency is located above the Poirot café. He's also highlighted in volume 3 of the manga, in &quot;Gosho Aoyama's Mystery Library&quot;, a section of the graphic novels (usually the last page) where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from literature.

In the Israeli sitcom ''[[The Pajamas]]'', one of the characters of Kobi is a grotesque policeman named 'Marcel Fuero', as a reference to Poirot ('Poirot' and 'Fuero' are written the same way in Hebrew, פוארו).

In the Portuguese New Year's special comedy show ''[[Crime na Pensão Estrelinha]]'' (starring Portuguese top comedian [[Herman José]]), there is a character named Hércules Pirô. Aside from the clear reference to Agatha Christie's character, 'Pirô' also is a misspelling of the word 'pirou', which is Portuguese slang for 'has gone crazy'.

In one episode of ''[[Freakazoid!]]'', after a commercial break the title character finds himself in an old fashioned study where a familiar looking detective called &quot;Swoirot&quot; is deducing the solution to a crime with typical suspects, such as a butler and an heiress. Freakazoid tells the viewer &quot;I think I'm on the wrong channel.&quot;

Poirot features in two sketches in ''[[That Mitchell And Webb Look]]'', both times played by [[David Mitchell (actor)|David Mitchell]]. In the first, Poirot is asked by the captain of a ship to investigate a murder that has taken place on board (The gag being that Mitchell is playing both Poirot and the captain simultaneously via [[split screen (filming)|split screen]], prompting [[Robert Webb]] to complain about the scene), and in the second, Poirot claims to have identified a murderer based on a shade of lipstick on a cigarette, but admits after the killer starts to talk in 'the evil voice'- a voice used only by murderers- that he actually had no evidence until the killer used 'the evil voice', noting after the killer commits suicide- having become increasingly sexier and more evil as the scene continues-, that it's easier this way as some courts don't accept 'the evil voice' as evidence.

'''Jane Marple''', usually referred to as '''Miss Marple''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in twelve of [[Agatha Christie]]'s crime novels. Miss Marple is an elderly [[spinster]] who lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an [[amateur]] [[detective]]. She is one of the most famous of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen. Her first published  appearance was in issue 350 of ''[[The Royal Magazine]]'' for December 1927 with the first printing of the short story &quot;[[The Thirteen Problems#The Tuesday Night Club|The Tuesday Night Club]]&quot;, which later became the first chapter of ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932). Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930.

==Character==
[[Image:Miss Marple First Image.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by Gilbert Wilkinson of Miss Marple from the December 1927 issue of ''The Royal Magazine'' and the first-known image of the character (See ''[[The Thirteen Problems#First publication of stories|The Thirteen Problems]]'')]]

Miss Jane Marple is an elderly lady who lives in the little English village  [[St. Mary Mead]]. Superficially stereotypical, she is dressed neatly in [[Harris Tweed|tweed]] and is frequently seen knitting or pulling weeds in her garden.  Miss Marple sometimes comes across as confused or &quot;fluffy&quot;, but when it comes to solving mysteries, she has a sharp logical mind, and an almost unmatched understanding of human nature with all its weaknesses, strengths, quirks and foibles. In the [[detective fiction|detective story]] tradition, she often embarrasses the local &quot;professional&quot; police by solving mysteries that have them stumped.

Tape recordings Christie made in the mid 1960s reveal that 'Miss Marple' was partly based on Christie's [[Grandparent|grandmother]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html &quot;Agatha Christie used her grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal&quot;], Stephen Adams, [[The Daily Telegraph]], 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no definitive source for the derivation of the name 'Marple'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheshire Life&quot;&gt;[http://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/main-menu-cheshire-county-life-was-miss-marple-born-in-cheshire?--37029 &quot;Was Miss Marple Born in cheshire?&quot;], Cheshire Life, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common explanation suggests that the name was taken from the [[Marple railway station|railway station in Marple]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], through which Christie passed, with the alternative account that Christie took it from the home of a Marple family who lived at Marple Hall, near her sister Madge's home at Abney Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheshire Life&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poirot.us/mprofile.php &quot;Marple's Profile&quot;], Hercule Poirot Central, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.&lt;/ref&gt; Agatha Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources: Miss Marple was &quot;the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my grandmother's Ealing cronies – old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl&quot;. Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.  When Michael Morton adapted Roger Ackroyd for the stage, he removed the character of Caroline replacing her with a young girl.  This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.

The character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'', is markedly different from how she appears in later books.  This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books she becomes more modern and a kinder person.

Miss Marple never married and has no close living relatives.  ''Vicarage'' introduced Miss Marple's nephew, the &quot;well-known author&quot; Raymond West. His wife Joan (initially called Joyce), a modern artist, was introduced in 1933 in ''The Thirteen Problems''. Raymond tends to be overconfident in himself and underestimates Miss Marple's mental powers. A niece named
Mabel, widow of the mysteriously dead Geoffrey Denham, stars in the 1927 short story &quot;The Thumb Mark of Saint Peter.&quot; Miss Marple also employs young women from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for &quot;service&quot; as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper &quot;faithful Florence.&quot; In her later years, Miss Marple has a live-in companion named Cherry Baker, who was first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side To Side''.

Miss Marple is able to solve difficult crimes not only because of her shrewd intelligence, but because St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. No crime can arise without reminding Miss Marple of some parallel incident in the history of her time.  Miss Marple's acquaintances are sometimes bored by her frequent analogies to people and events from St. Mary Mead, but these analogies often lead Miss Marple to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. Although she looks like a sweet, frail old woman, Miss Marple is not afraid of dead bodies and is not easily intimidated.  She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand.

Miss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'',1964). She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that, in her distant youth, Miss Marple spent time in Europe at a finishing school. She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home amongst them; Miss Marple would probably have been happy to describe herself as a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. In ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (1952), it is mentioned that Miss Marple grew up in a cathedral close, and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Louise Serrocold. (Ruth, prevailing on Miss Marple's long affection for them, arranges for Miss Marple to investigate Ruth's belief that Carrie Louise is in danger of her life.) Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. This education, history, and background are hinted at in the Margaret Rutherford films (see below), in which Miss Marple mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).

Christie wrote a concluding novel to her Marple series, ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'', in 1940. She locked it away in a bank vault so it would be safe should she be killed in [[the Blitz]].  The novel was not published until shortly after Christie's death in 1976, some thirty-six years after it was originally written.

While Miss Marple is described as 'an old lady' in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in &quot;At Bertram's Hotel&quot;, where it is said she visited the hotel when she was 14 and almost 60 years have passed since then.  Excluding &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's son. At the end of ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Vicar's wife is pregnant. In ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the son is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of aging are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a vacation after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' or finding in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'' that  because of poor eyesight she can no longer knit.

===Margaret Rutherford===
Although popular from her first appearance in 1930, Jane Marple had to wait thirty-two years for her first [[film|big-screen]] appearance.  When she made it, the results were found disappointing to Christie purists and Christie herself; nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Margaret Rutherford.

''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Dame [[Margaret Rutherford]]. She presented the character as a bold old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels.  This first film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series.  In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy does not see anything because there is no Mrs. McGillicuddy.  Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers.  Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Joan Hickson played the part of the home help in this film and can claim to have appeared in two Miss Marple series.

The other Rutherford films (all directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 Hercule Poirot novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (In this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964).  The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to ''The Mousetrap''.  Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the spoof Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).

The music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]] and is still played on radio today.  The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations on each. The main theme has a distinct 1960's feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[Violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]] after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; in 1957 and years previously [[Stanley Black]] had used [[Ron Goodwin]] as his orchestrator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006109/bio&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford, who was 70 years old when the first film was made, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]] appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'.  The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork.  Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones.  Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes.

===Ita Ever===
In 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the Russian language film adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS Mystery. Miss Marple&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple/links.html PBS Mystery. Miss Marple]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jennifer Garner===
In March 2011 it was reported that [[The Walt Disney Company]] had acquired the cinematic rights to the Miss Marple character, and was planning a contemporary adaptation to be set in the United States.

==Television, stage and radio adaptations==
===Television===
American TV was the setting for the first dramatic portrayal of Miss Marple with [[Gracie Fields]], the legendary British actress, playing her in a 1956 episode of ''Goodyear TV Playhouse'' based on ''A Murder Is Announced'', the 1950 Christie novel.

In 1970, the character of Miss Marple was portrayed by [[Inge Langen]] in a West German television adaptation of ''The Murder at the Vicarage '' (''Mord im Pfarrhaus'').&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS Mystery. Miss Marple&quot;/&gt;

American stage and screen legend [[Helen Hayes]] portrayed Miss Marple in two American made-for-TV movies, both for [[CBS]]: ''A Caribbean Mystery'' (1983) and ''Murder with Mirrors'' (1984). [[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy.

From 1984 to 1992, the [[BBC]] adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled ''[[Miss Marple (TV series)|Miss Marple]]''. [[Joan Hickson]] played the lead role. (Coincidentally, Hickson had played a cook in the first film in which Margaret Rutherford played Miss Marple.) These programs, which are actually a set of 12 feature-length TV movies rather than a TV series in the usual sense, followed the plots of the original novels more closely than previous film and television adaptations had. Hickson has come to be regarded by many as the definitive Miss Marple (indeed Agatha Christie herself once remarked years earlier that she would like Joan Hickson to play Miss Marple).&lt;ref&gt;Haining, Peter. Agatha Christie - Murder in Four Acts (Page 140). 1990. Virgin Books. ISBN 1-85227-273-2
&lt;/ref&gt;

Listing of the TV series featuring Joan Hickson:

*''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1984)
*''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1985)
*''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' (1985)
*''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1985)
*''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1986) - BAFTA nomination
*''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1987)
*''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1987)
*''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1987) - BAFTA nomination
*''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1987)
*''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1989)
*''[[They Do It with Mirrors|They Do It With Mirrors]]'' (1991)
*''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (1992)

[[Angela Lansbury]], who had played Miss Marple in the movie, ''The Mirror Crack'd'', directed by Lewis Gilbert, went on to star in the TV series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' as [[Jessica Fletcher]], a mystery novelist who also solves crimes. The character of Jessica Fletcher is thought{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to be based on a combination of Miss Marple, Agatha Christie herself, and another Christie character, [[Ariadne Oliver]], who often appears in the [[Hercule Poirot]] mysteries.

Beginning in 2004, [[ITV]] broadcast a series of adaptations of Agatha Christie's books under the title ''Agatha Christie's Marple'', usually referred to as ''[[Marple (TV series)|Marple]].'' [[Geraldine McEwan]] starred in the first three series. [[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season. The adaptions are notable for changing the plots and characters of the original books (e.g., incorporating lesbian affairs, changing killer identities, re-naming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature).

From 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''[[Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple]]'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]]. Miss Marple's voice is provided by [[Kaoru Yachigusa]].

===Stage===
In 1974, Barbara Mullen played Miss Marple in &quot;Murder at the Vicarage&quot; at the Savoy Theatre, London.
In September 1977, veteran actress and authoress [[Dulcie Gray]] played the Miss Marple character in a stage adaptation of ''A Murder Is Announced'' at the Vaudeville Theatre in London, England&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/announced/notes.html |title=Mystery! &amp;#124; A murder is announced &amp;#124; Production notes |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; that featured also [[Dinah Sheridan]], [[Eleanor Summerfield]], [[Patricia Brake]] and [[Barbara Flynn]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaudeville Theatre programme, No.29 February 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Month header}}
{{CalendarCustom|month=April|show_year=true|float=right}}
'''April''' {{audio|En-us-April.ogg|(pronunciation)}} is the fourth [[month]] of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s, and one of four months with a length of 30 [[days]]. April was originally the second month of the [[Roman calendar]], before January and February were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&amp;nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&amp;nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29 days. The derivation of the name ([[Latin]] ''Aprilis'') is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the Latin ''aperire'', &quot;to open,&quot; in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to &quot;open,&quot; which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of ἁνοιξις (anoixis) (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the ''Festum Veneris et Fortunae Virilis'' being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month Aphrilis, from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''Apru''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. &quot;Monate&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''Oster-monath'' or ''Eostur-monath''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''Eostur'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. [[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth. In [[China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to our April{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The Finns called (and still call) this month ''huhtikuu'', or 'Burnwood Month', when the wood for beat and burn clearing of farmland was felled.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The &quot;Days of April&quot; (''journées d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July_Monarchy#April_1834_insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''procès d'avril''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The [[Birthstones|birthstone]] of April is the [[diamond]], and the [[Birthday#Birth_flowers|birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] or the [[Sweet Pea]].&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

April is commonly associated with the season of [[spring (season)|spring]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]] and [[autumn]] in the [[Southern hemisphere]], where it is the seasonal equivalent to [[October]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]] and vice versa.

April starts on the same day of the week as July in all years, and January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year.

{{CalendarCustom|month=August|show_year=true|float=right}}
'''August''' {{Audio|En-us-August.ogg|(pronunciation)}} is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian Calendar]]s and one of seven months with a length of 31 days.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42820/August August].&quot; ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. 23 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This month was originally named ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month [[Roman calendar]] under [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] in 753 BC, when [[March]] was the first month of the year. About 700&amp;nbsp;BC it became the eighth month when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the year before March by King [[Numa Pompilius]], who also gave it 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]] giving it its modern length of 31 days. In [[8 C]] it was [[Augustus#Month of August|renamed]] in honor of [[Augustus]], who did ''not'' take a day from February (see the [[Julian calendar#Debunked theory on month lengths|debunked theory on month lengths]]). He chose this month to take his name rather than his birth month - which was traditional - as a mark of honour to the defeated Queen [[Cleopatra]] the last ruler of Egypt, this being her birth month. 

In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], August is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

In common years no other month starts on the same day of the week as August, though in leap years February starts on the same day. August ends on the same day of the week as November every year.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Qur'an]], '''Aaron''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ær|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛər|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Longman pronunciation dictionary|first=John C.|last= Wells|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow, England|year=1990|isbn=978-0-582-05383-0|page=2}} entry &quot;Aaron&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he|אַהֲרֹן}} ''Ahărōn'', {{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;هارون&lt;/big&gt;}} ''Hārūn'', Greek ([[Septuagint]]): ''Ααρών'' ), sometimes called '''Aaron the [[Levite]]''' ({{lang|he|אַהֲרֹן הַלֵּוִי}}), was the brother of [[Moses]], (Exodus 6:16-20;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%206:16-20;&amp;version=31;9;15; Exodus 6:16-20; - Passage&amp;nbsp;Lookup - BibleGateway.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Qur'an 28:34&lt;ref name=&quot;Cite quran|28|34|s=ns&quot;&gt;{{Cite quran|28|34|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a [[prophet]] of [[God]]. He represented the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] of the [[Israelites]]. While Moses was receiving his education at the Egyptian royal court, and during his exile among the [[Midianites]], Aaron and his sister Miriam remained with their [[kinsmen]] in the eastern border-land of Egypt ([[Land of Goshen|Goshen]]). There, Aaron gained a name for eloquent and persuasive speech, so that when the time came for the demand upon the [[Pharaoh]] to release Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s ''nabi'', or spokesman, to his own people (Exodus 7:1)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%207:1;&amp;version=31;9;15; Exodus 7:1; - Passage&amp;nbsp;Lookup - BibleGateway.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and, after their unwillingness to hear, to the Pharaoh himself (Exodus 7:9).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%207:9;&amp;version=31;9;15; Exodus 7:9; - Passage&amp;nbsp;Lookup - BibleGateway.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200&amp;nbsp;BC.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Aaron&quot; is unknown, with suggestions ranging from an Egyptian origin to meaning &quot;woe to this pregnancy&quot; or as derived from the Hebrew word for 'Ark'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vink|first=J.G.|title=The Priestly Code and Seven Other Studies|year=1969|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004030992|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JgANdbnoJTAC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=etymology+%22Aaron%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3-9TY31AtDzsgakrIjzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=etymology%20%22Aaron%22&amp;f=false|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proclamation and Presence|year=1983|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=978-0865541016|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D_V7InXk0vAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=etymology+%22Aaron%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3-9TY31AtDzsgakrIjzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=etymology%20%22Aaron%22&amp;f=false|author=Geo Widengran|authorlink=What do we know about Moses?|editor=John I Durham|accessdate=1 May 2011|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginzberg|first=Louis|title=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WA8-G-OqtuUC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=etymology+%22Aaron%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3-9TY31AtDzsgakrIjzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=etymology%20%22Aaron%22&amp;f=false|date=Reprint edition (13 May 1998)|publisher=John Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0801858949|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WA8-G-OqtuUC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=etymology+%22Aaron%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3-9TY31AtDzsgakrIjzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=etymology%20%22Aaron%22&amp;f=false|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greifenhagen|first=Franz Volker|title=Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map|year=2002|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0826462114|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DaVjGgPmmCsC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=etymology+%22Aaron%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nHy9TevaOIv1sgaR95GKBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=etymology%20%22Aaron%22&amp;f=false|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
Aaron’s function included the duties of speaker and implied personal dealings with the Egyptian royal court on behalf of Moses, who was always the central moving figure. The part played by Aaron in the events that preceded the Exodus was, therefore, ministerial, and not directive. He, along with Moses, performed “signs” before his people which impressed them with a belief in the reality of the divine mission of the brothers (Exodus 4:15–16).

At the command of [[Moses]] he stretched out his [[Aaron's rod|rod]] in order to bring on the first of three plagues (Exodus 7:19, 8:1,12). In the infliction of the remaining plagues, he appears to have acted merely as the attendant of Moses, whose outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon the Pharaoh and his subjects (Exodus 9:23, 10:13,22). The display of potency from Aaron's rod had already been demonstrated in the presence of Pharaoh's magicians; when Aaron's rod was thrown down to the ground it had turned into a snake,  so Pharaoh's magicians performed the same act with their own rods.  However, Aaron's snake ate up all the other snakes (Exodus 7:9) proving his rod was victorious. 

During the journey in the wilderness, Aaron is not always prominent or active; and he sometimes appears guilty of rebellious or treasonable conduct. At the battle with Amalek, he is chosen with [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] to support the hand of Moses that held the “rod of God” (Exodus 17:9). When the revelation was given to Moses at Mount Sinai, he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied Moses on the way to the summit. [[Joshua]], however, was admitted with his leader to the very presence of the Lord, while Aaron and Hur remained below to look after the people (Exodus 24:9-14). It was during the prolonged absence of Moses that Aaron yielded to the clamors of the people, and made a [[Golden Calf]] as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from Egypt (Exodus 32:1-6). (It should be noted that in the account given of the same events, in the Qur'an, Aaron is not the idol-maker and upon Moses' return begged his pardon as he had felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).) At the intercession of Moses, Aaron was saved from the plague which smote the people (Deuteronomy 9:20, Exodus 32:35), although it was to Aaron’s tribe of Levi that the work of punitive vengeance was committed (Exodus 32:26).

===Priesthood===
[[File:Aaron high priest.jpg|thumb|left|18th-century Dutch oak statue portraying the high priest]]
At the time when the tribe of Levi was set apart for the priestly service, Aaron was anointed and consecrated to the priesthood, arrayed in the robes of his office, and instructed in its manifold duties (Exodus 28, Exodus 29).

On the very day of his consecration, his sons, Nadab and Abihu, were consumed by fire from the Lord for having offered incense in an unlawful manner (Leviticus 10).

Scholarly consensus is that in Aaron's high priesthood the sacred writer intended to describe a model, the prototype, so to say, of the Jewish high priest. God, on [[Mount Sinai]] instituting a worship, also instituted an order of priests. According to the patriarchal customs, the [[firstborn]] son in every family used to perform the functions connected with God's worship. It might have been expected, consequently, that Reuben's family would be chosen by God for the ministry of the new altar. However, according to the biblical narrative it was Aaron who was the object of God's choice. To what jealousies this gave rise later, has been indicated above. The office of the Aaronites was at first merely to take care of the lamp which was to burn perpetually before the veil of the tabernacle Exodus 27:21. A more formal calling soon followed (Exodus 28:1). Aaron and his sons, distinguished from the commoners by their sacred functions, were also to receive holy garments suitable to their office.&lt;ref name=&quot;phod&quot;&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron offered the various sacrifices and performed the many ceremonies of the consecration of the new priests, according to the divine instructions (Exodus 29), and repeated these rites for seven days, during which Aaron and his sons were entirely separated from the rest of the people. When, on the eighth day, the high priest had inaugurated his office of sacrifice by killing the animals, he blessed the people (very likely according to the prescriptions of Numbers 6:24-26),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claudemariottini.com/blog/2006/03/priestly-benediction-numbers-624-26.html Dr. Claude Mariottini - Professor of Old Testament: The Priestly Benediction: Numbers 6:24-26]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Moses, entered into the tabernacle to possess it. They &quot;came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude: And behold a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces&quot; (Leviticus 9:23-24). In this way the institution of the Aaronic priesthood was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;phod&quot;/&gt;

===Rebellion of ''Korah''===
From the time of the sojourn at Mount Sinai, where he became the anointed priest of Israel, Aaron ceased to be the minister of Moses, his place being taken by Joshua. He is mentioned in association with Miriam in a jealous complaint against the exclusive claims of Moses as the Lord’s prophet. The presumption of the murmurers was rebuked, and Miriam was smitten with ''[[Tzaraath]]''. Aaron entreated Moses to intercede for her, at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted the uprising. Aaron himself was not struck with the plague on account of sacerdotal immunity; and Miriam, after seven days’ quarantine, was healed and restored to favor (Numbers 12). Micah a prophet in [[Judaism]], mentions Moses, Aaron, and Miriam as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus (a judgment wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives).&lt;ref&gt;Micah 6:4&lt;/ref&gt; In the present instance it is made clear by the express words of the oracle (Numbers 12:6-8) that Moses was unique among men as the one with whom the Lord spoke face to face. The failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their brother was the sin of Miriam and Aaron.

The validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of Aaron was attested after the ill-fated rebellion of Korah, who was a first cousin of Aaron. When the earth had opened and swallowed up the leaders of the insurgents (Numbers 16:25-35), Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests. And when the plague had broken out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was stayed (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).

Another memorable transaction followed. Each of the tribal princes of Israel took a rod and wrote his name upon it, and the twelve rods were laid up over night in the tent of meeting. The next morning Aaron’s rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds (Numbers 17:8). The miracle proved merely the prerogative of the tribe of Levi; but now a formal distinction was made in perpetuity between the family of Aaron and the other Levites. While all the Levites (and only Levites) were to be devoted to sacred services, the special charge of the sanctuary and the altar was committed to the [[Kohen|Aaronites]] alone (Numbers 18:1-7). The scene of this enactment is unknown, as is the time mentioned.

===Death===
Aaron, like Moses, was not permitted to enter Canaan with the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&amp;letter=A&amp;search=aaron#18 Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason alleged is that the two brothers showed impatience at [[Meribah]] ([[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh]]) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when Moses brought water out of a rock to quench the thirst of the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt; The action was construed as displaying a want of deference to the Lord, since they had been commanded to speak to the rock, whereas Moses struck it with the staff, twice (Numbers 20:7-11).&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt;

Of the death of Aaron we have two accounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt; The principal one gives a detailed statement that soon after the incident at Meribah, Aaron, with his son Eleazar and Moses, ascended Mount Hor.&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt; There Moses stripped Aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to Eleazar.&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt; Aaron died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days (Numbers 20:22-29; compare 33:38-39).&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt; The other account is found in Deuteronomy 10:6, where Moses is reported as saying that Aaron died at Moserah and was buried there.&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt; There is a significant amount of travel between these two points, as the itinerary in Numbers 33:31–37 records seven stages between Moseroth (Mosera) and Mount Hor.&lt;ref name=&quot;jd&quot;/&gt;

==Jewish Rabbinic literature==
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities.&lt;ref name=&quot;j2&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&amp;letter=A&amp;search=aaron#1 JewishEncyclopedia.com - AARON]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Aaron, the first priest, ranks below Moses: he is his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of God revealed through Moses, although it is pointed out&lt;ref&gt;Sifra, Wa-yiḳra, 1&lt;/ref&gt; that it is said fifteen times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] that “the Lord spoke to Moses ''and'' Aaron.” Under the influence of the priesthood which shaped the destinies of the nation under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, as is learned from [[Malachi]] 2:4–7; and the prevailing tendency was to place Aaron on a footing equal with Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;j2&quot;/&gt; “At times Aaron, and at other times Moses, is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank,” says [[Mekilta]]. בא, 1;&lt;ref name=&quot;j2&quot;/&gt; expressly infers this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of Aaron’s ministration.&lt;ref name=&quot;j2&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
In fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ([[Leviticus Rabbah]] x., [[Midrash Tehillim|Midrash Teh.]] cxxxiii. 1), Aaron's death, as described in the [[Haggadah]], was of a wonderful tranquility.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&amp;letter=A&amp;search=aaron#22 JewishEncyclopedia.com - AARON]&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by Moses, his brother, and by Eleazar, his son, Aaron went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; &quot;Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son Eleazar!&quot; said Moses; &quot;and then follow me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; &quot;Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother,&quot; Moses continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; The cave closed behind Moses as he left; and he went down the hill with Eleazar, with garments rent, and crying: &quot;Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, &quot;Where is Aaron?&quot; angels were seen carrying Aaron's bier through the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; A voice was then heard saying: &quot;The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin&quot; (Malachi 2:6).&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; He died, according to [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at Aaron's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and R. H. 2b-3a).&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deutronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: &quot;There [at Mosera] died Aaron.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Mek., Beshallaḥ, Wayassa', i.; Tan., Huḳḳat, 18; Yer. Soṭah, i. 17c, and Targum Yer. Num. and Deut. on the abovementioned passages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united Aaron and Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; When the latter was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another's greatness.&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; When Moses at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: &quot;O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send&quot; (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive Aaron, his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: &quot;Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart&quot; ({{Bibleref|Exodus|4:14|JPS}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; Indeed, Aaron was to find his reward, says [[Shimon bar Yochai]]; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother's rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the [[Urim and Thummim]], which were to &quot;be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before the Lord&quot; ([[Canticles Rabbah]] i. 10).&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; Moses and Aaron met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers (Exodus 4:27; compare [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] 8:1), and of them it is written: &quot;Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!&quot; (Psalms 133:1).&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; Of them it is said: &quot;Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]&quot; (Psalms 85:10); for Moses stood for righteousness, according to Deuteronomy 33:21, and Aaron for peace, according to {{Bibleref|Malachi|2:6|JPS}}. Again, mercy was personified in Aaron, according to Deuteronomy 33:8, and truth in Moses, according to Numbers 12:7 .&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Tan., Shemot, ed. Buber, 24-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Moses poured the oil of anointment upon the head of Aaron, Aaron modestly shrank back and said: &quot;Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt; Then [[Shekhinah|the Shekhinah]] spake the words: &quot;Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of Aaron, that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of Hermon&quot; ({{Bibleref|Psalm|133:2-3}}) .&lt;ref name=&quot;dar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sifra, Shemini, Milluim; Tan., Korah, ed. Buber, 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses===
According to [[Tanhuma]],&lt;ref&gt;ed. Buber, 2:12&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron’s activity as a prophet began earlier than that of Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&amp;letter=A&amp;search=aaron#21 JewishEncyclopedia.com - AARON]&lt;/ref&gt; Hillel held Aaron up as an example, saying: “Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!”&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abot]], 1:12&lt;/ref&gt; This is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 6b, and elsewhere, according to which Aaron was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt; While Moses was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong, Aaron went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt; The mourning of the people at Aaron’s death was greater, therefore, than at that of Moses; for whereas, when Aaron died the whole [[house of Israel]] wept, including the women. {{Bibleref|Numbers|20:29}}&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 20:29&lt;/ref&gt; Moses was bewailed by “the sons of Israel” only ({{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|34:8|NASB}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt; Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for Aaron.&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanhedrin 7a&lt;/ref&gt; His fortitude and silent submission to the will of God on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify God in the midst of great affliction.&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zebahim]] 115b&lt;/ref&gt; Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by God after the princes of the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|Twelve Tribes]] had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: “Say to thy brother Aaron: Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light shall last forever.”&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tanhuma]], ed. Buber, בהעלותך, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[File:Aaron-icon.jpg|thumb|[[Russian icon|Russian]] [[icon]] of Aaron (18th century, [[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]], [[Karelia]], Russia).]]
While Aaron and his descendants were the high priests of Judaism, [[Melchizedek]], a mystical figure who appeared over 700 years before Moses, is considered a [[typology (theology)|type]] of [[Christ]], the [[high priest]] of the [[New Covenant|new dispensation]](see the Book of Hebrews).

However, in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Maronite Church]] Aaron is [[veneration|venerated]] as a [[saint]], with a [[feast day]] celebrated on September 4, together with Moses (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], September 4 falls on September 17 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). He is also commemorated, together with other righteous saints from the Old Testament on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before [[Christmas]]).

He is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on July 30.  He is commemorated on July 1 in the modern Latin calendar and in the Syriac Calendar.

==Latter-day Saints==
In the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS church]], the [[Aaronic priesthood|Aaronic]] order is the lesser order of priesthood, comprising the grades (from lowest to highest) of deacon, teacher, and priest. The chief office of the Aaronic priesthood is the presiding bishopric; the head of the priesthood is the bishop. Each ward has one or more quorum of each office of the Aaronic priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=59cf5f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=c9faff3ff4c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____ LDS.org - Aaronic Priesthood Table of Contents - Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part A.] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aaron in Islam==
'''Aaron''' ([[Arabic]]: '''هارون'''; meaning ''Mountain of strength''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.babynamespedia.com/meaning/Aaron&lt;/ref&gt;) (''circa'' 1439 BC - 1317 BC?), is an [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] and [[Messengers of Islam|messenger]] mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]. Aaron preached and prophesied with [[Moses]] during the reign of the terrible [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]]. Aaron is one of the prophets who [[Muhammad]] is said to have met on the night of the ''[[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]]'' (Night Journey), his ascension through the [[heaven]]s. Aaron is also important for being a patriarch&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], ''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'', Note. '''904''': &quot;In the second group, we have the great founders of families, apart from Abraham, viz., Noah of the time of the Flood; David and Solomon, the real establishers of the Jewish monarchy; Job, who lived 140 years, saw four generations of descendants, and was blessed at the end of his life with large pastoral wealth (Job 42:16,12); Joseph, who as Minister of State did great things in Egypt and was the progenitor of two Tribes; and Moses and Aaron, the leaders of the Exodus from Egypt. They led active lives and called 'doers of good.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the ancestor of the priestly lineage of the family of [[Amram]]. The figures mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] who came from  Aaron's lineage were [[Islamic views on Mary|Mary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|27|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]]. Furthermore, the other figures present in the household - such as the high priest [[Islamic view of Zechariah|Zachariah]] and his wife [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Luke|1:5|NIV}}: &quot;In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; - are also mentioned as coming through the same bloodline.

===Aaron in the Qur'an===
The [[Qur'an]] states that Aaron was the brother of Moses and like his brother he too was a [[prophet]] who was tasked by [[God in Islam|God]] with saving the [[Israelites]] from the tyrannical [[Pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Firaun]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Qur'an God says:

{{quote|Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron with Our signs to the Pharaoh and his nobles; but they behaved arrogantly, for they were a people full of guilt.&lt;br&gt;Thus, when the truth had come to them from Us, they said: &quot;Surely this is nothing but pure magic.&quot;|Qur'an, sura 10 (Yunus), ayat 75-76&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|10|75|e=76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aaron was a gifted speaker.  He was largely responsible with teaching the Israelites the way of worship as it was laid out in the [[Torah]] of the time. According to the Qur'an, Moses prayed to God to grant him his brother Aaron as a helper to be with him in all his tasks ahead. God, in the Qur'an, says that Moses said:

{{quote|So send my brother Aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than I with words, that he should affirm me, for I fear that they would call me a liar.&quot;|Qur'an, sura 28 ([[Al-Qasas]]), ayah 34&lt;ref name=&quot;Cite quran|28|34|s=ns&quot;/&gt;}}

God granted Moses his request and told him that he could take his brother along with him.  God says:

{{quote|(And) God said: &quot;We shall strengthen your arm with your brother, and give you power with Our signs and give you authority, so that they will not be able to harm you. Both of you and your followers will be victorious.&quot;|Qur'an, sura 28, ayah 35&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aaron, being a prophetic messenger, was also given the law by God, to preach to the [[Children of Israel]] according to the Torah. The [[Qur'an]] mentions the holy scripture as a light and guidance for those who would accept the Message. God says in the Qur'an:

{{quote|We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, and a light and reminder for those who take heed for themselves,|Qur'an, sura 21 ([[Al-Anbiya]]), ayah 48&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Moses led his people on the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] to [[Mount Sinai]], he told them that he would be gone for a few days to receive the [[Tablets of the Law]]. He informed the [[Israelites]] that Aaron would be their leader in his absence. However, the moment Moses left, an evil man, [[Samiri]], fashioned an idol [[golden calf|calf]] out of the people's gold and jewelry and he made the Israelites succumb to idolatry.

Aaron preached with powerful zeal to his people, but they refused to listen to him. It is here that the [[Qur'anic]] narrative of the incident sharply contrasts with the Biblical story, which blames Aaron for making the golden calf. Aaron was overpowered and was threatened with being killed by his people. When Moses returned from [[Mount Sinai]], he blamed Aaron for allowing the Israelites to worship this idol and seized his brother by his beard, but Aaron then gave his explanation, after which Moses prayed to God to forgive both of them. As God says in the Qur'an:

{{quote|When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: &quot;Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?&quot; He put down the [[Ten Commandments|tablets]], seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: &quot;Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Moses prayed: &quot;O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy! for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!&quot;|Qur'an, sura 7 ([[As-Saaffat]]), ayat 150-151&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|150|e=151|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Aaron in Muhammad's time===
[[Muhammad]], in many of his sayings, speaks of Aaron. In the event of the [[Mi'raj]], his miraculous ascension through the Heavens, Muhammad is said to have encountered Aaron in the fifth heaven.&lt;ref name=&quot;muslim&quot;&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|309}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|1|314}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to old scholars, including [[Ibn Hisham]], Muhammad, in particular, mentioned the beauty of Aaron when he encountered him in Heaven. [[Martin Lings]], in his biographical ''Muhammad'', speaks of Muhammad's wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory:
{{quote|Of Joseph he said that his face had the splendor of the moon at its full, and that he had been endowed with no less than the half of all existing beauty. Yet this did not diminish Muhammad's wonderment at his other brethren, and he mentioned in particular the great beauty of Aaron.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Ishaq]], 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources'', Martin Lings, Page 102, Suhail Academy Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aaron was also mentioned by Muhammad in likeness to [[Ali]]. Muhammad had left Ali to look after his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found Ali a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence. Ali, grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told Muhammad what the local people were saying. In reply, the prophet said: &quot;They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine. Art thou not content, O Ali, that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses, save that after me there is no prophet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Ishaq]], ''Biography of the Prophet'', 897&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;

===Burial Place===

According to Islamic tradition the [[tomb of Aaron]] is located on ''Jabal Harun'', or Aaron's Mountain, near [[Petra]] in [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlastours.net/jordan/aarons_tomb.html|title=Aaron's Tomb, Petra|publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency|accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/humss/bwheeler/aaron.html|title=Tomb of Aaron|publisher=United States Naval Academy |accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 1350 meters above sea-level it is the highest peak in the area; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here. A 14th century [[Jordan]]ian mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Petra.

==Genetics==
{{Main|Y-chromosomal Aaron}}

Recently, the tradition that [[Kohanim]] (the Jewish priesthood) are actually descended from a single patriarch, Aaron, was found to be apparently consistent with [[genetic testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Skorecki et al., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Jewish men with the tradition of being Kohanim, but not all, share a direct male lineage with a common [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]], and testing was done across sectors of the [[Jewish population]] to see if there was any commonality between the Y-chromosomes of Kohanim. The results were found to cluster rather closely around a specific DNA signature, found in the Semitic [[Haplogroup J1]], which the researchers named the [[Cohen modal haplotype]], implying that many of the Kohanim do share a distinctive [[common descent|common ancestry]]. This information was also used to support the claim that the [[Lemba people|Lemba]] (a [[sub-Saharan]] tribe) are in fact descendant from a group of Jewish priests.

The Cohen Modal Haplotype or CMH is found in [[haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA)|J1]], which geneticists estimate originated in the Southern [[Levant]] (modern day Israel, Jordan; biblical Canaan) or North Africa (Egypt) approximately 10,000–15,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html; Semino, et al., “Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area.” Am J Hum Genet. 2004 May; 74(5).&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical tradition holds that Abraham and his ancestors, the Semitic tribes, originated from Southern Arabia or East Africa (Genesis 10); Aaron and Moses were 7th generation descendants from Abraham (Exodus 6). An estimated 20% of the modern Jewish community fall into haplogroup J1. The traditional date for Abraham is circa 2200–2000&amp;nbsp;BC. Behar, et al., found Kohanim in a variety of haplogroups (E3b, G2, H, I1b, J, K2, Q, R1a1, R1b), which included those which originated in the Levant (J1, J2) and those from Southern Arabia, East Africa, or another geographic region.&lt;ref&gt;Behar, DM; Thomas MG, Skorecki K, Hammer MF, Bulygina E, Rosengarten D, Jones AL, Held K, Moses V, Goldstein D, Bradman N, Weale ME (2003). &quot;Multiple Origins of Ashkenazi Levites: Y Chromosome Evidence for Both Near Eastern and European Ancestries&quot;. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 73: 768–779.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Karl Skorecki,&lt;ref name=&quot;Skorecki1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Skorecki| first = K| coauthors = Selig, S.; Blazer, S.; Bradman, R.; Bradman, N.; Waburton, P.J.; Ismajlowicz, M.; Hammer M.F.| year = 1997| url = http://www.familytreedna.com/nature97385.html| title = Y chromosomes of Jewish priests| journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 385|page = 32|pmid = 8985243| doi = 10.1038/385032a0| issue=6611}}{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of CMH, reported during a Conference for Kohanim in Jerusalem 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Israel First International Kohen Conference – The Center of Kohanim – Jerusalem – [http://www.cohen-levi.org Cohen-Levi Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. “Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2&lt;ref&gt;[http://israelplug.com/art-and-culture/jewish-priests-geneology-and-roles/ Understanding of Jewish priests’ genealogy] - July 18, 2007 • By Gil Zohar&lt;/ref&gt;” said Skorecki. According to the observed mutations rates, certain J2 haplotypes found on FTDNA&lt;ref&gt;J Haplogroup Project at [http://www.ftdna.com.br FTDNA], Cohen Project FTDNA, Iberian Project FTDNA&lt;/ref&gt; database projects share a common ancestor who lived 3100+/-200 years bp, as Skorecki revealed to the public.

==Descendants==
Aaron married [[Elisheba]], daughter of [[Amminadab]] and sister of [[Nahshon]] (Exod 6:23).  The sons of Aaron were [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]], [[Nadab and Abihu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scripturetext.com/1_chronicles/24-1.htm 1 Chronicles 24:1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.]&lt;/ref&gt; A descendant of Aaron is an Aaronite, or [[Kohen]], meaning Priest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=crESCkypt5MC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=a+priestly+descendant+of+aaron+is+an+aaronite+or+(kohen%7Ccohen) Dictionary of Jewish usage: a guide to the use of Jewish terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=A+priestly+descendant+of+Aaron+is+an+Aaronite#PPA1,M1 Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible]&lt;/ref&gt; Any non-Aaronic [[Levite]] descended from Levi but not of the priestly division&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgct.org/TexasBaptists/Document.Doc?&amp;id=1832 Studies in Luke: Journeying to the Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; would be assigned to assist the Levitical priests of the family of Aaron in the care of the tabernacle and later of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;According to Samaritan sources a civil war broke out between the Sons of Itamar [[Eli (Bible)]] and the Sons of Phineas—which resulted in the division of those who followed Eli and those who followed High Priest Uzzi ben Bukki at Mount Gerizim Bethel. (A third group followed neither.) Ironically likewise according to Samaritan sources the high priests line of the sons of Phineas died out in 1624 CE with the death of the 112th High Priest Shlomyah ben Pinhas when the priesthood was transferred to the sons of Itamar; see article Samaritan for list of High Priests from 1613 to 2004—the 131st high priest of the Samaritans is [[Elazar ben Tsedaka ben Yitzhaq]] See article [[Samaritan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art history==
Depictions of Aaron within art history are rare.  Other than Aaron's inclusion in the crowd of revelers around the [[Golden Calf]] ceremony—most notably in [[Nicolas Poussin]]’s “The Adoration of the Golden Calf” (ca. 1633–34, [[National Gallery]] London)—there is little else.  The recent discovery in 1991 of [[Pier Francesco Mola]]’s “Aaron, Holy to the Lord” (ca. 1650, Private Collection, New York: image available for study at Fred R. Kline Gallery Archives) adds significantly to the Aaronic mythos. The painting offers a dramatic, deeply psychological portrayal of the single figure of Aaron in his priestly garments celebrating [[Yom Kippur]] in the wilderness Tabernacle.  The Mola “Aaron” is considered, quite surprisingly, the unique single figure of Aaron to have been painted by a European old master artist, circa 15th–18th centuries (A.Pigler, &quot;Barockthemen&quot; Vol. 1; although unknown to Pigler).  The carefully rendered Judaic iconographic details in the Mola painting are rare and the subject itself may have importance in relationship to mid-17th century Jewish history, characterized by a controversial messianic movement involving a serious contender for a new Messiah, [[Shabtai Zvi]], whose influence was felt in Jewish communities worldwide (Harris Lenowitz, &quot;The Jewish Messiahs&quot;).  It is highly probable that the Zvi messianic phenomenon was noted by the Catholic Church as a possible threat to [[Jesus]], their sanctified Messiah. It may be significant to note, in considering the possible influence of the Roman Catholic Church in choices of lay-commissioned religious art during this period and considering as well the importance of Aaron in the Christian tradition, that &quot;Aaron, Holy to the Lord&quot; was originally commissioned along with a now lost pendant of Moses (both from Mola) by the nobel Colonna family, wealthy Catholic art patrons living in Rome ([[Getty Museum]] Archives).

[[Image:Alcohol general.svg|180px|thumb|right|The hydroxyl (OH) functional group in an alcohol molecule]]
[[Image:Alcohol.png|180px|thumb|right|Ball-and-stick model of the hydroxyl (OH) functional group in an alcohol molecule]]

In [[chemistry]], an '''alcohol''' is any [[organic compound]] in which a [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]] (-[[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]]) is bound to a [[carbon]] atom, usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms.

An important class are the simple [[aliphatic compound|acyclic]] alcohols, the general formula for which is C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt;OH. Of those, [[ethanol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) is the type of alcohol found in [[alcoholic beverages]], and in common speech the word '''alcohol''' refers specifically to ethanol.

Other alcohols are usually described with a clarifying adjective, as in ''[[isopropyl alcohol]]'' (''propan-2-ol'') or ''wood alcohol'' (''methyl alcohol'', or [[methanol]]). The suffix ''-ol'' appears in the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC chemical name]] of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix ''hydroxy-'' will appear in the [[IUPAC]] name. The suffix ''-ol'' in non-systematic names (such as [[paracetamol]] or [[cholesterol]]) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol.  But many substances (such as [[citric acid]], [[lactic acid]], and [[sucrose]]) contain one or more hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix.

==Simple alcohols==
[[Image:Alcohol spacefill.png|180px|thumb|right|Space filling model of the hydroxyl (OH) functional group in an alcohol molecule]]
The most commonly used alcohol is [[ethanol]], {{chem|C|2|H|5|OH}}, with the [[ethane]] backbone. Ethanol has been produced and consumed by humans for millennia, in the form of fermented and distilled [[alcoholic beverages]]. It is a clear flammable liquid that boils at 78.4 °C, which is used as an industrial solvent, [[alcohol fuel|car fuel]], and raw material in the chemical industry. In the [[United States|US]] and some other countries, because of legal and tax restrictions on alcohol consumption, ethanol destined for other uses often contains additives that make it unpalatable (such as [[denatonium benzoate|Bitrex]]) or poisonous (such as methanol). Ethanol in this form is known generally as [[denatured alcohol]]; when methanol is used, it may be referred to as [[methylated spirit]]s or &quot;surgical spirits&quot;.

The simplest alcohol is [[methanol]], {{chem|CH|3|OH}}, which was formerly obtained by the distillation of wood and, therefore, is called &quot;wood alcohol&quot;. It is a clear liquid resembling ethanol in smell and properties, with a slightly lower boiling point (64.7 °C), and is used mainly as a solvent, fuel, and raw material. Unlike ethanol, methanol is extremely toxic: One sip (as little as 10 ml) can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the [[optic nerve]] and 30 ml (one fluid ounce) is potentially fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vale&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vale A |title=Methanol |journal=Medicine |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=633–4 |year=2007|month= |pmid= |doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other alcohols whose uses are relatively widespread (though not so much as those of methanol and ethanol) are [[propanol]] and [[n-Butanol|butanol]]. Like ethanol, they can be produced by fermentation processes. (However, the fermenting agent is a bacterium, ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'', that feeds on [[cellulose]], not sugars like the [[Saccharomyces]] [[yeast]] that produces ethanol.) [[Saccharomyces]] [[yeast]] are known to produce these higher alcohols at temperatures above 75 F. These alcohols are called [[fusel alcohols]] or fusel oils in [[brewing]] and tend to have a spicy or peppery flavor. They are considered a fault in most styles of [[beer]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Simple alcohols, in particular, ethanol and methanol, possess [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] and inert rendering properties, leading to their use as anti-microbial agents in medicine, pharmacy, and industry. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Nomenclature==
===Systematic names===
In the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature|IUPAC]] system, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal &quot;e&quot; and adds &quot;ol&quot;, e.g., &quot;methanol&quot; and &quot;ethanol&quot;.&lt;ref name = reusch-alcohols&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = VirtualText of Organic Chemistry | title = Alcohols | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/alcohol1.htm#alcnom | accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the &quot;ol&quot;: [[propan-1-ol]] for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, [[Isopropyl alcohol|propan-2-ol]] for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(OH)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Sometimes, the position number is written before the IUPAC name: 1-propanol and 2-propanol. If a higher priority group is present (such as an [[aldehyde]], [[ketone]], or [[carboxylic acid]]), then it is necessary to use the prefix &quot;hydroxy&quot;,&lt;ref name = reusch-alcohols/&gt; for example: 1-hydroxy-2-propanone (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH).&lt;ref&gt;Organic chemistry IUPAC nomenclature. Alcohols Rule C-201. http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_202.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alcohol examples.gif|600px|thumb|left|Some examples of simple alcohols and how to name them]]
{{-}}
The IUPAC nomenclature is used in scientific publications and where precise identification of the substance is important. In other less formal contexts, an alcohol is often called with the name of the corresponding alkyl group followed by the word &quot;alcohol&quot;, e.g., [[methyl group|methyl]] alcohol, [[ethyl group|ethyl]] alcohol. [[Propyl]] alcohol may be [[propanol|''n''-propyl alcohol]] or [[isopropyl alcohol]], depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the 1st or 2nd carbon on the [[propane]] chain.

Alcohols are classified into ''primary'', ''secondary'', and ''tertiary'', based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl group. The primary alcohols have general formulas RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH; secondary ones are RR'CHOH; and tertiary ones are RR'R&quot;COH, where R, R', and R&quot; stand for alkyl groups. Ethanol and ''n''-propyl alcohol are primary alcohols; isopropyl alcohol is a secondary one. The prefixes ''sec''- (or ''s''-) and ''tert''- (or ''t''-), conventionally in italics, may be used before the alkyl group's name to distinguish secondary and tertiary alcohols, respectively, from the primary one. For example, isopropyl alcohol is occasionally called ''sec''-propyl alcohol, and the tertiary alcohol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH, or 2-methylpropan-2-ol in IUPAC nomenclature is commonly known as [[tert-Butanol|''tert''-butyl alcohol]] or ''tert''-butanol.

===Etymology===
{{Wiktionary|alcohol}}
The word ''alcohol'' appears in English in the 16th century, loaned via French from medical [[Latin]], ultimately from the [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|[[wikt:الكحل|الكحل]]}} (''{{transl|ar|al-kuḥl}},'' &quot;the [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], a powder used as an eyeliner&quot;).

{{lang|ar|[[wikt:ال|ال]]}} ''{{transl|ar|al}}'' is Arabic for the [[Article (grammar)|definitive article]], ''the'' in English.

The current Arabic name for alcohol is {{lang|ar|الكحول}} ''{{transl|ar|al-kuḥūl}}'', re-introduced from western usage.

''{{transl|ar|kuḥl}}'' was the name given to the very fine powder, produced by the [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] of the natural mineral [[stibnite]] to form [[antimony]] [[sulfide]] [[antimony|Sb]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (hence the essence or &quot;spirit&quot; of the substance), which was used as an [[antiseptic]] and [[Kohl (cosmetics)|eyeliner]].

[[Bartholomew Traheron]] in his 1543 translation of [[John of Vigo]] introduces the word as a term used by &quot;barbarous&quot; ([[Moorish]]) authors for &quot;fine powder&quot;:
:''the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for moost fine poudre.''

[[William Johnson]] in his 1657 ''Lexicon Chymicum'' glosses the word as ''antimonium sive stibium''. By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including &quot;alcohol of wine&quot;, the distilled essence of wine. [[Libavius]] in ''Alchymia'' (1594) has ''vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum''. Johnson (1657) glosses ''alcohol vini'' as ''quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.''
The word's meaning became restricted to &quot;spirit of wine&quot; ([[ethanol]]) in the 18th century, and was again extended to the family of substances so called in modern chemistry from 1850.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Alcohols have an odor that is often described as “biting” and as “hanging” in the nasal passages.

In general, the [[hydroxyl group]] makes the alcohol molecule [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to other compounds (except in [[2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane-3-ol|certain large molecules]] where the hydroxyl is protected by [[steric hindrance]] of adjacent groups&lt;ref name=&quot;maje&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first=Irena |last1=Majerza |first2= Ireneusz |last2=Natkaniec |year=2006 | title=Experimental and theoretical IR, R, and INS spectra of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane-3-ol |journal=Journal of Molecular Structure |volume =788 |issue= 1–3 |pages =93–101 | doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2005.11.022  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as [[protic solvent]]s. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water because the hydroxyl group wins out over the short carbon chain. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons ([[amyl alcohol|Pentanol]] and higher) are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents.

Because of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29 °C, compared to 69 °C for the hydrocarbon [[Hexane]] (a common constituent of [[gasoline]]), and 34.6 °C for [[Diethyl ether]].

Alcohols, like water, can show either acidic or basic properties at the O-H group. With a [[pKa|pK&lt;Sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of around 16-19, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]], but they are still able to react with strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or reactive metals such as [[sodium]]. The [[salt]]s that result are called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metal|M]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Meanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol:

[[Image:Methanol acid base.gif|500px|Acidity &amp; basicity of methanol]]

Alcohols can also undergo [[oxidation]] to give [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, or [[carboxylic acid]]s, or they can be dehydrated to [[alkene]]s. They can react to form [[ester compound]]s, and they can (if activated first) undergo [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions. The lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols nucleophiles. For more details, see the [[Alcohol#Reactions|reactions of alcohols]] section below.

As one moves from primary to secondary to tertiary alcohols with the same backbone, the hydrogen bond strength, the boiling point, and the acidity typically decrease.

==Applications==
[[File:Alcohol by Country.png|thumb|200px|Total recorded [[alcohol consumption by country|alcohol per capita consumption]] (15+), in litres of pure alcohol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/substance_abuse/publications/global_status_report_2004_overview.pdf |title=Global Status Report on Alcohol 2004|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Alcohols can be used as a beverage ([[ethanol]] only), as fuel and for many scientific, medical, and industrial utilities. [[Ethanol]] in the form of alcoholic beverages has been consumed by humans since pre-historic times. A 50% v/v solution of [[ethylene glycol]] in water is commonly used as an [[antifreeze]].

Some alcohols, mainly [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]], can be used as an [[alcohol fuel]]. Fuel performance can be increased in [[forced induction]] [[internal combustion engine]]s by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the [[turbocharger]] or [[supercharger]] has pressurized the air. This cools the pressurized air, providing a denser air charge, which allows for more fuel, and therefore more power.

Alcohols have applications in industry and science as reagents or [[solvent]]s. Because of its low toxicity and ability to dissolve [[non-polar]] substances, ethanol can be used as a solvent in medical drugs, [[perfume]]s, and vegetable essences such as [[vanilla]]. In [[organic synthesis]], alcohols serve as versatile intermediates.

Ethanol can be used as an antiseptic to disinfect the skin before injections are given, often along with iodine. Ethanol-based soaps are becoming common in restaurants and are convenient because they do not require drying due to the volatility of the compound. Alcohol is also used as a [[preservative]] for specimens.

Alcohol gels have become common as [[hand sanitizer]]s.

==Production==
In industry, alcohols are produced in several ways:
* By [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37&amp;nbsp;°C to produce ethanol, for instance, the conversion of [[invertase]] to [[glucose]] and [[fructose]] or the conversion of [[glucose]] to [[zymase]] and [[ethanol]].
* By direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]] using [[ethylene]] ([[Ethanol#Ethylene hydration|ethylene hydration]])&lt;ref name=&quot;ECT4 820&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Lodgsdon J.E. |year=1994 |chapter=Ethanol |editor= Kroschwitz J.I. | title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology| edition=4th| volume= 9 |page= 820 |location= New York |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-471-52677-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other alkenes from [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]].

===Endogenous===
Several of the benign bacteria in the intestine use [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] as a form of [[anaerobic respiration]]. This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces [[ethanol]] as a waste product, just like [[aerobic respiration]] produces [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]]. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria.

==Laboratory synthesis==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;
Several methods exist for the preparation of alcohols in the laboratory.

===Substitution===
Primary [[alkyl halide]]s react with aqueous [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] mainly to primary alcohols in [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]]. (Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]].

===Reduction===
[[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of β-keto-esters.

===Hydrolysis===
[[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed.

The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:
:[[Image:Secondary alcohol formation-diagram.svg|350px|Preparation of a secondary alcohol]]

==Reactions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;

===Deprotonation===
Alcohols can behave as weak acids, undergoing [[deprotonation]]. The deprotonation reaction to produce an [[alkoxide]] salt is performed either with a strong base such as sodium hydride or [[butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] or with sodium or potassium metal.

: 2 R-OH + 2 [[Sodium hydride|NaH]] → 2 R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2[[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]↑

: 2 R-OH + 2 [[Sodium|Na]] → 2 R-O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

: 2 [[Ethanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH]] + 2 Na → 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

Water is similar in [[pKa|pK&lt;Sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] to many alcohols, so with [[sodium hydroxide]] there is an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] set-up, which usually lies to the left:

: R-OH + NaOH ⇌ R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (equilibrium to the left)

It should be noted, however, that the bases used to deprotonate alcohols are strong themselves. The bases used and the alkoxides created are both highly moisture-sensitive chemical reagents.

The acidity of alcohols is also affected by the overall stability of the alkoxide ion. [[Electron-withdrawing group]]s attached to the carbon containing the hydroxyl group will serve to stabilize the alkoxide when formed, thus resulting in greater acidity. On the other hand, the presence of [[electron-donating group]] will result in a less stable alkoxide ion formed. This will result in a scenario whereby the unstable alkoxide ion formed will tend to accept a proton to reform the original alcohol.

With [[alkyl halide]]s alkoxides give rise to [[ether]]s in the [[Williamson ether synthesis]].

===Nucleophilic substitution===
The OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Image:Alcohol reaction examples.gif|700px|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]

Alcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:

: 3 R-OH + PBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 RBr + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.

===Dehydration===
Alcohols are themselves nucleophilic, so R−OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can react with ROH to produce [[ether]]s and water in a [[dehydration reaction]], although this reaction is rarely used except in the manufacture of [[diethyl ether]].

More useful is the E1 [[elimination reaction]] of alcohols to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature.

This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethene]]:

[[Image:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|550px]]

A more controlled elimination reaction is the [[Chugaev elimination]] with carbon disulfide and iodomethane.

===Esterification===
To form an [[ester]] from an alcohol and a [[carboxylic acid]] the reaction, known as [[Fischer esterification]], is usually performed at [[reflux]] with a [[catalyst]] of concentrated sulfuric acid:

: R-OH + R'-COOH → R'-COOR + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In order to drive the equilibrium to the right and produce a good [[yield (chemistry)|yield]] of ester, water is usually removed, either by an excess of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or by using a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]]. Esters may also be prepared by reaction of the alcohol with an [[acid chloride]] in the presence of a base such as [[pyridine]].

Other types of ester are prepared in a similar manner — for example, [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine.

===Oxidation===
{{Main|Alcohol oxidation}}
Primary alcohols (R-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH) can be oxidized either to [[aldehyde]]s (R-CHO) or to [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H), while the oxidation of secondary alcohols (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.

The direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.

[[Image:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|500px|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]]

Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]]. These include [[Collins reagent]] and [[Dess-Martin periodinane]]. The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using [[Potassium permanganate]] or the [[Jones reagent]].

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Short-term effects of alcohol|Long-term effects of alcohol}}

[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.png|thumb|right|Most significant of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]]. In addition, in pregnant women, it causes [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]
[[Ethanol]] in alcoholic beverages has been consumed by humans since prehistoric times for a variety of hygienic, dietary, medicinal, religious, and recreational reasons. The consumption of large doses of ethanol causes [[drunkenness]] (intoxication), which may lead to a [[hangover]] as its effects wear off. Depending upon the dose and the regularity of its consumption, ethanol can cause acute respiratory failure or death. Because ethanol impairs judgment in humans, it can be a catalyst for reckless or irresponsible behavior. The {{LD50}} of [[ethanol]] in rats is 10.3&amp;nbsp;g/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Robert S. Gable | year = 2004 | title = Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances | journal = [[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume = 99 | issue = 6 | pages = 686–696 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00744.x | url = http://web.cgu.edu/faculty/gabler/toxicity%20Addiction%20offprint.pdf | format = reprint | pmid = 15139867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other alcohols are substantially more poisonous than ethanol, partly because they take much longer to be metabolized and partly because their metabolism produces substances that are even more toxic. Methanol (wood alcohol), for instance, is oxidized to [[formaldehyde]] and then to the poisonous [[formic acid]] in the liver by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[formaldehyde dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s, respectively; accumulation of formic acid can lead to blindness or death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM |title=A seaman with blindness and confusion |journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339 |issue= |pages=b3929 |year=2009 |month=Sep 30|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, poisoning due to other alcohols such as [[ethylene glycol]] or [[diethylene glycol]] are due to their metabolites, which are also produced by alcohol dehydrogenase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brent-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brent J |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=N.

Alcohol dehydrogenase has a higher affinity for ethanol, thus preventing methanol from binding and acting as a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]. Any remaining methanol will then have time to be excreted through the kidneys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = HE | last2 = Burkhart | first2 = KK | last3 = Donovan | first3 = JW | title = Ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning: diagnosis and treatment | journal = Journal of emergency nursing: JEN : official publication of the Emergency Department Nurses Association | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–20 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10097201  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lobert | first1 = S | title = Ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Critical care nurse | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 41–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11878258  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanol itself, while poisonous, has a much weaker [[sedative]] effect than ethanol. Some longer-chain alcohols such as [[n-propanol]], [[isopropanol]], [[n-butanol]], [[t-butanol]], and [[2-methyl-2-butanol]] do, however, have stronger sedative effects, but also have higher toxicity than ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.alc.0000183012.93303.90 | last1 = McKee | first1 = M | last2 = Suzcs | first2 = S | last3 = Sárváry | first3 = A | last4 = Adany | first4 = R | last5 = Kiryanov | first5 = N | last6 = Saburova | first6 = L | last7 = Tomkins | first7 = S | last8 = Andreev | first8 = E | last9 = Leon | first9 = DA | title = The composition of surrogate alcohols consumed in Russia | journal = Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research | volume = 29 | issue = 10 | pages = 1884–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16269919  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1191/0960327106ht607oa | last1 = Bunc | first1 = M | last2 = Pezdir | first2 = T | last3 = Mozina | first3 = H | last4 = Mozina | first4 = M | last5 = Brvar | first5 = M | title = Butanol ingestion in an airport hangar | journal = Human &amp; experimental toxicology | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 195–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16696295  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These longer chain alcohols are found as contaminants in some alcoholic beverages and are known as [[fusel alcohol]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woo | first1 = KL | title = Determination of low molecular weight alcohols including fusel oil in various samples by diethyl ether extraction and capillary gas chromatography | journal = Journal of AOAC International | volume = 88 | issue = 5 | pages = 1419–27 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16385992  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | doi=10.5555/jaoi.2005.88.5.1419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lachenmeier | first1 = DW | last2 = Haupt | first2 = S | last3 = Schulz | first3 = K | title = Defining maximum levels of higher alcohols in alcoholic beverages and surrogate alcohol products | journal = Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–21 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18295386 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2007.12.008  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are reputed to cause severe [[hangover]]s although it is unclear if the fusel alcohols are actually responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hori | first1 = H | last2 = Fujii | first2 = W | last3 = Hatanaka | first3 = Y | last4 = Suwa | first4 = Y | title = Effects of fusel oil on animal hangover models | journal = Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research | volume = 27 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 37S–41S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12960505 | doi = 10.1097/01.ALC.0000078828.49740.48  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many longer chain alcohols are used in industry as [[solvent]]s and are occasionally abused by [[alcoholic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiernikowski | first1 = A | last2 = Piekoszewski | first2 = W | last3 = Krzyzanowska-Kierepka | first3 = E | last4 = Gomułka | first4 = E | title = Acute oral poisoning with isopropyl alcohol in alcoholics | journal = Przeglad lekarski | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 459–63 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9333902  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mańkowski | first1 = W | last2 = Klimaszyk | first2 = D | last3 = Krupiński | first3 = B | title = How to differentiate acute isopropanol poisoning from ethanol intoxication? -- a case report | journal = Przeglad lekarski | volume = 57 | issue = 10 | pages = 588–90 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11199895  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a range of adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogomolova | first1 = IN | last2 = Bukeshov | first2 = MK | last3 = Bogomolov | first3 = DV | title = The forensic medical diagnosis of intoxication of alcohol surrogates by morphological findings | journal = Sudebno-meditsinskaia ekspertiza | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 22–5 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15523882  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
