 further enjoined that any one playing bowls outside his own garden or orchard was liable to a penalty of 6s. 8d., while those possessed of lands of the yearly value of £100 might obtain licences to play on their own private greens.

In 1864 William Wallace Mitchell (1803–1884), a Glasgow Cotton Merchant, published his &quot;Manual of Bowls Playing&quot; following his work as the secretary formed in 1849 by Scottish bowling clubs which became the basis of the rules of the modern game.
Young Mitchell was only 11 when he played on Kilmarnock Bowling green, the oldest club in Scotland, instituted in 1740.

National Bowling Associations were established in the late 1800s. In the then Victorian Colony (now State of Victoria in Australia), the (Royal) Victorian Bowling Association was formed in 1880 and The Scottish Bowling Association was established in 1892, although there had been a failed attempt in 1848 by 200 Scottish clubs.

Today the sport is played in over 40 countries with more than 50 member national authorities.
The home of the modern game is still Scotland with the World Bowls centre in Edinburgh at Caledonia House,1 Redheughs Rigg, South Gyle, Edinburgh, EH12 9DQ.

==Game==

[[Image:Drumoak and district bowling green.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Drumoak]] bowling green]]
Lawn bowls is usually played on a large, rectangular, precisely leveled and manicured [[Lawn|grass]] or synthetic surface known as a [[bowling green]] which is divided into parallel playing strips called [[bowling green|rink]]s. In the simplest competition, singles, one of the two opponents flips a coin to see who wins the &quot;mat&quot; and begins a segment of the competition (in bowling parlance, an &quot;end&quot;), by placing the mat and rolling the jack to the other end of the green to serve as a target. Once it has come to rest, the jack is aligned to the centre of the rink and the players take turns to roll their bowls from the mat towards the jack and thereby build up the &quot;head&quot;. 

A bowl may curve outside the rink boundary on its path, but must come to rest within the rink boundary to remain in play. Bowls falling into the ditch are dead and removed from play, except in the event when one has &quot;touched&quot; the jack on its way. &quot;Touchers&quot; are marked with chalk and remain alive in play even though they are in the ditch. Similarly if the jack is knocked into the ditch it is still alive unless it is out of bounds to the side resulting in a &quot;dead&quot; end which is replayed, though according to international rules the jack is &quot;respotted&quot; to the centre of the rink and the end is continued. After each competitor has delivered all of their bowls (four each in singles and pairs, three each in triples, and two bowls each in fours), the distance of the closest bowls to the jack is determined (the jack may have been displaced) and points, called &quot;shots&quot;, are awarded for each bowl which a competitor has closer than the opponent's nearest to the jack. For instance, if a competitor has bowled two bowls closer to the jack than their opponent's nearest, they are awarded two shots. The exercise is then repeated for the next end, a game of bowls typically being of twenty one ends.

Lawn bowls is played on grass and variations from green to green are common. Greens come in all shapes and sizes, fast, slow, big crown, small crown and so on.

==Scoring==
Scoring systems vary from competition to competition. Games can be decided when:
* a player in a singles game reaches a specified target number of shots (usually 21 or 25).
* a team (pair, triple or four) has the higher score after a specified number of ends.

Games to a specified number of ends may also be drawn. The draw may stand, or the opponents may be required to play an '''extra end''' to decide the winner. These provisions are always published beforehand in the event's '''Conditions of Play'''.

In the [http://bowlstawa.com/hq/laws Laws of the Sport of Bowls] the winner in a singles game is the first player to score 21 shots. In all other disciplines (pairs, triples, fours) the winner is the team who has scored the most shots after 18 ends of play. Often local tournaments will play shorter games (often 10 or 12 ends). Some competitions use a &quot;set&quot; scoring system, with the first to seven points awarded a set in a best-or-three or best-of-five set match. As well as singles competition, there can be two (pairs), three (triples) and four-player (fours) teams. In these, teams bowl alternately, with each player within a team bowling all their bowls, then handing over to the next player. The team captain or &quot;skip&quot; always plays last and is instrumental in directing his team's shots and tactics. The current method of scoring in the professional tour ([[World Bowls Tour]]) is sets. Each set consists of nine ends and the player with the most shots at the end of a set wins the set. If the score is tied the set is halved. If a player wins two sets, or gets a win and a tie, that player wins the game. If each player wins a set, or both sets end tied, there is a 3-end tiebreaker to determine a winner.

==Bias of bowls==
[[Image:Bowls&amp;Kitty.JPG|thumb|Two bowls with club stickers. The kitty is sitting in front of the bowls.]]
Bowls are designed to travel a curved path because of a weight [[bias]] which was originally produced by inserting weights in one side of the bowl. This is no longer permitted by the rules and bias is now produced entirely by the shape of the bowl. A bowler determines the bias direction of the bowl in his hand by a dimple or symbol on one side. Regulations determine the minimum bias allowed, and the range of diameters (11.6 to 13.1&amp;nbsp;cm), but within these rules bowlers can and do choose bowls to suit their own preference. They were originally made from [[lignum vitae]], a dense wood giving rise to the term &quot;woods&quot; for bowls, but are now more typically made of a hard plastic composite material. 

Bowls were once only available coloured black or brown but they are now available in a variety of colours. They have unique symbol markings engraved on them for identification. Since many bowls look the same, coloured, adhesive stickers or labels are also used to mark the bowls of each team in bowls matches. Some local associations agree on specific colours for stickers for each of the clubs in their area. Provincial or national colors are often assigned in national and international competitions. These stickers are used by [[officials]] to distinguish teams.

Bowls have symbols unique to the set of four for identification. The side of the bowl with a larger symbol within a circle indicates the side away from the bias. That side with a smaller symbol within a smaller circle is the bias side toward which the bowl will turn. It is not uncommon for players to deliver a &quot;wrong bias&quot; shot from time to time and see their carefully aimed bowl crossing neighbouring rinks rather than heading towards their jack.

When bowling there are several types of delivery. &quot;Draw&quot; shots are those where the bowl is rolled to a specific location without causing too much disturbance of bowls already in the head. For a right-handed bowler, &quot;forehand draw&quot; or &quot;finger peg&quot; is initially aimed to the right of the jack, and curves in to the left. The same bowler can deliver a &quot;backhand draw&quot; or &quot;thumb peg&quot; by turning the bowl over in his hand and curving it the opposite way, from left to right. In both cases, the bowl is rolled as close to the jack as possible, unless tactics demand otherwise. A &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;strike&quot; involves bowling with force with the aim of knocking either the jack or a specific bowl out of play - and with the drive's speed, there is virtually no noticeable (or, at least, much less) curve on the shot. An &quot;upshot&quot; or &quot;yard on&quot; shot involves delivering the bowl with an extra degree of weight (often referred to as &quot;controlled&quot; weight or &quot;rambler&quot;), enough to displace the jack or disturb other bowls in the head without killing the end. A &quot;block&quot; shot is one that is intentionally placed short to defend from a drive or to stop an oppositions draw shot. The challenge in all these shots is to be able to adjust line and length accordingly, the faster the delivery, the narrower the line or &quot;green&quot;.

==Variations of play==
Particularly in team competition there can be a large number of bowls on the green towards the conclusion of the end, and this gives rise to complex tactics. Teams &quot;holding shot&quot; with the closest bowl will often make their subsequent shots not with the goal of placing the bowl near the jack, but in positions to make it difficult for opponents to get their bowls into the head, or to places where the jack might be deflected to if the opponent attempts to disturb the head.

[[Image:Edgworth Bowling Green.jpg|thumb|left|300pcx|A crown green at [[Edgworth, Lancashire]].]]

There are many different ways to set up the game. '''Crown Green Bowling''' utilises the entire green. A player can send the jack anywhere on the green in this game and the green itself is more akin to a golf green, with lots of undulation. Crown Green Bowls is very popular mostly in the North of England but also in Wales, West Midlands and Shropshire. The game is played usually to 21-up in Singles and Doubles format with some competitions playing to 31-up. The Panel (Professional Crown Green Bowls) is played at the Red Lion, Westhoughton daily and is played to 41-up with greenside betting throughout play. The game of Crown Green Bowls is looking to grow with the introduction of the Portuguese Masters in October and recent interest from Sky TV to re-televise the sport.

Singles, triples and fours and Australian pairs are some ways the game can be played. In singles, two people play against each other and the first to win to either 21, 25 or 31 shots (how many bowls of ones are closest to the white jack or kitty are shots). The controlling body sets the game to either 21, 25 or 31. An additional scoring method is set play. This comprises two sets over nine ends, an end being the completion of both players delivering all their bowls. Should a player win a set each, they then play a further 3 ends that will decide the winner.

Pairs allows both people on a team to play Skip and Lead. The lead throws two bowls, the skip delivers two, then the lead delivers his remaining two, the skip then delivers his remaining two bowls. Each end, the leads and skips switch positions. This is played over 21 ends or sets play. Triples is with three players while Fours is with four players in each team and is played over 21 ends.

Another pairs variation, popular in New Zealand, is 242 pairs. In the first end of the game the A players lead off with 2 bowls each, then the B players play 4 bowls each, before the A players complete the end with their final 2 bowls. The A players act as lead and skip in the same end. In the second end the roles are reversed with the A players being in the middle. This alternating pattern continues through the game which is typically over 15 ends.

[[Short Mat Bowls]] is an all-year sport unaffected by weather conditions and it does not require a permanent location as the rink mats can be rolled up and stowed away. This makes it particularly appropriate for small communities as it can be played in village halls, schools, sports and social clubs, hotels and so on. where space is restricted and is also required for other purposes: it is even played on North Sea oil rigs where space is really at a premium. 

Bowls are played by the blind and paraplegic. Blind bowlers are extremely skilful. A string is run out down the centre of the lane &amp; wherever the jack lands it is moved across to the string and the length is called out by a sighted marker, when the woods are sent the distance from the jack is called out, in yards, feet and inches-the position in relation to the jack is given using the clock,12.00 is behind the jack. The world's best are a match for the best club level sighted bowlers {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

Bowls is popular in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[Hong Kong]] and parts of the [[United States]]. It is also gaining momentum in [[Japan]]. Because of its competitiveness, skill and the fact that it is a non-contact sport, the game suits people from teen years through to their nineties. However, there is a considerable professional competition with many younger men and women playing. Since the early 2000s, the sport has developed in [[Denmark]] as well {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. The World Championships held in the UK annually is a £100,000 competition and is watched by 3 million viewers via BBC TV {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

Another phenomenon is barefoot or corporate bowls, where established clubs in Australia open their greens to paying customers who are organised into teams for a social few hours on the green.

Bowls is played at the [[Commonwealth Games]]; the last being held in Delhi, India, where Natalie Melmore (England) and Robert Weale (Wales) won the singles Gold Medals. 2014 sees the Games in [[Commonwealth Games 2014|Glasgow, Scotland]].

'''Barcelonnette''' (''Barcilona de Provença'' in [[Occitan]]) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Ubaye Valley]], in the southern [[French Alps]], in [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]] [[Departments of France|department]], of which it is a [[Subprefectures in France|subprefecture]].

==History==
The city's name comes from [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence|Ramon Berenguer IV]], count of Provence, who founded the city in 1231. The vallée de Barcelonnette, the area around the town, belonged to the Duchy of Savoy in the early modern period. At the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the vallée de Barcelonnette was traded to France. Thus Barcelonnette has only been a French possession since the 18th century.

==Geography==
Barcelonnette is situated in a wide and very fertile valley. It lies at an elevation of 1132&amp;nbsp;m (3717&amp;nbsp;ft) on the right bank of the [[Ubaye]] River, on which it is the most well-known place.

==Economy==
The city is mainly a tourist and resort centre, serving many [[ski]] lodges.

==Emigration==
The city and the region around has been the center of a French [[emigration]] wave to the Americas (mostly [[Mexico]]) in the late 19th and early beginning 20th centuries. Families which had prospered abroad came back and built the huge mansions that one can see all over the town called ''Maisons Mexicaines''. The construction of such mansions took place primarily from 1880 to 1930. Today, a large community of Barcelonettes live in, Monterrey, [[Mexico City]], San Luis Potosí and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico. Amongst the most famous of these descendants are the Mexican comedian Eugenio Derbez and the jazz composer and writer Alain Derbez. There are also very successful descendants who play an extremely significant role in the Mexican business community such as the Clariond and Suberville families.

The '''Bahá'í Faith''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|ə|ˈ|h|aɪ}})&lt;ref&gt;In English {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|aɪ}} with two syllables, in Persian {{lang-fa |بهائی}} {{IPA-fa|bæhɒːʔiː|}} with three syllables. The exact realization of the English pronunciation varies. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has {{IPAc-en|b|æ|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell|ba|HAH|ee}}, [[Merriam-Webster]] has {{IPAc-en |b|ɑː|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell|bah|HAH|ee}}, and the [[Random House Dictionary]] has {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell |bə|HAH|ee}}. See {{citation | publisher = Bahá’i Study | url = http://www.bahaistudy.org/mp3/Bahai-Glossary1.mp3 | first = Amin | last = Banani | title = A Baha'i Glossary and Pronunciation Guide | format = MP3}} and {{citation | url = http://bahai-library.com/wttp/programs.html | first = Darius | last = Shahrokh | title = Windows to the Past Series | title = Bahá’i Library}}&amp;nbsp;– A Guide to Pronunciation part 1 and 2, for more pronunciation instructions&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[monotheism| monotheistic]] [[religion]] founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 19th-century [[Persia]], emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Houghton|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are an estimated five to six million Bahá'ís around the world in more than 200 countries and territories.&lt;ref name= &quot;statistics&quot;&gt;[[Bahá'í statistics#Worldwide figures|Bahá'í statistics]] for a breakdown of different estimates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hutter|2005|pp=737–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Bahá'í Faith, religious history is seen to have unfolded through a series of divine messengers, each of whom established a religion that was suited to the needs of the time and the capacity of the people. These messengers have included [[Abraham]], the [[Gautama Buddha| Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] and others, and most recently the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. In Bahá'í belief, each consecutive messenger prophesied of messengers to follow, and Bahá'u'lláh's life and teachings fulfilled the [[eschatology|end-time]] promises of previous scriptures. Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution, and the need of the present time is for the gradual establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.&lt;ref name = &quot;PSmith107&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=107–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;Bahá'í&quot; is used either as an adjective to refer to the Bahá'í Faith or as a term for a follower of Bahá'u'lláh. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockman|2006|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Arabic ''[[Bahá'í symbols#The Greatest Name|Bahá’]]'', meaning &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;splendour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'ís prefer the orthographies &quot;Bahá'í&quot;, &quot;Bahá'ís&quot;, &quot;the Báb&quot;, &quot;Bahá'u'lláh&quot;, and &quot;`Abdu'l-Bahá&quot;, using a [[Bahá'í orthography|particular transcription]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] in publications. &quot;Bahai&quot;, &quot;Bahais&quot;, &quot;Baha'i&quot;, &quot;the Bab&quot;, &quot;Bahaullah&quot; and &quot;Baha'u'llah&quot; are often used when diacriticals are unavailable.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Bahaism&quot; (or &quot;Baha'ism&quot;) has been used in the past, but the correct name of the religion is Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hatcher|Martin|1998| pp = xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Journalist's Guide to the Baha'i Faith | author = Centre for Faith and the Media | location = Calgary, Alberta | url = http://www.faithandmedia.org/cms/uploads/files/8_guide-bahai.pdf | publisher = Centre for Faith and the Media | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Three core principles establish a basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|unity of God]], the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|unity of religion]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humankind]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt; From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith108&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== God ===
{{Main|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}
[[File:Bahaitemplesydney.JPG|thumb|Bahá'í Temple, Ingleside, Sydney, Australia]]

The Bahá'í writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty [[God]] who is the creator of all things in the universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith106&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of God and the [[universe]] is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Britannica|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed [[Manifestations of God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith106&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith111&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations.&lt;ref name=&quot;hatcher_huri&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|1982|pp=1–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bahá'í religion God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on [[monotheism]]; such doctrines as the [[Trinity]] contradict the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Jesus Christ in the Baha'i Writings | first = Robert | last = Stockman | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume= 2 | issue = 1 | number = 1 | url = http://bahai-library.com/articles/stockman.jesus.html | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path.&lt;ref name=&quot;hatcher_huri&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot; /&gt; According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]], [[Introspection|reflection]] and being of service to humankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;hatcher_huri&quot; /&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
::''See also: [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]]''

Bahá'í notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of most of the world's religions, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of [[dispensationalism|dispensations]], where each ''manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]], suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt; Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; however, it is believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McMullen|2000| |p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1978|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'í beliefs are sometimes described as [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combinations of earlier religions' beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Resource Guide for the Scholarly Study of the Bahá'í Faith | last = Stockman | first = Robert | chapter = The Baha'i Faith and Syncretism | year = 1997 | url = http://bahai-library.com/stockman_bahai_syncretism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own [[Bahá'í literature|scriptures]], [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[Bahá'í laws|laws]], and [[Bahá'í history|history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Bahais | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | url = http://www.brillonline.nl/public/demo#islam | accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its religious background in [[Shi'a Islam]] is seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = A. |year = 1984 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 3: `Akka, The Early Years 1868–77 |publisher = George Ronald |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-144-2 | page = 262 | url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V3/p253-274Ch12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to the modern context.&lt;ref name=&quot;lundberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Baha'i Apocalypticism: The Concept of Progressive Revelation | first = Zaid | last = Lundberg | date = 1996–2005 | url = http://bahai-library.com/lundberg_bahai_apocalypticism | accessdate = 2007-05-01 | chapter = The Concept of Progressive Revelation | publisher = Department of History of Religion at the Faculty of Theology, Lund University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh is believed to have fulfilled the [[Eschatology|messianic expectations]] of these precursor faiths.&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;&gt;{{cite book

=== Human beings ===
[[File:Ringstone.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Bahá'í symbols#Ringstone symbol|Ringstone symbol]] represents humanity's connection to God]]
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The Bahá'í writings state that human beings have a &quot;rational [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]&quot;, and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's station and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through His [[Manifestation of God|messengers]], and to conform to their teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn= 0-8135-2836-4 |pages= 57–58 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.&lt;ref name=&quot;lafd&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Life After Death: A study of the afterlife in world religions | last = Masumian | first = Farnaz | publisher = Oneworld Publications | location = Oxford | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-85168-074-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt; The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humankind is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt;{{-}}

=== Summary ===
[[Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' constitute the bedrock of the Bahá'í Faith:
{{quote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[superstition]] or [[tradition]]; the oneness of the entire [[Human|human race]], the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between [[religion]] and [[science]]; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of humankind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a [[World government|world tribunal]] for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and [[World peace|universal peace]] as the supreme goal of all mankind—these stand out as the essential elements [which Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-20.html#gr7 | pages=281–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Social principles ===
The following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Bahá'í teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith52&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bcom&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Principles of the Bahá'í Faith | publisher= bahai.com | date=2006-03-26 | url = http://www.bahai.com/Bahaullah/principles.htm | accessdate = 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bcom&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica2&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bahai Faith | first = Juan | last = Cole | authorlink = Juan Cole | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f4/v3f4a100a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty

With specific regard to the pursuit of [[world peace]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]] prescribed a world-embracing [[collective security]] arrangement as necessary for the establishment of a lasting peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-peace&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= peace |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mystical teachings ===
Although the [[Bahá'í teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt; The ''[[Seven Valleys]]'' is considered Bahá'u'lláh's &quot;greatest mystical composition.&quot; It was written to a follower of [[Sufism]], in the style of [[Attar Neyshapuri|{{nbsp}}`Attar]], a Muslim poet,&lt;ref name=&quot;ency_sevenvalleys&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Seven Valleys |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rob1&quot;&gt;{{cite book  |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853–63 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8|pages = 96–99|url=http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/p096-104Ch08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bahá'u'lláh to the [[Western world|West]]. The ''[[Hidden Words]]'' is another book written by Bahá'u'lláh during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Bahá'u'lláh claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.&lt;ref name=&quot;hiddenwords&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Hidden Words |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |page= 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covenant ===
{{Main|Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh}}
The Bahá'í teachings speak of both a &quot;Greater Covenant&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taherzadeh |first= Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1972 |title= The Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-344-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; being universal and endless, and a &quot;Lesser Covenant&quot;, being unique to each religious dispensation. The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bahá'í writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward.&lt;ref name=&quot;momen_covenant&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker | last = Momen | first = Moojan | accessdate = 2006-06-14 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#3.%20The%20Lesser%20Covenant }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humankind, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.

With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an [[Bahá'í administration|administration]] they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any [[Bahá'í divisions]] have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following.&lt;ref name=&quot;maceoin&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bahai Faith | first = Denis | last = MacEoin | authorlink = Denis MacEoin | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f4/v3f4a100a.html | pages= 448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of such divisions are regarded as [[Covenant-breaker]]s and shunned, essentially [[Excommunication|excommunicated]].&lt;ref name=&quot;momen_covenant&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith173&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canonical texts ==
{{Main|Bahá'í literature}}
The ''canonical texts'' are the writings of the [[Báb]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], [[Shoghi Effendi]] and the [[Universal House of Justice]], and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-canonical-texts&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= canonical texts |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], literally the ''Most Holy Book'', which is his book of laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]], literally the ''Book of Certitude'', which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gems of Divine Mysteries]], which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the [[Seven Valleys]] and the [[The Four Valleys|Four Valleys]] which are mystical treatises.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith20&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Bahá'í history}}
Bahá'í history follows a sequence of leaders, beginning with the [[Báb]]'s May 23, 1844 declaration in [[Shiraz, Iran]], and ultimately resting on an administrative order established by the central figures of the religion. The tradition was mostly isolated to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires until after the death of Bahá'u'lláh in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;rob4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1987 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 4: Mazra'ih &amp; Bahji 1877–92 |page=125 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 |url=http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V4/p118-144Ch08.html#p125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;affolter&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Affolter | first = Friedrich W.  | year = 2005 | last2 = Momen | month = January | first2 = Moojan | title = The Specter of Ideological Genocide: The Bahá'ís of Iran | journal = War Crimes, Genocide, &amp; Crimes against Humanity | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–114 | url =http://www.altoona.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf| accessdate = 2006-05-31 | doi = 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8 | format = [[PDF]] | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Báb ===
{{Main|Báb}}
[[File:Shrine Bab North West.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Shrine of the Báb]] in Haifa, Israel.]]
On May 23, 1844 Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad of Shiraz, Iran proclaimed that he was &quot;the Báb&quot; ({{lang|ar|الباب}} &quot;the Gate&quot;), referencing his later claim to the station of [[Mahdi]], the Twelfth Imam of [[Shi'a Islam|Shi`a Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;affolter&quot; /&gt; His followers were therefore known as [[Bábism|Bábís]]. As the Báb's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, his followers came under increased persecution and torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt; The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the [[List of kings of Persia|Shah's]] army. The Báb himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://bahai-library.com/winters_dying_for_god | last = Winter | first = Jonah | date =1997-09-17 | title= Dying for God: Martyrdom in the Shii and Babi Religions | journal = Master of Arts Thesis, University of Toronto | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís see the Báb as the forerunner of the Bahá'í Faith, because the Báb's writings introduced the concept of &quot;[[He whom God shall make manifest]]&quot;, a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá'ís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be in 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt; [[Shrine of the Báb|The Báb's tomb]], located in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]], is an important place of [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Bahá'ís. The remains of the Báb were brought secretly from [[Iran]] to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them in a spot specifically designated by Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name=&quot;balyuzi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Hasan |last=Balyuzi |authorlink=Hasan M.

=== Bahá'u'lláh ===
{{Main|Bahá'u'lláh}}
Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí was one of the early followers of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. He was arrested and imprisoned for this involvement in 1852. Bahá'u'lláh relates that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the [[Síyáh-Chál]] in [[Tehran]], he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt;

Shortly thereafter he was expelled from [[Tehran]] to [[Baghdad]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]];&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt; then to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]); and then to Adrianople (now [[Edirne]]). In 1863, at the time of his  banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and [[Subh-i-Azal]], the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bahá'u'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Bahá'ís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including Pope [[Pius IX]], [[Napoleon III]], and Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]].

In 1868 Bahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan [[Abdülâziz]] a final time to the Ottoman penal colony of [[Acre, Israel|`Akká]], in present-day [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole | authorlink = Juan Cole | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f4/v3f4a085.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica&quot; /&gt; He died there in 1892. Bahá'ís regard his resting place at [[Mansion of Bahjí|Bahjí]] as the [[Qiblih]] to which they turn in prayer each day.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith20&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=20–21, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá ===
{{Main|`Abdu'l-Bahá}}
`Abbás Effendi was Bahá'u'lláh's eldest son, known by the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá). His father left a [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will]] that appointed `Abdu'l-Bahá as the leader of the Bahá'í community, and designated him as the &quot;Centre of the Covenant&quot;, &quot;Head of the Faith&quot;, and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings.&lt;ref name=&quot;balyuzi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |origyear=1873–92 |year=1994 |title=Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn=0-87743-174-4 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ |p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until `Abdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908. Following his release he led a life of travelling, speaking, teaching, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt;

=== Bahá'í administration ===
{{Main|Bahá'í administration}}
Bahá'u'lláh's ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' and ''The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]'' are foundational documents of the Bahá'í administrative order. Bahá'u'lláh established the elected [[Universal House of Justice]], and `Abdu'l-Bahá established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;balyuzi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bahá appointed his eldest grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]], as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith55&quot;/&gt;

Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated [[Bahá'í texts]]; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bahá'í community; developed the [[Bahá'í World Centre]]; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt; He died in 1957 under conditions that did not allow for a successor to be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = A. |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year = 2000 |title = The Child of the Covenant |pages = 347–363 |publisher = George Ronald |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-439-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith68&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=58–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At local, regional, and national levels, Bahá'ís elect members to nine-person [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]], which run the affairs of the religion. There are also [[Institution of the Counsellors|appointed individuals]] working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do not serve as [[clergy]], which the Bahá'í Faith does not have.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith160&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, remains the successor and supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Bahá'í Faith: A portrait | first = Robert | last = Stockman | title = A Source Book for Earth's Community of Religions | editor = Joel Beversluis (ed) | location = Grand Rapids, MI | publisher = CoNexus Press | year = 1995 |url = http://www.books.google.com/books?id=dbSPOoQfu0IC | isbn = 9781577311218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any male Bahá'í, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith205&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International plans ===
In 1937, [[Shoghi Effendi]] launched a seven year plan for the Bahá'ís of North America, followed by another in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Studying the Writings of Shoghi Effendi | chapter = The Life of Shoghi Effendi | first = Helen | last = Danesh | coauthors = Danesh, John; Danesh, Amelia | publisher = George Ronald | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-85398-336-4|editor = M.

This plan included extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of [[Bahá'í texts]] into several new languages, and the sending of [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í pioneers]] into previously unreached nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Bahá'í Studies | title= Baha'i History in the Formative Age | first = Graham | last= Hassal | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | year = 1996 | pages=1–21 | url = http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/6.4.Hassall(scanned).pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments |first2= Moojan |last2= Momen | first = Moojan | last = Momen | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 |issue= 1 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its origins in the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires, by the early 20th century there were a number of converts in [[South Asia|South]] and [[South East Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]]. During the 1950s and 1960s vast [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|travel teaching]] efforts brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world. By the 1990s Bahá'ís were developing programs for systematic consolidation on a large scale, and the early 21st century saw large influxes of new adherents around the world. The Bahá'í Faith is currently the largest religious minority in Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;fdih1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date = 2003-08-01 | title = Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran | author = International Federation for Human Rights | publisher = fdih.org | accessdate = 2006-10-20|url = http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Bahá'í laws}}
[[File:Bahá'í gardens by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Bahá'í gardens in [[Haifa, Israel]].]]
The laws of the Bahá'í Faith primarily come from the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'', written by Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name=&quot;ency_laws&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Law |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |pages=  223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are a few examples of basic laws and religious observances.

* [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith]] consists of obligatory prayer and devotional (general) prayer. Bahá'ís over the age of 15 must individually recite an [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day, using fixed words and form. In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, believers are directed to daily offer [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|devotional prayer]] and to meditate and study sacred scripture. There is no set form for devotions and meditations, though the devotional prayers written by the central figures of the Bahá'í Faith and collected in prayer books are held in high esteem. Reading aloud of prayers from prayer books is a typical feature of Bahá'í gatherings.
* [[Backbiting]] and [[gossip]] are prohibited and denounced.
* Adult Bahá'ís in good health should observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast|nineteen-day sunrise-to-sunset fast]] each year from March 2 through March 20.
* Bahá'ís are forbidden to drink [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.
* [[Sexual intercourse]] is only permitted between a husband and wife, and thus [[premarital]] and [[homosexual]] intercourse are forbidden. ''(See also [[Homosexuality and the Bahá'í Faith]])''
* [[Gambling]] is forbidden.
* [[Fanaticism]] is forbidden.
* Adherence to [[ritual]] is condemned, with the notable exception of the obligatory prayers.
* Abstaining from [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] politics.

Performing useful work, for example, is not only required but considered a form of worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh prohibited a [[Mendicancy|mendicant]] and [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle,&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith154&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging Bahá'ís to &quot;Be anxiously concerned&quot; with the needs of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1991 |title=Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn=0-87743-064-0 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/PB/pb-61.html#gr1 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt;

{{Main|Bahá'í House of Worship}}
Most Bahá'í meetings occur in individuals' homes, local Bahá'í centers, or rented facilities. Worldwide, there are currently seven Bahá'í Houses of Worship with an eighth under construction in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=adherents.com | publisher=adherents.com | title=Baha'i Houses of Worship | url= http://www.adherents.com/largecom/bahai_HoW.html | date = 2001-05 | accessdate = 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í writings refer to an institution called a &quot;Ma&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;riqu'l-A&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;kár&quot; (Dawning-place of the Mention of God), which is to form the center of a complex of institutions including a hospital, university, and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith194&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ever Ma&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;riqu'l-A&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;kár in [[Ashgabat|`Ishqábád, Turkmenistan]], has been the most complete House of Worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ency_how&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Mashriqu'l-Adkhar |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calendar ===
{{Main|Bahá'í calendar}}
The Bahá'í calendar is based upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five [[Ayyám-i-Há|intercalary days]], to make a full [[Tropical year|solar year]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt; The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called [[Bahá'í Naw-Rúz|Naw Rúz]], and occurs on the [[vernal equinox]], March 21, at the end of the month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a [[Nineteen Day Feast|Feast]] for worship, consultation and socializing.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt;

Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty).&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith188&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God.  Bahá'ís observe 11 [[Bahá'í calendar#Holy days|Holy Days]] throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith188&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Bahá'í symbols}}

The symbols of the religion are derived from the Arabic word Bahá’ ({{lang|ar|بهاء}} &quot;splendor&quot; or &quot;glory&quot;), with a [[Abjad numerals|numerical value]] of 9, which is why the most common symbol is the [[nine-pointed star]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smith_gn&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= greatest name |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |coauthors= The Universal House of Justice |editor= Hornby, Helen (Ed.)  |year= 1983  |title= Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File  |publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India  |isbn= 81-85091-46-3 |url= http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ringstone symbol and calligraphy of the Greatest Name are also often encountered.

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen | coauthors = Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion |issue= 1 | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations ===
Bahá'u'lláh wrote of the need for [[world government]] in this age of humanity's collective life. Because of this emphasis the international Bahá'í community has chosen to support efforts of improving [[international relations]] through organizations such as the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]], with some reservations about the present structure and constitution of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í International Community]] is an agency under the direction of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, and has consultative status with the following organizations:&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmullen&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The Baha'i: The religious Construction of a Global Identity | year = 2000 | first = Michael | last= McMullen | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, N.J. | page = 39 | isbn = 0-8135-2836-4 | url = http://www.books.google.com/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Active Cooperation with the United Nations| author = Bahá'í International Community | publisher = bahai.org | url = http://www.bic.org/statements-and-reports/bic-statements/00-0606.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís continue to be persecuted in Islamic countries, as Islamic leaders do not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as an independent religion, but rather as [[apostasy]] from Islam. The most severe persecutions have occurred in [[Bahá'í Faith in Iran|Iran]], where over 200 Bahá'ís were executed between 1978 and 1998,&lt;ref name=&quot;fdih1&quot;/&gt; and in [[Bahá'í Faith in Egypt|Egypt]].

=== Iran ===
The marginalization of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by [[Shi`a Islam|Shi`a]] clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions.&lt;ref name=&quot;affolter&quot; /&gt; Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression that impacted individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and institutions were initiated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ihrdc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= Iran Human Rights Documentation Center | publisher = Iran Human Rights Documentation Center | title= A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha'is of Iran | year= 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-01|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/A-Faith-Denied_Dec06.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case in [[Yazd]] in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nash&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title  = Iran's secret pogrom : The conspiracy to wipe out the Bahaʼis | first = Geoffrey | last = Nash | publisher= Neville Spearman Limited | location = Sudbury, Suffolk | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-85435-005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girl's schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 40s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and [[Bahá'í texts]] were censored.&lt;ref name=&quot;ihrdc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sanasarian&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Eliz | last = Sanasarian | title = Religious Minorities in Iran | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | pages = 52–53 | isbn = 0-521-77073-4 | url = http://www.books.google.com/books?id=mpQCjXm0HAwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], due to the growing nationalism and the economic difficulties in Iran, the Shah gave control over certain religious affairs to the clergy of the country.

The [[Egyptian identification card controversy]] began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of [[identity documents]], which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle.&lt;ref name=&quot;hor&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Congressional Human Rights Caucus, House of Representatives | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | date = 2005-11-16 | url = http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061227195313/http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm |archivedate = December 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships.&lt;ref name=&quot;hor&quot;/&gt; Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on April 14, 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list dash in place of one of the three recognized religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Egypt officially changes rules for ID cards | first = | last = Editors of Bahá'í News Service | date = 2009-04-17 | accessdate = 2009-06-16 | publisher = Bahá'í News Service | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/707 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on August 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First identification cards issued to Egyptian Bahá'ís using a &quot;dash&quot; instead of religion | first = | last = Editors of Bahá'í News Service | date = 2009-08-14 | accessdate = 2009-08-16 | publisher = Bahá'í News Service | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions ===
[[Bernard Lewis]] states that the Muslim laity and Islamic authorities have always had great difficulty in accommodating post-Islamic [[monotheistic]] religions such as the Bahá'í Faith, since the followers of such religions cannot be dismissed either as benighted [[heathens]], like the [[polytheists]] of Asia and the [[animists]] of Africa, nor as outdated precursors, like the Jews and Christians. Moreover, their very existence presents a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1984|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bavarii''' were a [[Germanic tribe]] which emerged late in [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] tribal times. The full name originally was the [[Germanic languages|germanic]] ''*baio-warioz''. This name has been handed down as ''Baiwaren, Baioaren, Bioras'', [[latinised]] ''Bavarii, Baioarii''. It is assumed that this is an [[endonym]]. The first part &quot;baio&quot; refers to the name of the [[Celt|Celtic]] [[Boier]] tribe, which also resolved into the regional name [[Bohemia]] (germanic latinised boio-hemum = home of the Boier tribe). The name of the [[Bavarian]]s therefore is said to mean &quot;men from Bohemia&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  

In the [[Middle Age]]s the Bavarians were considered the descendants of the Celtic Boier tribe. Later, science considered the [[Marcomanni]] as the &quot;men of Bohemia&quot;, after whom the Bavarians were named. Currently they are being identified with a [[East Germanic]] group, whose remainders however have mostly been found in the North of modern day Bavaria. In the Bavarian original region the origins are very mixed. Over the last half of the 20th century, historical and archaeological research has increasingly supported the theory that the remnants of the Celtic Boii were absorbed into the [[Roman Empire]] and later intermingled with other Germanic peoples who chose to stay (or were stationed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]) in the area.  By the 6th c. AD there is evidence of the foundation of a Bavarian [[Stem duchy]] whose leadership was related to the ruling [[Franks|Frankish]] (and possibly [[Alemanni]]c/[[Swabia]]n) houses. However, there is no longer any real evidence that the rulers of Bavaria belonged to a people called the Bavarii.  It is in fact likely that, after the name of the region became known by the name of its early inhabitants, later settlers became known by the accepted geographical name.

The '''Burgundians''' ({{lang-la|Burgundiōnes}}&lt;!-- also Burgundī --&gt;; {{lang-on|Burgundar}}; {{lang-ang|Burgendas}}&lt;!-- also Burgendan and Burgende --&gt;; {{lang-el|Βούργουνδοι}}&lt;!-- also Βουρούγουνδοι and Οὐρουγοῦνδοι --&gt;) were an [[East Germanic language|East Germanic]] [[Germanic tribes|tribe]] which may have emigrated from mainland Scandinavia to the island of [[Bornholm]], whose old form in [[Old Norse]] still was ''Burgundarholmr'' (the Island of the Burgundians), and from there to mainland Europe. In ''[[Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar]]'' (''The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son''), Veseti settled in an island or holm, which was called Borgund's holm, i.e. Bornholm. [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of ''[[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'' uses the name ''Burgenda land''. The poet and early mythologist [[Viktor Rydberg]] (1828&amp;ndash;1895), (''Our Fathers' Godsaga'') asserted from an early medieval source, ''[[Sigismund of Burgundy|Vita Sigismundi]]'', that themselves retained oral traditions about their Scandinavian origin.
==Early history==
===Tribal origins===
[[File:DenmarkBornholm2.png|thumb|right|220px|Location of the island of [[Bornholm]]]]
The Burgundians' tradition of Scandinavian origin finds support in place-name evidence and archaeological evidence (Stjerna) and many consider their tradition to be correct (e.g. Musset, p.&amp;nbsp;62). Possibly because Scandinavia was beyond the horizon of the earliest Roman sources, including [[Tacitus]] (who only mentions one Scandinavian tribe, the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Suiones]]), Roman sources do not mention where the Burgundians came from, and the first Roman references place them east of the [[Rhine]] (''inter alia'', [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], XVIII, 2, 15). Early Roman sources considered them simply another East Germanic tribe. 

About 250, the population of [[Bornholm]] (the island of the Burgundians) largely disappeared from the island. Most cemeteries ceased to be used, and those that were still used had few burials (Stjerna, in Nerman 1925:176).

In the year 369, the Emperor [[Valentinian I]] enlisted the aid of the Burgundians in his war against another Germanic tribe, the [[Alamanni]] (Ammianus, XXVIII, 5, 8-15). At this time, the Burgundians were possibly living in the [[Vistula]] basin, according to the mid-6th-century historian of the [[Goths]], [[Jordanes]].  Sometime after their war against the Alamanni, the Burgundians were beaten in battle by [[Fastida]], king of the [[Gepids]] and were overwhelmed and almost annihilated.

Approximately four decades later, the Burgundians appear again. Following [[Stilicho]]'s withdrawal of troops to fight [[Alaric I]] the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] in AD 406-408, the northern tribes crossed the Rhine and entered the Empire in the ''[[Völkerwanderung]]'', or Germanic migrations.  Among them were the [[Alans]], [[Vandals]], the [[Suevi]], and possibly the Burgundians. The Burgundians migrated westwards and settled in the [[Rhine Valley]].

===Conversion to Christianity===
Somewhere in the east the Burgundians had converted to the [[Arianism|Arian]] form of Christianity from their native [[Germanic polytheism]]. Their Arianism proved a source of suspicion and distrust between the Burgundians and the Catholic Western Roman Empire. Divisions were evidently healed or healing circa AD 500, however, as [[Gundobad]], one of the last Burgundian kings, maintained a close personal friendship with [[Avitus of Vienne|Avitus]], the [[bishop of Vienne]].  Moreover, Gundobad's son and successor, [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]], was himself a Catholic, and there is evidence that many of the Burgundian people had converted by this time as well, including several female members of the ruling family.

===Early relationship with the Romans===
Initially, the Burgundians seem to have had a stormy relationship with the Romans.  They were used by the Empire to fend off other tribes, but also raided the border regions and expanded their influence when possible.

==Burgundian kingdoms==
===First Kingdom===
In 411, the Burgundian king [[Gunther|Gundahar]] or ''Gundicar'' set up a puppet emperor, [[Jovinus]], in cooperation with [[Goar]], king of the [[Alans]]. With the authority of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallic emperor]] that he controlled, Gundahar settled on the left (Roman) bank of the Rhine, between the river [[Lauter]] and the [[Nahe]], seizing [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Speyer]], and [[Strassburg]]. Apparently as part of a truce, the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] later officially &quot;granted&quot; them the land. (Prosper, a. 386)

Despite their new status as ''[[foederati]]'', Burgundian raids into Roman Upper [[Gallia Belgica]] became intolerable and were ruthlessly brought to an end in 436, when the Roman general [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]] called in [[Hun]] mercenaries who overwhelmed the Rhineland kingdom (with its capital at the old Celtic Roman settlement of Borbetomagus/Worms) in 437. Gundahar was killed in the fighting, reportedly along with the majority of the Burgundian tribe. (Prosper; ''Chronica Gallica 452''; Hydatius; and Sidonius Apollinaris)

The destruction of Worms and the Burgundian kingdom by the Huns became the subject of heroic legends that were afterwards incorporated in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''&amp;mdash;on which [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] based his [[Ring Cycle]]&amp;mdash;where King Gunther (Gundahar) and Queen [[Brünnehilde|Brünhild]] hold their court at Worms, and [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] comes to woo Kriemhild. (In Old Norse sources the names are ''Gunnar'', ''Brynhild'', and ''Gudrún'' as normally rendered in English.)  In fact, the ''Etzel'' of the ''Nibelungenlied'' is based on [[Attila the Hun]].

===Second Kingdom===
[[File:Map Burgundian Kingdom EN.png|thumb|right|230px|The Second Burgundian Kingdom between 443 and 476]]
For reasons not cited in the sources, the Burgundians were granted ''foederati'' status a second time, and in 443 were resettled by Aëtius in the region of ''Sapaudia''. (''Chronica Gallica 452'')  Though the precise geography is uncertain, ''Sapaudia'' corresponds to the modern-day [[Savoy]], and the Burgundians probably lived near ''Lugdunum'', known today as [[Lyon]]. (Wood 1994, Gregory II, 9)  A new king [[Gundioc]] or ''Gunderic'', presumed to be Gundahar's son, appears to have reigned from his father's death. (Drew, p.&amp;nbsp;1) The historian Pline{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} tells us that Gonderic reigned the areas of Saône, Dauphiny, Savoie and a part of Provence. He set up [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] as the capital of the kingdom of Burgundy. In all, eight Burgundian kings of the house of Gundahar ruled until the kingdom was overrun by the Franks in 534. 

As allies of Rome in its last decades, the Burgundians fought alongside [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]] and a confederation of Visigoths and others in the battle against [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] at the [[Battle of Châlons]] (also called &quot;The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields&quot;) in 451.  The alliance between Burgundians and Visigoths seems to have been strong, as Gundioc and his brother Chilperic I accompanied [[Theodoric II]] to Spain to fight the Sueves in 455. (Jordanes, ''Getica'', 231)

====Aspirations to the Empire====
Also in 455, an ambiguous reference ''infidoque tibi Burdundio ductu'' ([[Sidonius Apollinaris]] in ''Panegyr. Avit''. 442.) implicates an unnamed treacherous Burgundian leader in the murder of the emperor [[Petronius Maximus]] in the chaos preceding the sack of Rome by the [[Vandals]].  The Patrician [[Ricimer]] is also blamed; this event marks the first indication of the link between the Burgundians and Ricimer, who was probably Gundioc's brother-in-law and [[Gundobad]]'s uncle, (John Malalas, 374)

The Burgundians, apparently confident in their growing power, negotiated in 456 a territorial expansion and power sharing arrangement with the local Roman senators. (Marius of Avenches)

In 457, Ricimer overthrew another emperor, [[Avitus]], raising [[Majorian]] to the throne.  This new emperor proved unhelpful to Ricimer and the Burgundians.  The year after his ascension, Majorian stripped the Burgundians of the lands they had acquired two years earlier.  After showing further signs of independence, he was murdered by Ricimer in 461.

Ten years later, in 472, Ricimer&amp;ndash;who was by now the son-in-law of the Western Emperor [[Anthemius]]&amp;ndash;was plotting with Gundobad to kill his father-in-law; Gundobad beheaded the emperor (apparently personally). (''Chronica Gallica 511''; John of Antioch, fr. 209; Jordanes, ''Getica'', 239)  Ricimer then appointed [[Olybrius]]; both died, surprisingly of natural causes, within a few months.  Gundobad seems then to have succeeded his uncle as Patrician and king-maker, and raised [[Glycerius]] to the throne. (Marius of Avenches; John of Antioch, fr. 209)

In 474, Burgundian influence over the empire seems to have ended.  Glycerius was deposed in favor of [[Julius Nepos]], and Gundobad returned to Burgundy, presumably at the death of his father Gundioc.  At this time or shortly afterward, the Burgundian kingdom was divided between Gundobad and his brothers, Godigisel, Chilperic II, and Gundomar I. (Gregory, II, 28)

====Consolidation of the Kingdom====
According to [[Gregory of Tours]], the years following Gundobad's return to Burgundy saw a bloody consolidation of power.  Gregory states that Gundobad murdered his brother Chilperic, drowning his wife and exiling their daughters (one of whom was to become the wife of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] the [[Franks|Frank]], and was reputedly responsible for his conversion).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, II, 28. Gregory's chronology of the events surrounding Clovis and Gundobad has been questioned by Bury, Shanzer, and Wood, among others. Gregory was somewhat of a Frankish apologist, and commonly discredited the enemies of Clovis by attributing to them some fairly shocking acts.  As with Godegisel, he also commonly refers to the treachery of Clovis' allies, when in fact Clovis seems to have bought them off (e.g., in the case of the Ripuarians).&lt;/ref&gt; This is contested by, e.g., Bury, who points out problems in much of Gregory's chronology for the events.

C.500, when Gundobad and Clovis were at war, Gundobad appears to have been betrayed by his brother Godegisel, who joined the Franks; together Godegisel's and Clovis' forces &quot;crushed the army of Gundobad.&quot; (Marius a. 500; Gregory, II, 32)  Gundobad was temporarily holed up in Avignon, but was able to re-muster his army and sacked Vienne, where Godegisel and many of his followers were put to death.  From this point, Gundobad appears to have been the sole king of Burgundy. (e.g., Gregory, II, 33)  This would imply that his brother Gundomar was already dead, though there are no specific mentions of the event in the sources.

Either Gundobad and Clovis reconciled their differences, or Gundobad was forced into some sort of vassalage by Clovis' earlier victory, as the Burgundian king appears to have assisted the Franks in 507 in their victory over [[Alaric II]] the Visigoth.

During the upheaval, sometime between 483-501, Gundobad began to set forth the ''Lex Gundobada'' (see below), issuing roughly the first half, which drew upon the ''Lex Visigothorum''. (Drew, p.&amp;nbsp;1)  Following his consolidation of power, between 501 and his death in 516, Gundobad issued the second half of his law, which was more originally Burgundian.

====Fall of the Second Kingdom====
[[File:Map Burgundian Kingdom 2 EN.png|thumb|right|230px|Burgundy as part of the Frankish Empire between 534 and 843]]

The Burgundians were extending their power over southeastern [[Gaul]]; that is, northern Italy, western Switzerland, and southeastern France. In 493 [[Clovis I|Clovis]], king of the Franks, married the Burgundian princess [[Clotilde|Clotilda]] (daughter of Chilperic), who converted him to the Catholic faith.

At first allies with [[Clovis I|Clovis']] [[Franks]] against the [[Visigoths]] in the early 6th century, the Burgundians were eventually conquered by the Franks in 534 after a first attempt in the [[battle of Vézeronce]]. The Burgundian kingdom was made part of the [[Merovingian]] kingdoms, and the Burgundians themselves were by and large absorbed as well.

==Burgundian laws==
The Burgundians left three [[legal code]]s, among the earliest from any of the Germanic tribes.

The '''[[Lex Gundobada|Liber Constitutionum sive Lex Gundobada]]''' (''The Book of the Constitution following the Law of Gundobad''), also known as the ''Lex Burgundionum'', or more simply the ''Lex Gundobada'' or the ''Liber'', was issued in several parts between 483 and 516, principally by Gundobad, but also by his son, Sigismund. (Drew, p.&amp;nbsp;6-7)  It was a record of Burgundian customary law and is typical of the many Germanic law codes from this period.  In particular, the ''Liber'' borrowed from the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]'' (Drew, p.&amp;nbsp;6) and influenced the later ''[[Lex Ribuaria]]''. (Rivers, p.&amp;nbsp;9)  The ''Liber'' is one of the primary sources for contemporary Burgundian life, as well as the history of its kings.

Like many of the Germanic tribes, the Burgundians' legal traditions allowed the application of separate laws for separate ethnicities.  Thus, in addition to the ''Lex Gundobada'', Gundobad also issued (or codified) a set of laws for Roman subjects of the Burgundian kingdom, the ''[[Lex Romana Burgundionum]]'' (''The Roman Law of the Burgundians'').

In addition to the above codes, Gundobad's son Sigismund later published the ''Prima Constitutio''.  &lt;!--''&amp;ndash;I have been unable to find a source for this &amp;ndash;[[User:Ryanmcdaniel|Ryan McDaniel]]'' --&gt;

==Origin of Burgundy==
{{seealso|Bornholm}}
The name of the Burgundians has since remained connected to the area of modern France that still bears their name: see the later history of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Between the 6th and 20th centuries, however, the boundaries and political connections of this area have changed frequently; none of those changes have had anything to do with the original Burgundians. The name ''Burgundians'' used here and generally used by English writers to refer to the Burgundiones is a later formation and more precisely refers to the inhabitants of the territory of Burgundy which was named from the people called Burgundiones.  The descendants of the Burgundians today are found primarily among the west [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] and neighbouring regions of France.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dots and Boxes''' (also known as '''Boxes''', '''Squares''', '''Paddocks''', '''Square-it''', '''Dots and Dashes''', '''Dots''', '''Smart Dots''', '''Dot Boxing''', or, simply, the '''Dot Game''') is a [[pencil and paper game]] for two players (or sometimes, more than two) first published in 1889 by [[Édouard Lucas]].
[[Image:Dots-and-boxes.png|300px|right|thumb|Game of dots and boxes on the 2&amp;times;2 board.]]

Starting with an empty grid of dots, players take turns, adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1&amp;times;1 box earns one point and takes another turn.  (The points are typically recorded by placing in the box an identifying mark of the player, such as an initial).  The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner of the game is the player with the most points.

The board may be of any size. When short on time, 2&amp;times;2 boxes (created by a square of 9 dots) is good for beginners, and 6&amp;times;6 is good for experts. In games with an even number of boxes, it is conventional that if the game is tied then the win should be awarded to the second player (this offsets the advantage of going first).

The diagram on the right shows a game being played on the 2&amp;times;2 board. The second player (B) plays the mirror image of the first player's move, hoping to divide the board into two pieces and tie the game. The first player (A) makes a ''sacrifice'' at move 7; B accepts the sacrifice, getting one box. However, B must now add another line, and connects the center dot to the center-right dot, causing the remaining boxes to be joined together in a ''chain'' as shown at the end of move 8. With A's next move, A gets them all, winning 3&amp;ndash;1.

== Strategy ==
[[Image:dots-and-boxes-chains.png|300px|left|thumb|The double-cross strategy. Faced with position 1, a novice player would create position 2 and lose. An experienced player would create position 3 and win.]]

At the start of a game, play is more or less random, the only strategy is to avoid adding the third side to any box. This continues until all the remaining (potential) boxes are joined together into ''chains'' – groups of one or more adjacent boxes in which any move gives all the boxes in the chain to the opponent. A novice player faced with a situation like position 1 in the diagram on the left, in which some boxes can be captured, takes all the boxes in the chain, resulting in position 2. But with their last move, they have to open the next (and larger) chain, and the novice loses the game,

An experienced player faced with position 1 instead plays the ''double-cross strategy'', taking all but 2 of the boxes in the chain, leaving position 3. This leaves the last two boxes in the chain for their opponent, but then the ''opponent'' has to open the next chain. By moving to position 3, player A wins.

The double-cross strategy applies however many long chains there are. Take all but two of the boxes in each chain, but take all the boxes in the last chain. If the chains are long enough then the player will certainly win.  Therefore, when played by experts, Dots and Boxes becomes a battle for ''control'':  An expert player tries to force their opponent to start the first long chain.  Against a player who doesn't understand the concept of a sacrifice, the expert simply has to make the correct number of sacrifices to encourage the opponent to hand him the first chain long enough to ensure a win.  If the other player also knows to offer sacrifices, the expert also has to manipulate the number of available sacrifices through earlier play.

There is never any reason not to accept a sacrifice, as if it is refused, the player who offered it can always take it without penalty.  Thus, the impact of refusing a sacrifice need not be considered in your strategy.

Experienced players can avoid the chaining phenomenon by making early moves to split the board. A board split into 4x4 squares is ideal. Dividing limits the size of chains- in the case of 4x4 squares, the longest possible chain is four, filling the larger square. A board with an even number of spaces will end in a draw (as the number of 4x4 squares will be equal for each player); an odd numbered board will lead to the winner winning by one square (the 4x4 squares and 2x1 half-squares will fall evenly, with one box not incorporated into the pattern falling to the winner).

A common alternate ruleset is to require all available boxes be claimed on your turn. This eliminates the double cross strategy, forcing even the experienced player to take all the boxes, and give his opponent the win.

In [[combinatorial game theory]] dots and boxes is very close to being an [[impartial game]] and many positions can be analyzed using [[Sprague–Grundy theorem|Sprague–Grundy theory]].

== Unusual grids ==
Dots and boxes need not be played on a rectangular grid.  It can be played on a triangular grid or a hexagonal grid. Investigations on a triangular variation of the game have even been carried out by [[Raffles Institution]] students. There is also a variant in [[Bolivia]]  when it is played in a [[Chakana]] or Inca Cross grid, which adds more complications to the game.

Dots-and-boxes has a [[dual graph|dual]] form called &quot;strings-and-coins&quot;.  This game is played on a network of coins (vertices) joined by strings (edges).  Players take turns to cut a string.  When a cut leaves a coin with no strings, the player pockets the coin and takes another turn.  The winner is the player who pockets the most coins.  Strings-and-coins can be played on an arbitrary [[graph (mathematics)|graph]].
A variant played in Poland allows a player to claim a region of several squares as soon as its boundary is completed.

'''Big Brother''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. He is the enigmatic [[dictator]] of [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]], a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state taken to its utmost logical consequence – where the ruling Party wield total power for its own sake over the inhabitants.

In the society that Orwell describes, everyone is under complete [[surveillance]] by the authorities, mainly by [[telescreen]]s. The people are constantly reminded of this by the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;, which is the core &quot;truth&quot; of the [[propaganda]] system in this state. 

Since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the term &quot;Big Brother&quot; has entered the [[lexicon]] as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to [[civil liberties]].

In the essay section of his novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]] states that Orwell got the idea for Big Brother from advertising billboards for educational [[correspondence course]]s from a company called ''Bennett's'', current during [[World War II]]. The original posters showed Bennett himself; a kindly looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase &quot;Let me be your father&quot; attached. After Bennett's death his son took over the company, and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanour) with the text &quot;Let me be your big brother.&quot;

Speculation has also focused on [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orwelltoday.com/orwellkitchener.shtml Kitchener's face Big Brother]&lt;/ref&gt; who among other things was prominently involved in [[Recruitment to the British Army during World War I|British military recruitment in World War I]]. As a child Orwell (under his real name Eric Blair) published poems praising Kitchener and war recruitment in his local [[newspaper]].

==Appearance in the novel==
===Existence===

In the novel it is not clear whether Big Brother is (or was) a real person or a fiction invented by [[Ingsoc|the Party]] to personify it.

In Party propaganda Big Brother is presented as a real person: one of the founders of the Party, along with [[Emmanuel Goldstein|Goldstein]]. At one point in 1984 Winston Smith, the protagonist of Orwell's novel, tries &quot;to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the [[capitalism|capitalists]] in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London...&quot;

In the year 1984 Big Brother appears on posters and the telescreen as a man of about 45. [[Goldstein's book]] comments: &quot;We may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born.&quot;

===Cult of personality===
A spontaneous ritual of devotion to Big Brother (&quot;BB&quot;) is illustrated at the end of the &quot;[[Two Minutes Hate]]&quot;:

{{quote|
At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmic chant of 'B-B! .... B-B! .... B-B!'—over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second—a heavy murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamps of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.  For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up.  It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.  Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George (1949). Nineteen Eighty-Four.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though Oceania's [[Ministry of Truth]], [[Ministry of Plenty]], and [[Ministry of Peace]] each have names with meanings deliberately opposite to their real purpose, the [[Ministry of Love]] is perhaps the most straightforward: &quot;rehabilitated thought criminals&quot; leave the Ministry as loyal subjects who have been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] into genuinely loving Big Brother.

==Legacy==
Since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' the phrase &quot;Big Brother&quot; has come into common use to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure, and attempts by government to increase surveillance. 

The magazine ''Book'' ranked Big Brother #59 on its [http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900] list. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine rated him the 75th greatest villain of all time.&lt;ref&gt;''Wizard'' #177&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide [[reality television]] show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' is based on the novel's concept of people being under constant [[surveillance]]. In 2000, after the [[Big Brother (U.S.)|U.S. version]] of the [[CBS]] program &quot;Big Brother&quot; premiered, the Estate of George Orwell sued CBS and its production company &quot;Orwell Productions, Inc.&quot; in federal court in [[Chicago]] for copyright and trademark infringement. The case was Estate of Orwell v. CBS, 00-c-5034 (ND Ill). On the eve of trial, the case settled worldwide to the parties' &quot;mutual satisfaction&quot;; the amount that CBS paid to the Orwell Estate was not disclosed. CBS had not asked the Estate for permission. Under current laws the novel will remain under copyright protection until 2020 in the European Union and until 2044 in the United States.

The iconic image of Big Brother (played by David Graham) played a key role in [[Apple Computers|Apple]]'s [[1984 (advertisement)|1984 television commercial]] introducing the [[Macintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/news/remembering-the-1984-super-bowl-mac-ad/263647  Apple commercial overshadows Super Bowl memory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/09/iconic_apple_ad_gets_doubletwi.html Apple does Big Brother]&lt;/ref&gt; The Orwell Estate viewed the Apple commercial as a copyright infringement, and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and its advertising agency. The commercial was never televised again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouthlawjournal.org/articles/106-115.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 2002 issue of ''[[Gear Magazine|Gear]]'' magazine featured a story about technologies and trends that could violate personal privacy moving society closer to a &quot;Big Brother&quot; state and utilized a recreation of the movie poster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallmeierart.com/user/cimage/244493fb0.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; from the film version of ''1984'' created by Dallmeierart.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallmeierart.com/bigbrother.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, media analyst and political activist [[Mark Dice]] published a non-fiction book titled &quot;Big Brother: The Orwellian Nightmare Come True&quot; which analyzes the striking parallels between elements of the storyline in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and current government programs, technology, and cultural trends.[http://www.infowars.com/big-brother-the-orwellian-nightmare-come-true/]

In [[computer science]], a '''binary search''' or '''half-interval search''' [[algorithm]] locates the [[index (information technology)|position]] of an item in a [[Sorting algorithm|sorted]] [[array data structure|array]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Introduction to Algorithms]], [http://books.google.ca/books?id=NLngYyWFl_YC], pp15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinarySearch.html&lt;/ref&gt; Binary search works by comparing an input value to the middle element of the array. The comparison determines whether the element equals the input, less than the input or greater. When the element being compared to equals the input the search stops and typically returns the position of the element. If the element is ''not'' equal to the input then a comparison is made to determine whether the input is less than or greater than the element. Depending on which it is the algorithm then starts over but only searching the top or bottom [[subset]] of the array's elements. If the input is not located within the array the algorithm will usually output a unique value indicating this. Binary search algorithms typically halve the number of items to check with each successive iteration, thus locating the given item (or determining its absence) in [[logarithmic time]]. A binary search is a [[dichotomic search|dichotomic]] [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] [[search algorithm]].

== Overview ==
The binary search algorithm determines the index of an item in a [[sorting algorithm|sorted]] array.  For example, to search an array for contact information, with people's names, addresses, and telephone numbers sorted by name, binary search could be used to find out a few useful facts: whether the person's information is in the array, what the person's address is, and what the person's telephone number is.

Binary searching has a greater runtime efficiency than [[linear search]], but there are some disadvantages.  Binary search can be slower than using a [[hash table]].  If the contents of the array are modified, the array will have to be re-sorted so that binary search will work properly, which may take more time than the binary search itself.  Often, it is more efficient to place at the beginning of the array the items which will be frequently expected and to use a linear search.

== Examples ==
===Number guessing game===
This rather simple game begins something like &quot;I'm thinking of an integer between forty and sixty inclusive, and to your guesses I'll respond 'High', 'Low', or 'Yes!' as might be the case.&quot;
Supposing that ''N'' is the number of possible values (here, twenty-one as &quot;inclusive&quot; was stated), then at most &lt;math&gt;\lceil\log_2 N\rceil&lt;/math&gt; questions are required to determine the number, since each question halves the search space. Note that one less question (iteration) is required than for the general algorithm, since the number is already constrained to be within a particular range.

Even if the number to guess can be arbitrarily large, in which case there is no upper bound ''N'', The number can be found in at most &lt;math&gt;2\lceil \log_2 k \rceil&lt;/math&gt; steps (where k is the (unknown) selected number) by first finding an upper bound by repeated doubling.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} For example, if the number were 11, the following sequence of guesses could be used to find it: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 12, 10, 11

One could also extend the method to include negative numbers; for example the following guesses could be used to find −13: 0, −1, −2, −4, −8, −16, −12, −14, −13.

===Word lists===
People typically use a mixture of the binary search and [[Interpolation search|interpolative search]] algorithms when searching a [[telephone book]], after the initial guess we exploit the fact that the entries are sorted and can rapidly find the required entry. For example when searching for Smith, if Rogers and Thomas have been found, one can flip to a page about halfway between the previous guesses. If this shows Samson, it can be concluded that Smith is somewhere between the Samson and Thomas pages so these can be divided.

===Applications to complexity theory===
Even if we do not know a fixed range the number ''k'' falls in, we can still determine its value by asking &lt;math&gt;2\lceil\log_2k\rceil&lt;/math&gt; simple yes/no questions of the form &quot;Is ''k'' greater than ''x''?&quot; for some number ''x''. As a simple consequence of this, if you can answer the question &quot;Is this integer property ''k'' greater than a given value?&quot; in some amount of time then you can find the value of that property in the same amount of time with an added factor of &lt;math&gt;\log_2 k&lt;/math&gt;. This is called a ''[[reduction (complexity)|reduction]]'', and it is because of this kind of reduction that most complexity theorists concentrate on [[decision problem]]s, algorithms that produce a simple yes/no answer.

For example, suppose we could answer &quot;Does this ''n'' x ''n'' matrix have [[determinant]] larger than ''k''?&quot; in O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) time. Then, by using binary search, we could find the (ceiling of the) determinant itself in O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;log ''d'') time, where ''d'' is the determinant; notice that ''d'' is not the size of the input, but the size of the output.

==Performance==
With each test that fails to find a match at the probed position, the search is continued with one or other of the two sub-intervals, each at most half the size. More precisely, if the number of items, ''N'', is odd then both sub-intervals will contain (''N''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1)/2 elements, while if ''N'' is even then the two sub-intervals contain ''N''/2&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1 and ''N''/2 elements.

If the original number of items is ''N'' then after the first iteration there will be at most ''N''/2 items remaining, then at most ''N''/4 items, at most ''N''/8 items, and so on.  In the worst case, when the value is not in the list, the algorithm must continue iterating until the span has been made empty; this will have taken at most ⌊[[binary logarithm|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]](''N'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1⌋ iterations, where the ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋ notation denotes the [[floor function]] that rounds its argument down to an integer. This [[worst case analysis]] is tight: for any ''N'' there exists a query that takes exactly ⌊[[binary logarithm|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]](''N'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1⌋ iterations. When compared to [[linear search]], whose worst-case behaviour is ''N'' iterations, we see that binary search is substantially faster as ''N'' grows large.  For example, to search a list of one million items takes as many as one million iterations with linear search, but never more than twenty iterations with binary search.  However, a binary search can only be performed if the list is in sorted order.

===Average performance===
&lt;math&gt;\log_2(N) - 1&lt;/math&gt; is about the expected number of probes in an average successful search, and the worst case is &lt;math&gt;\log_2(N)&lt;/math&gt;, just one more probe. If the list is empty, no probes at all are made.
Thus binary search is a [[logarithmic algorithm]] and executes in [[big O notation|O(&lt;math&gt;\log N&lt;/math&gt;)]] time. In most cases it is considerably faster than a [[linear search]]. It can be implemented using [[iteration]], or [[recursion]]. In some languages it is more elegantly expressed recursively; however, in some C-based languages tail recursion is not eliminated and the recursive version requires more stack space.

Binary search can interact poorly with the memory hierarchy (i.e. [[cache|caching]]), because of its random-access nature.  For in-memory searching, if the span to be searched is small, a linear search may have superior performance simply because it exhibits better locality of reference. For external searching, care must be taken or each of the first several probes will lead to a disk seek. A common method is to abandon binary searching for linear searching as soon as the size of the remaining span falls below a small value such as 8 or 16 or even more in recent computers. The exact value depends entirely on the machine running the algorithm.

Notice that for multiple searches ''with a fixed value for N'', then (with the appropriate regard for integer division), the first iteration always selects the middle element at ''N''/2, and the second always selects either ''N''/4 or 3''N''/4, and so on. Thus if the array's key values are in some sort of slow storage (on a disc file, in virtual memory, not in the cpu's on-chip memory), keeping those three keys in a local array for a special preliminary search will avoid accessing widely separated memory. Escalating to seven or fifteen such values will allow further levels at not much cost in storage. On the other hand, if the searches are frequent and not separated by much other activity, the computer's various storage control features will more or less automatically promote frequently-accessed elements into faster storage.

When multiple binary searches are to be performed for the same key in related lists, [[fractional cascading]] can be used to speed up successive searches after the first one.

==Extensions==
There is no particular requirement that the array being searched has the bounds 1 to ''N''. It is possible to search a specified range, elements ''first'' to ''last'' instead of 1 to ''N''. All that is necessary is that the initialisation of the bounds be ''L:=first − 1'' and ''R:=last + 1'', then all proceeds as before.

The elements of the list are not necessarily all unique. If one searches for a value that occurs multiple times in the list, the index returned will be of the first-encountered equal element, and this will not necessarily be that of the first, last, or middle element of the run of equal-key elements but will depend on the positions of the values. Modifying the list even in seemingly unrelated ways such as adding elements elsewhere in the list may change the result.
To find all equal elements an upward and downward linear search can be carried out from the initial result, stopping each search when the element is no longer equal. Thus, e.g. in a table of cities sorted by country, we can find all cities in a given country.

Several algorithms closely related to or extending binary search exist. For instance, '''noisy binary search''' solves the same class of projects as regular binary search, with the added complexity that any given test can return a false value at random. (Usually, the number of such erroneous results are bounded in some way, either in the form of an average error rate, or in the total number of errors allowed per element in the search space.) Optimal algorithms for several classes of noisy binary search problems have been known since the late seventies, and more recently, optimal algorithms for noisy binary search in quantum computers (where several elements can be tested at the same time) have been discovered.

==Variations==
There are many, and they are easily confused.  Also, binary search vs. selection sort is debatable.

===Exclusive or inclusive bounds===
The most significant differences are between the &quot;exclusive&quot; and &quot;inclusive&quot; forms of the bounds. In the &quot;exclusive&quot; bound form the span to be searched is ''(L + 1)'' to ''(R − 1)'', and this may seem clumsy when the span to be searched could be described in the &quot;inclusive&quot; form, as ''L'' to ''R''. Although the details differ the two forms are equivalent as can be seen by transforming one version into the other. The inclusive bound form may be attained by replacing all appearances of &quot;L&quot; by &quot;(L − 1)&quot; and &quot;R&quot; by &quot;(R + 1)&quot; then rearranging. Thus, the initialisation of ''L:=0'' becomes ''(L − 1):=0'' or ''L:=1'', and ''R:=N + 1'' becomes ''(R + 1):=N + 1'' or ''R:=N''. So far so good, but note now that the changes to L and R are no longer simply transferring the value of ''p'' to ''L'' or ''R'' as appropriate but now must be ''(R + 1):=p'' or ''R:=p − 1'', and ''(L − 1):=p'' or ''L:=p + 1''.

Thus, the gain of a simpler initialisation, done once, is lost by a more complex calculation, and which is done for every iteration. If that is not enough, the test for an empty span is more complex also, as compared to the simplicity of checking that the value of ''p'' is zero. Nevertheless, the inclusive bound form is found in many publications, such as [[Donald Knuth]]. ''The Art of Computer Programming'', Volume 3: ''Sorting and Searching'', Third Edition.

===Deferred detection of equality===
Because of the syntax difficulties discussed [[#Syntax difficulties|below]], so that distinguishing the three states &lt;, =, and &gt; would have to be done with two comparisons, it is possible to use just one comparison and at the end when the span is reduced to zero, equality can be tested for. The solution distinguishes only &lt; from &gt;=.

===Midpoint and width===
An entirely different variation involves abandoning the ''L'' and ''R'' pointers in favour of a current position ''p'' and a width ''w'' where at each iteration, ''p'' is adjusted by + or − ''w'' and ''w'' is halved. Professor Knuth remarks &quot;It is possible to do this, but only if extreme care is paid to the details&quot; – Section 6.2.1, page 414 of ''The Art of Computer Programming'', Volume 3: ''Sorting and Searching'', Third Edition, outlines an algorithm, with the further remark &quot;Simpler approaches are doomed to failure!&quot;

==Computer use==
===The algorithm===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky… — Professor [[Donald Knuth]]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When [[Jon Bentley]] assigned it as a problem in a course for professional programmers, he found that an astounding ninety percent failed to code a binary search correctly after several hours of working on it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Furthermore, Bentley's own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book ''Programming Pearls'', contains an error that remained undetected for over twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html Extra, Extra – Read All About It: Nearly All Binary Searches and Mergesorts are Broken], Google Research Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

====Numerical difficulties====
{{Cleanup|date=April 2011}}
{{disputed-section|Midpoint calculation|date=November 2010}}
In a practical implementation, the variables used to represent the indices will be of finite size, hence only capable of representing a finite range of values.  For example, 32-bit [[signedness|unsigned integers]] can only hold values from 0 to 4294967295.  Most binary search algorithms use 32-bit signed integers, which can only hold values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.  If the binary search algorithm is to operate on large arrays, this has two implications:
* The values &lt;code&gt;first − 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;last + 1&lt;/code&gt; must both be representable within the finite bounds of the chosen integer type . Therefore, continuing the 32-bit unsigned example, the largest value that &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; may take is +429496729'''4''', not +429496729'''5'''.   A problem exists even for the &quot;inclusive&quot; form of the method, as if &lt;code&gt;x &gt; A(4294967295).Key&lt;/code&gt;, then on the final iteration the algorithm will attempt to store 4294967296 into &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; and fail.  Equivalent issues apply to the lower limit, where &lt;code&gt;first − 1&lt;/code&gt; could become negative as when the first element of the array is at index zero.
* If the midpoint of the span is calculated as &lt;code&gt;p := (L + R)/2&lt;/code&gt;, then the value &lt;code&gt;(L + R)&lt;/code&gt; will exceed the number range if &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; is greater than (for unsigned) 4294967295/2 or (for signed) 2147483647/2 and the search wanders toward the upper end of the search space.  This can be avoided by performing the calculation as &lt;code&gt;p := (R - L)/2 + L&lt;/code&gt;. When the problem arises for signed integers, a more efficient alternative is by performing the calculation as &lt;code&gt;p := (R + L) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; denotes the right [[logical shift]] operator. For example, this bug existed in Java SDK at &lt;code&gt;Arrays.binarySearch()&lt;/code&gt; from 1.2 to 5.0 and fixed in 6.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5045582 Bug ID: 5045582 (coll) binarySearch() fails for size larger than 1&lt;&lt;30]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementations===
====Iterative====

The following incorrect (see notes below) algorithm is slightly modified (to [[binary search algorithm#Numerical difficulties|avoid overflow]]) from [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s in standard [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]:&lt;ref&gt;Niklaus Wirth: ''Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.'' Prentice-Hall, 1975, ISBN 0-13-022418-9 [http://www.cs.inf.ethz.ch/~wirth/books/AlgorithmE0/]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
  min := 1;
  max := N; {array size: var A : array [1..N] of integer}
  repeat
    mid := (min+max) div 2;
    if x &gt; A[mid] then
      min := mid + 1;
    else
      max := mid - 1;
  until (A[mid] = x) or (min &gt; max);
&lt;/source&gt;

''Note:'' This code assumes [[Index (computer science)|1-based array indexing]]. For languages that use 0-based indexing (most modern languages), ''min'' and ''max'' should be initialized to 0 and ''N''-1.

''Note 2:'' The code above does not return a result, nor indicates whether the element was found or not.

''Note 3:'' The code above will not work correctly for empty arrays, because it attempts to access an element before checking to see if &lt;code&gt;min &gt; max&lt;/code&gt;.

This code uses inclusive bounds and a three-way test (for early loop termination in case of equality), but with two separate comparisons per iteration. It is not the most efficient solution.

====Recursive====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
A simple, straightforward, implementation is [[tail recursive]]; it recursively searches the subrange dictated by the comparison:
    BinarySearch(A[0..N-1], value, low, high) {
        if (high &lt; low)
            return -1 // not found
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2
        if (A[mid] &gt; value)
            return BinarySearch(A, value, low, mid-1)
        else if (A[mid] &lt; value)
            return BinarySearch(A, value, mid+1, high)
        else
            return mid // found
    }

It is invoked with initial &lt;code&gt;low&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;high&lt;/code&gt; values of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;N-1&lt;/code&gt;.

===Language support===
Many standard libraries provide a way to do a binary search:
* [[C (programming language)|C]] provides [[bsearch|bsearch()]] in its standard library.
* [[C++]]'s [[Standard Template Library|STL]] provides [[algorithm function]]s &lt;code&gt;binary_search&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lower_bound&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;upper_bound&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] offers a set of [[function overloading|overload]]ed &lt;code&gt;binarySearch()&lt;/code&gt; static methods in the classes {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Arrays}} and {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Collections}} in the standard &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; package for performing binary searches on Java arrays and on &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;s, respectively. They must be arrays of primitives, or the arrays or Lists must be of a type that implements the &lt;code&gt;Comparable&lt;/code&gt; interface, or you must specify a custom &lt;code&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; object.
* [[Microsoft]]'s [[.NET Framework]] 2.0 offers static [[generic programming|generic]] versions of the binary search algorithm in its collection base classes. An example would be &lt;code&gt;System.Array&lt;/code&gt;'s method &lt;code&gt;BinarySearch&lt;T&gt;(T[] array, T value).&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] provides the &lt;code&gt;[http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html bisect]&lt;/code&gt; module.
* [[COBOL]] can perform binary search on internal tables using the &lt;code&gt;SEARCH ALL&lt;/code&gt; statement.
* [[Perl]] can perform a generic binary search using the [[CPAN]] module Search::Binary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.cpan.org/~rant/Search-Binary-0.95/Binary.pm CPAN: Seach::Binary]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Go (programming language)|Go]]'s &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; standard library package contains functions &lt;code&gt;Search&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SearchInts&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SearchFloat64s&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SearchStrings&lt;/code&gt;, which implement general binary search, as well as specific implementations for searching slices of integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, respectively.[http://golang.org/pkg/sort/]
* For [[Objective-C]], the [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] framework provides the [http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/NSArray.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSArray/indexOfObject:inSortedRange:options:usingComparator: NSArray -indexOfObject:inSortedRange:options:usingComparator:] method in Mac OS X 10.6+. Apple's [[Core Foundation]] C framework also contains a [http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFArrayRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CFArrayBSearchValues CFArrayBSearchValues()] function.

'''Belle and Sebastian''' is an [[indie pop]] band formed in [[Glasgow]] in January 1996.

After releasing a number of albums and EPs on [[Jeepster Records]], they are now signed to [[Rough Trade Records]] in the United Kingdom and [[Matador Records]] in the United States.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1996–1997)===
Belle and Sebastian were formed in Glasgow in 1996 by [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]] and [[Stuart David]].&lt;ref name=&quot;a2x&quot;/&gt; Together they recorded some demos with [[Stow College]] music professor [[Alan Rankine]], which were picked up by the college's Music Business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college's label, [[Electric Honey (label)|Electric Honey]]. As the band had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos, Belle and Sebastian were allowed to record a full-length album, which was named ''[[Tigermilk]]''. Murdoch once described the band as a &quot;product of botched capitalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;a2x&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Stuart Murdoch live.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Stuart Murdoch performing in 2006]]
''Tigermilk'' was recorded in three days and originally only one thousand copies were pressed on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grd&quot;/&gt; These original copies now sell for up to £400.&lt;ref name=&quot;rse&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Pareles |first=John |title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=[[Fireside Publishing]] |year=2001 |page=66 |isbn=0743201205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiel |first=George |title=Tigermilk |url=http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |work=Eclectic Honey |accessdate=4 November 2007 |format=&lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AShiel+intitle%3ATigermilk&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070616110535/http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |archivedate = 16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Belle and Sebastian 2nd Melbourne show! |url=http://www.pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&amp;Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show!++ |work=PBS 106.7FM |date= |accessdate=4 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070916203738/http://pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&amp;Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show!++ |archivedate = 16 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm reception the album received inspired Murdoch and David to turn the band into a full-time project, recruiting [[Stevie Jackson]] (guitar and vocals), [[Isobel Campbell]] (cello/vocals), [[Chris Geddes]] (keys) and [[Richard Colburn]] (drums) to fill out the group.

After the success of the debut album, Belle and Sebastian were signed to [[Jeepster Records]] in August 1996 and ''[[If You're Feeling Sinister]]'', their second album, was released on 18 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; The album was named by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' as one of the 100 greatest albums between 1985 and 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005 |url=http://www.spin.com/articles/100-greatest-albums-1985-2005 |work=Spin |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered the band's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;notebook&quot;/&gt; Just before the recording of ''Sinister'', [[Sarah Martin (musician)|Sarah Martin]] (violin/vocals) joined the band. Following this a series of EPs were released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hornby |first=Nick |title=Lazy Line Painter Jane |url=http://www.salon.com/music/sharps/1997/11/14sharps.html |work=Salon |date=14 November 1997 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was ''[[Dog on Wheels]]'', which contained four demo tracks recorded before the real formation of the band. In fact, the only long-term band members to play on the songs were Murdoch, David, and [[Mick Cooke]], who played trumpet on the EP but would not officially join the band until a few years later. It charted at #59 in the UK singles chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Lazy Line Painter Jane]]'' EP followed in July. The track was recorded in the church where Murdoch lived&lt;ref name=&quot;lim&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Lim |first=Dennis |title=Winter of Their Youth |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-09-15/music/winter-of-their-youth/ |work=The Village Voice |date=15 September 1998 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features vocals from [[Monica Queen]]. The EP narrowly missed out of the UK top 40, peaking at #41.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; The last of the 1997 EPs was October's ''[[3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light]]''. The EP was made Single of the Week in both the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and reached #32 in the charts, thus becoming the band's first top 40 single.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;

The band released their third LP, ''[[The Boy with the Arab Strap]]'' in 1998, and it reached #12 in the UK charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Best |first=Sophie |title=Ring the Belle |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/22/1090464785300.html |work=The Age |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While often cited by critics as the band's best album, ''Arab Strap'' has nonetheless had its detractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Owings |first=Henry |title=The Overrated Book |publisher=[[Last Gasp]] |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0867196572}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' gave the album a particularly poor review, calling it a &quot;parody&quot; of their earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Josephes |first=Jason |title=The Boy With the Arab Strap review |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15372-the-boy-with-the-arab-strap |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221210634/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15372-the-boy-with-the-arab-strap |archivedate=21 December 2007 |work=Pitchfork Media |date=1 October 1998 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |format= – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AJosephes+intitle%3AThe+Boy+With+the+Arab+Strap+review&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, the album garnered positive reviews from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ratliff |first=Ben |title=The Boy With the Arab Strap review |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/belleandsebastian/albums/album/103457/review/5941160/the_boy_with_the_arab_strap |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071027105615/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/belleandsebastian/albums/album/103457/review/5941160/the_boy_with_the_arab_strap |archivedate=27 October 2007 |publisher=''Rolling Stone|date=25 August 1998 |accessdate=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Village Voice]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;lim&quot;/&gt; among others. During the recording of the album long time studio trumpet-player Mick Cooke was asked to join the band as a full member.&lt;ref name=&quot;rse&quot;/&gt; The ''[[This Is Just a Modern Rock Song]]'' EP followed later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=MODERN LOVERS ROCK HARD |url=http://www.nme.com/news/belle-and-sebastian/676 |work=NME |date=26 October 1998 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the band were shockingly awarded with Best Newcomer (for their third album) at the [[BRIT Awards]], upsetting the much better known acts [[Steps (band)|Steps]] and [[5ive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Robbie rules over Brits |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/brit_awards/280847.stm |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 1999 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the band hosted their own festival, the [[Bowlie Weekender]]. ''[[Tigermilk]]'' was also given a full release by [[Jeepster Records|Jeepster]] before the band started work on their next LP. The result was ''[[Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant]]'', which became the band's first top 10 album in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; A stand-alone single, &quot;[[Legal Man]]&quot;, reached #15 and gave them their first appearance on [[Top of the Pops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Urban |first=Andy |title=Side Project Becomes Full-Length Let Down |url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/237 |work=Dusted Magazine |date=18 June 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bellesebastian.jpg|thumb|230px|Belle &amp; Sebastian performing at the [[9:30 Club]] in Washington, D.C.]]
As the band's popularity and recognition was growing worldwide, their music began appearing in films and on television. The 2000 film ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'' mentions the band and features a clip from the song &quot;[[Seymour Stein]]&quot; from ''The Boy with the Arab Strap''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zacharek |first=Stephanie |title=High Fidelity |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/review/2000/03/31/high_fidelity/print.html |work=Salon |date=31 March 2000 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the title track from ''Arab Strap'' was played over the end credits of the UK television series ''[[Teachers (UK TV series)|Teachers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Virtue |first=Graeme |title=Jingle Book Belles |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031221/ai_n12585237 |work=Sunday Herald |date=21 December 2003 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart David soon left the band to concentrate on his side-project, [[Looper (band)|Looper]], and his book writing, which included his ''The Idle Thoughts of a Daydreamer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Heim |first=Joe |title=Sharps &amp; Flats: Looper |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/music/review/2000/05/09/looper/index.html |work=Salon |date=9 May 2000 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Bobby Kildea]] of [[V-Twin (band)|V-Twin]].

A '''broadcast domain''' is a logical division of a [[computer network]], in which all [[node (networking)|node]]s can reach each other by [[broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] at the [[data link layer]]. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.

In terms of current popular technologies: Any computer connected to the same [[Ethernet]] [[repeater]] or [[network switch|switch]] is a member of the same broadcast domain.  Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain.  [[Router]]s and other [[Network layer|higher-layer]] devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.

This is as compared to a [[collision domain]], which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges.  Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.

While some [[Data Link Layer|layer two network]] devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches.

== Further explanation ==

The distinction between broadcast and collision domains comes about because simple [[Ethernet]] and similar systems use a shared [[transmission system]]. In simple Ethernet (without switches or [[network bridge|bridges]]), [[data frame]]s are transmitted to all other nodes on a network.  Each receiving node checks the destination address of each frame, and simply ignores any frame not addressed to its own MAC.

Switches act as buffers, receiving and analyzing the frames from each connected network segment.  Frames destined for nodes connected to the originating segment are not forwarded by the switch.  Frames destined for a specific node on a different segment are sent only to that segment.  Only broadcast frames are forwarded to all other segments.  This reduces unnecessary traffic and collisions.

In such a switched network, transmitted frames may not be received by all other reachable nodes.  Nominally, only broadcast frames will be received by all other nodes.  Collisions are localized to the network segment they occur on.  Thus, the broadcast domain is the entire inter-connected [[Data Link Layer|layer two network]], and the segments connected to each switch/bridge port are each a collision domain.

Not all network systems or media feature broadcast/collision domains.  For example, [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP links]]

==Broadcast domain control==

With a sufficiently sophisticated switch, it is possible to create a network in which the normal notion of a broadcast domain is strictly controlled.  One implementation of this concept is termed a &quot;[[private VLAN]]&quot;.  Another implementation is possible with [[Linux]] and ebtables.  One helpful analogy is that by creating multiple VLANs, the number of broadcast domains increases, but the size of each broadcast domain size decreases.  This is because a [[virtual LAN]] (or VLAN) is technically a broadcast domain.

This is achieved by designating one or more &quot;[[server (computing)|server]]&quot; or &quot;provider&quot; nodes, either by MAC address or switch port.  Broadcast frames are allowed to originate from these sources, and are sent to all other nodes.  Broadcast frames from all other sources are directed only to the server/provider nodes.  Traffic from other sources not destined to the server/provider nodes (&quot;[[peer-to-peer]]&quot; traffic) is blocked.

The result is a network based on a nominally shared transmission system, like Ethernet, but in which &quot;[[client (computing)|client]]&quot; nodes cannot communicate with each other, only with the server/provider.  A common application is [[Internet service provider|Internet providers]].  Allowing direct data link layer communication between customer nodes exposes the network to various security attacks, such as [[ARP spoofing]].  Controlling the broadcast domain in this fashion provides many of the advantages of a point-to-point network, using commodity broadcast-based hardware.

'''Beechcraft ''' is an American manufacturer of [[general aviation]] and [[military]] aircraft, ranging from light single engine aircraft to business jets and light military transports. Previously a division of [[Raytheon]], it has been a brand of [[Hawker Beechcraft]] since 2006.

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2011}}
{{Expand_section|date=February 2011}}
[[Image:beech.bonanza.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|1978 [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Beech Bonanza F33C]]]]

Beechcraft was founded in [[Wichita, Kansas]] in 1932 by [[Walter Herschel Beech|Walter H. Beech]] and his wife [[Olive Ann Beech|Olive Ann Mellor Beech]].  The company began operations in an idle [[Cessna]] factory.  With designer Ted Wells, they developed the first aircraft under the Beechcraft name, the classic [[Beechcraft Staggerwing|Model 17 Staggerwing]], which first flew in November 1932. Over 750 Staggerwings were built, with 270 manufactured for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Beechcraft was not Beech's first company, as he had previously formed [[Travel Air]] in 1924 and the design numbers used at Beechcraft followed the sequence started at Travel Air, and were then continued at Curtiss-Wright, after Travel Air had been absorbed into the much larger company in 1929. Beech became President of the Curtiss-Wright's airplane division and VP of sales, but became dissatisfied with being so far removed from aircraft production and quit to form Beechcraft, using the original Travel Air facilities and employing many of the same people. Model numbers prior to 11/11000 were built under the Travel Air name, while Curtiss-Wright built the CW-12, 14, 15 and 16 as well as previous successful Travel Air models (mostly the model 4).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1942 Beech won their first [[Army-Navy ‘E’ Award]] production award and became one of the elite five percent of war contracting firms in the country to win five straight awards for production efficiency, mostly for the production of the Beechcraft 18 which remains in widespread use worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

After the war, the Staggerwing was replaced by the revolutionary [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] with a distinctive [[V-tail]].  Perhaps the best known Beech aircraft, the single-engine Bonanza has been manufactured in various models since 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;PL&quot;/&gt;  The Bonanza has had the longest production run of any airplane, past or present, in the world.  Other important Beech planes are the [[Beechcraft King Air|King Air]]/[[Beechcraft Super King Air|Super King Air]] line of twin-engine turboprops, in production since 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;PL&quot;&gt;[http://www.hawkerbeechcraft.com/service_support/pubs/docs/nontechnical/serializationList.pdf Hawker Beechcraft production lists, 1945 - present] retrieved 29 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Beechcraft Baron|Baron]], a twin-engine variant of the Bonanza, and the [[Beechcraft Model 18]], originally a business transport and commuter airliner from the late 1930s through the 1960s, which remains in active service as a cargo transport.

In 1950, Olive Ann Beech was installed as president and CEO of the company, after the sudden death of her husband from a heart attack on November 29 of that year.  She continued as CEO until Beech was purchased by [[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]] on 8 February 1980.  Ted Wells had been replaced as Chief Engineer by Herbert Rawdon, who remained at the post until his retirement in the early 1960s (he continued as a part-time consultant to Cessna President Dwane Wallace in Wichita until shortly before his death).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1994, Raytheon merged Beechcraft with the Hawker product line it had acquired in 1993 from [[British Aerospace]], forming [[Raytheon Aircraft Company]]. In 2002, the Beechcraft brand was revived to again designate the Wichita-produced aircraft.  Randy Groom, now President of Groom Aviation LLC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groomaviation.com/mx/AboutRandyGroom Groom Aviation LLC website] retrieved 22 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was President from 2003 to 2007, when Raytheon sold Raytheon Aircraft to [[Hawker Beechcraft]]. Since its inception Beechcraft has resided in [[Wichita, Kansas]], also the home of chief competitor [[Cessna]], the birthplace of [[Learjet]] and of [[Stearman]], whose trainers were used in large numbers during WW2.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The '''Battle of Peleliu''', codenamed '''Operation Stalemate II''', was fought between the [[United States]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], from September–November 1944 on the island of [[Peleliu]], present-day [[Palau]]. U.S. forces (originally consisting of only the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], but later relieved by the [[United States Army|Army's]] [[81st Infantry Division (United States)|81st Infantry Division]]), fought to capture an [[airstrip]] on the small [[coral]] island.

Major General [[William Rupertus]]—commander of 1st Marine Division—predicted the island would be secured within four days. However, due to Japan's well-crafted fortifications and stiff resistance, the battle lasted over two months. It remains one of the war's most controversial command decisions because of the island's questionable strategic value and the very high death toll. Considering the number of men involved, Peleliu had the highest casualty rate of any battle in the Pacific War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/peleliu/default.aspx Military History Online - Bloody Peleliu: Unavoidable Yet Unnecessary]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Museum of the Marine Corps]] called it &quot;the bitterest battle of the war for the Marines&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmcmuseum.com/Exhibits_UncommonValor_p15.asp World War II: Central Pacific Campaigns: Peleliu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the summer of 1944, victories in the Southwest and [[Central Pacific Area|Central Pacific]] had brought the war closer to Japan, with American bombers able to strike at the Japanese main islands. There was disagreement among the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|U.S. Joint Chiefs]] over two proposed strategies to defeat the Japanese Empire. The strategy proposed by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called for the recapture of the [[Philippines]], followed by the capture of [[Okinawa]], then an [[Operation Downfall|attack on the Japanese mainland]]. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] favored a more direct strategy of bypassing the Philippines, but seizing Okinawa and Formosa as [[staging area]]s to an attack on the Chinese mainland, followed by the future invasion of Japan's southernmost islands.

Both commanders' strategies included the invasion of Peleliu, but for different reasons. The [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] had already been chosen to make the assault. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] traveled to [[Pearl Harbor]] to personally meet both commanders and hear their arguments. MacArthur's strategy was chosen. However, before MacArthur could retake the Philippines, the [[Palau Islands]], specifically Peleliu and [[Angaur]], were to be neutralized and an airfield built to protect MacArthur's right flank.

==Preparations==
===Japanese===
By the summer of 1944, the Palau Islands were occupied by approximately 30,000 Japanese troops, with about 11,000 men on Peleliu, made up of the [[14th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|14th Infantry Division]], and Korean and [[Okinawa]]n laborers. Colonel [[Kunio Nakagawa]]—commander of the Division's 2nd Regiment—led the preparations for the island's defense.

After their losses in the [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomons]], [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts, Marshalls]] and [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] assembled a research team to develop a new island defense strategy. The team chose to abandon the early beach-based perimeter defense tactics and reckless [[Banzai charge|Banzai attacks]]. The new strategy was only to disrupt the landings, to form a &quot;honeycomb&quot; system of fortified positions inland, replace the fruitless banzai attacks with coordinated counterattacks, and draw the Americans into a bloody war of [[attrition warfare|attrition]] to wear them down and force them to commit ever more resources to the attack. Colonel Nakagawa concentrated his defenses inland. Using the rough terrain to his advantage, he constructed a system of heavily fortified bunkers, caves, and underground positions.
[[File:Peleliu-defense-194409.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Japanese fortifications.]]

The majority of Nakagawa's defenses were based at Peleliu's highest point, Umurbrogol mountain, a collection of hills and steep ridges. Located at the center of Peleliu, Umurbrogol overlooked a large portion of the island, including the crucial airfield. The Umurbrogol contained some 500 limestone caves, connected by tunnels. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding steel armor doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns.

The Japanese army dug and blasted other positions throughout Umurbrogol, armed with [[Type 97 81 mm infantry mortar|{{convert|81|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] and [[Type 96 150 mm Infantry Mortar|{{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} mortar]]s, and [[Type 98 20 mm AA Machine Cannon|{{convert|20|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} cannon]]s, and backed by a light tank unit and an anti-aircraft detachment. The cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout central Peleliu, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking [[interior lines]].

The Japanese also used the beach terrain to their advantage. The northern end of the landing beaches faced a {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} coral promontory which overlooked the beaches from a small peninsula, a spot later known to the Americans simply as &quot;The Point&quot;. Holes were blasted into the ridge to accommodate a [[Type 1 47 mm Anti-Tank Gun|{{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} gun]], and six 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannons. The positions were then sealed shut, leaving just a small firing slit to assault the beaches. Similar positions were crafted along the {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} stretch of landing beaches.

The Japanese covered the beaches with thousands of obstacles for the landing craft, principally mines and a large number of heavy artillery shells, buried with the fuses exposed to explode on being run over. A battalion was placed along the beach to defend against the landing, but the defenses were meant simply to delay the American advance. The invaders eventually would be led inland to be mauled along the fortified ridges and hills.

===American===
[[File:Battle of Peleliu2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|U.S. Marines in combat.]]

Unlike the Japanese, who drastically altered their tactics for the upcoming battle, the American invasion plan was unchanged from previous amphibious landings, even after suffering 3,000 casualties and two months of delaying tactics against the entrenched Japanese defenders at the [[Battle of Biak]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Storm Landings'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; On Peleliu, American planners chose to land on the southwest beaches, due to their proximity to the airfield on South Peleliu. The [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Marine Regiment]]—commanded by Col. [[Chesty Puller|Lewis B. Puller]]—was to land on the northern end of the beaches. The [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marine Regiment]]—under Col. [[Harold D. Harris]]—would land in the center, and the [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th Marine Regiment]]—under Col. [[Herman Hanneken|Herman H. Hanneken]]—would land at the southern end.

The division's artillery regiment—the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]]—would land after the infantry regiments. The plan was for the 1st and 7th Regiments to push inland, guarding the 5th Regiment's left and right flank, and allowing them to capture the airfield located directly to the center of the landing beaches. The 5th Marines were to push to the eastern shore, cutting the island in half. The 1st Marines would push north into the Umurbrogol, while the 7th Marines would clear the southern end of the island. Only one battalion was left behind in reserve, with the Army's 81st Infantry Division available for support from Angaur, just south of Peleliu.

On 4 September, the Marines shipped off from their station on [[Pavuvu]], just north of [[Guadalcanal]], a {{convert|2100|mi|km|abbr=on}} trip across the Pacific to Peleliu. The Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]] went in first to clear the beaches of obstacles, while [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships began their pre-invasion bombardment of Peleliu on 12 September.

The [[battleship]]s {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}, {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}, {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, {{USS|Tennessee|BB-43|2}} and {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|2}}, [[heavy cruiser]]s {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}}, {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}}, {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, [[light cruiser]]s {{USS|Columbia|CL-56|2}}, {{USS|Cleveland|CL-55|2}}, {{USS|Denver|CL-58|2}} and {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|2}}, and three [[aircraft carrier|fleet]] and five [[light aircraft carrier]]s dropped 519 rounds of {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells, 1,845 rounds of {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells, 1,793 {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs, and 73,412 {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]] rounds onto the tiny island, only {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size.

The Americans believed the bombardment to be successful, as [[Rear Admiral]] [[Jesse Oldendorf]] claimed that the Navy had run out of targets. In reality, the majority of the Japanese positions were completely unharmed. Even the battalion left to defend the beaches was virtually unscathed. During the assault, the island's defenders used unusual firing discipline to avoid giving away their positions. The bombardment managed only to destroy Japan's aircraft on the island, as well as the buildings surrounding the airfield. The Japanese remained in their fortified positions, ready to attack the troops soon to be landing.

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

===Landing===
[[File:Battle of Peleliu map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Routes of Allied landings on Peleliu, 15 September 1944.]]

The Marines landed at 08:32 on 15 September; the 1st Marines to the north on &quot;White Beach&quot;, and the 5th and 7th Marines to the center and south on &quot;Orange Beach&quot;. As the other landing craft approached the beaches, they caught hell in a crossfire when the Japanese opened the steel doors guarding their positions and let loose with heavy artillery fire. The positions on the coral promontories guarding each flank attacked the Marines with 47&amp;nbsp;mm guns and 20&amp;nbsp;mm autocannon. By 09:30, the Japanese destroyed 60 [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT's]] and [[DUKW]]'s.
[[File:Orange Beach 2 - Peleliu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|5th Marines on Orange Beach]]

The 1st Marines were quickly bogged down by heavy fire from &quot;The Point&quot;. Puller narrowly escaped death when a high velocity shell landed a direct hit on his LVT. His entire communications section had been wiped out on its way to the beach by an identical hit from a 47&amp;nbsp;mm round. The 7th Marines to the south faced similar problems with gun emplacements on their flank. Many of their LVT's were knocked out in their approach, leaving their occupants to wade ashore through the coral reef in chest-deep or higher water while being raked by Japanese machine guns; casualties were horrific and many who did make it to the beach alive had lost their rifles and other essential gear.

The 5th Marines made the most progress on D-Day, due to their distance from the heavy gun emplacements guarding the left and right flanks. They pushed forward toward the airfield, but were met with Nakagawa's first counterattack. His armored tank company raced across the airfield to push the Marines back, but were soon assaulted by every available tank, howitzer, naval gun and dive bomber. Nakagawa's inefficient tanks were quickly wiped out, along with their accompanying infantrymen.

At the end of D-Day, the Americans held their {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} stretch of landing beaches, but little else. Their biggest push in the south managed to move {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, but the 1st Marines to the north made very little progress because of the relentless attacks from The Point. The Marines had suffered 1,100 casualties on D-Day, with about 200 dead, and 900 wounded. Rupertus had believed the Japanese would quickly crumble since their perimeter had been broken, still unaware of his enemy's change of tactics.

===The airfield/South Peleliu===
[[File:Wounded Marine on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|A wounded Marine receives a drink]]

On D+1, the 5th Marines moved to capture the airfield and push toward the eastern shore. They quickly raced across the airfield under heavy artillery fire from the highlands to the north, suffering heavy casualties in the process. After capturing the airfield, they rapidly advanced to the eastern end of Peleliu, leaving the island's southern defenders to be wiped out by the 7th Marines.

This area was hotly contested by the Japanese, who still occupied numerous pillboxes. Temperatures remained around {{convert|115|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, and the Marines soon suffered high casualties from heat exhaustion. Further complicating the situation, the Marines' only available water supply was contaminated with oil. Still, by D+8 the 5th and 7th Marines had accomplished their objectives, holding the airfield and the southern portion of the island.

Having quickly captured the airfield, the American forces put it to use as early as D+3. [[L-2 Grasshopper]]s from [[VMO-1]] soon began aerial spotting missions for Marine artillery and naval gunfire. On 26 September (D+11), Marine [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]]s from [[VMF-114]] landed on the airstrip. The Corsairs began dive-bombing missions across Peleliu, and also brought two more useful weapons to the fight against Japanese fortifications. Corsairs fired rockets to blow open cave entrances for the infantrymen, and also delivered [[napalm]] attacks; it was only the second time the weapon had been used in the Pacific. Napalm proved useful, burning away the vegetation hiding spider holes and usually killing their occupants.

===The Point===
[[File:Skull and danger sign on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|Front line warning sign on Peleliu October 1944]]

The [[fortress]] atop The Point continued to cause heavy casualties across the landing beaches. Puller ordered [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] George Hunt, commander of K Company, [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]], to capture the position. He approached The Point short on supplies, having lost most of his machine guns while approaching the beaches. One of Hunt's [[platoon]]s was pinned down for nearly an entire day in a vulnerable position between [[fortification]]s. The rest of his [[company (military unit)|company]] was also in extreme danger after the Japanese cut a hole in their line, leaving his right flank cut off.

However, a rifle platoon began knocking out the Japanese gun positions, one by one. Using [[smoke grenade]]s for cover, they swept through each hole, destroying the positions with [[rifle grenade]]s. After knocking out the six machine gun positions, the Marines faced the 47&amp;nbsp;mm gun cave. A [[lieutenant]] blinded the 47&amp;nbsp;mm gunner with a smoke grenade, allowing [[Corporal]] [[Henry W. Hahn]] to throw a grenade through the cave's aperture. The grenade detonated the 47&amp;nbsp;mm's shells, forcing the cave's occupants out, where they were shot.

K Company had captured The Point, but Nakagawa sent [[counterattack]] after counterattack to recapture the valuable piece of terrain. The next 30 hours saw four major counterattacks against a sole company, critically low on [[materiel|supplies]] and out of water. The [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]s soon had to resort to [[hand-to-hand combat]] to fend off the Japanese attackers. By the time [[reinforcement]]s arrived, the company had been reduced to 18 men, suffering 157 casualties during the battle for The Point.

===Ngesebus Island===
The 5th Marines—after having secured the airfield—were sent to capture Ngesebus Island, just north of Peleliu. Ngesebus was occupied by many Japanese artillery positions, and was the site of an airfield still under construction. The tiny island was connected to Peleliu by a small causeway, but 5th Marines commander Harris opted instead to make a shore-to-shore amphibious landing, predicting the causeway to be an obvious target for the island's defenders.

Harris coordinated a pre-landing bombardment of the island on September 28, carried out by Army {{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns, naval gunfire, howitzers from the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]], strafing runs from VMF-114's Corsairs, and {{convert|75|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} fire from the approaching LVTs. Unlike the Navy's bombardment of Peleliu, Harris' assault on Ngesebus was highly successful, neutralizing the majority of the Japanese defenders. The Marines still faced opposition in the ridges and caves, but the island fell quickly, with relatively light casualties for the 5th Marines. They had suffered 15 killed and 33 wounded, and inflicted 470 casualties on the Japanese.

===Bloody Nose Ridge===
[[File:Corsair attacks jap bunker on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|A Corsair drops napalm on Japanese positions atop Umurbrogol]]
[[File:Marines wait in their foxholes - Peleliu.jpg|left|thumb|Marines waiting in their [[foxhole]]s.]]

After capturing The Point, the 1st Marines moved north into the Umurbrogol pocket, named &quot;Bloody Nose Ridge&quot; by the Marines. Puller led his men in numerous assaults, but every attack was quickly neutralized by the Japanese. The 1st Marines were trapped within the narrow paths between the ridges, with each ridge fortification supporting the other with deadly crossfire.

The Marines took increasingly high casualties as they slowly advanced through the ridges. The Japanese again showed unusual fire discipline, striking only when they could inflict maximum casualties. As casualties mounted, Japanese [[sniper]]s began to take aim at [[stretcher]] bearers, knowing that if two stretcher bearers were injured or killed, more would have to return to replace them, and the snipers could steadily pick off more and more Marines. In place of their ''banzai'' attacks, the Japanese would infiltrate the American lines at night to attack the Marines in their foxholes. The Marines built two-man foxholes, so one could sleep while the other kept watch for infiltrators.

One particularly bloody battle on Bloody Nose came when the [[1st Battalion 1st Marines|1st Battalion, 1st Marines]]—under the command of [[Major]] [[Ray Davis (U.S. Marine)|Raymond Davis]]—attacked Hill 100. Over six days of fighting, the battalion suffered 71% casualties. [[Everett P. Pope|Captain Everett Pope]] and his company penetrated deep into the ridges, leading his remaining 90 men to seize what he thought was Hill 100. It took an entire day of bloody fighting to reach what he thought was the crest of the hill, but ending up being the nose of yet another ridge, occupied by more Japanese defenders.

Trapped at the base of the ridge, Pope set up a small defense perimeter, which was attacked relentlessly by the Japanese throughout the night. The men soon ran out of bullets, and had to fight the attackers off with knives and fists, even resorting to throwing coral rock and empty boxes of ammunition at the Japanese. Pope and his men managed to hold out until dawn. When they evacuated the position, only nine men remained. Pope would receive the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions.

Gerald Thursby Sr. take time out for a cigarette}, during mopping up operations on Peleliu on 14 September 1944.]]

The Japanese eventually inflicted 60% casualties on Puller's 1st Marines, who lost 1,749 out of approximately 3,000 men. After six days of deadly fighting in the ridges of Umurbrogol, [[General]] [[Roy Geiger]], commander of the III Amphibious Corps, sent elements of 81st Infantry Division to Peleliu to relieve the regiment. The 321st Regiment Combat Team landed on the western beaches of Peleliu—at the northern end of Umurbrogol mountain—on 23 September. The 321st Regiment, and the 5th and 7th Marines all took their turn attacking the Umurbrogol, and all suffered similar casualties.

By mid-October, the 5th and 7th Marines both lost around half their men while clawing their way through the ridges. Geiger then decided to evacuate the entire 1st Marine Division, to be replaced by more 81st troops. The 323rd Regimental Combat Team landed on 15 October, and by the third week of October, almost all of the Marines had been evacuated back to Pavuvu.

The Army troops headed off to battle the remaining Japanese on Bloody Nose Ridge, fighting it out for another month before finally securing the island. At the end, Nakagawa proclaimed &quot;Our sword is broken and we have run out of spears&quot;. He then burnt his regimental colors and committed [[seppuku|ritual suicide]]. He was posthumously promoted to [[Lieutenant General]] for his valor displayed on Peleliu.

A Japanese [[lieutenant]] with his 26 2nd Infantry soldiers and eight 45th Guard Force sailors held out in the caves in Peleliu until April 22, 1947 and surrendered after a Japanese Admiral convinced them the war was over. This was the last official surrender of World War II.{{fact|date=May 2011}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Soldiers wounded in battle of peleliu.jpg|thumb|Marines in a hospital on Guadalcanal after being wounded in the Battle of Peleliu]]

The reduction of the Japanese pocket around Umurbrogol mountain is considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Peleliu/USMC-M-Peleliu-5.html |title=USMC Historical Monograph - The Seizure of Peleliu, by Major Frank O. Hough, USMC, Chapter V: A Horrible Place| publisher=Historical Branch, G-3 Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps |accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the most difficult fight that the U.S. military encountered in the entire Second World War. The 1st Marine Division was severely mauled and it remained out of action until the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]] on 1 April 1945. In total, the 1st Division suffered over 6,500 casualties during their month on Peleliu, over ⅓ of their entire division. The 81st Infantry Division suffered over 3,000 casualties during their tenure on the island.

The battle was controversial due to the island's lack of strategic value. The airfield captured on Peleliu was of little use for the attack on the Philippines. The island was never used for a staging operation in subsequent invasions; the [[Ulithi Atoll]], in the [[Caroline Islands]] north of the Palaus, was used as a staging base for the invasion of Okinawa. In addition, few news reports were made on the battle. Due to Rupertus' &quot;3 days&quot; prediction, only six reporters bothered coming ashore. The battle was overshadowed by MacArthur's return to the Philippines and the Allies' push towards [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]].

The [[Battle of Angaur|battles for Angaur]] and Peleliu showed Americans the pattern of future Japanese island defense which would be seen again at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, 1958, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Naval bombardment prior to amphibious assault at Iwo Jima was only slightly more effective than at Peleliu, but at Okinawa the preliminary shelling was superb.&lt;ref name=Alexander95&gt;Alexander,''Storm Landings'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Frogmen performing underwater demolition at Iwo Jima confused the enemy by sweeping both coasts, but later alerted Japanese defenders to the exact assault beaches at Okinawa.&lt;ref name=Alexander95/&gt; American ground forces at Peleliu gained experience in assaulting heavily fortified positions such as they would find again at Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, 1958, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the recommendation of Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]], the planned occupation of [[Yap]] Island in the Caroline islands was canceled. Halsey actually recommended that the landings on Peleliu and Angaur be canceled, too, and their Marines and soldiers be thrown into [[Leyte Island]] instead, but was overruled by Nimitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Peleliu/USMC-M-Peleliu-B.html |title=The Seizure of Peleliu, Appendix B - STALEMATE II and the Philippines Campaign |publisher=Historical Branch, G-3 Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps| accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- LEAD STARTS HERE --&gt;The '''Battle of Stalingrad''' was a major battle of [[World War II]] in which [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies fought the [[Soviet Union]] for control of the city of [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] (now [[Volgograd]]) in southwestern Russia. The battle took place between 23 August 1942 and 2 February 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern world history : patterns of interaction|year=2006|publisher=McDougal Littell|location=Evanston, IL|isbn=0618557156|pages=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was among the largest on the Eastern Front and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and [[civilian casualties]]. It was amongst the [[List of battles by casualties|bloodiest battles in the history of warfare]] with the higher estimates of combined casualties amounting to nearly two million deaths. In its defeat, the crippling losses suffered by Germany's military proved to be insurmountable for the war. The battle was a turning point in the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;EBdates&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/562720/Battle-of-Stalingrad &quot;Battle of Stalingrad.&quot;] ''Encyclopædia Britannica.'' 2009.

The German offensive to capture Stalingrad commenced in late summer 1942, supported by intensive ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing which reduced much of the city to rubble. The German offensive eventually became bogged down in house-to-house fighting; and despite controlling over 90% of the city at times, the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' was unable to dislodge the last Soviet defenders clinging tenaciously to the west bank of the [[Volga River]].

In November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]]; a two-pronged attack, targeted at the inferior Romanian and Italian forces which were protecting the German 6th Army flanks. The success of these attacks caused the weakly held flanks to collapse and the 6th Army to be [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] inside Stalingrad. As the Russian winter set in, the 6th Army weakened rapidly from cold, starvation and ongoing Soviet attacks. Command ambiguity coupled with Adolf Hitler's resolute belief in the &quot;power of the will&quot; and the value of &quot;standing fast&quot; further compounded the German predicament. Eventually, the failure to break the encirclement by relieving German forces, coupled with the failure of re-supply by air, caused the final collapse. By early February 1943, German resistance in Stalingrad had ceased and the remaining elements of the surrounded 6th Army had either surrendered or had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer (1990), p. 932&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By spring 1942, the Germans had stabilized their new front in a line running roughly from [[Leningrad]] in the north to [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] in the south. There were a number of [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salients]] in the line where Soviet offensives had pushed the Germans back, notably to the northwest of Moscow and south of [[Kharkov]], but neither was particularly threatening. In the far south, the Germans were in control of most of [[Ukraine]] and much of the [[Crimea]], although [[Sevastopol]] remained in Soviet hands along with a small portion of the [[Kerch Peninsula]].

The Germans were confident they could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1941. There was some substance to this belief: while the German [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy punishment, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged during the winter fighting, and had been rested and re-equipped; and Army Groups North and South had not been particularly hard pressed over the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.J.P Taylor]] &amp; [[Alan Clark]] 1974, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of Stalingrad===


The capture of Stalingrad was important to [[Adolf Hitler]], and to [[Benito Mussolini]], for two primary reasons. First, the city was an important base on the transportation route provided by the [[Volga River]] between the [[Caspian Sea]] and northern Russia. Consequently a German capture of the city would effectively sever the Soviet river link to the north. Second, its capture would secure the western flank of the German armies as they advanced into the oil-rich city of [[Baku]]—with the strategic aim of cutting off fuel from Stalin's war machine.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer (1990), p. 909&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the city bore the name of the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Joseph Stalin]], would make its capture an [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[propaganda]] coup.

The Soviets realized that they were under tremendous constraints of time and resources and ordered that anyone strong enough to hold a rifle be sent to defend the city.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald (1986), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage of the war, the Red Army was less capable of highly mobile operations than the German Army. However, combat in large urban areas tends to be dominated by small arms weaponry rather than armoured and mechanized units. This would lessen any Soviet disadvantage because the Red Army was specially trained for close-quarters urban combat, whereas the Wehrmacht was principally trained for fast-moving field operations.

Army Group South was selected for a sprint forward through the southern Russian [[steppe]]s into the Caucasus to capture the vital Soviet [[oil field]]s [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|there]]. The planned summer offensive was [[Code name|code-named]] ''Fall Blau'' (&quot;Case Blue&quot;). It was to include the German 6th, [[German Seventeenth Army|17th]], [[German Fourth Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[German First Panzer Army|1st Panzer]] Armies. Army Group South had overrun the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] in 1941. Poised in Eastern Ukraine, it was to spearhead the offensive.

Hitler intervened, however, ordering the [[Army Group]] to be split in two. Army Group South (A), under the command of [[Wilhelm List]], was to continue advancing south towards the Caucasus as planned with the 17th Army and First Panzer Army. Army Group South (B), including [[Friedrich Paulus]]’ 6th Army and [[Hermann Hoth]]'s 4th Panzer Army, was to move east towards the Volga and Stalingrad. Army Group B was commanded initially by [[Field Marshal]] [[Fedor von Bock]] and later by General [[Maximilian von Weichs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirer 1990, p.915&quot;&gt;Shirer (1990), p. 915&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of Case Blau had been planned for late May 1942. However, a number of German and [[Romania]]n units that were involved in ''Blau'' were then in the process of [[Siege of Sevastopol (1942)|besieging Sevastopol]] on the Crimean Peninsula. Delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for ''Blau'' several times, and the city did not fall until the end of June. A smaller action was taken in the meantime, pinching off a Soviet [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], which resulted in the [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Pocket|pocketing]] of a large Soviet force on 22 May.
[[File:German Summer Offensive, 7 May-23 July 1942.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The German advance to the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] between 7 May and 23 July.]]

''Blau'' finally opened as Army Group South began its attack into southern Russia on 28 June 1942. The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.

The initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 6th both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and re-assigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.

By the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers were only {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which was to have important implications later in the course of the battle. The Germans began using the armies of their [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], Hungarian, Croatian and Romanian allies to guard their left (northern) flank. The Italians are not often credited with bravery in the fighting, but they won several accolades in official German communiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=|last=German High Command (communique)|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=27 October 1941|year=|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques.|journal=New York Times|volume=|issue=28 October 1941| pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi =|id=|url=http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5000808| language=|accessdate=27 April 2009|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=|last=German High Command (communique)|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=10 November 1942|year=|month=|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques on Fighting in Various Zones.| journal=New York Times|volume=|issue=10 November 1942|pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi=|id=|url= http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5001262|language=| accessdate=27 April 2009|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=| last=German High Command (communique)|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=26 August 1942|year=|month =|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques on Fighting in Various Zones.|journal= New York Times| volume=|issue=26 August 1942|pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi=|id=|url=http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5001240|language=|accessdate=27 April 2009|laysummary=| laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=|last=German High Command (communique) |first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=12 December 1942|year=|month=|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques.|journal=New York Times|volume=|issue=12 December 1942|pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi=|id=|url= http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5001290|language=| accessdate = 27 April 2009|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were held in little regard by the Germans, and were often accused of cowardice and low morale: in reality, their ineffectiveness in combat was due to their very scarce equipment, obsolete weaponry, and primitive tactics of Italian officers, thus often being obliged to retreat or flee. They distinguished themselves in numerous battles, as in the [[battle of Nikolayevka]]. The German 6th Army was only a few dozen kilometers from Stalingrad, and 4th Panzer Army, now to their south, turned northwards to help take the city. To the south, Army Group A was pushing far into the Caucasus, but their advance slowed as supply lines grew overextended. The two German army groups were not positioned to support one another due to the great distances involved.

After German intentions became clear in July, Stalin appointed [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Andrey Yeryomenko]] as commander of the [[Soviet Southeastern Front|Southeastern Front]] on 1 August 1942. Yeryomenko and [[Commissar]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] were tasked with planning the defense of Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=Craig73&gt;Craig, William (1973). ''Enemy at the Gates: the Battle for Stalingrad''. New York: Penguin Books (ISBN 0-14-200000-0 &amp; ISBN 1-56852-368-8).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|25, 48|date=May 2009}} The eastern border of Stalingrad was the wide River Volga, and over the river, additional Soviet units were deployed. These units became the newly formed 62nd Army, which Yeryomenko placed under the command of [[Lieutenant general|Lt. Gen.]] [[Vasily Chuikov|Vasiliy Chuikov]] on 11 September 1942. The situation was extremely dire. When asked how he interpreted his task, he responded &quot;We will defend the city or die in the attempt.&quot;&lt;ref name=Beevor127&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The 62nd Army's mission was to defend Stalingrad at all costs. Chuikov's generalship during the battle earned him one of his two [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] awards.

==Beginning of the battle==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0130-0050-004, Russland, Kesselschlacht Stalingrad.jpg|thumb|right|The aftermath of a [[bombing raid]] in the city]]

The Soviets had enough warning of the Germans' advance to ship virtually all the city's grain, cattle, and railroad rolling stock across the Volga and out of harm's way. This &quot;harvest victory&quot; left the city short of food even before the German attack began. Production continued in some factories, particularly the one producing [[T-34]] tanks. Before the ''Wehrmacht'' reached the city itself, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had rendered the River Volga, vital for bringing supplies into the city, unusable to Soviet shipping. Between 25 and 31 July, 32 Soviet ships were sunk, with another nine crippled.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007&gt;Bergström, Christer, (2007), ''Stalingrad – The Air Battle: 1942 through January 1943'', Chevron Publishing Limited ISBN 978-1-85780-276-4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|69|date=May 2009}}

The battle began with the heavy bombing of the city by ''Generaloberst'' [[Wolfram von Richthofen]]'s ''[[Luftflotte 4]]'', which in the summer and autumn of 1942 was the most powerful single air [[formation (military)|formation]] in the world. Some 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|122|date=May 2009}} The city was quickly turned to rubble, although some factories continued production while workers joined in the fighting. The Croatian 369th Reinforced Infantry Regiment was the only non-German unit&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;Pojić, Milan. ''[http://www.naklada-ljevak.hr/knjiga/show/id/2079 Hrvatska pukovnija 369. na Istočnom bojištu 1941. – 1943.]''. [[Croatian State Archives]]. Zagreb, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; selected by the ''Wehrmacht'' to enter Stalingrad city during assault operations. It fought as part of the 100th Jäger Division.

Stalin rushed all available troops to the east bank of the Volga, some from as far away as [[Siberia]]. All the regular ferries were quickly destroyed by the Luftwaffe, which then targeted troop barges being towed slowly across the river by tugs. Many civilians were evacuated across the Volga.&lt;ref name=Craig73&gt;[[William Craig|Craig, William]] (1973). ''[[Stalingrad (book)|Stalingrad]]'' or ''Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad'' (in the US). Reader's Digest Press, E. P. Dutton Co., Inc. 1973, ISBN 0142000000&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Stalin prevented civilians from leaving the city in the belief that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city's defenders.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians, including women and children, were put to work building [[trench]]works and protective fortifications. A massive German [[strategic bombing|air bombardment]] on 23 August caused a [[firestorm]], killing thousands and turning Stalingrad into a vast landscape of rubble and burnt ruins. Ninety percent of the living space in the Voroshilovskiy area was destroyed. Between 23 and 26 August, Soviet reports indicate 955 people were killed and another 1,181 wounded as a result of the bombing.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|73|date=May 2009}} Casualties of 40,000 were exaggerated,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward 2001, pp. 188-189.&lt;/ref&gt; and after 25 August, the Soviets did not record civilian and military casualties as a result of air raids.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström quotes: Soviet Reports on the effects of air raids between 23–26 August 1942. This indicates 955 people were killed and another 1,181 wounded&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 116-168-618, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Soldat mit MPi.jpg|thumb|left|German officer with a Russian [[PPSh 41]] submachine gun taking cover in rubble.]]

The [[Soviet Air Force]], the ''Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily'' (VVS), was swept aside by the Luftwaffe. The VVS assembly in the immediate area lost 201 aircraft between 23 and 31 August, and despite meager reinforcements of some 100 aircraft in August, it was left with just 192 serviceable aircraft, 57 of which were fighters.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|74|date=May 2009}} The Soviets continued to pour aerial reinforcements into the Stalingrad area in late September, but continued to suffer appalling losses; the ''Luftwaffe'' had complete control of the skies. However, due to the relocation of Soviet industry in 1941, Soviet aircraft production reached 15,800 in the second half of 1942. The VVS was able to preserve significant strength and build up a strategic reserve that would eventually overpower the ''Luftwaffe''.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|86|date=May 2009}}

The burden of the initial defense of the city fell on the [[1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; a unit made up mainly of young female volunteers who had no training for engaging ground targets. Despite this, and with no support available from other units, the AA gunners stayed at their posts and took on the advancing panzers. The [[German 16th Panzer Division]] reportedly had to fight the 1077th’s gunners &quot;shot for shot&quot; until all 37 anti-aircraft batteries were destroyed or overrun. The German 16th Panzer Division was shocked to find that, due to Soviet manpower shortages, it had been fighting female soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stalingrad-info.com/stalingrad1942.htm|title=Stalingrad 1942| accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, the Soviets relied extensively on &quot;Workers' [[militia]]s&quot; composed of workers not directly involved in war production. For a short time, tanks continued to be produced and then manned by volunteer crews of factory workers. They were driven directly from the factory floor to the front line, often without paint or even gunsights.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:StalingradRus.jpg|thumb|left|Soviets preparing to ward off a German assault in Stalingrad's suburbs]]

By the end of August, Army Group South (B) had finally reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. Another advance to the river south of the city followed. By 1 September, the Soviets could only reinforce and supply their forces in Stalingrad by perilous crossings of the Volga under constant bombardment by artillery and aircraft.

On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and [[66th Army|66th]] Armies organized a massive attack against XIV ''Panzerkorps''. The ''Luftwaffe'' helped repulse the offensive by heavily attacking Soviet artillery positions and defensive lines. The Soviets were forced to withdraw at midday after only a few hours. Of the 120 tanks the Soviets had committed, 30 were lost to air attack.&lt;ref name= Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|75|date=May 2009}}

Soviet operations were constantly hampered by the ''Luftwaffe''. On 18 September, the Soviet [[1st Guards Army (Soviet Union)|1st Guards]] and [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th Army]] launched an offensive against ''VIII. Armeekorps'' at Kotluban. ''[[8th Air Corps (Germany)|VIII. Fliegerkorps]]'' dispatched wave after wave of [[Stuka]] dive-bombers to prevent a breakthrough. The offensive was repulsed. The Stukas claimed 41 of the 106 Soviet tanks knocked out that morning, while escorting [[Bf 109]]s destroyed 77 Soviet aircraft.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|80|date=May 2009}}
Amid the debris of the wrecked city, the Soviet [[62nd Army|62nd]] and 64th [[Army (Soviet Army)|Armies]], which included the Soviet [[13th Guards Rifle Division]], anchored their defense lines with strongpoints in houses and factories.

Fighting within the ruined city was fierce and desperate. Lieutenant General [[Alexander Rodimtsev]] was in charge of the 13th Guards Rifle Division, and received one of two [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]] awarded during the battle for his actions. Stalin's [[Order No. 227]] of 27 July 1942 decreed that all commanders who ordered unauthorized retreat would be subject to a military tribunal. “[[Order No. 227|Not a step back]]!” and &quot;There is no land behind the Volga!&quot; were the slogans. The Germans pushing forward into Stalingrad suffered heavy casualties.

===Hugging tactics===
{{ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:German Summer Offensive, 24 July-18 November.PNG|thumb|right|300px| The German advance to Stalingrad between 24 July and 18 November.]]

German [[military doctrine]] was based on the principle of [[Combined arms|combined-arms teams]] and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, [[Military engineer|engineers]], artillery and [[Ground attack aircraft|ground-attack aircraft]]. To counter this, Soviet commanders adopted the tactic of always keeping the front lines as close to the Germans as physically possible; Chuikov called this &quot;hugging&quot; the Germans. This forced the German infantry to either fight on their own or risk taking casualties from their own supporting fire; it neutralized German close air support and weakened artillery support. The Soviets understood that, in Stalingrad, the best defense would depend on anchoring their defense lines in numerous buildings overseeing strategically important streets and squares. Such a strategy would hold for as long as possible all the ground the Soviets could take in the city. Thus, they converted multi-floored apartment blocks, factories, warehouses, street corner residences and office buildings into strongholds bristling with machine guns, anti-tank rifles, mortars, mines, barbed wire, snipers and small 5-10 man units of submachine gunners and grenadiers prepared for house-to-house combat. Bitter fighting raged for every ruin, street, factory, house, basement and staircase. The sewers were the sites of labyrinthine firefights. The Germans, calling this unseen [[urban warfare]] ''Rattenkrieg'' (&quot;Rat War&quot;), bitterly joked about capturing the kitchen but still fighting for the living room. In such desperate chaos, all battle lines vanished, and the major, armor-supported mobility to which the German soldiers were accustomed degenerated into vicious, fast-paced skirmishes ranging through bombed-out debris of residential neighborhoods, office blocks, basements and apartment high-rises. Some of the taller buildings, blasted into roofless shells by earlier German aerial bombardment, saw floor-by-floor, close-quarters combat, with the Germans and Soviets on alternate levels, firing at each other through holes in the floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TV Novosti|title=Crucial WW2 battle remembered|url=http://www.russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-02-02/Crucial_WW2_battle_remembered.html| accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting on [[Mamayev Kurgan]], a prominent hill above the city, was particularly merciless, and the position changed hands many times.&lt;ref name=Craig73/&gt;{{Rp|p?|date=May 2009}} By 12 September, the Soviet 62nd Army had been reduced to 90 tanks, 700 mortars and just 20,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th Guards Rifle Division, assigned to retake Mamayev Kurgan and Railway Station No. 1 on 13 September suffered particularly heavy losses. Over 30 percent of its soldiers were killed in the first 24 hours, and just 320 out of the original 10,000 survived the entire battle. Both objectives were retaken, but only temporarily. The railway station changed hands 14 times in six hours. By the following evening, the 13th Guards Rifle Division had ceased to exist, but its men had killed approximately an equal number of Germans. Combat raged there for weeks near the giant grain silo. When German soldiers finally took the position, only forty dead Soviet fighters were found, though the Germans had thought there were many more due to the ferocious resistance. The Soviets burned heaps of grain during their retreat. In another part of the city, a Soviet [[platoon]] under the command of [[Yakov Pavlov]] turned an apartment building that oversaw a square in the city center into an impenetrable fortress, later called &quot;[[Pavlov's House]]&quot;. The soldiers surrounded it with minefields, set up machine-gun positions at the windows and breached the walls in the basement for better communications.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers found about ten Soviet civilians hiding in the basement. They were not relieved, and not significantly reinforced, for two months. Well after the battle, Chuikov liked to joke that more Germans died trying to capture Pavlov's House than died capturing Paris. According to Beevor, throughout the second month, after each wave of German assault against the building, the Soviets had to run out and kick down the piles of German corpses in order for the machine and anti-tank gunners in the building to have clear firing lines across the square. The building was labeled ''Festung'' (&quot;Fortress&quot;) on German maps. Sgt. Pavlov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] for his actions.

With no end in sight, the Germans started transferring [[heavy artillery]] to the city, including the gigantic [[Dora (artillery)|{{convert|800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} railroad gun]] nicknamed &quot;Dora&quot;, but made no attempt to send a force across the Volga, allowing the Soviets to build up a large number of artillery batteries on the east side. This artillery continued to bombard the German positions. German tanks became useless amid heaps of rubble up to eight meters high.

Snipers on both sides used the ruins to inflict heavy casualties. The most famous [[soviet sniper]] in Stalingrad was [[Vasily Zaytsev]] with 225 confirmed kills during the battle. Zaytsev was one of a whole corps of snipers and had over 30 students, who were credited with killing over 3,000 German soldiers during the war.

For both Stalin and Hitler, Stalingrad became a matter of prestige over and above its actual strategic significance. The Soviet command moved the Red Army's strategic reserves from the Moscow area to the lower Volga, and transferred aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad region.

The strain on both military commanders was immense: Paulus developed an uncontrollable tic in his eye, which eventually afflicted the left side of his face, while Chuikov experienced an outbreak of [[eczema]] that required him to have his hands completely bandaged. Troops on both sides faced the constant strain of close-range combat.

Determined to crush Soviet resistance, ''Luftflotte'' 4's ''Stukawaffe'' flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the [[Volgograd Tractor Factory|''Dzerzhinskiy'' Tractor Factory]] on 5 October. Several Soviet regiments were wiped out; the entire staff of the Soviet 339th Infantry Regiment were killed the following morning during an air raid.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|83|date=May 2009}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-107-24, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|thumb|left|German troops near the wreck of a [[T-34]].]]

In mid-October, the ''Luftwaffe'' intensified its efforts against remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. ''Luftflotte'' 4 flew 2,000 sorties on 14 October and {{convert|600|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped while German infantry surrounded the three factories. ''Stukageschwader'' 1, 2, and 77 had largely silenced Soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the Volga before turning their attention to the shipping that was once again trying to reinforce the narrowing Soviet pockets of resistance. The 62nd Army had been cut in two, and, due to intensive air attack on its supply ferries, was now being paralyzed.

With the Soviets forced into a {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} strip of land on the western bank of the Volga, over 1,208 ''Stuka'' missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|84|date=May 2009}} Despite the heavy air bombardment (Stalingrad suffered heavier bombardment than [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] or [[Sevastopol]]), the Soviet 62nd Army, with 47,000 men and 19 tanks, prevented the ''VI Armee'' and ''IV Panzerarmee'' from taking the west bank.

The ''Luftwaffe'' retained [[air superiority]] into early November and Soviet daytime aerial resistance was nonexistent, but after flying 20,000 individual sorties, its original strength of 1,600 serviceable aircraft had fallen to 950. The ''Kampfwaffe'' (bomber force) had been hardest hit, having only 232 out of a force of 480 left.&lt;ref name=hayward98&gt;Hayward, Joel S.A. ''Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942–1943 (Modern War Studies)''. University Press of Kansas, 1998, (hardcover) ISBN 0-7006-0876-1; 2001, (paperback) ISBN 0-7006-1146-0&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|95|date=May 2009}} Despite enjoying qualitative superiority against the ''VVS'' and possessing 80% of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s resources on the Eastern Front, ''Luftflotte'' 4 could not prevent Soviet aerial power from growing. By the time of the counter-offensive, the Soviets outnumbered it.

The Soviet bomber force, the ''Aviatsiya Dal'nego Deystviya'' ([[Long Range Aviation]]; ADD), having taken crippling losses over the past 18 months, was restricted to flying at night. The Soviets flew 11,317 night sorties over Stalingrad and the Don-bend sector between 17 July and 19 November. These raids caused little damage and were of nuisance value only.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|82|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Golovanov 2004, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation for the ''Luftwaffe'' was now becoming increasingly difficult. On 8 November, substantial units from ''Luftflotte'' 4 were withdrawn to combat [[Operation Torch|the Allied landings in North Africa]]. The German air arm found itself spread thinly across Europe, and struggling to maintain its strength in the other southern sectors of the Soviet-German front.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;8,314 German aircraft were produced from July–December 1942, but this could not keep pace with a three-front aerial war of attrition&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Soviet Army was being supplied by the American government under the [[Lend-Lease]] program. During the last quarter of 1942, the U.S. sent the Soviet Union 60,000 trucks, 11,000 jeeps, 2 million pairs of boots, {{convert|50000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of explosives, {{convert|450000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of steel and {{convert|250000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of aviation gas.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the American boots, which Stalin requested first{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, reached the troops. However, a part of the military equipment and food supplied by the USA was destroyed by German attacks,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} as that of [[Convoy PQ-17]].

After three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets. Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders. Nevertheless, the fighting, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city, continued as fiercely as ever. The battles for the [[Red October (factory)|Red October Steel Factory]], the Dzerzhinsky tractor factory and the Barrikady gun factory became world-famous.

==Soviet counter-offensives==
Recognizing that German troops were ill prepared for offensive operations during the winter and that most of them were redeployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the [[Stavka]] decided to conduct a number of offensive operations which took place between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943.

Seen in post-war history as a pivotal strategic period of war that began the [[Second Period of the Great Patriotic War]] (19 November 1942–31 December 1943), these operations opened the [[Winter Campaign of 1942-1943]] (19 November 1942–3 March 1943), which involved some 15 Armies operating on several fronts.

===German order of battle===
{{Main|Battle of Stalingrad German Order of Battle}}

===German exhaustion prior to Operation Uranus===
The German offensive to take Stalingrad had been halted by a combination of stubborn Red Army resistance inside the city and local weather conditions. The Soviet counter-offensive planning used deceptive measures that eventually trapped and destroyed the 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city, becoming the second large scale defeat of the German Army during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Glantz (1989), ''Soviet Military Deception in the Second World War'', pp. 108–119&lt;/ref&gt;

During the siege, the German and allied [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian]], and [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Romanian]] armies protecting Army Group B's [[Flanking maneuver|flank]]s had pressed their [[headquarters]] for support.&lt;ref&gt;Haupt (1998), ''Army Group South: The Wehrmacht in Russia 1941-1945'', pp. 209–211&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian 2nd Army, consisting of mainly ill-equipped and ill-trained units, was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|–|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single [[platoon]]. Soviet forces held several bridgeheads on the western bank of the river and presented a potentially serious threat to Army Group B.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirer 1990, p.915&quot;/&gt;

Similarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian [[VII Corps (Romania)|VII Corps]], and beyond it, a single German division, the [[16th Infantry Division (Germany)|16th Motorized Infantry]].

However, Hitler was so focused on the city itself that requests from the flanks for support were refused. The Chief of the [[OKH|Army General Staff]], [[Franz Halder]], expressed concerns about Hitler's preoccupation with the city, pointing out that if the situation on the weak German flanks was not rectified, &quot;there would be a disaster&quot;. Hitler told Halder that Stalingrad would be captured and the weakened flanks would be held with &quot;national socialist ardour, clearly I cannot expect this of you (Halder)&quot;, and replaced him with General [[Kurt Zeitzler]] in mid-October.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer (1990), pp. 917–918&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Uranus: the Soviet offensive===
{{Main|Operation Uranus}}
[[Image:Map Battle of Stalingrad-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Soviet counter-attack at Stalingrad {{legend-line|solid#dd0000 2px|German front, 19 November}} {{legend-line|solid#ff6600 2px|German front, 12 December}} {{legend-line|solid #009a00 2px|German front, 24 December}} {{legend|#c3c3c3|border=solid grey 1px|Russian advance, 19–28 November}}]]

In autumn, the Soviet generals [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]], responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated massive forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city. The German northern flank was particularly vulnerable, since it was defended by [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian]], and [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Romanian]] units that suffered from inferior equipment, morale, and leadership when compared with their German counterparts. This weakness was known and exploited by the Soviets, who preferred to face off against non-German troops whenever possible, just as the British preferred attacking Italian troops instead of German ones in North Africa. The plan was to keep pinning the Germans down in the city, then punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the Germans inside Stalingrad. The flanks were to be attacked far enough away from Stalingrad so that the bulk of the 6th Army in Stalingrad could not redeploy to defend against the attack. During the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organization, insisted on a one week delay in the start date of the planned attack.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was code-named &quot;Uranus&quot; and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]]. The plan was similar to the one Zhukov had used to achieve victory at [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]] three years before, where he had sprung a [[pincer movement|double envelopment]] and destroyed the [[IJA 23d Division|23rd Division]] of the Japanese army.&lt;ref&gt;Maps of the conflict.

On 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] unleashed Operation Uranus. The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen. [[Nikolay Vatutin]] consisted of three complete armies, the [[Soviet First Guards Army|1st Guards Army]], [[5th Guards Tank Army|5th Tank Army]], and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry [[Division (military)|divisions]], eight tank [[brigade]]s, two [[Mechanized force|motorized]] brigades, six [[cavalry]] divisions and one anti-tank brigade. The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was shattered. On 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad, against points held by the [[Romanian IV Corps]]. The Romanian forces, made up primarily of infantry, collapsed almost immediately. Soviet forces raced west in a [[pincer movement]], and met two days later near the town of [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]], sealing the ring around Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirer 1990, p.926&quot;&gt;Shirer (1990), p. 926&lt;/ref&gt; This was not filmed at the time; the Soviets re-enacted the link-up for a [[propaganda]] film, which achieved worldwide fame.

===Sixth Army encirclement===
{{ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:M3 Tank Stalingrad.JPG|thumb|Soviet forces attacking north of Stalingrad in late November of 1942]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-218-0501-27, Russland-Süd, rumänische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Romanian troops near Stalingrad]]

About 290,000 German and Romanian soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;Manstein (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} the Croatian 369th Reinforced Infantry Regiment and other volunteer subsidiary troops were surrounded. Inside the [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Pocket|pocket]] ({{lang-de|[[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Kessel|Kessel]]}}, literally &quot;cauldron&quot;), there were also around 10,000 Soviet civilians and several thousand Soviet soldiers the Germans had taken captive during the battle. Not all of the 6th Army was trapped; 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. The Red Army units immediately formed two defensive fronts: a [[circumvallation]] facing inward and a [[contravallation]] facing outward.

[[Adolf Hitler]] had declared in a public speech (in the [[Berlin Sportpalast]]) on 30 September 1942 that the German army would never leave the city. At a meeting shortly after the Soviet [[encirclement]], German army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the Don, but Hitler was at his Bavarian retreat of Obersalzberg in ''[[Berchtesgaden]]'' with the head of the ''Luftwaffe'', [[Hermann Göring]]. When asked by Hitler, Göring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;{{Rp|234|date=May 2009}} that the [[Luftwaffe]] could supply the 6th Army with an &quot;[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]]&quot;. This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on while a relief force was assembled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirer 1990, p.926&quot;/&gt;

A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army. Also, Soviet fighter forces had improved considerably in both quality and quantity in the intervening year. But the mention of the successful Demyansk air supply operation reinforced Hitler's own views, and was endorsed by Göring several days later.

The head of ''Luftflotte'' 4, [[Wolfram von Richthofen]], tried to get this decision overturned. The 6th Army was the largest unit of this type in the world and almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. It should have been clear that supplying them by air was impossible; the maximum {{convert|117.5|ST|t|abbr=on}} they could deliver a day—based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at Pitomnik to land at—was far less than the minimum {{convert|800|ST|t|abbr=on}} needed.&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shirer p. 926 says that &quot;Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,&quot; while Craig pp. 206–207 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: &quot;Are you aware ... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need? ... Seven hundred tons! Every day!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement the limited number of [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports, the Germans used aircraft wholly inadequate for the role, such as the [[Heinkel He 177]] bomber (some bombers performed adequately—the [[Heinkel He 111]] proved to be quite capable and was much faster than the Ju 52). But Hitler backed Göring's plan and reiterated his order of &quot;no surrender&quot; to his trapped armies.

The air supply mission failed. Appalling weather conditions, technical failures, heavy Soviet [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft]] fire and fighter interceptions led to the loss of 488 German aircraft. The ''Luftwaffe'' failed to achieve even the daily supply of {{convert|117|ST|t|abbr=on}} that it had aircraft for. An average of {{convert|94|ST|t|abbr=on}} of supplies per day was delivered. The most successful day, 19 December, delivered only {{convert|289|ST|t|abbr=on}} of supplies in 154 flights. The supplies that did get through were often useless: one aircraft arrived with {{convert|20|t|ST|abbr=on}} of [[vodka]] and summer uniforms, another with supplies of black pepper and [[marjoram]].&lt;ref name=Craig73/&gt; Hitler's indecision on the purpose of Operation Winter Storm (either to allow a breakout or to open a corridor) meant that large quantities of fuel that would have helped with a breakout were shipped when food and ammunition would have been more useful.&lt;ref name=walsh2000/&gt;{{Rp|153|date=June 2009}} The transport aircraft that did land safely were used to evacuate technical specialists and sick or wounded men from the besieged enclave (some 42,000 in all).

Initially, supply flights came in from the field at [[Tatsinskaya]], called 'Tazi' by the German pilots. On 23 December, the Soviet 24th Tank Corps, commanded by Major-General [[Vasily Badanov|Vasily Mikhaylovich Badanov]], reached nearby Skassirskaya and in the early morning of 24 December, [[Tatsinskaya Raid|the tanks reached Tatsinskaya]]. Without any soldiers to defend the airfield, it was abandoned under heavy fire; in a little under an hour, 108 Ju 52s and 16 [[Junkers Ju 86|Ju 86]]s took off for [[Novocherkassk]]—leaving 72 Ju 52s and many other aircraft burning on the ground. A new base was established some {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Stalingrad at [[Salsk]], the additional distance another obstacle to the resupply efforts. Salsk was abandoned in turn by mid-January for a rough facility at Zverevo, near Shakhty. The field at Zverevo was attacked repeatedly on 18 January and a further 50 Ju 52s were destroyed.

The 6th Army slowly starved. Pilots were shocked to find the troops too exhausted and hungry to unload. Germans fought over the slightest scraps of bread. General [[Kurt Zeitzler|Zeitzler]], moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times. After a few weeks on such a diet, he had lost {{convert|26|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and had become so emaciated that Hitler, annoyed, personally ordered him to start eating regular meals again.

The toll on the ''Transportgruppen'' was heavy. Some 266 Junkers Ju 52s were destroyed, ⅓ of the fleet's strength on the Eastern Front. The He 111 ''gruppen'' lost 165 aircraft in transport operations. Other losses included 42 Ju 86s, nine [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]] Condors, five He 177 bombers and a [[Junkers Ju 290|Ju 290]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' also lost close to 1,000 highly experienced bomber crew personnel.&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;{{Rp|310|date=May 2009}} So heavy were the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s losses that four of ''Luftflotte'' 4's transport units (KGrzbV 700, KGrzbV 900, I./KGrzbV 1 and II./KGzbV 1) were &quot;formally dissolved&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|122|date=May 2009}}

These losses amounted to about 50% of the total used units. In addition, the training program was stopped for the air supply and ''[[History of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)|Luftwaffe]]'' sorties in other theaters of war had been significantly reduced to save fuel for use at Stalingrad.

===Operation Little Saturn===
{{Main|Operation Little Saturn|Operation Winter Storm}}

Soviet forces consolidated their positions around Stalingrad, and fierce fighting to shrink the pocket began. Operation Winter Storm (''Operation Wintergewitter''), a German attempt to relieve the trapped army from the south, was successfully fended off by the Soviets in December. The full impact of the harsh Russian winter set in. The Volga froze solid, allowing the Soviets to supply their forces more easily. The trapped Germans rapidly ran out of heating fuel and medical supplies, and thousands started to die of [[frostbite]], malnutrition, and disease.
[[File:OperationLittleSaturn.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Soviet gains (shown in blue) during Operation Little Saturn]]

On 16 December, the Soviets launched a second offensive, Operation Little Saturn, which attempted to punch through the Axis army on the Don and take [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]]. If successful, this offensive would have trapped the remainder of Army Group South, ⅓ of the entire German army in Russia, in the Caucasus. The Germans set up a &quot;mobile defense&quot; in which small units were to hold towns until supporting armor could arrive. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions—supported by at least 100 tanks—attacked the Italian Cosseria and Ravenna Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians resisted until 19 December, when ARMIR headquarters finally ordered the battered divisions to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=0275985059|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets never got close to Rostov, but the fighting forced von Manstein to extract Army Group A from the Caucasus and re-establish the frontline some {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the city. The [[Tatsinskaya Raid]] also caused significant losses to the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s transport fleet.

The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German reinforcement. The German troops in Stalingrad were not told this, however, and continued to believe that reinforcements were on their way. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler’s orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, as he abhorred the thought of disobeying orders. Also, while a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions.

The Germans were now not only starving, but running out of ammunition. Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called &quot;[[Hiwi (volunteer)|HiWis]]&quot;, Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody [[urban warfare]] began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. They fortified their positions in the factory districts and the Soviets encountered almost the same tooth-and-nail ferocity that they themselves displayed a month earlier. The Germans adopted a simple defense of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown. The Germans now had no usable tanks in the city. Those tanks which still functioned could at best be used as stationary cannons. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility. A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain [[Nikolay Dyatlenko]] and a trumpeter) carried an offer to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners allowed to keep their personal belongings, &quot;normal&quot; food rations, and repatriation to whatever country they wished to go to after the war; but Paulus—ordered not to surrender by Hitler—did not respond.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1995, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler promoted Paulus to ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]''. Since no [[List of German Field Marshals|German Field Marshal]] had ever been taken prisoner, Hitler assumed that Paulus would fight on or take his own life. However, when Soviet forces closed in on his headquarters in the ruined [[State Universal Store|GUM]] department store the next day, Paulus surrendered. The remnants of the Axis forces in Stalingrad surrendered on 2 February; 91,000 tired, ill, and starving prisoners were taken, including 3,000 Romanians, the survivors of the 20th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division and “Col. Voicu” Detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Pusca, Dragos; Nitu, Victor.

According to the German documentary film ''Stalingrad'', over 11,000 soldiers refused to lay down their arms at the official surrender, presumably believing that fighting to the death was better than a slow end in Soviet camps. They continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers, but by early March 1943, the remaining small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered. According to Soviet intelligence documents shown in the documentary, a remarkable NKVD report from March 1943 is available showing the tenacity of some of these German groups: &quot;The mopping-up of counter-revolutionary elements in the city of Stalingrad proceeded. The German-fascist bandits - who had hidden themselves in huts and trenches - offered armed resistance after combat actions had already ended. This armed resistance continued until 15 February and in a few areas until 20 February. Most of the armed groups were liquidated by March... During this period of armed conflict with the German-fascist bandits, the brigade's units killed 2.418 soldiers and officers and captured 8.646 soldiers and officers, escorting them to POW camps and handing them over&quot;. The operative report of the Don Front's staff issued on 5 February 1943, 22.00 says:
&quot;...2.The 64th Army was putting itself in order, being in previously occupied regions. Location of army's units is as it was previously.

Many others had the same idea and thousands implemented their plans.

Of more than 91,000 German prisoners captured in Stalingrad, only about 5,000 ever returned. Already weakened by disease, starvation and lack of medical care during the encirclement, they were sent to [[labour camp]]s all over the Soviet Union, where most of them died of disease (particularly [[typhus]]), cold, overwork, mistreatment and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help with rebuilding. In March 1943, 40,000 Germans were buried in a mass grave, victims of a typhus epidemic.&lt;ref name=Craig73/&gt;{{Rp|369|date=May 2009}} A handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the [[National Committee for a Free Germany]]. Some, including Paulus, signed anti-Hitler statements which were broadcast to German troops.

===Casualties===
Various scholars have estimated the Axis suffered from 500,000-850,000 casualties (killed, disabled, captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies, many of them POWs who died in Soviet captivity between 1943 and 1955. Of the 91,000 German POWs taken at Stalingrad, 27,000 died within weeks&lt;ref&gt;Rayfield 2004, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; and only 6,000 returned to Germany in 1955. The remainder of the POWs died in Soviet captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, J. W. 1969, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernig, Jorg, 1997, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to archival figures, the Red Army suffered a total of 1,129,619 total casualties;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.hrono.info/sobyt/1900sob/1942stal.html Сталинградская битва] {{ru icon}}. Retrieved 4 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 478,741 men killed or missing and 650,878 wounded. These numbers are for the whole Stalingrad Area; in the city itself 750,000 were killed, captured, or wounded. The Soviet authorities executed approximately 13,500 Soviet soldiers during the battle, equivalent to an entire division. Also, from 955 to 40,000 Soviet civilians died in Stalingrad and its suburbs during a single week of aerial bombing as the German 4th Panzer and 6th armies approached the city; the total number of civilians killed in the regions outside the city is unknown. In all, the battle resulted in an estimated total of 1.7-2 million Axis and Soviet casualties.

===Scope of the battle===
[[Image:stalingrad aftermath.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the Battle of Stalingrad]]

At different times, the Germans had held up to 90% of the city, yet the Soviet forces fought on fiercely. At the end of the battle, the Soviet armies had encircled and besieged the 6th Army. Some elements of the German 4th Panzer Army also suffered casualties in operations around Stalingrad during the Soviet counter-offensive.

German mobility had been a significant factor in the Wehrmacht's earlier victories. Before Stalingrad, the Soviets had been able to amass their forces in sufficient numbers to achieve victory only around Moscow. Stalingrad, which had limited military value and had already been stripped of its assets, could have been bypassed and invested by the 6th Army in its drive to the Caucasus with Army Group A. Instead, Hitler chose to sacrifice many of his most experienced troops in vicious street fighting among urban rubble, which favoured the defenders and gave the Soviet Union time to amass and concentrate its forces for its pincer movement. Some Germans felt Hitler had sacrificed one of his largest and finest armies for prestige. The 6th Army was reconstituted in time for the [[Battle of Kursk]], but was made up mostly of conscripts, and was never again the force it had once been.&lt;ref name=Craig73/&gt;{{Rp|386|date=May 2009}}

A significant factor in Germany's failure at Stalingrad was Hitler's pursuit of too many simultaneous objectives. To the South of Stalingrad, Army Group A was committed to capturing oilfields in the Caucasus and in particular at Baku in Azerbaijan. These oil fields were the original objective of the 1942 campaign, and he could have used Army Group A to bolster Army Group B's flanks around Stalingrad and perhaps to aid in fighting within the city. Clearly Hitler's ambitions were well beyond German means.&lt;ref name=walsh2000&gt;Walsh, Stephen. (2000). ''Stalingrad 1942–1943 The Infernal Cauldron''. London, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. ISBN 0-7432-0916-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being a turning point in the war, Stalingrad revealed the discipline and determination of both the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and the Soviet [[Soviet Army|Red Army]]. The Soviets first defended Stalingrad against a fierce German onslaught. So great were Soviet losses that at times, the [[life expectancy]] of a newly arrived soldier was less than a day, and the life expectancy of a Soviet officer was three days. Their sacrifice is immortalized by one of General [[Alexander Rodimtsev|Rodimtsev]]'s soldiers, about to die, who scratched on the wall of the main railway station—which changed hands 15 times during the battle—“Rodimtsev’s Guardsmen fought and died here for their Motherland.”

A significant historical debate concerns the degree of terror in the Red Army. The British historian [[Anthony Beevor]] noted the claim from the Stalingrad Front’s Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: “The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower” as an example of the sort of coercion that the Special Detachments (later to be renamed [[SMERSH]]) subjected the Red Army soldiers to.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor, Anthony pages 154-168&quot;&gt;Beevor, Anthony “Stalingrad and Researching the Experience of War” pp. 154-168 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to Verdun, and argued that such self-sacrifice cannot be explained by terror alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor, Anthony pages 154-168&quot;/&gt;

For the heroism of the Soviet defenders of Stalingrad, the city was awarded the title [[Hero City]] in 1945. Twenty-four years after the battle, in October 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Memorial Complex &quot;To the Heroes of the Stalingrad Battle&quot; at Mamayev Hill. [http://mamayevhill.volgadmin.ru/00_n.htm Official web site]. Retrieved 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; a colossal monument, [[The Motherland Calls|Mother Motherland]], was erected on [[Mamayev Kurgan]], the hill overlooking the city. The statue forms part of a [[War memorial]] complex which includes ruined walls deliberately left the way they were after the battle. The Grain Silo, as well as [[Pavlov's House]], the apartment building whose defenders eventually held out for two months until they were relieved, can still be visited. Even today one may find bones and rusty metal splinters on Mamayev Kurgan, symbols of both the human suffering during the battle and the successful yet costly resistance.

Many women fought on the Soviet side, or were under fire. At the beginning of the battle there were 75,000 women and girls from the Stalingrad area who had finished military or medical training, and all of whom were to serve in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Reina “Women and the Battle of Stalingrad” pp. 169-211 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 pp. 180-182&lt;/ref&gt; Women staffed a great many of the anti-aircraft batteries that fought not only the Luftwaffe but German tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Reina “Women and the Battle of Stalingrad” pp. 169-211 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet nurses not only treated wounded men under fire but were involved in the highly dangerous work of bringing wounded soldiers back to the hospitals under enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Reina “Women and the Battle of Stalingrad” pp. 169-211 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 pp. 189-192&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Soviet wireless and telephone operators were women who often suffered heavy casualties when their command posts came under fire.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Reina “Women and the Battle of Stalingrad” pp. 169-211 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 pp. 192-194&lt;/ref&gt; Though women were not usually trained as infantry, many Soviet women fought as machine gunners, mortar operators, and scouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennington, Reina pages 169-211&quot;&gt;Pennington, Reina “Women and the Battle of Stalingrad” pp. 169-211 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also snipers at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Reina “Women and the Battle of Stalingrad” pp. 169-211 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 pp. 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Three air regiments at Stalingrad were entirely female.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennington, Reina pages 169-211&quot;/&gt; At least three women won the title Hero of the Soviet Union while driving tanks at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Reina “Women and the Battle of Stalingrad” pp. 169-211 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 pp. 204-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Army showed remarkable discipline after being surrounded. It was the first time that it had operated under adverse conditions on such a scale. During the latter part of the siege, short of food and clothing, many German soldiers starved or froze to death. Yet, discipline was maintained until the very end, when resistance no longer served any useful purpose. Friedrich Paulus obeyed Hitler's orders, against many of Hitler's top generals' counsel and advice, including that of von Manstein, and did not attempt to break out of the city. German ammunition, supplies, and food became all too scarce.

Paulus knew that the airlift had failed and that Stalingrad was lost. He asked for permission to surrender to save the lives of his troops, but Hitler refused and instead promoted him to the rank of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]''. No German officer of this rank had ever surrendered, and the implication was clear: if Paulus surrendered, he would shame himself and would become the highest ranking German officer ever to be captured. Hitler believed that Paulus would either fight to the last man or commit suicide. Paulus surrendered, commenting, &quot;I have no intention of shooting myself for this Bohemian corporal&quot;. (Beevor, p.&amp;nbsp;381.)&lt;ref&gt;''Für so einen Schweinehund wie den böhmischen Gefreiten erschieße ich mich nicht!'' (engl: ''I am not going to shoot myself for such a swine as this Bohemian corporal!''), quoted in: &quot;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44435444.html Ich bitte erschossen zu werden]&quot;, ''Der Spiegel'', 01-29-1949&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
{{Main|Battle of Stalingrad in popular culture}}

The extreme conditions of the battle, including the paralyzing Soviet winter that precipitated massive German fatalities due to starvation and freezing, have been immortalized in several films of [[Stalingrad (film)|German]], Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4562967572164209056&amp;q=duration%3Along+is%3Afree+genre%3AMOVIE_FEATURE|title=The Great Battle on the Volga (1962)|publisher=Video.google.com |date=|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enemy at the Gates|British and American]] origin. The struggle is also remembered and reflected upon in numerous books, for its significance in thwarting the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]], as well as its significance as a landmark of military barbarism and human suffering in which the loss of life was unprecedented.

Stalingrad was the subject of an eponymous poem by the West Indian poet, Robert Blackman. His reading of the poem was published as the &quot;b side&quot; of [[Robert Wyatt]]'s Stalin Wasn't Stalling single in an effort to counter the Cold War's diminution of the Soviet Union's part in defeating Adolf Hitler during the Second World War.

|}'''Bodhidharma'''  ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:&lt;/small&gt;போதிதர்மன்) was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]] who lived during the 5th/6th century and is traditionally credited as the leading patriarch and transmitter of [[Zen]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''Chán'', [[Sanskrit]]: ''Dhyāna'') to [[China]]. According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the [[Shaolin]] monks that led to the creation of [[Shaolinquan]]. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th century [[qigong]] manual known as the ''[[Yijin Jing]]''.

Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree that he was a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] from [[South India|southern India's]] [[Pallava]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Dumoulin| first1 = Heinrich|last2 = Heisig| first2 = James|last3 = Knitter| first3 = Paul| title = Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China| publisher = World Wisdom, Inc| year = 2005| page = 86| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9CYeWYtYBS4C&amp;pg=PA86| isbn = 9780941532891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have concluded his place of birth to be [[Kanchipuram]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin |2005|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Addiss|2008|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Faure|1996|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hoover|1999|p=1(Chapter One)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|1988|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Chung|1998|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Jørgensen|2005|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming a Buddhist monk, Bodhidharma traveled to [[China]]. The accounts differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the [[Liu Song Dynasty|Liú Sòng Dynasty]] (420–479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the [[Liang Dynasty|Liáng Dynasty]] (502–557). Bodhidharma was primarily active in the lands of the [[Northern Wei|Northern Wèi Dynasty]] (386–534). Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume One), pages 57, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is described as &quot;The Blue-Eyed [[Barbarian]]&quot; in Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;Soothill and Hodous&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952) identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in an uninterrupted line that extends all the way back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself. [[D.T. Suzuki]] contends that Chán's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had &quot;no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism&quot; and that Chán historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Suzuki|1949|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{Buddhism and China}}

===Contemporary accounts===
There are two known extant accounts written by contemporaries of Bodhidharma.

====Yáng Xuànzhī====
[[Image:Bodhidharma, Porcelain, Ming Dynasty.JPG|thumb|200px|A [[Blanc de Chine|Dehua ware]] porcelain statuette of Bodhidharma, from the late [[Ming Dynasty]], 17th century]]

The ''Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of [[Luoyang]]'' (洛陽伽藍記 ''Luòyáng Qiélánjì''), was compiled in 547 by Yáng Xuànzhī 楊衒之, a writer and translator of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhist texts into the Chinese language.&lt;blockquote&gt;At that time there was a monk of the Western Region named Bodhidharma, a Persian Central Asian. He traveled from the wild borderlands to China. Seeing the golden disks [on the pole on top of Yǒngníng's [[stupa]]] reflecting in the sun, the rays of light illuminating the surface of the clouds, the jewel-bells on the stupa blowing in the wind, the echoes reverberating beyond the heavens, he sang its praises. He exclaimed: &quot;Truly this is the work of spirits.&quot; He said: &quot;I am 150 years old, and I have passed through numerous countries. There is virtually no country I have not visited. Even the distant Buddha-realms lack this.&quot; He chanted homage and placed his palms together in salutation for days on end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Harvcoltxt|Broughton|1999|p=55}} dates Bodhidharma's presence in Luoyang to between 516 and 526, when the temple referred to—Yǒngníngsì (永寧寺)—was at the height of its glory. Starting in 526, Yǒngníngsì suffered damage from a series of events, ultimately leading to its destruction in 534.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tánlín ====
The second account was written by Tánlín (曇林; 506–574). Tánlín's brief biography of the &quot;Dharma Master&quot; is found in his preface to the ''[[Two Entrances and Four Acts]]'', a text traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma, and the first text to identify Bodhidharma as [[South India#Demographics|South Indian]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Dharma Master was a South Indian of the Western Region. He was the third son of a great Indian king of the [[Pallava Dynasty]]. His ambition lay in the [[Mahayana]] path, and so he put aside his white layman's robe for the black robe of a monk [...] Lamenting the decline of the true teaching in the outlands, he subsequently crossed distant mountains and seas, traveling about propagating the teaching in Han and Wei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tánlín's account was the first to mention that Bodhidharma attracted disciples,&lt;ref name = &quot;bdbxvl&quot;&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically mentioning Dàoyù (道育) and [[Huike|Huìkě]] (慧可), the latter of whom would later figure very prominently in the Bodhidharma literature.

Tánlín has traditionally been considered a disciple of Bodhidharma, but it is more likely that he was a student of Huìkě, who in turn was a student of Bodhidharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later accounts===
====Dàoxuān====
In the 7th-century historical work ''Further Biographies of Eminent Monks'' (續高僧傳 ''Xù gāosēng zhuàn''), [[Dàoxuān]] (道宣; 596-667) possibly drew on Tanlin's preface as a basic source, but made several significant additions:[[Image:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This Japanese scroll calligraphy of '''Bodhidharma''' reads “Chán points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]”. It was created by [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (1685 to 1768)]]Firstly, Dàoxuān adds more detail concerning Bodhidharma's origins, writing that he was of &quot;[[South Indian Brahman]] stock&quot; (南天竺婆羅門種 ''nán tiānzhú póluómén zhŏng'').&lt;ref name=hd87&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, more detail is provided concerning Bodhidharma's journeys. Tanlin's original is imprecise about Bodhidharma's travels, saying only that he &quot;crossed distant mountains and seas&quot; before arriving in Wei. Dàoxuān's account, however, implies &quot;a specific itinerary&quot;:&lt;ref name=jlb56&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He first arrived at [[Nanyue|Nan-yüeh]] during the Sung period. From there he turned north and came to the Kingdom of Wei&quot;.&lt;ref name=hd87/&gt; This implies that Bodhidharma had travelled to China by sea, and that he had crossed over the [[Yangtze River]].

Thirdly, Dàoxuān suggests a date for Bodhidharma's arrival in China. He writes that Bodhidharma makes landfall in the time of the [[Liu Song Dynasty|Song]], thus making his arrival no later than the time of the Song's fall to the [[Southern Qi|Southern Qi Dynasty]] in 479.&lt;ref name=jlb56/&gt;

Finally, Dàoxuān provides information concerning Bodhidharma's death. Bodhidharma, he writes, died at the banks of the Luo River, where he was interred by his disciple [[Huike]], possibly in a cave. According to Dàoxuān's chronology, Bodhidharma's death must have occurred prior to 534, the date of the Northern Wei Dynasty's fall, because Huike subsequently leaves Luoyang for [[Ye]]. Furthermore, citing the shore of the Luo River as the place of death might possibly suggest that Bodhidharma died in [[Emperor Yuán Zǐyōu 元子攸, posthumous Xiàozhuāng 孝莊 of Northern Wei#The Heyin Massacre and aftermath|the mass executions at Heyin]] 河陰 in 528. Supporting this possibility is a report in the ''[[Chinese Buddhist canon|Taishō shinshū daizōkyō]]'' stating that a Buddhist monk was among the victims at Héyīn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epitaph for Fărú====
The idea of a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|patriarchal lineage]] in Chán dates back to the [[epitaph]] for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch Hóngrĕn (弘忍 601–674), which gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|1993|p=37]}} &lt;br&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cole|2009|pp=73–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yǒngjiā Xuánjué====
According to the ''Song of Enlightenment'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') by Yǒngjiā Xuánjué (665-713)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Chang | first=Chung-Yuan | title=Ch'an Buddhism: Logical and Illogical | journal=Philosophy East and West | volume=17 | year=1967 | pages=37–49 | url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew27057.htm | doi=10.2307/1397043 | jstor=1397043 | issue=1/4 | publisher=Philosophy East and West, Vol. 17, No. 1/4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—one of the chief disciples of [[Huìnéng]], sixth Patriarch of Chán—Bodhidharma was the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from [[Śākyamuni Buddha]] via his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]], and the first Patriarch of Chán:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mahakashyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;&lt;br&gt;The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;&lt;br&gt;And Bodhidharma became the First Father here&lt;br&gt;His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,&lt;br&gt;And by them many minds came to see the Light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Suzuki|1948|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The idea of a line of descent from Śākyamuni Buddha is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of the Chán school.

====''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall''====
In the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (祖堂集 ''Zǔtángjí'') of 952, the elements of the traditional Bodhidharma story are in place. Bodhidharma is said to have been a disciple of [[Prajnatara|Prajñātāra]],&lt;ref name=broughton2&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus establishing the latter as the 27th patriarch in India. After a three-year journey, Bodhidharma reaches China in 527&lt;ref name=broughton2/&gt; during the [[Liang Dynasty]] (as opposed to the Song period of the 5th century, as in Dàoxuān). The ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' includes Bodhidharma's encounter with [[Emperor Wu of Liang China|Emperor Wu]], which was first recorded around 758 in the appendix to a text by Shen-hui (神會), a disciple of Huineng.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=McRae | first=John R. | contribution=The Antecedents of Encounter Dialogue in Chinese Ch'an Buddhism | contribution-url=http://kr.buddhism.org/zen/koan/John_McRae.htm | editor-last=Heine | editor-first=Steven | editor2-last=Wright | editor2-first=Dale S. | title=The Kōan: Texts and Contexts in Zen Buddhism | publisher=Oxford University Press | publication-date=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, as opposed to Daoxuan's figure of &quot;over 150 years,&quot;&lt;ref name=dumoulin88&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' states that Bodhidharma died at the age of 150. He was then buried on Mount Xiong'er (熊耳山 ''Xióngĕr Shān'') to the west of Luoyang. However, three years after the burial, in the [[Pamir Mountains]], Sòngyún (宋雲)—an official of one of the later Wei kingdoms—encountered Bodhidharma, who claimed to be returning to India and was carrying a single sandal. Bodhidharma predicted the death of Songyun's ruler, a prediction which was borne out upon the latter's return. Bodhidharma's tomb was then opened, and only a single sandal was found inside.

Insofar as, according to the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'', Bodhidharma left the Liang court in 527 and relocated to [[Mount Song]] near Luoyang and the [[Shaolin Monastery]], where he &quot;[[faced]] a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time&quot;,&lt;ref name=Lin182&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Lin|1996|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; his date of death can have been no earlier than 536. Moreover, his encounter with the Wei official indicates a date of death no later than 554, three years before the fall of the [[Western Wei Dynasty|last Wei kingdom]].

====Dàoyuán====
Subsequent to the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'', the only dated addition to the biography of Bodhidharma is in the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (景德傳燈錄 ''Jĭngdé chuándēng lù'', published 1004 [[Common Era|CE]]), by Dàoyuán (道原), in which it is stated that Bodhidharma's original name had been Bodhitāra but was changed by his master Prajñātāra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern scholarship ===
==== Bodhidharma's origins ====
Though Dàoxuān wrote that Bodhidharma was &quot;of South Indian Brahman stock,&quot; {{Harvcoltxt|Broughton|1999|p=2}} notes that Bodhidharma's royal pedigree implies that he was of the [[Kshatriya]] warrior [[Indian caste system|caste]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Mahajan|1972|pp=705–707}} argued that the [[Pallava]] dynasty was a [[Tamilian]] dynasty and {{Harvcoltxt|Zvelebil|1987}} proposed that Bodhidharma was born a prince of the Pallava dynasty in their capital of [[Kanchipuram]]. 

Yáng Xuànzhī's eyewitness account identifies Bodhidharma as a [[Persian people|Persian]] (波斯國胡人 ''bō-sī guó hú rén'') from the [[Western Regions]] (西域 ''xī yù'', usually referring to [[Central Asia]]), and {{Harvcoltxt|Broughton|1999|p=54}} notes that an Iranian Buddhist monk making his way to North China via the Silk Road is more likely than that of a South Indian master making his way by sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=54}}: &quot;There is, however, nothing implausible about an early sixth-century Iranian Buddhist master who made his way to North China via the fabled Silk Road. This scenario is, in fact, more likely than a South Indian master who made his way by the sea route.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Broughton|1999|p=138}} also states that the language Yang uses in his description of Bodhidharma is specifically associated with &quot;Central Asia and particularly to peoples of Iranian extraction&quot; and that of &quot;an Iranian speaker who hailed from somewhere in Central Asia&quot;. However, {{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=54}} notes that Yáng may have actually been referring to another monk named Boddhidharma, not related to the historical founder of Chan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=54}}: {{quote|&quot;Of course Yang may have been referring to another Bodhidharma. His record mentions a Bodhidharma twice in passing. This minor player's role is merely to illustrate that even a Westerner could be astonished by the imposing stupas and monasteries of metropolitan Lo-yang.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bodhidharma's name ====
Bodhidharma was said to be originally named Bodhitara. His surname was Chadili. His [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyāna]] teacher, Prajnatara, is said to have renamed him Bodhidharma.&lt;ref name=&quot;karatehistory&quot;/&gt;

{{Harvcoltxt|Faure|1986}} notes that &quot;Bodhidharma’s name appears sometimes truncated as Bodhi, or more often as Dharma (Ta-mo). In the first case, it may be confused with another of his rivals, [[Bodhiruci]].&quot;

Tibetan sources give his name as &quot;Bodhidharmottāra&quot; or &quot;Dharmottara&quot;, that is, &quot;Highest teaching (dharma) of enlightenment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tibetan Buddhism. By Steven D. Goodman, Ronald M. Davidson. SUNY Press, 1992. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice and teaching==
===Meditation===
Tanlin, in the preface to ''Two Entrances and Four Acts'', and Daoxuan, in the ''Further Biographies of Eminent Monks'', mention a practice of Bodhidharma's termed &quot;wall-gazing&quot; (壁觀 ''bìguān''). Both Tanlin&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Broughton|1999|pp=9, 66}} translates 壁觀 as &quot;wall-examining&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and Daoxuan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T50/2060_016.htm ''Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō'', Vol. 50, No. 2060], p. 551c 06(02)&lt;/ref&gt; associate this &quot;wall-gazing&quot; with &quot;quieting [the] mind&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;bdbxvl&quot;/&gt; (安心 ''ān xīn''). Elsewhere, Daoxuan also states: &quot;The merits of Mahāyāna wall-gazing are the highest&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin96&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the first mentions in the historical record of what may be a type of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] being ascribed to Bodhidharma.
[[Image:Bodhidharma.and.Huike-Sesshu.Toyo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bodhidharma seated in meditation before a wall; ink painting by [[Sesshu Toyo|Sesshū]]]]
In the ''Two Entrances and Four Acts'', traditionally attributed to Bodhidharma, the term &quot;wall-gazing&quot; also appears:&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who turn from delusion back to reality, who ''meditate on walls'', the absence of self and other, the oneness of mortal and sage, and who remain unmoved even by scriptures are in complete and unspoken agreement with reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Red Pine|1989|p=3}}, emphasis added.&lt;br&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Broughton|1999|p=9}} offers a more literal rendering of the key phrase 凝住壁觀 (''níngzhù bìguān'') as &quot;[who] in a coagulated state abides in wall-examining&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Exactly what sort of practice Bodhidharma's &quot;wall-gazing&quot; was remains uncertain. Nearly all accounts have treated it either as an undefined variety of meditation, as Daoxuan and Dumoulin,&lt;ref name=Dumoulin96/&gt; or as a variety of seated meditation akin to the [[zazen]] (坐禪; Chinese: ''zuòchán'') that later became a defining characteristic of Chán; the latter interpretation is particularly common among those working from a Chán standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [[Keizan]], ''[http://www.wwzc.org/translations/denkoroku.htm Denkoroku]'';&lt;br&gt;Child, Simon, &quot;[http://www.westernchanfellowship.org/in-the-spirit-of-chan.html In the Spirit of Chan]&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt; There have also, however, been interpretations of &quot;wall-gazing&quot; as a non-meditative phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;''viz.'' {{Harvcoltxt|Broughton|1999|pp=67–68}}, where a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] interpretation of &quot;wall-gazing&quot; as being akin to [[Dzogchen]] is offered.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''===
The ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'', one of the [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna Buddhist]] [[Sutra|sūtras]], is a highly &quot;difficult and obscure&quot; text&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suzuki|1932|loc=[http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-intro.htm#preface Preface]}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose basic thrust is to emphasize &quot;the inner [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] that does away with all duality and is raised above all distinctions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kohn|1991|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the first and most important texts in the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], or &quot;[[Consciousness-only]]&quot;, school of Mahāyāna Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sutton|1991|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the recurrent emphases in the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' is a lack of reliance on words to effectively express reality:&lt;blockquote&gt;''If, Mahamati, you say that because of the reality of words the objects are, this talk lacks in sense. Words are not known in all the Buddha-lands; words, Mahamati, are an artificial creation. In some Buddha-lands ideas are indicated by looking steadily, in others by gestures, in still others by a frown, by the movement of the eyes, by laughing, by yawning, or by the clearing of the throat, or by recollection, or by trembling.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suzuki|1932|loc=XLII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the ineffectiveness of words, the sūtra instead stresses the importance of the &quot;self-realization&quot; that is &quot;attained by noble wisdom&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suzuki|1932|loc=XI(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occurs &quot;when one has an insight into reality as it is&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suzuki|1932|loc=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The truth is the state of self-realization and is beyond categories of discrimination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suzuki|1932|loc=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sūtra goes on to outline the ultimate effects of an experience of self-realization:&lt;blockquote&gt;[The [[Bodhisattva]]] will become thoroughly conversant with the noble truth of self-realization, will become a perfect master of his own mind, will conduct himself without effort, will be like a gem reflecting a variety of colours, will be able to assume the body of transformation, will be able to enter into the subtle minds of all beings, and, because of his firm belief in the truth of Mind-only, will, by gradually ascending the stages, become established in Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suzuki|1932|loc=VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One of the fundamental Chán texts attributed to Bodhidharma is a four-line stanza whose first two verses echo the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'''s disdain for words and whose second two verses stress the importance of the insight into reality achieved through &quot;self-realization&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;A special transmission outside the scriptures,&lt;br&gt;Not founded upon words and letters;&lt;br&gt;By pointing directly to [one's] mind&lt;br&gt;It lets one see into [one's own true] nature and [thus] attain Buddhahood.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin85&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The stanza, in fact, is not Bodhidharma's, but rather dates to the year 1108.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, there are earlier texts which explicitly associate Bodhidharma with the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''. Daoxuan, for example, in a late recension of his biography of Bodhidharma's successor [[Dazu Huike|Huike]], has the sūtra as a basic and important element of the teachings passed down by Bodhidharma:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the beginning Dhyana Master Bodhidharma took the four-roll ''Laṅkā Sūtra'', handed it over to Huike, and said: &quot;When I examine the land of China, it is clear that there is only this sutra. If you rely on it to practice, you will be able to cross over the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another early text, the ''Record of the Masters and Disciples of the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' (楞伽師資記 ''Léngqié shīzī jì'') of Jìngjué (淨覺; 683–750), also mentions Bodhidharma in relation to this text. Jingjue's account also makes explicit mention of &quot;sitting meditation&quot;, or zazen:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T85/2837_001.htm ''Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō'', Vol. 85, No. 2837], p. 1285b 17(05)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For all those who sat in meditation, Master Bodhi[dharma] also offered expositions of the main portions of the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', which are collected in a volume of twelve or thirteen pages,&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;volume&quot; referred to is the ''Two Entrances and Four Acts''.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] bearing the title of ''Teaching of [Bodhi-]Dharma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Chán is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra school&quot; (楞伽宗 ''Léngqié zōng'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
===In Southeast Asia===
According to [[Southeast Asia]]n folklore, Bodhidharma travelled from [[south India]] by sea to [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] for the purpose of spreading the [[Mahayana]] doctrine. From [[Palembang]], he went north into what are now [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]]. He travelled the region transmitting his knowledge of [[Buddhism]] and [[martial arts]]&lt;ref name=Tua&gt;{{Citation| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance Of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=9789834232801}}&lt;/ref&gt; before eventually entering [[China]] through [[Vietnam]]. Malay legend holds that Bodhidharma introduced preset forms to [[silat]].&lt;ref name=Tua/&gt;

===Encounter with Emperor Xiāo Yǎn 蕭衍===
The ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' tells us that in 527 during the [[Liang Dynasty]], Bodhidharma, the first Patriarch of Chán, visited the [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] (Emperor Xiāo Yǎn 蕭衍 (posthumous name Wǔdì 武帝) of Liáng 梁 China), a fervent patron of Buddhism. The emperor asked Bodhidharma, &quot;How much karmic merit have I earned for ordaining Buddhist monks, building monasteries, having sutras copied, and commissioning [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] images?&quot; Bodhidharma answered, &quot;None. Good deeds done with worldly intent bring good karma, but no merit.&quot; The emperor then asked Bodhidharma, &quot;So what is the highest meaning of noble truth?&quot; Bodhidharma answered, &quot;There is no noble truth, there is only void.&quot; The emperor then asked Bodhidharma, &quot;Then, who is standing before me?&quot; Bodhidharma answered, &quot;I know not, Your Majesty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Broughton|1999|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on, the emperor refused to listen to whatever Bodhidharma had to say. Although Bodhidharma came from [[India]] to [[China]] to become the first patriarch of [[China]], the emperor refused to recognize him. Bodhidharma knew that he would face difficulty in the near future, but had the emperor been able to leave the throne and yield it to someone else, he could have avoided his fate of starving to death. 

According to the teaching, Emperor Wu's past life was as a [[bhikshu]]. While he cultivated in the mountains, a monkey would always steal and eat the things he planted for food, as well as the fruit in the trees. One day, he was able to trap the monkey in a cave and blocked the entrance of the cave with rocks, hoping to teach the monkey a lesson. However, after two days, the bhikshu found that the monkey had died of starvation. 

Supposedly, that monkey was reincarnated into [[Hou Jing]] of the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]], who led his soldiers to attack [[Nanjing]]. After Nanjing was taken, the emperor was held in captivity in the palace and was not provided with any food, and was left to starve to death. Though Bodhidharma wanted to save him and brought forth a compassionate mind toward him, the emperor failed to recognize him, so there was nothing Bodhidharma could do. Thus, Bodhidharma had no choice but to leave Emperor Wu to die and went into meditation in a cave for nine years.

This encounter would later form the basis of the first [[Koan|kōan]] of the collection ''The [[Blue Cliff Record]]''. However that version of the story is somewhat different. In the Blue Cliff's telling of the story, there is no claim that Emperor Wu did not listen to Bodhidharma after the Emperor was unable to grasp the meaning. Instead, Bodhidharma left the presence of the Emperor once Bodhidharma saw that the Emperor was unable to understand. Then Bodhidharma went across the river to the kingdom of Wei. 

After Bodhidharma left, the Emperor asked the official in charge of the Imperial Annals about the encounter. The Official of the Annals then asked the Emperor if he still denied knowing who Bodhidharma was? When the Emperor said he didn't know, the Official said, &quot;This was the Great-being [[Guanyin]] (i.e., the Mahasattva [[Avalokiteśvara]]) transmitting the imprint of the Buddha's Heart-Mind.&quot; 

The Emperor regretted his having let Bodhidharma leave and was going to dispatch a messenger to go and beg Bodhidharma to return. The Official then said, &quot;Your Highness, do not say to send out a messenger to go fetch him. The people of the entire nation could go, and he still would not return.&quot;

===Nine years of wall-gazing===
Failing to make a favorable impression in Southern China, Bodhidharma is said to have traveled to [[Northern Wei Dynasty|the northern Chinese kingdom of Wei]] to the [[Shaolin Monastery]]. After either being refused entry to the temple or being ejected after a short time, he lived in a nearby cave, where he &quot;faced a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lin182/&gt;

The biographical tradition is littered with apocryphal tales about Bodhidharma's life and circumstances. In one version of the story, he is said to have fallen asleep seven years into his nine years of wall-gazing. Becoming angry with himself, he cut off his eyelids to prevent it from happening again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Maguire|2001|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, as his eyelids hit the floor the first [[tea plant]]s sprang up; and thereafter [[tea]] would provide a stimulant to help keep students of Chán awake during [[Zazen|meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Watts, Alan W. | title=The Way of Zen | publisher=Pelican books | year=1962 | location=Great Britain | pages=106 | isbn=0140205470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular account relates that Bodhidharma was admitted into the Shaolin temple after nine years in the cave and taught there for some time. However, other versions report that he &quot;passed away, seated upright&quot;;&lt;ref name=Lin182/&gt; or that he disappeared, leaving behind the ''[[Yi Jin Jing]]'';&lt;ref name=lby183&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Lin|1996|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that his legs atrophied after nine years of sitting,&lt;ref name=hd86&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why Japanese [[Daruma doll|Bodhidharma dolls]] have no legs.

===Bodhidharma at Shaolin===
{{See|Shaolin Monastery#Patron saint}}  
Some Chinese accounts describe Bodhidharma as being disturbed by the poor physical shape of the Shaolin monks, after which he instructed them in techniques to maintain their physical condition as well as teaching meditation. He is said to have taught a series of external exercises called the Eighteen Arhat Hands (''Shi-ba Lohan Shou''), and an internal practice called the Sinew Metamorphosis Classic.&lt;ref name=artofshaolin&gt;{{Citation

Copies and translations of the [[Yi Jin Jing]] survive to the modern day, though many modern historians believe it to be of much more recent origin.&lt;ref name=lby183/&gt;  The Xi Sui Jing has been lost.&lt;ref name=karatehistory&gt;{{Citation

While Bodhidharma was born into the warrior caste in India and thus certainly studied and must have been proficient in self-defense, it is unlikely that he contributed to the development of self-defense technique specifically within China. However, the legend of his education of the monks at Shaolin in techniques for physical conditioning would imply (if true) a substantial contribution to Shaolin knowledge that contributed later to their renown for fighting skill. 
However, both the attribution of Shaolin boxing to Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the ''Yi Jin Jing'' itself have been discredited by some historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Matsuda Ryuchi. This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his ''Zhongguo wushu shi'' as follows:
    
{{quote|As for the &quot;Yi Jin Jing&quot; (Muscle Change Classic), a spurious text attributed to Bodhidharma and included in the legend of his transmitting martial arts at the temple, it was written in the Ming dynasty, in 1624, by the Daoist priest Zining of Mt. Tiantai, and falsely attributed to Bodhidharma. Forged prefaces, attributed to the Tang general Li Jing and the Southern Song general Niu Gao were written. They say that, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years at Shaolin temple, he left behind an iron chest; when the monks opened this chest they found the two books &quot;Xi Sui Jing&quot; (Marrow Washing Classic) and &quot;Yi Jin Jing&quot; within. The first book was taken by his disciple Huike, and disappeared; as for the second, &quot;the monks selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Real. The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript.&quot; Based on this, Bodhidharma was claimed to be the ancestor of Shaolin martial arts. This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source.&lt;ref name=lby183/&gt;}} 
    
The oldest available copy was published in 1827&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Matsuda Ryuchi 松田隆智 | authorlink = Ryuchi Matsuda | title = Zhōngguó wǔshù shǐlüè 中國武術史略 | year = 1986 | publisher = Danqing tushu | location = Taipei 臺北 | language = Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624.&lt;ref name=lby183/&gt; Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only becomes widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel ''The Travels of Lao Ts'an'' in ''Illustrated Fiction Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Henning | first=Stanley | title=Ignorance, Legend and Taijiquan | journal=Journal of the Chenstyle Taijiquan Research Association of Hawaii | volume=2 | issue=3 | year=1994 | pages=1–7 | url=http://seinenkai.com/articles/henning/il&amp;t.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
In one legend, Bodhidharma refused to resume teaching until his would-be student, [[Dazu Huike]], who had kept vigil for weeks in the deep snow outside of the monastery, cut off his own left arm to demonstrate sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Maguire|2001|p=58}}&lt;br&gt;Dàoxuān records that Huìkě's arm was cut off by bandits {{Harvcol|Broughton|1999|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After death===
Three years after Bodhidharma's death, Ambassador Song Yun of northern Wei is said to have seen him walking while holding a shoe at the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir Heights]]. Song Yun asked Bodhidharma where he was going, to which Bodhidharma replied &quot;I am going home&quot;. When asked why he was holding his shoe, Bodhidharma answered &quot;You will know when you reach Shaolin monastery. Don't mention that you saw me or you will meet with disaster&quot;. After arriving at the palace, Song Yun told the emperor that he met Bodhidharma on the way. The emperor said Bodhidharma was already dead and buried, and had Song Yun arrested for lying. At the [[Shaolin Temple]], the monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead and had been buried in a hill behind the temple. The grave was exhumed and was found to contain a single shoe. The monks then said &quot;Master has gone back home&quot; and prostrated three times. &lt;blockquote&gt;For nine years he had remained and nobody knew him;&lt;br&gt;Carrying a shoe in hand he went home quietly, without ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Watts|1958|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The lineage of Bodhidharma and his disciples==
In the ''Two Entrances and Four Acts'' and the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'', Daoyu and Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma.
The ''Jǐngdé Records of the Transmission of the Lamp'' (Jǐngdé chuándēng lù 景德传灯录) of Dàoyuán 道原, presented to the emperor in 1004, gives Bodhidharma four disciples who, in increasing order of understanding, are Dàofū 道怤, who attains Bodhidharma's skin; the nun Dharani,&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Jǐngdé Records of the Transmission of the Lamp'', Dharani repeats the words said by the nun Yuanji in the ''Two Entrances and Four Acts'', possibly identifying the two with each other {{Harvcol|Broughton|1999|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who attains Bodhidharma's flesh; Dàoyù 道育, who attains Bodhidharma's bone; and Huìkě 慧可, who attains Bodhidharma's marrow.

Heng-Ching Shih &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/BuddhistNunsMonasticLife/the_committee_of_western_bhikshunis.html see: Advisors - Ven. Bhiksuni Heng-ching Shih, Professor of Philosophy at Taiwan National University (Gelongma ordination 1975 in San Francisco).]&lt;/ref&gt; states that according to the ''Jǐngdé chuándēng lù'' 景德传灯录 the first `bhikṣuni` mentioned in the Chán literature was a disciple of the First Patriarch of Chinese Chán Bodhidharma, known as Zōngzhǐ 宗旨 [early-mid 6th century]; Bodhidharma before returning to India after many years of teaching in China asked his disciples Dàofū, Bhikṣuni Zōngzhǐ, Dàoyù and Huìkě to relate their realization of the Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027135930/http://www.geocities.com/zennun12_8/chanwomen.html  WOMEN IN ZEN BUDDHISM: Chinese Bhiksunis in the Chàn Tradition] by Heng-Ching Shih&lt;/ref&gt; 
Zōngzhǐ is also known by her title Soji, and by Myoren, her nun name.
In the Shōbōgenzō 正法眼蔵 chapter called Katto (&quot;Twining Vines&quot;) by Dōgen Zenji 道元禅師 (1200–1253), she is named as one of Bodhidharma's four Dharma heirs. Although the First Patriarch's line continued through another of the four, Dogen emphasizes that each of them had a complete understanding of the teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027135930/http://www.geocities.com/zennun12_8/chanwomen.html  some information]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Records of different authors gave a variation of transmission lines.

According to the Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks (Xù gāosēng zhuàn 續高僧傳) of Dàoxuān 道宣 (596-667) the transmission line runs as follows:

* Bodhidharma
** [[Huìkě]] 慧可 (487? - 593)
*** [[Sēngcàn]] 僧璨 (d.606)
**** [[Dàoxìn]] 道信 (580 - 651)
***** [[Hóngrěn]] 弘忍 (601 - 674)

In [[mathematical logic]], '''biconditional introduction''' is the [[rule of inference]] that, if B follows from A, and A follows from B, then A [[if and only if]] B.

For example, from the statements &quot;if I'm breathing, then I'm alive&quot; and &quot;if I'm alive, then I'm breathing&quot;, it can be inferred that &quot;I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive&quot;.

Formally, biconditional introduction is the rule schema.

:&lt;math&gt; A \to B \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \underline{B \to A} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A \leftrightarrow B &lt;/math&gt;

'''Biconditional elimination''' allows one to infer a [[Material conditional|conditional]] from a biconditional: if ( A ↔ B ) is true, then one may infer either direction of the biconditional, ( A → B ) and ( B → A ).

For example, if it's true that I'm breathing [[if and only if]] I'm alive, then it's true that if I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's true that if I'm alive, I'm breathing.

Formally:

  &lt;u&gt;( A ↔ B )&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;
  ∴ ( A → B )

also

  &lt;u&gt;( A ↔ B )&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;
  ∴ ( B → A )

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], two [[nucleotide]]s on opposite [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] strands that are connected via [[hydrogen bond]]s are called a '''base pair''' (often abbreviated bp). In the canonical Watson-Crick DNA base pairing, [[adenine]] ('''A''') forms a base pair with [[thymine]] ('''T''') and [[guanine]] ('''G''') forms a base pair with [[cytosine]] ('''C'''). In RNA, thymine is replaced by [[uracil]] ('''U'''). Alternate hydrogen bonding patterns, such as the [[wobble base pair]] and [[Hoogsteen base pair]], also occur&amp;mdash;in particular, in RNA&amp;mdash;giving rise to complex and functional [[nucleic acid tertiary structure|tertiary structures]].  It is important to note that pairing is the mechanism by which [[codon]]s on [[messenger RNA]] molecules are recognized by [[anticodon]]s on [[transfer RNA]] during protein [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. Some DNA- or RNA-binding enzymes can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.

The size of an individual [[gene]] or an organism's entire [[genome]] is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of [[telomere]]s). The [[haploid]] [[human genome]] (23 [[chromosomes]]) is estimated to be about 3 billion base pairs long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHSGC2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | title = [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7011/full/nature03001.html Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome] | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011 | pages = 931–45 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15496913 | doi = 10.1038/nature03001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A kilobase (kb) is a unit of measurement in [[molecular biology]] equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA or RNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSN-4C8GBDB-4Y/2/0c09db014fb73f4a8e0f3b5af596da01 Andrew F. Cockburn, Mary Jane Newkirk, Richard A. Firtel, Cell, Volume 9, Issue 4, Part 1, December 1976, Pages 605-613, ISSN 0092-8674, DOI: 10.1016/0092-8674(76)90043-X.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen bonding and stability==

[[Image:GC base pair jypx3.png|thumb|280px|A GC base pair demonstrating three intermolecular [[hydrogen bond]]s
]]
[[Image:AT base pair jypx3.png|thumb|280px|An AT base pair demonstrating two intermolecular [[hydrogen bond]]s]]

[[Hydrogen bond]]ing is the chemical interaction that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the &quot;right&quot; pairs to form stably. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low [[GC-content]], but, contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly, and stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions.&lt;ref name =&quot;Yakovchuk2006&quot;&gt;Peter Yakovchuk, Ekaterina Protozanova and Maxim D. Frank-Kamenetskii. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkj454 Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix]. Nucleic Acids Research 2006 34(2):564-574.&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger [[nucleobase]]s, adenine and guanine, are members of a class of double-ringed chemical structures called [[purine]]s; the smaller nucleobases, cytosine and thymine (and uracil), are members of a class of single-ringed chemical structures called [[pyrimidine]]s. Purines are complementary only with pyrimidines: pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too far apart for hydrogen bonding to be established; purine-purine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too close, leading to overlap repulsion. The only other possible pairings are GT and AC; these pairings are mismatches because the pattern of hydrogen donors and acceptors do not correspond. The GU pairing, with two hydrogen bonds, does occur fairly often in [[RNA]] (see [[wobble base pair]]).

Paired DNA and RNA molecules are comparatively stable at room temperature but the two nucleotide strands will separate above a [[Dna melting|melting point]] that is determined by the length of the molecules, the extent of mispairing (if any), and the GC content. Higher GC content results in higher melting temperatures; it is, therefore, unsurprising that the genomes of [[extremophile]] organisms such as ''[[Thermus thermophilus]]'' are particularly GC-rich. On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently — for example, the promoter regions for often-[[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] genes — are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see [[TATA box]]). GC content and melting temperature must also be taken into account when designing  [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for [[PCR]] reactions.

==Base stacking==

Base [[stacking (chemistry)|stacking]] interactions in DNA and RNA are due to dispersion attraction, short-range exchange repulsion, and electrostatic interactions, which also contribute to stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jiří Šponer,  Jerzy Leszczyński, and Pavel Hobza | title = Nature of Nucleic Acid−Base Stacking: Nonempirical ab Initio and Empirical Potential Characterization of 10 Stacked Base Dimers. Comparison of Stacked and H-Bonded Base Pairs | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry | volume = 100 | issue = 13 | pages = 5590–5596 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1021/jp953306e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, GC stacking interactions with adjacent bases tend to be more favorable. (Note, however, that a GC stacking interaction with the next base pair is geometrically different from a CG interaction.) Base stacking effects are especially important in the secondary structure and [[RNA Tertiary Structure|tertiary structure]] of RNA; for example, RNA [[stem-loop]] structures are stabilized by base stacking in the loop region.

==Base analogs and intercalators==

{{Main|Nucleic acid analogues}}
Chemical analogs of nucleotides can take the place of proper nucleotides and establish non-canonical base-pairing, leading to errors (mostly [[point mutation]]s) in [[DNA replication]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|DNA transcription]]. This is due to their isosteric chemistry. One common mutagenic base analog is [[5-bromouracil]], which resembles thymine but can base-pair to guanine in its [[enol]] form.

Other chemicals, known as [[DNA intercalation|DNA intercalators]], fit into the gap between adjacent bases on a single strand and induce [[frameshift mutation]]s by &quot;masquerading&quot; as a base, causing the DNA replication machinery to skip or insert additional nucleotides at the intercalated site. Most intercalators are large [[aromatic|polyaromatic]] compounds and are known or suspected [[carcinogen]]s. Examples include [[ethidium bromide]] and [[acridine]].

==Examples==
The following DNA sequences illustrate pair double-stranded patterns. By convention, the top strand is written from the [[5' end]] to the [[3' end]]; thus, the bottom strand is written 3' to 5'.

: A base-paired DNA sequence:
 ATCGATTGAGCTCTAGCG
 TAGCTAACTCGAGATCGC
: The corresponding RNA sequence, in which [[uracil]] is substituted for thymine where uracil takes its place in the RNA strand:
 AUCGAUUGAGCUCUAGCG
 UAGCUAACUCGAGAUCGC

===Length measurements===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[KB]] --&gt;
The following abbreviations are commonly used to describe the length of a D/R[[DNA|NA molecule]]:
* bp  = base pair(s)—one bp corresponds to circa 3.4 [[Angstrom|Å]] of length along the strand
* kb (= kbp) = kilo base pairs = 1,000 bp
* Mb = mega base pairs = 1,000,000 bp
* Gb = giga base pairs = 1,000,000,000 bp.

In case of single stranded DNA/RNA units of [[nucleotide]]s are used, abbreviated nt (or knt, Mnt, Gnt), as they are not paired.
For distinction between units of [[computer storage]] and bases kbp, Mbp, Gbp, etc. may be used for basepairs. The length of 16S rDNA for bacteria is 1542 base-pairs in length.

The [[Centimorgan]] is also often used to imply distance along a chromosome, but the number of base-pairs it corresponds to varies widely. In the Human genome, it is about 1 million base pairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Glossary.aspx?acronym=False#C NIH ORDR - Glossary - C]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew P Scott, Paul Matsudaira, Harvey Lodish, James Darnell, Lawrence Zipursky, Chris A Kaiser, Arnold Berk, Monty Krieger |title=Molecular Cell Biology, Fifth Edition |publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2004 |pages=396 |isbn=0-7167-4366-3 |oclc= |doi= |quote=&quot;...in humans 1 centimorgan on average represents a distance of about 7.5x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; base pairs.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baltimore Ravens''' are a professional [[American football]] [[professional sports league organization|franchise]] based in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. They are currently members of the [[AFC North|North Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team's name is a reference to the poem &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot; by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who lived and worked in Baltimore at various points during his life and is [[Death of Edgar Allan Poe|buried in the city]].

The Baltimore Ravens are officially a quasi-expansion franchise, having originated in 1995 with the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]] after [[Art Modell]], then owner of the [[Cleveland Browns]], announced his intention to relocate the team to Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2010-jan-the-jaguars-nfl-relocations-and-the-la-stadium-plan &quot;The Jaguars - NFL Relocations and the LA Stadium Plan,&quot; Metro Jacksonville, Friday, January 29, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Modell's team was named the &quot;Baltimore Ravens&quot; after a fan contest and began play in the 1996 season.

The Ravens' triumph over the [[New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XXXV]] at the conclusion of the [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|2000 season]] remains their best season. The Ravens are currently one of only four teams to win in their lone Super Bowl appearance, along with the [[New Orleans Saints]], [[New York Jets]], and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].

==History==
{{details3|[[History of the Baltimore Ravens]] and [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]]}}

===1995&amp;ndash;1999===
The Baltimore Ravens came into existence in 1995 when [[Art Modell]], then owner of the [[Cleveland Browns]], announced his intention to relocate his team from [[Cleveland]] to [[Baltimore]]. The resulting [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|controversy]] ended when representatives of Cleveland and the NFL reached a settlement on February 8, 1996. The agreement stipulated that the Browns' name, colors, uniform design and franchise records would remain in Cleveland. The franchise history included Browns club records and connections with [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] players. A new team to begin play in 1999 would be regarded as the &quot;reactivated&quot; Cleveland Browns. Modell's Baltimore team, while retaining all current player contracts, would officially be the [[expansion team]], a &quot;new franchise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Jon. [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-modell020996,1,1050941.story Deal clears NFL path to Baltimore], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', February 9, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all players, staff or front office would make the move to Baltimore, however.

After relocation Modell hired Ted Marchibroda as the head coach for his new team in Baltimore. Marchibroda was already well known because of his work as head coach of the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] during the 1970s and the [[Indianapolis Colts]] during the early 1990s. [[Ozzie Newsome]], the Browns' tight end for many seasons, joined Modell in Baltimore as director of football operations. He was later promoted to Vice President/General Manager.

The home stadium for the Ravens first two seasons was Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], home field of the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] years before. The Ravens moved to their own new stadium at Camden Yards in 1998. Raven Stadium would subsequently wear the names [[PSINet|PSI Net]] Stadium and then [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]].

In the [[1996 NFL Draft]], the Ravens, with two picks in the first round, drafted offensive tackle [[Jonathan Ogden]] at #4 overall and linebacker [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] at #26 overall. Both players would go on to have [[Hall of Fame]]-caliber careers for the Ravens.

The 1996 Ravens won their opening game against the [[Oakland Raiders]]. However, they would not keep this momentum for long, and they finished 4-12 despite receiver Michael Jackson leading the league with 14 touchdown catches.

The 1997 Ravens started 3&amp;ndash;1. [[Peter Boulware]], a rookie defender from [[Florida State University|Florida State]], recorded 11.5 sacks and was named AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. The team finished 6&amp;ndash;9&amp;ndash;1. On October 26, the team made its first trip to [[Landover, Maryland]] to play their new [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|regional rivals]], the [[Washington Redskins]], for the first time in the regular season, at the new [[FedEx Field|Jack Kent Cooke Stadium]] (replacing the still-standing [[RFK Stadium]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]). The Ravens won the game 20-17.

Quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] left for the [[New York Jets]] before the 1998 season, and was replaced by former Indianapolis Colt [[Jim Harbaugh]], and later [[Eric Zeier]]. Cornerback [[Rod Woodson]] joined the team after a successful stint with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Priest Holmes]] started getting the first playing time of his career and ran for 1,000 yards. The Ravens finished 1998 with a 6&amp;ndash;10 record. On November 29, the Ravens welcomed the Colts back to Baltimore for the first time in 15 years. Amidst a shower of negative cheers towards the Colts, the Ravens won 38-31.

Three consecutive losing seasons under Marchibroda led to a change in the head coach. [[Brian Billick]] took over as head coach in 1999. Billick, a self described offensive genius, had been offensive coordinator for the record-setting [[Minnesota Vikings]] the season before. Quarterback [[Tony Banks (quarterback)|Tony Banks]] came to Baltimore from the [[St. Louis Rams]] and had the best season of his career with 17 touchdown passes and an 81.2 [[pass rating]]. He was joined by receiver [[Qadry Ismail]], who posted a 1,000-yard season. The Ravens initially struggled with a record of 4-7 but managed to finish with an 8&amp;ndash;8 record.

Due to continual financial hardships, the NFL directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to [[Steve Bisciotti]]. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club.

===2000 season — Super Bowl champions===

The 2000 season saw the Ravens defense, led by defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]], develop into a rock-solid unit that emerged as one of the most formidable defenses in NFL history. The Ravens defense set a new NFL record in holding opposing teams to 165 total points; the feat eclipsed the mark set previously by the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1986 Chicago Bears]] of 187 points for a 16 game season. Linebacker [[Ray Lewis]] was named Defensive Player of the year and, with two of his defensive teammates, [[Sam Adams (football player)|Sam Adams]] and [[Rod Woodson]], made the [[Pro Bowl]].  

Baltimore's season started strong with a 5-1 record. Tony Banks began the 2000 season as the starting quarterback and was replaced by [[Trent Dilfer]] when the Ravens fell to 5-4. Coach [[Brian Billick]] announced that the change at quarterback would be for the rest of the season. The 1,364-yard rushing season by rookie running back [[Jamal Lewis]] combined with the stout Ravens defense kept Baltimore competitive in games even when the offense struggled. At one point in the season the team played five consecutive games without scoring an offensive touchdown but still managed 2 wins during that stretch. The team regrouped and won each of their last seven games, finishing 12&amp;ndash;4. The Ravens had made the playoffs for the first time.

Since the divisional rival [[Tennessee Titans]] had a record of 13&amp;ndash;3, Baltimore had to play in the wild card round. In their first ever playoff game, they dominated the [[Denver Broncos]] 21&amp;ndash;3 in front of a then record-crowd of 69,638 at then called [[PSINet]] Stadium. In the divisional playoffs, they went on the road to Tennessee. Tied 10&amp;ndash;10 in the fourth quarter, an [[Al Del Greco]] field goal attempt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by [[Anthony Mitchell (American football)|Anthony Mitchell]], and a Ray Lewis interception return for a score put the game squarely in Baltimore's favor. The 24&amp;ndash;10 win put the Ravens in the AFC Championship against the [[Oakland Raiders]]. [[Shannon Sharpe]]'s 96-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter, followed by an injury to Raiders quarterback [[Rich Gannon]],  highlighted the Ravens' 16&amp;ndash;3 victory.

Baltimore then went to Tampa for [[Super Bowl XXXV]] against the [[New York Giants]], cruising to a 34&amp;ndash;7 win for their first championship in franchise history. The Ravens recorded four sacks, forced five turnovers, one of which was a [[Kerry Collins]] interception returned for a touchdown by [[Duane Starks]]. The Giants' only score was a [[Ron Dixon]] kickoff return for another touchdown (after Starks' interception return); however, Baltimore immediately countered with a TD return by [[Jermaine Lewis]]. The Ravens became only the third wild card team (and fourth non-division champion) to win a Super Bowl championship. The interception return for a touchdown, followed by two kick return TDs, marked the quickest time in Super Bowl history that three touchdowns had been scored. 

The title made the Ravens the fourth Baltimore-based pro football team to win a league championship. They were preceded by the [[National Football League|NFL]] [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] in [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958]], [[1959 NFL season|1959]] and [[Super Bowl V|1970]], the [[United States Football League|USFL]] [[Baltimore Stars|Stars]] in [[1985 USFL season|1985]] and the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] [[Baltimore Stallions|Stallions]] in [[83rd Grey Cup|1995]].

===2001&amp;ndash;2002===
In 2001, the Ravens attempted to defend its title with [[Elvis Grbac]] as its new starting quarterback, but a season-ending injury to [[Jamal Lewis]] on the first day of training camp and poor offensive performances stymied the team. After a 3&amp;ndash;3 start, the Ravens defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the final week to clinch a wild card berth at 10&amp;ndash;6. In the first round the Ravens showed flashes of their previous year with a 20&amp;ndash;3 blowout over the [[Miami Dolphins]], in which the team forced three turnovers and outgained the Dolphins 347 yards to 151. In the divisional playoff the Ravens played the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Three interceptions by Grbac ended the Ravens' season, as they lost 27&amp;ndash;10.
Baltimore ran into [[salary cap]] problems entering the 2002 season and was forced to part with a number of impact players. The Ravens stayed somewhat competitive, until a losing streak in December eliminated any chances of a post-season berth.

===2003 draft===
The Ravens needed a quarterback but, drafting after all the top quarterbacks were gone, used their 10th pick to select [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]] defensive end [[Terrell Suggs]]. They then traded their 2003 2nd round pick and 2004 1st round pick to the [[New England Patriots]] for the 19th overall selection which they used to draft [[University of California|Cal]] quarterback [[Kyle Boller]]. The Patriots eventually used the Ravens' 2004 1st round selection to take defensive tackle [[Vince Wilfork]].

===2003&amp;ndash;2005===
After the 2003 season, Art Modell officially transferred his remaining 51% ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 years of tenure as an NFL franchise owner. Modell still has an office at the Ravens' headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland, and acts as a consultant.

The Ravens named Boller their starting QB just prior to the start of the 2003 season, but he was injured midway through the season and was replaced by [[Anthony Wright (quarterback)|Anthony Wright]]. Jamal Lewis ran for 2,066 yards (including 295 yards in one game against the Cleveland Browns on September 14). The Ravens held a 5&amp;ndash;5 record until, in a home game against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], they wiped out a 41&amp;ndash;24 gap in the final seven minutes of regulation, then won on a [[Matt Stover]] field goal in overtime for a 44&amp;ndash;41 triumph. From there the Ravens won five of their last six games. With a 10&amp;ndash;6 record, Baltimore won their first AFC North division title. Their first playoff game, at home against the Tennessee Titans, went back and forth, with the Ravens being held to only 54 yards total rushing. The Titans won 20-17 on a late field goal, and Baltimore's season ended early. Ray Lewis was named [[Defensive Player of the Year]] for the second time in his career.

The Ravens did not make the playoffs in 2004 and finished the season with a record of 9-7 with Kyle Boller finishing the season at QB.

In the 2005 offseason the Ravens looked to augment their receiving corps (which was second-worst in the NFL in 2004) by signing [[Derrick Mason]] from the Titans and drafting star Oklahoma wide receiver [[Mark J. Clayton|Mark Clayton]] in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. However, the Ravens ended their season 6-10.

===2006 season===
{{main|2006 Baltimore Ravens season}}

The 2006 Baltimore Ravens season began with the team trying to improve on their 6&amp;ndash;10 record of 2005. The Ravens, for the first time in franchise history, started 4&amp;ndash;0, under the leadership of former Titans quarterback [[Steve McNair]].

The Ravens lost 2 straight games mid-season on offensive troubles, prompting coach Brian Billick to drop their offensive coordinator [[Jim Fassel]] in their week 7 bye. After the bye, and with Billick calling the offense, Baltimore would record a five-game win streak before losing to the Bengals in week 13.

Still ranked second overall to first-place [[San Diego Chargers|San Diego]], The Ravens continued on. They defeated the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]], and held the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers to only one touchdown at Heinz Field, allowing the Ravens to clinch the AFC North.

The Ravens ended the regular season with a franchise-best 13&amp;ndash;3 record. Baltimore had secured the AFC North title, the #2 AFC playoff seed, and clinched a 1st-round bye by season's end. The Ravens were slated to face the Indianapolis Colts in the second round of the playoffs, in the first meeting of the two teams in the playoffs. Many Baltimore and Indianapolis fans saw this historic meeting as a sort of &quot;Judgment Day&quot; with the new team of Baltimore facing the old team of Baltimore (the former Baltimore Colts having left Baltimore under questionable circumstances in 1984). In one of the most bizarre playoff games in NFL history, both Indianapolis and Baltimore were held to scoring only field goals as the two defenses slugged it out all over M&amp;T Bank Stadium. McNair threw two costly interceptions, including one at the 1-yard line. The eventual Super-Bowl-Champion Colts won 15-6, ending Baltimore's season.

===2007 season===
{{main|2007 Baltimore Ravens season}}

After a stellar 2006 season, the Ravens hoped to improve upon its 13-3 record but injuries and poor play plagued the team which finished the 2007 season in the AFC North cellar with a disappointing 5-11 record. A humiliating 22-16 overtime loss to the previously winless [[Miami Dolphins]] on December 16 ultimately led to Billick's dismissal on New Year's Eve, one day after the end of the regular season.

===2008 season===
{{main|2008 Baltimore Ravens season }}

With rookies at head coach ([[John Harbaugh]]) and quarterback ([[Joe Flacco]]), the Ravens entered the 2008 campaign with lots of uncertainty. Its Week 2 contest at the [[Houston Texans]] was postponed until two months later because of [[Hurricane Ike]], forcing the Ravens to play for what would eventually be eighteen straight weeks. With its record at 2&amp;ndash;3 after consecutive losses to Pittsburgh, Tennessee and Indianapolis, its triumph over the Dolphins in Week 7 was redemption for what had happened against the same opponent in the previous season. Eight victories in its last ten regular season matches enabled them to clinch the sixth seed in the AFC playoffs. The biggest win during that stretch came in Week 16 with a 33&amp;ndash;24 humbling of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the final game at [[Texas Stadium]]. [[Willis McGahee]]'s 77-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter established a new stadium record which would last until [[Le'Ron McClain]], on the very first offensive play of the Ravens' next possession, secured the victory with an 82-yarder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2008122000/2008/REG16/ravens@cowboys NFL Game Center: Baltimore Ravens at Dallas Cowboys &amp;ndash; 2008 Week 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the strength of four interceptions, one resulting in an [[Ed Reed]] touchdown, the Ravens began its postseason run by winning a rematch over Miami 27&amp;ndash;9 at [[Dolphin Stadium]] on January 4, 2009 in a wildcard game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290104015&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines &quot;Pennington throws four interceptions in loss,&quot; ''The Associated Press'', Sunday, January 4, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, they advanced to the [[AFC Championship Game]] by avenging a Week 5 loss to the Titans 13&amp;ndash;10 at [[LP Field]] on a [[Matt Stover]] field goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290110010&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines &quot;Stover's FG with 53 seconds left boots Ravens into AFC Championship Game,&quot; ''The Associated Press'', Saturday, January 10, 2009.] During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The Steelers lead the series (begun in 1996), 16–10. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses in their division. The Steelers-Ravens Rivalry really began when Art Modell moved the his Franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore. &quot;The Steelers saw the Ravens as Modell's team, which was reason enough to want to beat them. The Steelers also looked at Modell's move of his franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore as taking away the Steelers longest and deepest rivalry.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; The Ravens fell one victory short of Super Bowl XLIII by losing to the Steelers 23&amp;ndash;14 at [[Heinz Field]] on January 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290118023 &quot;Polamalu's INT return secures Steelers' Super Bowl berth,&quot; ''The Associated Press'', Sunday, January 18, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 season===
{{main|2009 Baltimore Ravens season }}

With Jonathan Ogden retiring after the 2007 season and Matt Stover going into free agency, Baltimore's only remaining player from its first season was [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]]. The Ravens held the 26th pick in the [[2009 NFL draft]] but went up to the 23rd pick by trading its 26th pick and a 5th round pick to the [[New England Patriots]]. The Ravens selected [[Michael Oher]] (who later had a movie named [[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]] made after his life during his early years) in the first round of the [[NFL Draft]].

In the season opener, the offense continued its improvements from the year before as it scored 38 points and accounted for over 500 yards in a 38-24 victory over the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. In week 2, the Ravens defeated the [[San Diego Chargers]] 31-26. Although the Ravens secondary struggled, Ray Lewis made a crucial tackle on fourth down of the Chargers' final drive to seal the Baltimore win. In week 3, the Ravens defeated the [[Cleveland Browns]] in a 34-3 blowout while celebrating Derrick Mason's 800th pass reception in his career. 

In week 4, the Ravens lost in heartbreak fashion to the [[New England Patriots]], 27-21, with their final drive ending with a dropped pass by Mark Clayton on 4th down within the 10 yard line with 28 seconds left on the clock. The following week, the Ravens hosted the Cincinnati Bengals, but lost with the Bengals' final drive resulting in a touchdown. The Ravens then played an away game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and suffered another heartbreaking loss, 33-31, putting them behind both the Bengals and the Steelers in the AFC North. The Ravens had rallied from 17 points down to the Vikings and managed to drive the ball down the field, but [[Steve Hauschka]] missed a 44 yard field goal as time expired on the clock. Joe Flacco made 28 out of 43 passing attempts and threw for a career high 385 yards, and Ray Rice ran for 117 yards. The very next week they hosted the [[Denver Broncos]], who were undefeated (6-0). After Hauschka kicked a pair of field goals in the 1st and 2nd quarters, the Broncos kicked off at the start of the 3rd quarter and the Ravens immediately returned it for a touchdown, giving the Ravens a 13-0 lead. They finished the game victorious, crushing the Broncos 30-7, handing Denver its first loss of the season. 
The following week, they looked to avenge the week 5 loss to the Bengals. However, they were out-played on both sides of the ball, suffered a crucial miss by Hauschka, and lost 17-7. 

In week 10, the Ravens visited the Cleveland Browns on [[ESPN Monday Night Football]] and shut out their divisional rivals 16-0 despite a slow offensive start. Ravens kicker [[Steve Hauschka]] missed a field goal and had an extra point blocked, costing the Ravens 4 points. This led coach [[John Harbaugh]] to release Hauschka and replace him with [[Billy Cundiff]]. 
In week 11, the Ravens played their third undefeated opponent, the [[Indianapolis Colts]], who were (9-0). They lost 17-15, failing to score a single touchdown. Cundiff went 5 for 6 on field goals, scoring the Ravens only points. Joe Flacco threw a late interception and after Ed Reed's fumbled attempt to lateral on a punt return, [[Peyton Manning]] kneeled to seal the Colts' seventh consecutive victory against Baltimore. With this loss, the Ravens record stood at 5-5, ranking third in the AFC North. 
The Ravens then beat the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], who were playing without quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] with an overtime field goal on [[Sunday Night Football]]. The next week, however, the Ravens lost to the [[Green Bay Packers]] on [[ESPN Monday Night Football]]. 

The Ravens then crushed two opponents from the [[NFC North]] at home, beating the [[Detroit Lions]] 48-3 and the [[Chicago Bears]] 31-7. The Ravens improved to 8-6, second in the [[AFC North]], and in line for the fifth seed. They looked ahead to their division rivals, the Steelers, who were coming off a dramatic last-second win against the Packers. A win would give the Ravens a chance to clinch a playoff spot and would knock the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] out of contention. But the Ravens, who committed 11 penalties and blew several chances to put additional points on the board, lost 23-20. The Ravens still had a shot at the playoffs with a week 17 victory, and made it defeating the [[Oakland Raiders]] 21-13. 

In the playoffs, they faced the [[New England Patriots]] in the wild card round. The Ravens beat the Patriots 33-14, aided by Ray Rice's 83-yard touchdown run on the first play from scrimmage, helping them to a 24-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. Advancing to the AFC Divisional Round, they next played the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. Two touchdowns late in the first half gave the Colts a 17-3 lead at halftime, and Baltimore miscues in the second half ensured the end of their season, by a 20-3 score.

===2010 season===
{{main|2010 Baltimore Ravens season }}

During the 2009-2010 offseason, the Ravens made some key additions to their offense by acquiring WR [[Anquan Boldin]] from the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and free agent [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]], released after the preseason by the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. They also added [[Donte' Stallworth]], who most recently played for the [[Cleveland Browns]], but was suspended for the 2009 season, and signed back-up quarterback [[Mark Bulger]] who was released by the [[St. Louis Rams]] after the 1-15 2009 season. Stallworth broke his foot in the third preseason game and came back later in the season. 

They also drafted tight ends [[Dennis Pitta]], [[Ed Dickson]], defensive tackle [[Terrence Cody]], [[Arthur Jones]], linebacker [[Sergio Kindle]], wide receiver [[David Reed (American football)|David Reed]] and offensive tackle [[Ramon Harewood]] in the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. On July 25, [[Sergio Kindle]] suffered a head trauma after falling down 2 flights of stairs in a home in Austin, Texas and was lost for the season. The new additions accounted for a combined 37 starts.

The Ravens finishing the season at 12-4 but with a marginally better divisional record (Steelers 5-1 divisionally versus the Ravens' 4-2). They then went on to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs 30-7 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs, running back Ray Rice becoming the first Raven running back to have a receiving touchdown in a playoff game. The Ravens would then lose to the Steelers 31-24 in the Divisional Playoffs. Leading at halftime 21-7, the Ravens then turn the ball over 3 times in the third quarter, in which gave the Steeler 14 points. Baltimore's season ended with a potential touchdown drop by Anqaun Boldin and, later, another drop by T.J. Houshmazadeh on 4th down, surrendering the game 31-24.

==Logo controversy==
[[Image:Bwings.png|right|thumb|Baltimore Ravens logo from 1996-1998]]
[[Image:RavensdrawingBouchat.png|right|frame|Bouchat's original sketch]]
The team's first helmet logo, used from 1996 through 1998, featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter ''B'' framed by the word ''Ravens'' overhead and a [[cross bottony]] underneath. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed a jury verdict that the logo [[Copyright infringement|infringed]] on a [[copyright]] retained by Frederick E. Bouchat, an amateur artist and security guard in Maryland, but that he was entitled to only three dollars in damages from the NFL.

Bouchat had submitted his design to the Maryland Stadium Authority by fax after learning that Baltimore was to acquire an NFL team. He was not credited for the design when the logo was announced. Bouchat sued the team, claiming to be the designer of the emblem; representatives of the team asserted that the image had been designed independently. The court ruled in favor of Bouchat, noting that team owner Modell had access to Bouchat's work. Bouchat's fax had gone to John Moag, the Maryland Stadium Authority chairman, whose office was located in the same building as Modell's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=4th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=991617P&amp;exact=1 FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bouchat ultimately was not awarded monetary compensation in the damages phase of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens Football Club, 346 F.3d 514, 519 (4th Cir. 2003), cert. denied 541 U.S. 1042 (2004) (&quot;The damages trial was conducted over a period of six days, from July 17 to 24, 2002. On July 23, 2002, at the close of the evidence, the jury was asked to decide whether the Defendants had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues were attributable entirely to factors other than the Defendants' infringement of Bouchat's copyright. If the jury found that they were not, then it was charged to decide the percentage of the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues attributable to factors other than the infringement. After a full day of deliberations, the jury answered the first question in the affirmative, thereby denying Bouchat any monetary recovery.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' ran a poll showing three designs for new helmet logos. Fans participating in the poll expressed a preference for a raven's head in profile over other designs. [[Art Modell]] announced that he would honor this preference but still wanted a letter ''B'' to appear somewhere in the design. The new Ravens logo featured a raven's head in profile with the letter superimposed. The secondary logo is a shield that honors Baltimore's history of [[heraldry]]. Alternating Calvert and Crossland emblems (seen also in the [[flag of Maryland]] and the [[flag of Baltimore]]) are interlocked with stylized letters ''B'' and ''R''.

==Uniforms==
[[Image:AFCN-Uniform-Combination-BAL.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Baltimore Ravens uniform combination]]
The design of the Ravens uniform has remained essentially unchanged since the team's inaugural season in 1996. Helmets are [[black]] with [[purple]] &quot;talon&quot; stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games. At home games the combination of black pants with purple jersey made the Ravens the first NFL team to wear dark colors head to calf. A number of NFL teams have since donned the look, beginning with the all-black home uniform worn in three games by the 2001 [[New Orleans Saints]].

In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in the 2000 Super Bowl.

In the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener and, occasionally, other early games in the season that have a 1:00 kickoff. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.
 
In November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the Cleveland Browns, entitled &quot;Pitch Black&quot; night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.

The Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the [[Washington Redskins]], the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the &quot;blackout&quot; look.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/ravens/blog/2010/06/back_in_black_1.html |title=Back in black |work=Ravens Insider |date=June 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30-24 victory over the New Orleans Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://boards.baltimoreravens.com/topic/22806-ravens-alternate-black-jersey-dates for-2010-announced/|title=Ravens Alternate Black Jerseys for 2010 Announced |work=BaltimoreRavens.com |date=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted back to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC's Sunday Night Football telecast.  The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13-10.

==Rivalries==
{{see also|Steelers–Ravens rivalry|Baltimore Colts relocation controversy}}
Due to the Ravens' relatively short existence, the team has not established many rivalries to date. By far, the team's biggest [[Steelers–Ravens rivalry|rival]] is the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The two teams are both known for their hard-hitting physical style of play, and the rivalry is considered the [[spiritual successor]] to the [[Browns–Steelers rivalry]] due to the Modell move as well as Pittsburgh having an overwhelming 21-4 record against the reactivated Browns. In Baltimore (which is only a five-hour drive from [[Pittsburgh]] along [[Interstate 70]]), there is the added element of many former Colts fans in the area becoming [[Steeler Nation|Steeler fans]] after the Colts move, then retaining their affiliation with the Steelers after the arrival of the Ravens.

Although the Steelers rivalry is based on mutual respect and hatred for each other, the Ravens' rivalry with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] is directed to the organization, and is more fan-based than between the players.  During Ravens home games the scoreboard lists the away team simply as &quot;Indy&quot; rather than the team name that is traditionally used for the visiting opponent.     

The Ravens also have a rivalry with [[Washington Redskins]], though due to the current scheduling formula, the two teams meet only once every four years. However, the two do meet annually in the [[National Football League preseason|preseason]].

The '''British National Party''' ('''BNP''') is a [[far-right]] political party formed as a splinter group from the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] by [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] in 1982. It restricted membership to &quot;[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] British&quot; people until 2010, after a legal challenge to its constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7026702.ece ''BNP changes all-white constitution and ejects Times reporter from meeting'', The Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP advocates &quot;firm but voluntary incentives for immigrants and their descendants to return home&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;BBC-Rebuilding&quot;&gt;British National Party: ''Rebuilding British Democracy'' (general election manifesto 2005 online at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf ''BBC News'')]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the repeal of anti-discrimination legislation. All mainstream political parties in the UK are united in opposing the BNP.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The BNP finished fifth in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 London mayoral election]] with 5.2% of the vote and secured one of the [[London Assembly]]'s 25 seats. It won its first county council seats in 2009 and two seats in the [[European Parliament]]. During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], the BNP received 1.9% of the vote and failed to win any seats.

The BNP's media profile has increased under its current leader, [[Nick Griffin]], a former national organiser of the National Front.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4670574.stm Profile: Nick Griffin ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background, National Front outgrowth===
[[File:Yorkshire NF.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of people carrying [[Union Flag]]s, demonstrating outside a factory.|[[National Front (UK)|National Front]] march from the 1970s. The movement from which the BNP would emerge by 1982.]]
The British National Party{{#tag:ref|The name British National Party had been used in politics previously by four organisations, most notably by the [[British National Party (1942)|a Mosleyite party]] which became the [[English National Association]] and by [[British National Party (1960s)|a 1960s party]] initiated by [[John Bean]], which became part of the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]]. Tyndall was a leading member of the 1960s BNP and a founder of the present party.|group=note}} was founded in 1982 following a split within the [[British National Front|National Front]] (NF) two years previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2000|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NF had organised marches in an attempt to further raise its profile. These sometimes led to violent clashes with political opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;twotwoseven&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Robin|1989|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing groups set up the [[Anti-Nazi League]] campaign against the NF.&lt;ref name=&quot;twotwoseven&quot;/&gt; After a poor showing at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], internal factional division heightened within the NF. This culminated in chairman [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] leaving the party in 1980,&lt;ref name=&quot;betz&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Betz|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; founding the New National Front, which became the BNP two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barberis|2005|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its foundation, the party included a faction of the disintegrating [[British Movement]].

===Tyndall leadership, early years===
According to ''[[Spearhead (magazine)|Spearhead]]'', a magazine produced by Tyndall, the split within the movement was not initially intended to be permanent.&lt;ref name=&quot;betz&quot;/&gt;

During the mid-1980s, the party began to develop friendly relations with organisations such as the NF [[Flag Group]]{{#tag:ref|There were overtures at a possible BNP and NF Flag Group reunification as the ''Nationalist Alliance''.

Following the report, the campaign group [[Unite Against Fascism]] called for ballerina [[Simone Clarke]] to be dismissed from the [[English National Ballet]], because her views on immigration were &quot;incompatible with a leading arts institution such as the English National Ballet&quot; and because she had &quot;used her position to support a party which fosters division&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNP-ballerina-BBC&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6241763.stm|title=Storm grows over 'BNP ballerina'|date=8 January 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke said: &quot;the BNP is the only party to take a stand against immigration&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNP-ballerina-BBC&quot; /&gt;

==Policies==
{{Nationalism sidebar}}

===Economic policy===
The economic policy of the party has developed over time. In the 1990s, the party reflected [[protectionism]] and [[economic nationalism]], although in comparison with other radical nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2002|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the &quot;subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot; /&gt; It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum [[self-sufficiency]] in food production.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot; /&gt; It has advocated ending overseas aid in order to provide aid within the UK and to finance the repatriation of immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot; /&gt;

In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a &quot;mixture of big capitalism and state control&quot;, saying it favoured a &quot;[[distributism|distributionist]] tradition established by home-grown thinkers&quot; favouring small business.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatw&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Eatwell|2004|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2005 manifesto, the BNP opposed &quot;[[globalism]], [[international socialism]], [[laissez-faire capitalism]] and [[economic liberalism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf|publisher=BBC.co.uk|title=BNP General Election Manifesto 2005|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP rejects the notion of [[Thatcherism]] and &quot;submitting to the dictates of the international marketplace&quot; which &quot;has no loyalty to this country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; The BNP has claimed that it is possible for a national economy to thrive outside of the [[laissez-faire]] model, pointing to 21st century examples such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; The BNP claims that, while immigration increases the [[Aggregate income|aggregate GNP]] by providing cheap labour, it decreases the [[Per capita income|per-capita GNP]], which the BNP claims is most representative of the economic well-being of British people.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt;

The party says that &quot;old-style socialist methods&quot; of tax and spend &quot;turned out to have harmful effects&quot; and it would instead seek &quot;non-destructive means to reduce income inequality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; Central to the BNP's economic policies are greater share ownership and the establishment of [[worker cooperative|worker co-operatives]]. The party advocates the provision of extra resources for &quot;especially gifted children&quot; and the reversal of closures of special needs schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt;

===Social and cultural policy===
The BNP advocates [[corporal punishment]] and [[capital punishment]] for paedophiles, terrorists and murderers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; It proposes to increase defence spending and to reintroduce compulsory [[national service]]. It has proposed that men should keep a rifle and ammunition in their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; Its policy is &quot;to end the conflict in Ireland by welcoming Eire{{sic}} as well as Ulster as equal partners in a federation of the nations of the British Isles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080120155729/www.bnp.org.uk/sms-news-texts/ &quot;BNP Policies&quot;], BNP Website.

====Race and immigration policies====
At its founding, the BNP was explicitly racist. In 1990, it was described by the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] committee on racism and xenophobia as an &quot;openly Nazi party&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bnputs&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = BNP: under the skin|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1984.stm|publisher = BBC|accessdate = 4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the party's deputy leader [[Richard Edmonds]] said, &quot;We are 100 per cent racist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bnputs&quot;/&gt; When [[Nick Griffin]] became chairman in 1999, the party began to change its stance on race issues. Griffin espouses &quot;[[ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalism]]&quot; based on &quot;concern for the well-being of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ethnic nations that compose the United Kingdom&quot;.

The BNP's 1992 General Election manifesto said that the party had &quot;no quarrel with the ordinary Jew who goes about his own business and does not attempt to influence national affairs in the interests of his racial group&quot;, but was opposed to Jewish people &quot;whose activities in pursuit of the interests of their own co-racialists here and around the world can sometimes bring them into conflict with British interests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tyndall|first=John |title=Fight Back!

The party does not regard non-white people as being British, including those born in the UK or who are naturalised British citizens. Griffin has stated that &quot;non-Europeans who stay&quot;, while protected by British law, &quot;will be regarded as permanent guests&quot;.&lt;ref name=racereality&gt;Griffin, Nick [http://web.archive.org/web/20071010043702/http://www.bnp.org.uk/articles/race_reality.htm &quot;The BNP: Anti-asylum protest, racist sect or power-winning movement?&quot;].

The BNP is opposed to mixed-race relationships because &quot;when whites take partners from other ethnic groups, a white family line that stretches back into deep pre-history is destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref name=bnpfaq&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20020203190553/www.bnp.org.uk/faq.html &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;], bnp.org.uk, Retrieved on 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Griffin stated: &quot;...while the BNP is not racist, it must not become multi-racist either.

====Criticism of Islam====
The party states that it &quot;has moved on in recent years, casting off the leg-irons of conspiracy theories and the thinly veiled anti-semitism which has held this party back for two decades. The real enemies of the British people are home grown Anglo-Saxon Celtic liberal-leftists&amp;nbsp;... and the Crescent Horde—the endless wave of Islamics who are flocking to our shores to bring our island nations into the embrace of their barbaric desert religion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nationalism and Israel&quot;/&gt;

Consequently, the party has shifted allegiance in conflicts involving Israel. Its head of legal affairs, Lee Barnes, wrote on the party's website about the [[2006 Lebanon War]]: &quot;As a Nationalist I can say that I support Israel 100% in their dispute with [[Hezbollah]]. In fact, I hope they wipe Hezbollah off the Lebanese map and bomb them until they leave large greasy craters in the cities where their Islamic extremist cantons of terror once stood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Barnes [http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195705/http://www.bnp.org.uk/columnists/brimstone2.php?leeId=80 &quot;Nationalism and Israel&quot;], BNP Website, 28 July 2006.

The BNP was criticised over a web article titled, &quot;Liars, buggers and thieves&quot;, which grouped several gay politicians in with convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles.

===Political tendency===

It has been claimed that the BNP has, since its foundation, been fascist. The party's predecessor, the NF, was overtly fascist, incorporating nationalism, racism and [[antisemitism]] into its core ideology. This ideology was taken up by the newly formed BNP. Founder John Tyndall proclaimed: &quot;''[[Mein Kampf]]'' is my bible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,11375,1028498,00.html Expelled BNP founder plans court battle] ''The Observer'', 24 August 2003. Retrieved 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Piero Ignazi has said that the &quot;proto-Nazi&quot; mould of the NF, and the &quot;generalised nostalgia for all sorts of fascist tendencies&quot; and association with &quot;foreign ideologies&quot;, which continued under the BNP, accounted for the lack of success for both parties in comparison to successful far-right parties in Europe, which disavowed traditional fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Extreme right parties in Western Europe|author=Piero Ignazi|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0199291594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Richard Overy has said that &quot;Fascism with a capital F&quot; was strictly a movement of the past. According to David Stevenson, &quot;the BNP is different in style and structure from fascism in the 1930s&quot; saying that although they do not wear uniforms they still count &quot;bully boys&quot; among their membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/09/bnp-fascism-meps-far-right |title=Leading historians on whether fascism is on the march again &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2009|location=London|first=Stephen|last=Moss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the BNP represents a hybrid movement containing elements of neo-fascism and anti-immigrant themes.&lt;ref&gt;Julie V. Gottlieb, Thomas P. Linehan, ''The culture of fascism: visions of the far right in Britain'', I B Taurus, New York (2004) pp70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

====1983-1992====

The BNP achieved no real success in their first three general elections from 1983-1992. No deposits of contested constituencies were saved and its share of votes only ranged from 0.1% to 3.6% in each constituency.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ge1992.html Election.demon.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992]] the BNP percent of votes overall was only 0.02% of the electorate.

====1997====

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997]] the BNP for the first time saved 3 deposits (out of 56 contested seats).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ge1997.html Election.demon.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Their highest amount of votes received was 3350 (7.5%) in the East End seat of [[Bethnal Green and Bow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1507680.stm News.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their average votes per candidate also increased from 664 to 1,428, and they secured 47,129 votes in total.

====2005====

The United Kingdom general election 2005 was considered a major breakthrough by the BNP, as they picked up 192,746 votes in the 119 constituencies they contested and retained a deposit in 40 of the seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4519347.stm | work=BBC News | title=BNP sees increase in total votes | date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a record of 73 deposits were saved.

Party chairman Nick Griffin came third in the [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]] constituency, behind [[Margaret Hodge]] of Labour and Simon Marcus of the Conservatives, who were first and second respectively.

===Local elections===
The BNP's first electoral success came in 1993, when [[Derek Beackon]] was returned as a councillor in [[Millwall]], London. He lost his seat in elections the following year. The next BNP success in local elections was not until the [[Burnley Council election, 2002|2002]] local elections, when three BNP candidates gained seats on [[Burnley (borough)|Burnley]] council.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05064.pdf Parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2000 the BNP fielded 17 candidates in 12 councils and polled 3,022 votes. The average share of votes in wards contested was 8%.
*In 2001 the BNP fielded 4 candidates in three councils and polled 867 votes, with an average share of 4% in the wards contested.
*In 2002 the BNP fielded 67 candidates and polled 30,998 votes in 26 local councils. The BNP average share of votes was 16%. Three BNP candidates were elected for the first time in Burnley with an average share of 28.1%.

The BNP's success in the 2003 local elections sparked national media publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/and-now-they-have-five-but-what-happens-when-the-bnp-wins-a-seat-746262.html Independent.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-156455/BNP-fifth-election-win.html Dailymail.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Layer the same year, the BNP won two local by-elections. In the Heckmondwicke ward of Kirklees Council in August, avid Exley, polled 1,607 votes (44%). In September, Nick Geri won the Grays Riverside ward of Thurrock council, polling 552 votes (38%).&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt; Later in Burnley, the number of councillors increased, making the BNP briefly the second-largest party and official opposition on that council, a position it lost after the resignation of a BNP councillor who had been disciplined by the party. The BNP stood in the subsequent [[Burnley local elections#Lanehead By-Election 2003|by-election]].

*In 2004 the BNP had 312 candidates stand for election in 59 local authorities in England and Wales, including 25 candidates in Sunderland, 24 in Birmingham and 23 in Leeds. The BNP won 14 council seats, and polled 190,200 votes.

The party's biggest election success to date was a gain of 52% of the vote in the Goresbrook ward of [[Barking]] in the 2004 local elections. The victorious councillor, Daniel Kelley, retired just 10 months later, claiming he had been an outcast within the council. A new election was held in June 2005, in which the seat was regained by the Labour candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/9-democracy/elections/results/elect-by-goresbrook-05.html|title=LBBD: Goresbrook Ward By-Election Result}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest gain in the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|local elections on 4 May 2006]], was in [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham|Barking and Dagenham]] where the BNP won 11 of the 13 seats it contested,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BNP laughing stock at council meeting&quot;, ''Barking and Dagenham Recorder'', 18 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; gaining 17% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/nov/15/nick-griffin-barking-general-election|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=BNP leader Nick Griffin to take on Margaret Hodge in Barking|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=15 November 2009|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP also won three seats in [[Epping Forest (district)|Epping Forest]], three in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], three in [[Sandwell]], two in [[Burnley Council election, 2006|Burnley]], two in [[Kirklees]], and single seats in [[Bradford]], [[Havering]], [[Solihull]], [[Redditch]], [[London Borough of Redbridge|Redbridge]], [[Pendle]] and [[Leeds]]. In 2006, the BNP also gained its first parish councillor in Wales when Mike Howard of Rhewl Mostyn, [[Flintshire]], previously an Independent, joined the BNP.

*In the 2007 local elections, the BNP polled 292,911 votes. It won 10 seats with a net gain of one. The party fielded a record of 744 candidates in 148 councils across England and Scotland. This was more than double the number of candidates fielded in 2006; they scored on average 13% of the votes in the wards which they contested.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2444454.ece |title=BNP goes bourgeois as party aims for rural seats|publisher=The Independent|date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2007|location=London|first1=Nigel|last1=Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary of BNP councillors from 2000-2007: from 2000 to 2001 the BNP had none, in 2002 it had three, by 2003 it had
16 local councilors, this increased to 21 by 2005, in 2006 the biggest gain saw BNP's councillors rise to 48, and by 2007 to 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;100council&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7382831.stm |title=BNP gains from Labour disaffection |publisher=BBC News |first=Dominic |last=Casciani |date=4 May 2008 |accessdate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the number of BNP councillors fell slowly due to resignations and expulsions, several of them associated with a failed leadership challenge in the summer. By the end of the year, the number was 42. In 2008, however, the BNP increased its councillors to 55.

===Claims of repression of free speech===
The BNP says that [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] guidelines on reporting 'far right' organisations forbid unionised journalists from reporting uncritically on the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/2008/03/the-media-reporting-on-the-bnp/|title=The Media: Reporting on the BNP|author=Martin Wingfield|date=16 March 2008|accessdate=17 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment cases and related controversies===
In ''[[ASLEF v. United Kingdom]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] overturned an employment appeal tribunal ruling that awarded BNP train driver [[Jay Lee]], damages for expulsion from a trade union. It found that the union was entitled to decide who could be a member, and that the UK was in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in the way it had treated ASLEF.&lt;ref&gt;European Court of Human Rights: [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=813953&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ASLEF v. United Kingdom: Final judgement], Strasbourg, 27 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Potter, later an official of [[Solidarity – The Union for British Workers]], was expelled from his union. A court upheld the expulsion and found that it was based on previous exclusion rather than BNP membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:j9ITehWultQJ:www.pforum.fire.gov.uk/document/147+potter+bnp+prison+service&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=uk Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case, Robert Baggs claimed that he had been discriminated against because of &quot;religion, or similar philosophical belief&quot; after he was refused a job at a [[General practitioner|GP]] surgery. His claimed that the employer was in violation of the Employment (Religious Discrimination) Regulations of 2003. The Employment Tribunal found that membership of the BNP was not a &quot;similar&quot; belief,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article384990.ece|work=The Times|location=London|title=BNP loses battle|date=26 April 2005|accessdate=27 April 2010|first=Daniel|last=Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case was rejected. Stuart Chamberlain of management consultants Gee Consult has advised that a similar case might be successful since the removal of the qualification &quot;similar&quot; from philosophical belief by an amendment in 2007. &quot;Cases concerning claims made by British National Party's (BNP) members that their fascist beliefs were similar to religious beliefs have previously been decided in favour of the employer or potential employer.

Arthur Redfearn was a bus driver whose BNP membership was unknown to his employer, Serco, until he was elected as a councillor. His employer was concerned that he might endanger its contract with a local authority to transport vulnerable people of various ethnicities from a day centre and he was dismissed. The Employment Tribunal held that members of racist organisations could lawfully be dismissed on health and safety grounds if there was a danger of violence occurring in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emplaw.co.uk/researchfree-redirector.aspx?StartPage=data%2f2005irlr744.htm |title=Disclaw Publishing - Employment Law, unfair dismissal, redundancy pay |publisher=Emplaw.co.uk |accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been unsuccessfully argued at the Employment Tribunal that Redfearn had been racially discriminated against because the BNP is a whites-only organisation, and was treated unfairly in comparison to racist organisations that were non-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII|country=ew|litigants=SERCO LIMITED and ARTHUR REDFEARN|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=659|para=16|date=25 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a BNP candidate and Regional Organiser, Kevin Scott, was dismissed from the [[B&amp;Q]] hardware store in [[Gateshead]]. The management said this was not due to his party membership but due to &quot;low morale&quot; amongst other staff who did not want to work with him, and also the number of calls from customers expressing their disapproval. Scott settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, although the BNP had pledged to support any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2264846.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Store settles with sacked BNP worker |publisher=BBC News |date=17 September 2002 |accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with violence===
John Hagan claims that the BNP has conducted right-wing extremist violence in order to gain &quot;institutionalized power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;haganwilliam&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hagan |first=John |title=International handbook of violence research |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |isbn=9781402014666 |page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the BNP, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] in a 1997 report, have asserted that the party recruits from skinhead groups and that it promotes racist violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanrightsw&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racist violence in the United Kingdom |url = http://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;vid=ISBN1564322025&amp;vid=LCCN96077750 | publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1997 |isbn=9781564322029 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence to further the party's aims. In 1986, when Griffin was Deputy Chair of the NF, he advised his audience at an anti-[[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] rally to use the &quot;traditional British methods of the brick, the boot and the fist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Yorkshire Post'', 17 February 1986&lt;/ref&gt; After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote that the BNP should not be a &quot;postmodernist rightist party&quot; but &quot;a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan 'Defend Rights for Whites' with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate&quot;. In 1997 he said: &quot;It is more important to control the streets of a city than its council chambers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardng&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/sep/01/features.magazine37|title=Flying the flag|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|date=1 September 2002|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 October 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP defends itself by arguing that over 20% of the working population has some criminal record or another and that a large proportion of MPs, councillors and activists in the other three main parties also have unsatisfactory past records.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A BBC ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme reported on a number of BNP members who have had criminal convictions, some racially motivated.

===Equality and Human Rights Commission===
The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] sent the BNP a letter in 2009, ahead of legal action, setting out concerns about the BNP's constitution and membership criteria. It alleged that the BNP's constitution restricting membership to white people was unlawful under the Race Relations Act. The BNP chose to fight this opinion in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].

The Commission issued county court proceedings against party leader Nick Griffin and two other officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8218397.stm Legal action over BNP membership], BBC News.

It would be a pyrrhic victory, to say the least, if anyone thought that giving the BNP a facelift would make the slightest difference to a body with so much racism and hatred pumping through its veins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The courts declared that the new constitution still breached equality laws and was still indirectly discriminatory. Judge Paul Collins ordered the BNP to pay costs and said its membership list must remain &quot;closed&quot; until it complied with race relations laws. The BNP claimed that it had a waiting list of black and Asian people and wanted more applications from ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;New BNP rules rejected by court&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8564742.stm|work=BBC News|title=New BNP rules rejected by court|date=12 March 2010|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP would be subject to the &quot;same general principles governing official impartiality&quot; and they would receive &quot;standard written briefings as appropriate from time to time&quot;, but diplomats would not be &quot;proactive&quot; in dealing with the BNP MEPs and that any requests for policy briefings from them would be treated differently and on a discretionary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/09/diplomats-shun-nick-griffin-bnp-europe |title= UK diplomats shun BNP officials in Europe|accessdate=23 October 2009|location=London|first=Ian|last=Traynor|date=9 July 2009|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the most visible and vocal opponents of the BNP and other far right-wing groups are [[Unite Against Fascism]] and ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]''. Unite Against Fascism, which aims to unite a broad spectrum of opposition to the far-right, includes the [[Anti-Nazi League]], the [[National Assembly Against Racism]] and the [[Student Assembly Against Racism]]. ''Searchlight'' has monitored the activities of far-right groups in Britain and abroad, including the BNP and its members, for many years.

Some opponents of fascism call for no coverage to be given to groups or individuals enunciating what they describe as &quot;[[hate speech]]&quot;. The &quot;[[No Platform]]&quot; stance is to deny perceived fascist hate speech any sort of publicity. The policy is most commonly associated with university student unions and debating societies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/blogs/blog/aaronporter/2010/09/14/Re-affirming-our-support-for-No-Platform/ Nusconnect.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; but has also resulted in BNP candidates being banned from speaking at various hustings meetings around the country. In 2005, the ''[[Leeds Student]]'' newspaper was criticised after publishing an interview with Nick Griffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leedstoday.net/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=39&amp;ArticleID=971585|title=Yorkshire Evening Post: BNP interview fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, an invitation to Nick Griffin by the [[University of St Andrews]] Union Debating Society to participate in a debate on multiculturalism was withdrawn after protests.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Jackson, [http://news.scotsman.com/farrightintheuk/Universitys-invitation-to-BNP-leader.2600849.jp &quot;University's invitation to BNP leader withdrawn&quot;], ''The Scotsman'', 5 February 2005.

Retrieved 3 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, a presentation by Nick Griffin was to be held at the [[University of Bath]], but the University withdrew permission due to concerns over the large number of people opposing the meeting and possible disruption it could cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6644117.stm|title=BBC News: University halts BNP speech plan|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, a [[Democratic Unionist Party]] councillor in [[Northern Ireland]], [[Bobby McKee]], condemned a BNP leafleting campaign in his home town of [[Larne]] opposing a refugee dentention centre being built there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/bnp-takes-hate-message-to-larne-14966990.html#ixzz18T30Vjjk BNP takes hate message to Northern Ireland] ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Nazi League-organised group, [[Love Music Hate Racism]], organises regular music events in opposition to the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovemusichateracism.com/about/ Love Music Hate Racism about page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterans and Second World War===
In June 2009, the [[Royal British Legion]] wrote to Griffin privately to ask him to stop wearing their poppy symbol. After he refused and wore the badge at campaign events and on the party's televised election broadcast, The Legion said in an open letter: &quot;True valour deserves respect regardless of a person's ethnic origin, and everyone who serves or has served their country deserves nothing less&amp;nbsp;... [our national chairman] appealed to your sense of honour. But you have responded by continuing to wear the poppy. So now we're no longer asking you privately. Stop it, Mr Griffin. Just stop it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Matthew.

Firth had spent 24 hours raising the money, half of which was given to the Legion and the other half to the BNP. The Legion said that Firth had assured them that the donation would not be exploited politically although the story was later &quot;splashed across&quot; the BNP's website. BNP spokesman Simon Darby denied that the party exploited the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8250086.stm|title=British Legion accepts BNP gift|last=Furlong|first=Ray|date=11 September 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]]'s family has criticised the BNP after the party used his image and quotes from one of his speeches in its campaign. Churchill's grandson, [[Nicholas Soames]], described the BNP as &quot;monstrous&quot; and said its use of Churchill was &quot;offensive and disgusting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8068717.stm &quot;BNP's Churchill use 'disgusting'&quot;], ''BBC News'', 26 May 2009, Retrieved on 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP was also caught up in a dispute with 1940s singer [[Vera Lynn]] after she objected to the party selling copies of her [[(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover|White Cliffs of Dover]] CD on its website to fund its European election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/4687730/Dame-Vera-Lynn-takes-on-BNP-over-White-Cliffs-of-Dover.html &quot;Dame Vera Lynn takes on BNP over White Cliffs of Dover&quot;], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|telegraph.co.uk]]'', 18 February 2009, Retrieved on 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online presence==
In September 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported that [[Hitwise]], the online competitive intelligence service, said that the BNP website had more hits than any other website of a British political party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/13/nbnp113.xml BNP website is the most popular in politics] ''Daily Telegraph, 17 September 2007.

===International political contacts===
The BNP and the French [[National Front (France)|Front National]] have co-operated on numerous occasions. [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] visited the UK in 2004 to assist in launching the BNP's European Parliament campaign and Nick Griffin repaid the favour by sending a delegation of BNP officials to the FN's annual 'First of May [[Joan of Arc]] parade' in Paris in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3654941.stm|title=BBC News: Le Pen UK visit sparks protests|date=25 April 2004|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=288|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195748/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=288|archivedate=14 October 2007|title=BNP: BNP Leader flies in to help French in Euro poll}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP has links with Germany's [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]].

Griffin spoke at a Jobbik party rally in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;The Sun, 28 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, [[Simon Darby]], deputy chairman of the BNP, was welcomed with fascist salutes by members of the Italian nationalist [[Forza Nuova]] during a trip to Milan.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Funerary Stela Corporis Custodes.jpg|thumb|Funerary stela of one of [[Nero]]'s ''Corporis Custodes'' (imperial bodyguard). The bodyguard, Indus, was of the Batavian tribe.]]
The '''Batavi''' were an ancient [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] tribe, originally part of the [[Chatti]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; reported by [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] to have lived around the [[Rhine]] delta, in the area that is currently the [[Netherlands]], &quot;an uninhabited district on the extremity of the coast of Gaul, and also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean in front, and by the river Rhine in the rear and on either side&quot; (Tacitus, ''Historiae'' iv).  This led to the [[Latin language|Latin]] name of '''insula Batavorum''' for the area.&lt;ref&gt;The Dutch applied the familiar name ''Batavia'' to their colonial factory on the island of [[Java]], now [[Jakarta]].&lt;/ref&gt; The same name is applied to several military units, originally raised among the Batavi.  The tribal name, probably a derivation from ''batawjō'' (&quot;good island&quot;, from [[Germanic Languages|Germanic]] ''bat-'' &quot;good, excellent&quot; and ''awjō'' &quot;island, land near water&quot;), refers to the region's fertility, today known as the ''fruitbasket of the Netherlands'' (the [[Betuwe]]).

Finds of [[Wax tablet|wooden tablets]] show that at least some were literate.

==Location==
[[File:Continental.coast.150AD.Germanic.peoples.jpg|frameless|240px|right]]
The Batavi were mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] in his commentary ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', as living on an island formed by the [[Rhine River]] after it splits, one arm being the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] the other the [[Nederrijn|Lower Rhine]]/[[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]]. The strategic position, to wit the high bank of the Waal—which offered an unimpeded view far into Germania Transrhenana (Germania Beyond the Rhine)--was recognized first by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], who built a massive fortress (''castra'') and a headquarters (''praetorium'') in imperial style. The latter was in use until the Batavian revolt.

Archeological evidence suggests they lived in small villages, composed of 6 to 12 houses in the very fertile lands between the rivers, and lived by agriculture and cattle-raising . Finds of horse skeletons in graves suggest a strong equestrian preoccupation. On the south bank of the Waal (in what is now Nijmegen) a Roman administrative center was built, called ''Oppidum Batavorum''. An [[Oppidum]] was a fortified warehouse, where a tribe's treasures were stored and guarded. This centre was razed during the Batavian Revolt.

The Batavi (the name is believed to derive from a West Germanic root also present in &quot;better&quot; (possibly meaning &quot;superior men&quot;)) moved into the [[Betuwe]] in the late 1st century BC. The previous inhabitants of the area were Celtic-speaking Gauls, as evidenced by the two Latinised Celtic names for their chief town: ''Batavodurum'' and ''Noviomagus'' ([[Nijmegen]], Neth).&lt;ref&gt;Birley (2002) 42-3&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the existing inhabitants were simply subjugated with the Batavi forming a ruling elite, or the existing inhabitants simply displaced. For this reason it is also uncertain whether the Batavi remained Germanic-speaking or adopted the Belgic Gallic tongue of the indigenes.

==Military units==
[[Image:Bataafseeed.jpg|thumb|240px|''The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis'' by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]]]
The first Batavi commander we know of is named [[Chariovalda]], who led a charge across the Visurgin ([[Weser]]) against the [[Cherusci]] led by Arminius during the campaigns of Germanicus in ''Germania Transrhenana'' (Annales II, 11).

Tacitus (''[[De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' XXIX) described the Batavi as the bravest of the tribes of the area, hardened in the Germanic wars, with cohorts under their own commanders transferred to [[Britannia]]. They retained the honour of the ancient association with the Romans, not required to pay tribute or taxes and used by the Romans only for war: &quot;They furnished to the Empire nothing but men and arms&quot;, Tacitus remarked. Well regarded for their skills in horsemanship and swimming&amp;mdash;for men and horses could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. [[Dio Cassius]] describes this surprise tactic employed by [[Aulus Plautius]] against the &quot;barbarians&quot;&amp;mdash;the British Celts&amp;mdash; at the [[Battle of the Medway|battle of the River Medway]], 43:

:''The barbarians thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of Germanic tribesmen, who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. [...] Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found; but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the Germans swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them.'' (Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book 60:20)
It is uncertain how they were able to accomplish this feat. The late 4th century writer on Roman military affairs Vegetius mentions soldiers using reed rafts, drawn by leather leads, to transport equipment across rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Vegetius ''De re militari'' III.7&lt;/ref&gt; But the sources suggest the Batavi were able to swim across rivers actually wearing full armour and weapons. This would only have been possible by the use of some kind of buoyancy device: [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] mentions that the ''[[Cornuti]]'' regiment swam across a river floating on their shields &quot;as on a canoe&quot; (357).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] XVI.11&lt;/ref&gt; Since the shields were wooden, they may have provided sufficient buoyancy

The Batavi also provided a contingent for the Emperor's [[equites singulares Augusti|Horse Guard]].

Numerous altars and tombstones of the cohorts of Batavi, dating to the 2nd century and 3rd century, have been found along [[Hadrian's Wall]], notably at [[Castlecary]] and [[Carrawburgh]], [[Germany]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Austria]].

===Revolt of the Batavi===

{{main|Revolt of the Batavi}}
Despite the alliance, one of the high-ranking Batavi, Julius Paullus, to give him his Roman name, was executed by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion. His kinsman [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] was paraded in chains in Rome before [[Nero]]; though he was acquitted by [[Galba]], he was retained at Rome, and when he returned to his kin in the year of upheaval in the Roman Empire, 69, he headed a Batavian rebellion. He managed to capture [[Castra Vetera]], the Romans lost two legions while two others (I Germanica and XVI Gallica) were controlled by the rebels. The rebellion became a real threat to the Empire when the conflict escalated to northern Gaul and Germania. The Roman army retaliated and invaded the ''insula Batavorum''. A bridge was built over the river [[Nabalia]], where the warring parties approached each other on both sides to negotiate peace. The narrative was told in great detail in Tacitus' History, book iv, although, unfortunately, the narrative breaks off abruptly at the climax. Following the uprising, [[Legio X Gemina|Legio X ''Gemina'']] was housed in a stone ''castra'' to keep an eye on the Batavians.

== Fate of the Batavi==

The Batavi were still mentioned in 355 during the reign of [[Constantius II]] (317 - 361), when their island was already dominated by the [[Salian Franks|Salii]], a Frankish tribe that had sought Roman protection there in 297 after having been expelled from their own country by the Saxons.

[[Constantius Gallus]] added inhabitants of Batavia to his legions, &quot;of whose discipline we still make use.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus03_book3.htm Zosimus, New History. London: Green and Chaplin (1814). Book 3]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assumed they merged with the Salii shortly before or after and, after having been expelled by another tribe (it has been proposed this was the [[Chamavi]]), shared their subsequent migration to [[Toxandria]], an ancient name for current [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] after (358).

In the [[Late Roman army]] there was a unit called ''[[Batavi (military unit)|Batavi]]''.

==The Batavian myth==
{{main|History of the Netherlands#Batavians}}
In the 16th-century invention of a suitably antique origin myth for the [[Dutch people]] that would be expressive of their self-identification as separate from their neighbors in the national struggle with Spain of the [[Eighty Years War]] for Dutch independence, the Batavians came to be regarded as their eponymous ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;This section follows Simon Schama, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'', (New York) 1987, ch. II &quot;Patriotic Scripture&quot;, especially pp 72ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mix of fancy and fact in the ''Cronyke van Hollandt, Zeelandt ende Vriesland'' (called the ''Divisiekronike''), first published in 1517, brought the spare remarks in Tacitus'  newly-rediscovered ''Germania'' to a popular public; it was being reprinted as late as 1802.&lt;ref&gt;I. Schöffer, &quot;The Batavian myth during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,&quot; in P.A.M. Geurts and A.E.M. Janssen, ''Geschiedschrijving in Nederland'' ('Gravenhage) 1981:84-109, noted by Schama 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Dutch virtues of independence, fortitude and industry were rendered fully recognizable among the Batavians in more scholarly history represented in [[Hugo Grotius]]' ''Liber de Antiquitate Republicae Batavicorum'' (1610). The myth was perpetuated by Romeyn de Hooghe's ''Spiegel van Staat der Vereenigden Nederlanden'' (&quot;Mirror of the State of the United Netherlands&quot;, 1706), which also ran to many editions, and it was revived in the atmosphere of [[Romantic nationalism]] in the late eighteenth-century reforms that saw a short-lived [[Batavian Republic]] and, in the colony of the [[Dutch East Indies]], a capital (now [[Jakarta]]) that was named Batavia. The success of this legend of origins was partly due to theories in anthropology, which were based on a tribal paradigm. Being politically and geographically inclusive and leaving at the same time space for diversity, this historical vision filled the needs of Dutch nation-building and integration in the 1890-1914 era. However, the disadvantages of this historical interpretation soon became apparent. It suggested there were no strong external borders, while allowing for the fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three parts. The origins myth appeared, especially during the Second World War, allow the dangers of regional separatism and annexation to Germany. After 1945 the tribal paradigm lost its grip on anthropology; the &quot;three-tribes-theme&quot; was also fundamentally questioned and slowly faded away.&lt;ref&gt;Marnix Beyen, &quot;A Tribal Trinity: the Rise and Fall of the Franks, the Frisians and the Saxons in the Historical Consciousness of the Netherlands since 1850.&quot; ''European History Quarterly'' 2000 30(4): 493-532. Issn: 0265-6914 Fulltext: [[EBSCO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern variants of the Batavian [[founding myth]] are made more credible by pointing out that the Batavians were only part of the ancestry of the Dutch people, together with the [[Frisians]], [[Franks]] and [[Saxons]], and by tracing patterns of DNA. Echoes of this supposed cultural continuity may still be found in popularisations of the history that follows.

The usual form of baptism among [[Early Christians|the earliest Christians]] was for the candidate to be immersed totally (submersion) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the early centuries baptism was usually by immersion. However, this need not have meant full submersion in the water.

Here the words of St. John Chrysostom might be noted: &quot;It is as in a tomb that we immerse our heads in the water… then when we lift our heads back the new man comes forth&quot; (''On John'' 25.2, PG 59:151). In a word, while early Christians were very attentive to symbolism relating to baptism (cf. the funerary shape of the baptistry building; the steps, typically three, for descending and rising from the font; the iconography relating to regeneration, etc.), they show few signs of preoccupation with total immersion.

Today, some Christians, particularly [[Quaker]]s and the [[Salvation Army]], do not see baptism as necessary, and do not practice the rite. Among those that do, differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize &quot;in the name of the [[God the Father|Father]], and of the [[God the Son|Son]], and of the [[Holy Spirit]]&quot; (following the [[Great Commission]]), but some baptize in [[Jesus' Name doctrine|Jesus' name only]]. Most Christians [[infant baptism|baptize infants]];&lt;ref&gt;Out of a total of about 2,100,000 Christians ([http://www.numberof.net/number-of-christians-in-the-world-2/ Number of Christians in the World,][http://www.religioustolerance.org/worldrel.htm Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance)], infant baptism is in use in the Catholic Church (1,100,000,000), the Eastern Orthodox Church (225,000,000), most of the 77,000,000 members of the Anglican Communion, Lutherans and others ([http://www.adherents.com/adh_rb.html Religious Bodies of the World with at Least 1&amp;nbsp;Million Adherents;] [http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Christianity Major Denominational Families of Christianity).] See also [http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html Worldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-1995]&lt;/ref&gt; many others hold that only [[believer's baptism|believer’s baptism]] is true baptism. Some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others consider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the head, is sufficient.

&quot;Baptism&quot; has also been used to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Joseph P.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word &quot;baptism&quot; is derived indirectly through [[Latin]] from the neuter [[Greek language|Greek]] concept noun ''baptisma'' (Greek βάπτισμα, &quot;washing-ism&quot;), which is a [[neologism]] in the [[New Testament]] derived from the masculine Greek noun ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) which is a fairly common term for ritual washing in Greek language texts of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] during the [[Second Temple period]], such as the [[Septuagint]]. Both of these nouns are nouns derived from ''baptizein'' (βαπτίζω, &quot;I wash&quot; [[transitive verb]]) which is used in Jewish texts for ritual washing, and in the [[New Testament]] both for ritual washing and also for the apparently new rite of ''baptisma''. The Greek verb root ''bpt'' in turn is hypothetically traced to a reconstructed [[Indo-European]] root *''gwabh-''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=baptize Online [[Etymology]] Dictionary: &quot;baptize&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or *''gwebh-''&lt;ref name=AHD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/etymologicaldict00skea#page/46/mode/2up Walter W.

As Christians of different traditions dispute whether total [[immersion baptism|immersion]] (submersion) is necessary for baptism, the precise meaning of the Greek noun ''baptisma'' in the New Testament has become important for discussion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Usual meaning of the Greek verb ''baptizein''===
The [[Greek-English Lexicon]] of Liddell and Scott gives the primary meaning of the verb ''baptizein'' (1st Person ''βαπτίζω'' ''baptizô''), from which the English noun &quot;baptism&quot; is derived, as &quot;dip, plunge&quot;, and indicates that the dipping or plunging need not be complete, as when a sword is plunged into a throat or into a foetus or when wine is drawn by dipping a cup in the bowl; for New Testament usage it gives two meanings: &quot;baptize&quot;, with which it associates the [[Septuagint]] mention of [[Naaman]] dipping himself in the [[Jordan River]], and &quot;perform ablutions&quot;, as in {{bibleref2|Luke|11:38}},&lt;ref name=&quot;LSJ&quot;&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=baptizw&amp;la=greek#lexicon Liddell &amp; Scott: entry βαπτίζω]: &quot;Βαπτίζω.

===Other meanings of the verb ''baptizein''===
Two passages in the [[New Testament]] indicate that the [[verb]] ''baptizein'' when applied to washing in a context unrelated to Christian baptism, did not always indicate submersion. The first is Luke 11:38&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|11:38}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, &quot;was astonished to see that he did not first wash (''ἐβαπτίσθη'', aorist passive of ''βαπτίζω''—literally, &quot;be baptized&quot;) before dinner.&quot; This is the passage that Liddell and Scott cites as an instance of the use of ''{{polytonic|βαπτίζω}}'' to mean ''perform ablutions''. [[Jesus]]' omission of this action is similar to that of his disciples: &quot;Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash (''{{polytonic|νίπτω}}'') not their hands when they eat bread.&quot;{{bibleref2c|Mt|15:1–2|KJV}} The other [[New Testament]] passage pointed to is: &quot;The Pharisees…do not eat unless they wash (''{{polytonic|νίπτω}}'', the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, &quot;baptize themselves&quot;—''βαπτίσωνται'', passive or middle voice of ''βαπτίζω'')&quot;.{{bibleref2c|Mk|7:3–4|KJV}}

Accordingly, standard lexicography identifies the meaning of βαπτίζω here as 'immerse'.&lt;ref&gt;'Washing or ablution was frequently by immersion, indicated by either baptízō or níptō (3538), to wash.

The use of the term for cleansing vessels (as in Lev. 6:28 Aquila [cf. 6:21]; cf. baptismos in Mk. 7:4) does not prove the contrary, since vessels were normally cleansed by immersing them in water. The metaphorical uses of the term in the NT appear to take this for granted, e.g. the prophecy that the Messiah will baptise in Spirit and fire as a liquid (Matt. 3:11), the “baptism” of the Israelites in the cloud and the sea (1 Cor. 10:2), and in the idea of Jesus’ death as a baptism (Mk. 10:38f. baptisma; Lk. 12:50; cf.

The lexicographical works of Zodhiates and Balz &amp; Schneider likewise say that in the second of these two cases, {{Bibleref2|Mark|7:4}}, the verb ''baptizein'' means that, after coming from the market, the Pharisees only immersed their hands in collected water.&lt;ref&gt;'Washing or ablution was frequently by immersion, indicated by either baptízō or níptō (3538), to wash.

A possible additional use of the verb ''baptizein'' to relate to ritual washing is suggested by [[Peter Leithart]] (2007) who suggests that Paul's phrase &quot;Else what shall they do who are [[baptism for the dead|baptized for the dead]]?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;οἱ βαπτιζόμενοι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν&lt;/ref&gt; relates to Jewish ritual washing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Leithart ''The Baptized Body'' 2007 p136 &quot;Paul uses a distancing third person—“they” baptize for the dead. Why not “we”? Paul might well be referring to Jewish practices. Under the ceremonial laws of Torah, every washing was a washing “for the dead” (cf. Num. 19).

===Derived nouns===
Two nouns derived from the verb ''baptizo'' (βαπτίζω) appear in the New Testament: the masculine noun ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) and the neuter noun ''baptisma'' (βάπτισμα):

*''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) refers in {{bibleref2|Mark|7:4}} to a water-rite for the purpose of purification, washing, cleansing, of dishes;&lt;ref name=Arndt&gt;Arndt, W., Danker, F. W., &amp; Bauer, W. (2000). A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, (3rd ed.) (165).

F. (2000). Vol. 4: Analytical Lexicon of the Greek New Testament. Baker's Greek New Testament Library (87). Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Spiros Zodhiates]] when referring merely to the cleansing of utensils ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) is equated with ''rhantismos'' (ῥαντισμός, [[aspersion|&quot;sprinkling&quot;]]), found only in {{bibleref2|Hebrews|12:24}} and {{bibleref2|1Peter|1:2}}, a noun used to indicate the symbolic cleansing by the Old Testament priest.&lt;ref name=Zodhiates/&gt;

*''baptisma'' (βάπτισμα), which is a [[neologism]] appearing to originate in the New Testament, and probably should not be confused with the earlier Jewish concept of ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός),&lt;ref name=Zodhiates&gt;Zodhiates, S. (2000, c1992, c1993). The Complete Word Study Dictionary : New Testament (electronic ed.) (G908). Chattanooga, TN: AMG Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Later this is found only in writings by Christians.&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; In the New Testament, it appears at least 21 times:
:*13 times with regard to the rite practised by [[John the Baptist]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|3:7}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|21:25}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|1:4}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|11:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|3:3}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:29}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|20:4}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:22}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|10:37}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|13:24}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|18:25}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|19:3–4}})&lt;/ref&gt;
:*3 times with reference to the specific Christian rite&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Romans|6:4}}, {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|4:5}}, {{Bibleref2|1Peter|3:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4 times if the use in some inferior manuscripts in {{Bibleref2|Colossians|2:12}} is counted);

*Manuscript variation: In {{bibleref2|Colossians|2:12}}, some manuscripts have neuter noun ''baptisma'' (βάπτισμα), but some have masculine noun ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός), and this is the reading given in modern critical editions of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/online-bibeln/novum-testamentum-graece-na-27/lesen-im-bibeltext/bibelstelle/Kol%202/cache/d3cb350c68/#v12 [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]] 27th (latest) edition.&lt;/ref&gt; If this reading is correct, then this the only New Testament instance in which ''baptismos'' (βαπτισμός) is clearly used of Christian baptism, rather than of a generic washing, unless the opinion of some is correct that {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|6:2}} may also refer to Christian baptism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friberg&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Baptism}}

===Background in Jewish ritual===
{{Main|Mikvah}}

Although the term &quot;baptism&quot; is not used to describe the Jewish rituals, the purification rites in [[Halakha|Jewish laws]] and tradition, called mikvah, have some similarity to baptism, and the two have been linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theabrahamproject.com/resources/glossary-christian.html |last=Stoltz |first=Eric |title=A Christian Glossary: Baptism |publisher=The Abraham Project |year=2005 |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: &quot;The only conception of Baptism at variance with Jewish ideas is displayed in the declaration of John, that the one who would come after him would not baptize with water, but with the Holy Ghost (Mark i. 8; John i. 27).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and other Jewish texts, immersion in water for ritual purification was established for restoration to a condition of &quot;ritual purity&quot; in specific circumstances. For example, [[Jew]]s who (according to the [[Torah|Law of Moses]]) became ritually defiled by contact with a corpse had to use the [[mikvah]] before being allowed to participate in the Holy Temple. Immersion is required for [[Ger tzedek|converts to Judaism]] as part of their conversion. Immersion in the mikvah represents a change in status in regards to purification, restoration, and qualification for full religious participation in the life of the community, ensuring that the cleansed person will not impose uncleanness on property or its owners ({{bibleref2|Num.|19|HE}} and [[Babylonian Talmud]], [[Mishnah|Tractate]]''[[Hagigah|Chagigah]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;12). This change of status by the mikvah could be obtained repeatedly, while Christian baptism, like [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], is, in the general view of Christians, unique and not repeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Christa |last=Pongratz-Lippitt |date=May 5, 2007|title=Churches mutually recognise baptisms|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/9737 |journal=[[The Tablet]]|accessdate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Temple period]] the Greek noun ''baptismos'' was used to refer to ritual washing in [[Hellenistic Judaism]].

===John the Baptist===

[[John the Baptist]] adopted baptismal immersion as the central sacrament in his messianic movement,&lt;ref&gt;sacrament (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 20, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515366/sacrament&lt;/ref&gt; seen as a forerunner of Christianity.

===Early Christianity===
{{main|Baptism in early Christianity}}

{{expand section|date=December 2010}}

Baptism has been part of Christianity from the start, as shown by the many mentions in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Pauline epistles]]. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism. How explicit Jesus' intentions were and whether he envisioned a continuing, organized Church is a matter of dispute among scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;cross2005baptism&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Frank Leslie |last=Cross |authorlink=Frank Leslie Cross |coauthors=Elizabeth A.

===Early Middle Ages===
Infant baptism became common, alongside the developing theology of [[original sin]], displacing the earlier common practice of delaying baptism until the deathbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODWR&quot; /&gt; Against Pelagius, Augustine insisted that baptism was necessary for salvation even for virtuous people and for children.

[[File:Baptême Cathédrale de Troyes 290308.jpg|thumb|left|Baptism of [[Augustine of Hippo]] as represented in a sculptural group in [[Troyes]] cathedral (1549)]]

===Middle Ages===
The 12th century saw the meaning of the word &quot;[[sacrament]]&quot; narrowed down and restricted to seven rites, among them that of baptism, while other symbolic rites came to be called &quot;[[sacramentals]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cross2005sacrament&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Frank Leslie |last=Cross |authorlink=Frank Leslie Cross |coauthors=Elizabeth A.

In the period between the 12th and the 14th centuries, [[affusion]] became the usual manner of administering baptism in Western Europe, though immersion continued to be found in some places even as late as the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathen&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=William |last=Fanning |title=Baptism |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm |year=1907 |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Middle Ages, there was therefore considerable variation in the kind of facility required for baptism, from the baptismal pool large enough to immerse several adults simultaneously of the 13th century [[Baptistry (Pisa)|Baptistery at Pisa]], to the half-metre deep basin in the 6th century baptistery of the old [[Cologne Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Baptismal Font from the Cologne Baptistery |first=Sebastian |last=Ristow |publisher=[[Cologne Cathedral]] |url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/17216.html?&amp;L=1 |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both East and West considered washing with water and the Trinitarian baptismal formula necessary for administering the rite. [[Scholasticism]] referred to these two elements as the matter and the form of the sacrament, employing terms taken from the then prevailing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]]. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], while teaching the necessity of both elements, nowhere uses these philosophical terms when speaking of any of the sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;The words &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;form&quot; are not found in the index, nor do they appear in the definition of the sacraments given in [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P35.HTM section 1131]. A search of the electronic form of the book finds no instance of the word &quot;matter&quot;, and finds &quot;form&quot; only in the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4B.HTM section 1434], headed &quot;The Many Forms of Penance in Christian Life&quot;, which is not about the sacraments.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
{{Main|Lutheranism#Baptism}}

In the 16th century, [[Martin Luther]] considered baptism to be a sacrament. For the Lutherans, baptism is a &quot;[[Means of Grace#Lutheran theology|means of grace]]&quot; through which God creates and strengthens &quot;saving faith&quot; as the &quot;washing of regeneration&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Titus|3:5}} in which infants and adults are reborn.{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:3–7}} Since the creation of faith is exclusively God's work, it does not depend on the actions of the one baptized, whether infant or adult. Even though baptized infants cannot articulate that faith, Lutherans believe that it is present all the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2607 |title=Baptism and Its Purpose |publisher=[[Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod]] |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is [[Sola fide|faith alone]] that receives these divine gifts, Lutherans confess that baptism &quot;works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Martin |last=Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther |chapter=The Sacrament of Holy Baptism |chapterurl=http://www.bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.html#baptism |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |title=[[Luther's Small Catechism]] |year=2009 |origyear=1529}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the special section on infant baptism in his [[Luther's Large Catechism|Large Catechism]], Luther argues that infant baptism is God-pleasing because persons so baptized were reborn and sanctified by the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Martin |last=Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther |chapter=Of Infant Baptism |chapterurl=http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/6_baptism.html |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |year=2009 |origyear=1529 |title=[[Luther's Large Catechism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss Reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] differed with the Lutherans by denying sacramental status of baptism. Zwingli identified baptism and the Lord's supper as sacraments, but in the sense of an initiatory ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;cross2005baptism&quot; /&gt; His understanding of these sacraments as symbolic differentiated him from Luther.

[[File:Jordan river baptism cue.jpg|thumb|left||Awaiting submersion baptism in the [[Jordan river]]]]
Anabaptists (a word that means &quot;rebaptizers&quot;) rejected so thoroughly the tradition maintained by Lutherans as well as Catholics that they denied the validity of baptism outside their group. They &quot;rebaptized&quot; converts on the grounds that one cannot be baptized without wishing it, and an infant, who does not understand what happens in a baptism ceremony and who has no knowledge of the concepts of Christianity, is not really baptized. They saw as non-biblical the baptism of infants, who cannot confess their faith and who, not having yet committed any sins, are not in the same need of salvation. Anabaptists and other Baptist groups do not consider that they ''re''baptize those who have been baptized as infants, since, in their view, infant baptism is without effect. The [[Amish]], Restoration churches ([[Churches of Christ]]/ [[Christian Church]]), [[Hutterite]]s, [[Baptists]], [[Mennonite]]s and other groups descend from this tradition. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]] and most non-denominational churches share this view as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brackney&quot;&gt;Brackney, William H. &quot;Doing Baptism Baptist Style: Believer's Baptism.&quot; ''Baptist History and Heritage Society.''

{{Main|Immersion baptism}}
The word &quot;immersion&quot; is derived from [[late Latin]] ''immersionem'', a noun derived from the verb ''immergere'' (''in'' – &quot;into&quot; + ''mergere'' &quot;dip&quot;). In relation to baptism, some use it to refer to any form of dipping, whether the body is put completely under water or is only partly dipped in water; they thus speak of immersion as being either total or partial. Others, of the Anabaptist tradition, use &quot;immersion&quot; to mean exclusively plunging someone entirely under the surface of the water (submersion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=immersion Online Etymology Dictionary].

Immersion in this sense has been employed in West and East since at least the 2nd century and is the form in which baptism is generally depicted in early Christian art.

===Submersion===
{{Main|Immersion baptism}}
[[File:Russian-baptism.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Baptism by submersion in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] ([[Sophia Cathedral]], 2005)]]

The word Submersion comes from the [[late Latin]] (''sub-'' &quot;under, below&quot; + ''mergere'' &quot;plunge, dip&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/submerge Submerge – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (2007-04-25). Retrieved on 2010-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also sometimes called &quot;complete immersion&quot;. It is the form of baptism in which the water completely covers the candidate's body. Submersion is practiced in the Orthodox and several other Eastern Churches, as well as in the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. It is one of the methods provided in the [[Roman Rite]] of the baptism of infants.

===Apparel===
Until the [[Middle Ages]], most baptisms were performed with the candidates completely naked—as is evidenced by most of the early portrayals of baptism (some of which are shown in this article), and the early Church Fathers and other Christian writers. Typical of these is Cyril of Jerusalem who wrote &quot;On the Mysteries of Baptism&quot; in the 4th century (c. 350&amp;nbsp;AD):

{{quotation|Do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death? etc.…for you are not under the Law, but under grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber, were symbolic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. As soon, then, as you entered, you put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds.{{Bibleref2c|Col|3:9}} Having stripped yourselves, you were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree. For since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, you may no longer wear that old garment; I do not at all mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxes corrupt in the lusts of deceit.{{Bibleref2c|Eph|4:22}} May the soul which has once put him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on?{{Bibleref2c|SongofS|5:3|| Song of Sol 5:3}} O wondrous thing! You were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed; for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3. Then, when you were stripped, you were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4. After these things, you were led to the holy pool of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes. And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial of Christ.… And at the self-same moment you were both dying and being born;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lecture 20 (On the Mysteries. II. of Baptism) {{Bibleref2|Romans|6:3–14}} http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310120.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The symbolism is threefold:

1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth—&quot;by water and the Spirit&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}—the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism &quot;λοχείαν&quot;, i.e., giving birth, and &quot;new way of creation…from water and Spirit&quot; (&quot;to John&quot; speech 25,2), and later elaborates:

: {{Quotation|&quot;For nothing perceivable was handed over to us by Jesus; but with perceivable things, all of them however conceivable. This is also the way with the baptism; the gift of the water is done with a perceivable thing, but the things being conducted, i.e., the rebirth and renovation, are conceivable. For, if you were without a body, He would hand over these bodiless gifts as naked [gifts] to you. But because the soul is closely linked to the body, He hands over the perceivable ones to you with conceivable things &quot; (Chrysostom to Matthew., speech 82, 4, c. 390&amp;nbsp;A.D.)}}

2. The removal of clothing represented the &quot;image of putting off the old man with his deeds&quot; (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the &quot;new man,&quot; which is given by Jesus, can be put on.

3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture and tradition were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the &quot;old man&quot; of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.

Changing customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) and/or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a t-shirt—practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.

==Meaning and effects==
There are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a [[sacrament]], and speak of &quot;[[baptismal regeneration]]&quot;. Its importance may be understood by an informed knowledge of their interpretation of the most fundamental and basic meaning of the &quot;Mystical Body of Christ&quot; as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, and by Churches formed early during the [[Protestant Reformation]] such as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. For example, [[Martin Luther]] said:

{{quotation|To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save. No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to &quot;be saved&quot;. To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever.|''[[Luther's Large Catechism]]'', 1529}}

The [[Churches of Christ]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.

For Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 1212–13). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic Tradition holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood ([[martyrdom]]). [[Pope Pius XII]], in his encyclical ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi|The Mystical Body of Christ]]'', June 29, 1943, includes ''all baptized Christians'' as members of Christ, members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul. [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P12MYSTI.HTM (''Mystici Corporis Christi''–full text)] (''the bold emphasis provided here is not in the encyclical'')
{{quotation|
:'''18'''...''Through the '''waters of Baptism''' those who are born into this world dead in sin are not only '''born again and made members of the Church''', but being stamped with a spiritual seal they become able and fit to receive the other Sacraments.''

:'''27'''...''He also determined that through '''Baptism''' those who should believe would be '''incorporated in the Body of the Church'''.''

:'''30'''...''it was on the tree of the '''Cross''', finally, that He entered into possession of '''His Church, that is, of all the members of His Mystical Body'''; for they would not have been '''united to this Mystical Body through the waters of Baptism''' except by the salutary virtue of the '''Cross''', by which they had been already brought under the complete sway of Christ.''

:'''34''' ''That this '''Mystical Body which is the Church''' should be called '''Christ's''' is proved in the second place from the fact that He must be universally acknowledged as its actual '''Head'''. &quot;He,&quot; as St. Paul says, &quot;is the '''Head of the Body, the Church'''.&quot;'' (Col. 1:18)''|''Mystici Corporis Christi}}

By contrast, most [[Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]]), [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], and [[fundamentalist]] Protestant groups recognize baptism as an act of obedience to and identification with Jesus as the Christ. They say that baptism has no sacramental (saving) power, and only [[testimony|testifies]] outwardly to the invisible and internal operation of God's power, which is completely separate from the rite itself.

[[Churches of Christ]] consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God &quot;by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.66}} Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it &quot;is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Theology Matters&quot;&gt;Harold Hazelip, Gary Holloway, Randall J.

===Christian traditions===
[[File:BaptismalFontStRaphaelDubuque.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|The baptistry at [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]], [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], [[Iowa]]. This particular font was expanded in 2005 to include a small pool to provide for immersion baptism of adults. Eight-sided font architectures are common symbology of the day of Christ's Resurrection: the &quot;Eighth Day&quot;.]]

The [[liturgy]] of baptism in the [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] traditions makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of [[Noah]] and the passage of the [[Israelites]] through the [[Red Sea]] divided by [[Moses]]. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe that baptism is necessary for the cleansing of the taint of [[original sin]], and for that reason infant baptism is a common practice. The Eastern Churches ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as {{bibleref2|Matthew|19:14}}, which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these traditions, baptism is immediately followed by [[Chrismation]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]] at the next [[Divine Liturgy]], regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Nicodemos the Hagiorite]] |title=Concerning Thoughts |work=Exomologetarion |url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.

Eastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. [[Latin Rite]] Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Anglicans baptize by submersion, immersion, affusion or sprinkling.

According to a tradition, evidence of which can be traced back to at latest about the year 200,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Tertullian]] |editor=[[Philip Schaff]] |title=[[Ante-Nicene Fathers]] |chapter=Of the Persons to Whom, and the Time When, Baptism is to Be Administered |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.vi.iii.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsors or [[godparents]] are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.

Baptists argue that the Greek word {{polytonic|βαπτίζω}} originally meant &quot;to immerse&quot;. They interpret some Biblical passages concerning baptism as requiring submersion of the body in water. They also state that only submersion reflects the symbolic significance of being &quot;buried&quot; and &quot;raised&quot; with Christ.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:3–4}} Baptist Churches baptize in the name of the [[Trinity]]—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation; but rather that it is an act of Christian obedience.

Some &quot;full gospel&quot; charismatic churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostal]]s baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ, citing Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus as their authority.{{Bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}} They also point to several historical sources that maintain that the early church always baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus until development of the Trinity Doctrine in the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/name.htm |title=Baptism in Jesus' Name |publisher=Apostolic Network |accessdate=February 25, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apostolic-voice.org/tracts/water_baptism.htm |title=Water Baptism in Jesus' Name is Essential unto Salvation |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical statements===
In 1982 the [[World Council of Churches]] published the [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] paper ''[[Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry]]''. The preface of the document states:

{{quotation|Those who know how widely the churches have differed in doctrine and practice on baptism, Eucharist and ministry, will appreciate the importance of the large measure of agreement registered here. Virtually all the confessional traditions are included in the Commission's membership. That theologians of such widely different traditions should be able to speak so harmoniously about baptism, Eucharist and ministry is unprecedented in the modern ecumenical movement. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the Commission also includes among its full members theologians of the Catholic and other churches which do not belong to the World Council of Churches itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry.html#c10471 |title=Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry—Faith and Order Paper No. 111 |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |year=1982 |accessdate=March 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1997 document, ''Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism'', gave the views of a commission of experts brought together under the aegis of the World Council of Churches. It states:

{{quotation|…according to {{bibleref2|Acts|2:38}}, baptisms follow from Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus and lead those baptized to the receiving of Christ's Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and life in the community: &quot;They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers&quot;{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|2:42|RSV}} as well as to the distribution of goods to those in need.{{bibleref2c-nb|Acts|2:45}}}}

Those who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh.{{bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}} Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life{{bibleref2c|1Pe|1:3–21||1 Pe 1:3–21}} lead to purification and new birth.{{bibleref2c-nb|1Pe.|1:22–23||1 Pet. 1:22–23}} This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking [[Holy Communion|God's food]],{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:2–3||1 Pet. 2:2–3}} by participation in the life of the community—the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:4–10||1 Pet. 2:4–10}}—and by further moral formation.{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|2:11ff||1 Pet. 2:11 ff.}} At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit.{{bibleref2c-nb|1Peter|1:2||1 Pet. 1:2}} So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit.&lt;sup&gt;{{color|blue|cf. }}&lt;/sup&gt;{{bibleref2c|1Cor|12:13||1 Co 12:13}} In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with [[Nicodemus]] indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules. {{bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/index.php?id=2672 |title=Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |year=1997 |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity considerations by some churches===
[[File:Окрещённый ребёнок.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] priest greeting an infant and its [[godparents]] on the steps of the church at the beginning of the [[Sacred Mystery]] of Baptism.]]

Since the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran Churches teach that baptism is a [[sacrament]] that has actual spiritual and salvific effects, certain key criteria must be complied with for it to be valid, i.e., to actually have those effects. If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the Church's laws) but still valid.

One of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb &quot;baptize&quot; is essential.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathen&quot; /&gt; Catholics of [[Latin Rite]], Anglicans and Methodists use the form &quot;I baptize you….&quot; Eastern Orthodox and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] use the form &quot;This servant of Christ is baptized…&quot; or &quot;This person is baptized by my hands….&quot; These Churches generally recognize each other's form of baptism as valid.

Use of the [[Trinitarian formula]] &quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot; is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-[[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostals]].

Another essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some other liquid was used would not be considered valid.

Another requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention &quot;to do what the Church does&quot;, not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.

Some conditions expressly do not affect validity—for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. If the water does not flow on the skin, there is no ablution and so no baptism.

If for a medical or other legitimate reason the water cannot be poured on the head, it may be poured over another principal part of the body, such as the chest. In such case validity is uncertain and the person should later be [[conditional baptism|conditionally baptized]] in the prescribed manner.

For many communions, validity is not affected if a single submersion or pouring is performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.

According to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an [[sacramental character|indelible &quot;seal&quot;]] upon the soul of the baptized and therefore a person who has already been baptized cannot be validly baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the [[Donatist]]s who practiced rebaptism. The grace received in baptism is believed to operate ''ex opere operato'' and is therefore considered valid even if administered in heretical or schismatic groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODWR&quot; /&gt;

===Recognition by other denominations===
The [[Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Anglican]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodist]] Churches accept baptism performed by other denominations within this group as valid, subject to certain conditions, including the use of the Trinitarian formula. It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament of confirmation or chrismation, by being confirmed. In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, [[conditional baptism]] is administered, with a formula on the lines of &quot;If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you….&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 869]; cf. [http://books.google.com/books?id=JKgZEjvB5cEC New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law By John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J.], pp. 1057–1059.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the still recent past, it was common practice in the Roman Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete case. In the case of the major Protestant Churches, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestant tradition. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Churches of [[Eastern Christianity]], but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=June 5, 2001 |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for converts from other communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity)his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by [[chrismation]] or, in rare circumstances, [[confession]] of faith alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local [[canon law|canons]] and is the subject of some controversy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es recognise the validity of baptisms performed within the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Some also recognise baptisms performed by Catholic Churches. Any supposed baptism not performed using the Trinitarian formula is considered invalid.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the eyes of the Catholic Church, all Orthodox Churches, Anglican and Lutheran Churches, the baptism conferred by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html Declaration] of June 5, 2001 by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].&lt;/ref&gt; An article published together with the official declaration to that effect gave reasons for that judgment, summed up in the following words: &quot;The Baptism of the Catholic Church and that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints differ essentially, both for what concerns faith in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in whose name Baptism is conferred, and for what concerns the relationship to Christ who instituted it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/Theology/MORMBAP1.HTM |title=The Question Of The Validity Of Baptism Conferred In The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter |publisher=Ewtn.com |date=August 1, 2001 |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stresses that baptism must be administered by one having proper authority; consequently, the Church does not recognize the baptism of any other church as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;index=2&amp;sourceId=1af539b439c98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ |title=Topic Definition: Baptism |publisher=Lds.org |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Officiator===
[[File:Baptism in a front-end loader.jpg|thumb|left|A baptism administered by a U.S. Navy chaplain in Iraq]]

There is debate among Christian churches as to who can administer baptism. The examples given in the New Testament only show apostles and deacons administering baptism. Ancient Christian churches interpret this as indicating that baptism should be performed by the clergy except ''in extremis'', i.e., when the one being baptized is in immediate danger of death. Then anyone may baptize, provided, in the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the person who does the baptizing is a member of that Church, or, in the view of the Catholic Church, that the person, even if not baptized, intends to do what the Church does in administering the rite. Many Protestant churches see no specific prohibition in the biblical examples and permit any believer to baptize another.

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[canon law]] for the [[Latin Rite]] lays down that the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 861 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; but its administration is one of the functions &quot;especially entrusted to the [[priest|parish priest]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1T.HTM#18G canon 530]&lt;/ref&gt; If the person to be baptized is at least fourteen years old, that person's baptism is to be referred to the bishop, so that he can decide whether to confer the baptism himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 863]&lt;/ref&gt; If no ordinary minister is available, a [[catechist]] or some other person whom the local [[ordinary]] has appointed for this purpose may licitly do the baptism; indeed in a case of necessity ''any'' person (irrespective of that person's religion) who has the requisite intention may confer the baptism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 861 §2]&lt;/ref&gt;  By &quot;a case of necessity&quot; is meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. &quot;The requisite intention&quot; is, at the minimum level, the intention &quot;to do what the Church does&quot; through the rite of baptism.

In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved to the Parish Priest or to another priest to whom he or the local [[ordinary|hierarch]] grants permission, a permission that can be presumed if in accordance with canon law. However, &quot;in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/__PIT.HTM |title=Canon 677 |work=[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] |year=1990 |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. They require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ware |first=Kallistos |authorlink=Timothy Ware |year=1964 |title=The Orthodox Church |page=285 |location=New York City |publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin Rite Catholic Church does not insist on this condition, considering that the effect of the sacrament, such as membership of the Church, is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. For the Orthodox, while Baptism ''in extremis'' may be administered by a deacon or any lay-person, if the newly baptized person survives, a priest must still perform the other prayers of the Rite of Baptism, and administer the [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] of [[Chrismation]].

The discipline of [[Anglicanism]] and Lutherans is similar to that of the Latin Rite Catholic Church. For [[Methodists]] and many other [[Protestant]] denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion.

Newer movements of Protestant [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches, particularly non-denominational, have begun to allow those persons most instrumental in one's faith to baptize.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], only a man who has been ordained to the [[Aaronic Priesthood]] holding the priesthood office of [[Priest (Mormonism)|Priest]] or higher office in the [[Melchizedek Priesthood]] may administer baptism.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds.org&quot;&gt;&quot;Aaronic Priesthood&quot;, ''Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders’ Guidebook'', © 1992, 2001 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc., [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=true&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=9a230f9856c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=198bf4b13819d110VgnVCM1000003a94610aRCRD#38 As Retrieved September 16, 2009], &quot;Brethren who hold the Aaronic Priesthood have authority to perform certain priesthood ordinances.

A [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] baptism is performed by a &quot;dedicated male&quot; adherent.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated480&quot;&gt;&quot;Questions From Readers&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480, &quot;In connection with baptism, it may also be noted that a baptism may be performed by a dedicated male even though no other human witnesses are present.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The General Priesthood Today&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147, &quot;Because he is a minister, any competent male member is called on to perform funerals, baptisms and weddings, and to conduct the service in annual commemoration of the Lord’s death.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Only in extraordinary circumstances would a &quot;dedicated&quot; baptizer be unbaptized (see section ''[[#Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]]'').

[[Anabaptist]]s (&quot;re-baptizers&quot;) and [[Baptists]] promote adult baptism, or &quot;[[believer's baptism]]&quot;. Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as Savior.

Early Anabaptists were given that name because they re-baptized persons who they felt had not been properly baptized, having received infant baptism, sprinkling, or baptism of any sort by another denomination.

Anabaptists perform baptisms indoors in a baptismal font, a swimming pool, or a bathtub, or outdoors in a creek or river. Baptism memorializes the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6}} Baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign or testimony that the person's sins have already been washed away by the cross of Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;London&quot;&gt;''London Baptist Confession of 1644.''

===Baptist===
For the majority of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.{{Bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}} It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to the believer's faith in the final resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;BFM&quot;&gt;&quot;The Baptist Faith and Message,&quot; Southern Baptist Convention.

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God &quot;by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.66}} Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it &quot;is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Theology Matters&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.112}} While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a &quot;sacrament&quot;, their view of it can legitimately be described as &quot;sacramental.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.66}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Baptism, Why Wait?&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.186}} They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself,&lt;ref name=&quot;Baptism, Why Wait?&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.186}} and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than just a symbol of conversion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baptism, Why Wait?&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.184}} A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as just a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as &quot;the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.66}} There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to &quot;reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Baptism&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.66}}

Because of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Foster&quot;&gt;Douglas A.

===Reformed and Covenant theology view===
{{Main|Covenant Theology#Baptism}}

[[Infant Baptism|Paedobaptist]] Covenant theologians see the administration of all the biblical covenants, including the New Covenant, as including a principle of [[family|familial]], corporate inclusion or &quot;generational succession&quot;. The biblical covenants between God and man include signs and seals that visibly represent the realities behind the covenants. These visible signs and symbols of God's covenant redemption are administered in a corporate manner (for instance, to households), not in an exclusively individualistic manner.

Baptism is considered by the Reformed churches as the visible sign of entrance into the New Covenant and therefore may be administered individually to new believers making a public profession of [[faith]]. Paedobaptists further believe this extends corporately to the households of believers which typically would include children, or individually to children or infants of believing parents (see [[Infant baptism]]). In this view, baptism is thus seen as the functional replacement and sacramental equivalent of the Abrahamic rite of [[History of male circumcision#Male circumcision in the Greco-Roman world|circumcision]] and symbolizes the internal cleansing from [[sin]], among other things.

===Catholic===
In Catholic teaching, baptism is believed to be usually essential for salvation.&lt;ref name=&quot;can849&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2T.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 849 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching dates back to the teachings and practices of 1st-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until Huldrych Zwingli denied the necessity of baptism, which he saw as merely a sign granting admission to the Christian community.&lt;ref name=&quot;cross2005baptism&quot;/&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that &quot;Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican&quot; /&gt; Accordingly, a person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. This teaching is based on Jesus' words in the [[Gospel according to John]]: &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5|RSV}}

Catholics are baptized in water, by submersion, immersion or affusion, in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&lt;ref&gt;''Ordo initiationis christanae adultorum'', editio typica, Vatican City, Typis polyglottis vaticanis, 1972, pg 92, cf Lateran IV ''De Fide Catholica'', DS 802, cf Florence, ''Decretum pro Armeniis'', DS, 1317.&lt;/ref&gt;—not three gods, but [[Trinity|one God subsisting in three Persons]]. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three &quot;masks&quot; or manifestations of one divine being. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three &quot;Persons&quot; of the one God. Adults can also be baptized through the [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]].

It is claimed that [[Pope Stephen I]], [[St. Ambrose]] and [[Pope Nicholas I]] declared that baptisms in the name of &quot;Jesus&quot; only as well as in the name of &quot;Father, Son and Holy Spirit&quot; were valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathen&quot; /&gt; Current [[canonical law]] requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity.&lt;ref name=&quot;can849&quot; /&gt;

The Church recognizes two equivalents of baptism with water: &quot;baptism of blood&quot; and &quot;[[baptism of desire]]&quot;. Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are [[martyr]]ed for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to [[catechumen]]s who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This ''Baptism of blood'', like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Catholic Church holds that non-Christians who seek God with a sincere heart and, moved by grace, try to do God's will as they know it through the dictates of conscience can also be saved without water baptism as they are said to desire it implicitly.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Catechism, 1260&lt;/ref&gt; As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; &quot;the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God&quot; (Catechism, 1261).

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that baptism should be performed by complete immersion (submersion) only when an individual is old enough to understand its significance. They believe that water baptism is an outward symbol that a person has made an unconditional dedication through Jesus Christ to do the will of God. They consider baptism to constitute ordination as a minister.&lt;ref&gt;''Jet'' magazine, Aug 4, 1955, page 26 [http://books.google.com/books?id=xbEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22jehovah%27s+witnesses%22 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective candidates for baptism must express their desire to be baptized well in advance of a planned baptismal event, to allow for congregation [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] to assess their suitability.&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Elders approve candidates for baptism if the candidates are considered to understand what is expected of members of the religion and to demonstrate sincere dedication to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most baptisms among Jehovah's Witnesses are performed at scheduled assemblies and conventions by elders and ministerial servants&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1970, page 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The General Priesthood Today&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses, page 215, &quot;Baptisms are usually performed at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely occur at local [[Kingdom Hall]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated480&quot;&gt;&quot;Questions From Readers&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to baptism, at the conclusion of a pre-baptism talk, candidates must affirm two questions:&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower June 1, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
# On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will?
# Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah's Witnesses in association with God's spirit-directed organization?}}

Only baptized males may baptize new members. Baptizers and candidates wear swimsuits or other informal clothing for baptism, but are directed to avoid clothing that is considered undignified or revealing.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;&gt;&quot;“God’s Prophetic Word” District Conventions&quot;, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 1999, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Questions From Readers&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1973, page 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Question Box&quot;, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', June 1993, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, candidates are individually immersed by a single baptizer,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;/&gt; unless a candidate has special circumstances such as a physical [[disability]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Watchtower 1986, page 31&quot;&gt;&quot;Questions From Readers&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1986, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; In circumstances of extended isolation, a qualified candidate's dedication and stated intention to become baptized may serve to identify him as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, even if immersion itself must be delayed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Questions From Readers&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1973, pages 479–480&lt;/ref&gt; In rare instances, unbaptized males who had stated such an intention have reciprocally baptized each other, with both baptisms accepted as valid.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands&quot;, ''1987 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who had been baptized in the 1930s and 1940s by female Witnesses, such as in concentration camps, were later re-baptized but recognized their original baptism dates.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated480&quot; /&gt;

===Mormonism===
[[File:Mormon baptism circa 1850s.png|thumb|right|175px|A Mormon baptism, circa the 1850s]]
{{Main|Baptism (Mormonism)}}

In [[Mormonism]], baptism has the main purpose of remitting the [[sin]]s of the participant. It is followed by [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]], which inducts the person into membership in the church and constitutes a [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]]. Latter-day Saints believe that baptism must be by full immersion, and by a precise ritualized ordinance: if some part of the participant is not fully immersed, or the ordinance was not recited verbatim, the ritual must be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=2ca59207f7c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=ba805f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B: Performing Priesthood Ordinances], §Baptism.&lt;/ref&gt;
It typically occurs in a [[baptismal font]]. In addition, Latter-day Saints do not believe a baptism is valid unless it is performed by a Latter-day Saint [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]] or [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gs/b/6 Guide to the Scriptures: Baptism, Baptize], §''Proper authority''.&lt;/ref&gt; Authority is passed down through a form of [[apostolic succession]]. All new converts to the faith must be baptized or [[rebaptism (Mormonism)|re-baptized]]. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of [[Jesus]]' death, burial and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/b/7 Bible Dictionary: Baptism], ¶2.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also symbolic of the baptized individual discarding their &quot;natural&quot; self and donning a new identity as a disciple of Jesus.

According to Latter-day Saint theology, [[faith]] and [[repentance]] are prerequisites to baptism. The ritual does not cleanse the participant of [[original sin]], as Latter-day Saints do not believe the doctrine of original sin. Mormonism rejects [[infant baptism]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Book of Mormon]], [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moro/8/4-23#4 Moroni 8:4–23].&lt;/ref&gt; and baptism must occur after the [[age of accountability]], defined in Latter-day Saint scripture as eight years old.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/68/25,27#25 68:25, 27].&lt;/ref&gt;

Latter-day Saint theology also teaches [[baptism for the dead]] in which deceased ancestors are baptized vicariously by the living, and believe that their practice is what Paul wrote of in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:29}}. This occurs in [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|Latter-day Saint temples]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=1ec52f2324d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ Baptisms for the Dead]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-practitioners==
===Quakers===
[[Quakers]] (members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]]) do not believe in the baptism of either children or adults with water, rejecting all forms of outward [[sacraments]] in their religious life. [[Robert Barclay]]'s ''Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:

{{quotation|&quot;I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire&quot;.{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:11}} Here John mentions two manners of baptizings and two different baptisms, the one with water, and the other with the Spirit, the one whereof he was the minister of, the other whereof Christ was the minister of: and such as were baptized with the first were not therefore baptized with the second: &quot;I indeed baptize you, but he shall baptize you.&quot; Though in the present time they were baptized with the baptism of water, yet they were not as yet, but were to be, baptized with the baptism of Christ.|[[Robert Barclay]], 1678&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html |title=Apology, Proposition 12 |publisher=Qhpress.org |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Robert Barclay|Barclay]] argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which [[Quakers]] argue is meaningless.

===Salvation Army===
The [[Salvation Army]] does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward [[sacraments]]. [[William Booth]] and [[Catherine Booth]], the founders of the [[Salvation Army]], believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself, whereas what they believed was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the [[Salvation Army]] does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |title=Why does The Salvation Army not baptise or hold communion? |publisher=The Salvation Army |date=February 28, 1987 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperdispensationalism===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from Baptism--&gt;
There are some Christians who carry [[dispensationalism]] to such an extreme that they accept only Paul's Epistles as applicable for the church today.{{POV-statement|date=December 2009}} As a result, they do not accept baptism or the Lord's Supper, since these are not found in the Prison Epistles. They also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=David M. |last=Havard |title=Are We Hyper-Dispensationalists? |url=http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html |publisher=Berean Bible Society |accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperdispensationalism|Hyperdispensationalists]] assert:

*The great commission&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref2|Matthew|28:18–20}}]&lt;/sup&gt; and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.

*The baptism of {{bibleref2|Acts|2:36–38}} is Peter's call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of the Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.

Water baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism{{Bibleref2c|1cor|12:13||1 Cor 12:13}} foretold by John the Baptist.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|3:16}}, {{bibleref2|John|1:33}}, {{bibleref2|Matt|3:11}}{{bibleref2|Acts|1:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the &quot;baptism of the [[Holy Spirit]]&quot;.{{bibleref2c|Ac|11:15–16}} This, &quot;spirit&quot; baptism, however, is unlikely given the texts and facts that the baptisms of the Eunuch{{bibleref2c|Ac|8:36}} and the household of Cornelius{{bibleref2c-nb|Acts|10:47–48}} were explicitly in water. Further evidence points to the humanly administered Great Commission which was to last until the end of the world.{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:19–20}} Therefore, the baptism the Ephesians underwent was water by context.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Ephesians|5:26}}; {{bibleref2|Acts|19:1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Holy Spirit Baptism is recorded as only occurring twice in all the book of Acts to selected individuals.{{bibleref2c|Ac|2:1–4}} {{bibleref2c-nb|Acts|10:44–46}} Finally, it is argued that only Jesus possessed the power to baptize with the Holy Spirit and with Fire which eliminates any mortal ever doing.{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:11}} {{bibleref2c|Lk|3:16}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;John answered, saying to all, &quot;I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire&quot;{{bibleref2c|Lk|3:16|NKJV}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many in this group also argue that John's promised [[Baptized by fire|baptism by fire]] is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|3:12}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:17}}, {{bibleref2|2|Pe|3:10||2 Peter 3:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John, as he said &quot;baptized with water&quot;, as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples.{{bibleref2c|Jn|4:1–2}} Unlike Jesus' first Apostles, Paul, his Apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|1:17||1 Co 1:17}} but did occasionally baptize, for instance in Corinth{{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|1:14–16}} and in Philippi,{{bibleref2c|Ac|16:13}} in the same manner as they.&lt;sup&gt;cf.&lt;/sup&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}} He also taught the spiritual significance of the submerging in baptism and how one contacts the atoning death of Christ in such.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:4}}

Other Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary only for a short period between Christ's ascension and mid-Acts. The great commission {{bibleref2c|Mt|28:18–20}} and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation{{bibleref2c|Mk|16:16}} {{bibleref2c|1Peter|3:21||1 Pe 3:21}} or the Holy Spirit{{bibleref2c|Ac|2:38}} until they were baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul.{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|9:17–18}} Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|10:44–48}} is worthy of note.

| [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]]
| Baptism is necessary for salvation as part of the entire baptismal arrangement: as an expression of obedience to Jesus' command (Matthew 28:19–20), as a public symbol of the saving faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ (Romans 10:10), and as an indication of repentance from dead works and the dedication of one's life to Jehovah. (1 Peter 2:21) However, baptism does not guarantee salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Worship the Only True God'', published by Jehovah's Witnesses (2002, 2006), &quot;Chapter 12: The Meaning of Your Baptism&quot;, p. 118, &quot;It would be a mistake to conclude that baptism is in itself a guarantee of salvation. It has value only if a person has truly dedicated himself to Jehovah through Jesus Christ and thereafter carries out God’s will, being faithful to the end.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

So even when unusual steps are necessary because of a person’s condition, he should be baptized if at all possible. …In modern times Jehovah’s Witnesses have arranged for baptisms at conventions. [However], fully valid baptisms have even been performed locally in large home bathtubs. …Of course, it might be that in some extreme case baptism would seem absolutely impossible for the time being.

He taught that in baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the &quot;ordinary means&quot; that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective.
&lt;br&gt;
''Baptism as Forgiveness of Sin''. In baptism God offers and we accept the forgiveness of our sin (Acts 2:38). With the pardoning of sin which has separated us from God, we are justified—freed from the guilt and penalty of sin and restored to right relationship with God. This reconciliation is made possible through the atonement of Christ and made real in our lives by the work of the Holy Spirit. We respond by confessing and repenting of our sin, and affirming our faith that Jesus Christ has accomplished all that is necessary for our salvation. Faith is the necessary condition for justification; in baptism, that faith is professed. God's forgiveness makes possible the renewal of our spiritual lives and our becoming new beings in Christ. &lt;br&gt;
''Baptism as New Life''. Baptism is the sacramental sign of new life through and in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Variously identified as regeneration, new birth, and being born again, this work of grace makes us into new spiritual creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). We die to our old nature which was dominated by sin and enter into the very life of Christ who transforms us. Baptism is the means of entry into new life in Christ (John 3:5; Titus 3:5), but new birth may not always coincide with the moment of the administration of water or the laying on of hands. Our awareness and acceptance of our redemption by Christ and new life in him may vary throughout our lives. But, in whatever way the reality of the new birth is experienced, it carries out the promises God made to us in our baptism.|accessdate = 2007–08–02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;By Water and the Spirit – Personal Faith&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&amp;mid=992| title = By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|quote= The United Methodist Church does not accept either the idea that only believer's baptism is valid or the notion that the baptism of infants magically imparts salvation apart from active personal faith.|accessdate = 2007–08–02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This initiation of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to [[catechumen]]ical practices in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Lars |last=Hartman |title=Into the Name of the Lord Jesus: Baptism in the Early Church |publisher=[[T&amp;T Clark]] |location=[[Edinburgh]] |year=1997 |page=4 |isbn=0-567-08589-9 |oclc=38189287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baptism of objects===
[[File:USS Dewey christening.jpg|200 px|right|Christening of [[USS Dewey]]]]

The word &quot;baptism&quot; or &quot;christening&quot; is sometimes used to describe the inauguration of certain objects for use.

*The name ''Baptism of Bells'' has been given to the blessing of ([[bell (instrument)|musical]], especially [[Church bell|church]]) bells, at least in France, since the 11th century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with [[holy water]] by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming [[censer]] is placed under it and the bishop prays that these [[sacramentals]] of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.
*''Baptism of Ships'': at least since the time of the [[Crusades]], rituals have contained a blessing for [[ship]]s. The [[priest]] begs God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail in. The [[ship]] is usually sprinkled with [[holy water]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cathen&quot; /&gt;

===&quot;Debaptism&quot;===
Mainline Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[atheism|rejecting religion]] entirely.

In addition to ''de facto'' renunciation through [[apostasy]], [[heresy]], or [[schism (religion)|schism]], the Roman Catholic Church envisages the possibility of [[actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica|formal defection from the Church]] through a decision manifested personally, consciously and freely, and in writing, to the competent church authority, who is then to judge whether it is genuinely a case of &quot;true separation from the constitutive elements of the life of the Church ... (by) an act of apostasy, heresy or schism.&quot;&lt;ref name=PCLT&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/intrptxt/documents/rc_pc_intrptxt_doc_20060313_actus-formalis_en.html Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, ''Actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica'']&lt;/ref&gt; A formal defection of this kind is then noted in the register of the person's baptism, an annotation that, like those of marriage or ordination, is independent of the fact of the baptism and is not an actual &quot;debaptism&quot;, even if the person who formally defects from the Catholic Church has also defected from the Christian religion. The fact of having been baptized remains a fact and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a lasting [[sacramental character|seal or character]] that &quot;is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or fact of defection.&quot;&lt;ref name=PCLT/&gt;

Some atheist organizations offer certificates of &quot;debaptism&quot;. One such group is the [http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/06/debaptism Italian Union of Rationalists and Agnostics]. Another is the British [[National Secular Society]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7941817.stm Atheists call for &quot;debaptism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/mar/20/religion-atheism The peculiar practice of debaptism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepdic.com/debaptism.html Skeptic's Dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Not even those who provide the certificates consider them as having legal or canonical effect.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The society's president, Terry Sanderson, says the certificate is not designed to be taken too seriously, and he suggests displaying it in the loo&quot; ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7941817.stm Atheists call for &quot;debaptism&quot;).]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of England]] refuses to take any action on presentation of the certificate, while the Roman Catholic Church treats it as any other act of renunciation of the Catholic faith and, if it considers it seriously meant, makes the appropriate annotation in the baptismal register.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Using a [[hair dryer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crosswalk.com/news/religiontoday/11606299/ 'Debaptism' Takes Root with American Atheists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://drjimsthinkingshop.com/2009/07/24/debaptism-cmon-out-the-blowdryer-is-fine/ Debaptism: C’mon out, the blowdryer is fine!]&lt;/ref&gt; some atheist groups have conducted tongue-in-cheek &quot;debaptism&quot; ceremonies, not intended to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Participants acknowledge the silliness and celebrate freely because the mock ceremony is a very informal [...] While it is true that a ceremony to affirm one’s atheism is unnecessary, it’s also true that human beings are social creatures who simply enjoy being silly from time to time and having fun at celebratory social gatherings&quot;.

'''Bocce''' (sometimes anglicized as '''bocci''' or '''boccie''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bocce.org/rules.html bocce.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bocci TheFreeDictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bocci+ball TheFreeDictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikipatents.com/5480026.html US Patent #5480026]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modern-ruins.com/buehler/aboveny/bocci.html modernruins.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Ball Sports|ball sport]] belonging to the [[boules]] sport family, closely related to [[bowls]] and [[pétanque]] with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the [[Roman Empire]]. Developed into its present form in [[Italy]] (where it is called ''Bocce'', the plural of the Italian word ''boccia'' which means &quot;ball&quot;), it is played around [[Europe]] and also in overseas areas that have received Italian migrants, including [[Australia]], [[North America]] and [[South America]] (where it is known as ''bochas''; ''bolas criollas'' in Venezuela, ''bocha'' (the sport) in Brazil), initially amongst the migrants themselves but slowly becoming more popular with their descendants and the wider community. The sport is also very popular in [[Slovenia]] (known as ''balinanje''&lt;ref name=slo&gt;[http://portal.balinarska-zveza.si/ Bocce Association of Slovenia]&lt;/ref&gt;). In Southern [[France]] the sport is also popular and known as [[Boule Lyonnaise]]. 

==Rules and play==
Bocce is traditionally played on natural soil and asphalt courts {{convert|27.5|m}} in length and {{convert|2.5|to|4|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 4 - Specifications of the Court]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bocce balls can be made of [[metal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 1 - The Bowls]&lt;/ref&gt; or various kinds of [[plastic]]. Unlike [[lawn bowls]], bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.   [[Image:Boccia-set.PNG.png|framed|Red scores 2 points]]
A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the '''jack''' (called a '''boccino''' or '''pallino''' in some areas), from one end of the court into a zone {{convert|5|m|ft}} in length, ending {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} from the far end of the court. If they miss twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.

The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does ''not'' have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame.  The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team.  The length of a game varies by region, but is typically from 7 to 13 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch2.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 2 - Article 8 - Points to be Made and the Duration of the Match]&lt;/ref&gt;

Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position.  Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.

'''Beatmatching''' is a [[disc jockey]] technique of [[pitch shift]]ing or [[timestretching]] a track to match its [[tempo]] to that of the currently playing track e.g. the kicks and snares in two house records hit at the same time when both records are played simultaneously.  Beatmatching is a component of [[beatmixing|mixing]] which employs beatmatching combined with equalization, attention to phrasing and track selection in an attempt to make a single mix that flows together and has a good structure.

The technique was developed to keep the people from leaving the dancefloor at the end of the song.  These days it is considered basic among DJs in [[electronic dance music]] genres, and it is standard practice in clubs to keep the constant beat through the night, even if DJs change in the middle.

Beatmatching is no longer considered a novelty, and new digital mixers have made the technique much easier to master.

==Technique==

The beatmatching technique consists of the following steps:

# While a record is playing, beatmatch a new record to it, using headphones for monitoring.  Use [[gain]] (or ''trim'') control on the mixer to match the levels of the two records.
# Restart and [[slip-cueing|slip-cue]] the new record at the right time, begin the new record on beat with the record currently playing.  Pay attention to track structures; careful [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] can make the mix seamless.
# If the beat on the new record hits before the beat on the current record then the new record is too fast, reduce the pitch and manually slow the speed of the new record to bring the beats back in sync. 
# If the beat on the new record hits after the beat on the current record then the new record is too slow, increase the pitch and manually increase the speed of the new record to bring the beats back in sync.
# Continue this process until the two records are in sync with each other, it can be difficult to sync the two records perfectly, so manual adjustment of the records is necessary to maintain the beat synchronization. 
# Before fading in the new track, check that the beats of two tracks match by listening to both channels together in the headphones, as the sound from the speakers can reach you with a delay.
# Gradually, fade in parts of the new track while fading out the old track.  While in the mix, ensure that the tracks are still synchronized, adjusting the records if needed.
# The fade can be repeated several times, for example, from the first track, fade to the second track, then back to first, then to second again.

===Pitch and tempo===

The [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of a track are normally linked together: spin a disc 5% faster and both pitch and tempo will be 5% higher.  However, some modern DJ software can change pitch and tempo independently using [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|time-stretching and pitch-shifting]], allowing [[harmonic mixing]]. This technique is referred to as beatmatching.

==History==
Beatmatching was invented by [[Francis Grasso]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Initially he was counting the tempo with a [[metronome]] and looking for records with the same tempo.  Later a mixer was built for him by [[Alex Rosner]] which let him listen to any channel in the headphones independently of what was playing on the speakers; this became the defining feature of [[DJ mixer]]s.  That and turntables with [[pitch control]] enabled him to mix tracks with different tempo by changing the pitch of the ''cued'' (redirected to headphones) track to match its tempo with the track being played by ear.  Essentially, the technique he originated hasn't changed since.

These days beatmatching is considered central to DJing, and features making it possible are a requirement for DJ-oriented players.  In 1978, the [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200MK2]] turntable was released, whose comfortable and precise sliding pitch control and high torque [[Direct-drive turntable|direct drive]] motor made beatmatching easier and it became the standard among DJs.  With the advent of the compact disc, DJ-oriented [[Compact Disc player]]s with pitch control and other features enabling beatmatching (and sometimes [[scratching]]), dubbed [[CDJ]]s, were introduced by various companies.  More recently, software with similar capabilities has been developed to allow manipulation of [[digital audio]] files stored on computers using turntables with special vinyl records (e.g. [[Final Scratch]], [[M-Audio Torq]], [[Serato Scratch Live]]) or computer interface (e.g. [[Traktor DJ Studio]], [[Mixxx]], [[Virtual DJ]]). Other software including algorithmic beatmatching is [[Ableton Live]], which allows for realtime music manipulation and deconstruction, or [[Mixmeister]], a DJ Mixset creation tool.  Freeware software such as [[Rapid Evolution]] can detect the [[beats per minute]] and determine the percent BPM difference between songs. 

The change from pure hardware to software is on the rise, and big DJs are introducing new equipment to their kits such as the [[laptop]], and dropping the difficulty of carrying hundreds of CDs with them. The creation of the mp3-player allowed DJs to have an alternative tool for DJIng. Limitations with mp3-player DJing equipment has meant that only second generation equipment such as the IDJ2 or the Cortex Dmix-300 have the pitch control that alters tempo and allows for beatmatching on a digital music player. However, recent additions to the Pioneer CDJ family, such as the [[CDJ-400]], allow mp3-player and other digital storage devices (such as external hard drives and USB memory sticks) to be connected to the CDJ device via USB. This allows the DJ to make use of the beatmatching capabilities of the CDJ unit whilst playing digital music files from the mp3-player or other storage device.

'''Beltane''' or '''Beltaine''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|ɛ|l|t|ei|n}}) is the anglicised spelling of [[Old Irish]] ''''' Bel(l)taine''''' or ''''' Beltine''''' ([[Irish language|modern Irish]] ''Bealtaine''  {{IPA-ga|ˈbʲal̪ˠt̪ˠənʲə|}}, [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Bealltainn''  {{IPA-ga|ˈbʲal̪ˠt̪ˠənʲ|}}), the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for either the month of [[May]] or the festival that takes place on [[1 May|first day of May]].

Bealtaine was historically a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] festival celebrated in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]].
Bealtaine and [[Samhain]] were the leading terminal dates of the civil year in medieval Ireland, though the latter festival was the more important. The festival regained popularity during the [[Celtic Revival]] and remains observed in the [[Celtic Nations]] and the [[Irish diaspora]].

In [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]], the month of May is known as ''Mí Bhealtaine'' or ''Bealtaine'', and the festival as ''Lá Bealtaine'' ('day of Bealtaine' or, 'May Day'). In [[Scottish Gaelic]], the month is known as either ''(An) Cèitean'' or ''a' Mhàigh'', and the festival is known as ''Latha Bealltainn'' or simply ''Bealltainn''. The feast was also known as ''Céad Shamhain'' or ''Cétshamhainin'' from which the word ''Céitean'' derives. Beltane was formerly spelled 'Bealtuinn' in Scottish Gaelic; in Manx it is spelt 'Boaltinn' or 'Boaldyn'. In Modern Irish, ''Oidhche Bealtaine'' or ''Oíche Bealtaine'' is May Eve, and ''Lá Bealtaine'' is May Day. ''Mí na Bealtaine'', or simply ''Bealtaine'' is the name of the month of May.

In [[Neopaganism]], Bealtaine is considered a [[cross-quarter day]], marking the midpoint in the [[Sun]]'s progress between the [[spring equinox]] and summer [[solstice]].  The [[astronomy|astronomical]] date for this midpoint is closer to 5 May or 7 May, but this can vary from year to year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dames2&quot;&gt;Dames (1992) p.214&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Celtic period===
According to [[Nora Chadwick]], in [[Celtic Ireland]] &quot;Beltine (or Beltaine) was celebrated on 1 May, a spring-time festival of optimism.  Fertility ritual again was important, in part perhaps connecting with the waxing power of the sun, symbolized by the lighting of fires through which livestock were driven, and around which the people danced in a sunwise direction&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Chadwick, Nora, The Celts, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Irish mythology]], the beginning of the summer season for the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] started at Bealtaine. Great bonfires would mark a time of purification and transition, heralding in the season in the hope of a good harvest later in the year, and were accompanied with ritual acts to protect the people from any harm by [[Other World|Otherworldly]] spirits, such as the ''[[Aos Sí]]''. Like the festival of [[Samhain]], opposite Beltane on 31 October Beltane was also a time when the Otherworld was seen as particularly close at hand.  Excavations at Uisnech in the 20th century provided evidence of large fires taking place. &lt;ref name=&quot;MacKillop&quot;&gt;MacKillop, James (1998) ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-280120-1 pp.39, 400–402, 421&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
In [[medieval Ireland]], the main Bealtaine fire was held on the central hill of [[Uisneach]] 'the navel of Ireland', one of the ritual centres of the country, which is located in what is now [[County Westmeath]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
The lighting of bonfires on ''Oidhche Bhealtaine'' seems to have survived to the present day only in [[County Limerick]], especially in [[Limerick]] itself, as their yearly bonfire night and in [[County Wicklow]] in [[Arklow]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, though some cultural groups have expressed an interest in reviving the custom at Uisneach and perhaps at the [[Hill of Tara]].&lt;ref&gt;Aideen O'Leary reports (&quot;An Irish Apocryphal Apostle: Muirchú's Portrayal of Saint Patrick&quot; ''The Harvard Theological Review'' '''89'''.3 [July 1996:287–301] p. 289) that, for didactic and dramatic purposes, the festival of Beltane, as presided over by Patrick's opponent King [[Lóegaire mac Néill]], was moved to the eve of Easter and from Uisneach to Tara by [[Muirchu moccu Machtheni|Muirchú]] (late seventh century) in his ''Vita sancti Patricii''; he describes the festival as ''in Temora, istorium Babylone'' ('at Tara, their Babylon'). However there is no authentic connection of Tara with Babylon, nor any know connection of Tara with Beltane.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beltane marked the beginning of the pastoral summer season when the herds of livestock were driven out to the summer pastures and mountain grazing lands. Due to the change from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]], ''Bealltainn'' in Scotland was commonly celebrated on 15 May while in Ireland ''Sean Bhealtain'' / &quot;Old May&quot; began about the night of 11 May.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The lighting of [[bonfire]]s on ''Oidhche Bhealtaine'' ('the eve of ''Bealtaine''') on mountains and hills of ritual and political significance was one of the main activities of the festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danaher&quot;&gt;Danaher, Kevin (1972) ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs'' Dublin, Mercier. ISBN 1-85635-093-2 pp. 86–127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chadwick&quot;&gt;Chadwick, Nora (1970) ''The Celts'' London, Penguin. ISBN 0-14-021211-6 p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Scottish Gaelic]], ''Latha Buidhe Bealltainn'' or ''Là Buidhe Bealltainn'' ('the yellow day of Bealltain') is used to describe the first day of May. This term ''Lá Buidhe Bealtaine'' is also used in Irish and is translated as 'Bright May Day'. In Ireland it is referred to in a common folk tale as ''Luan Lae Bealtaine''; the first day of the week (Monday/''Luan'') is added to emphasise the first day of summer.

===Modern period===
[[Edward Dwelly]] in ''Bealltuinn'' (1911) describes a 1 May custom of his day, practised in the [[Scottish Highlands]], where young people met on the moors, lighted a bonfire and made an oatmeal cake toasted at the embers. The cake was divided, one of the pieces marked with charcoal, and, drawing the pieces blindfolded, the person who got the marked piece was compelled to leap over the flames three times.

In Gaelic folkore, the village's cattle were driven between two fires to purify them and bring luck (''Eadar dà theine Bhealltainn'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], 'Between two fires of Beltane'). This term is also found in Irish and is used as a turn of phrase to describe a situation which is difficult to escape from. In Scotland, boughs of [[juniper]] were sometimes thrown on the fires to add an additional element of purification and blessing to the smoke. People would also pass between the two fires to purify themselves.

Another common aspect of the festival in the early 20th century in Ireland was the hanging of May Boughs on the doors and windows of houses and the erection of May Bushes in farmyards, which usually consisted either of a branch of [[rowan]]/''caorthann'' (mountain ash) or more commonly [[Common Hawthorn|whitethorn]]/''sceach geal'' (hawthorn) which is in bloom at the time and is commonly called the 'May Bush' or just 'May' in [[Hiberno-English]]. [[Furze]]/''aiteann'' was also used for the May Boughs, May Bushes and as fuel for the bonfire. The practice of decorating the May Bush or ''Dos Bhealtaine'' with flowers, ribbons, garlands and coloured egg shells exists to some extent among the [[Gaelic diaspora (disambiguation)|Gaelic diaspora]], most notably in Newfoundland, and in some Easter traditions observed on the [[East Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Danaher&quot;/&gt;

The festival persisted widely up until the 1950s, and in some places the celebration of Beltane continues today.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKillop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeill2&quot;&gt;McNeill (1959) Vol. 2. p.63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;Campbell, John Gregorson (1900, 1902, 2005) ''The Gaelic Otherworld''. Edited by Ronald Black. Edinburgh, Birlinn Ltd. ISBN 1-84158-207-7 p.552–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brythonic culture===
In Brythonic culture, i.e.  in  [[Culture of Wales|Wales]], [[Culture of Brittany|Brittany]], and [[Cornish people|Cornwall]], there are festivals similar to it at the same time of year such as the Padstow 'obby 'oss.
In Wales, the day is known as ''[[Calan Mai]]''.
A cognate term in [[Continental Celtic]] may have been  [[Gaulish]]  ''Belotenia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKillop2&quot;&gt;MacKillop (1998) p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Since the early 20th century it has been commonly accepted that [[Old Irish]] ''Bel(l)taine'' is derived from a [[Common Celtic]] ''*belo-te(p)niâ'', meaning &quot;bright fire&quot; (where the element ''*belo-'' might be cognate with the English word ''bale'' [as in 'bale-fire'] meaning 'white' or 'shining'; compare [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''bael'', and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]/[[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''baltas/balts'', found in the name of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; in [[Slavic languages]] ''byelo'' or ''beloye'' also means 'white', as in ''Беларусь'' (White Russia or Belarus) or ''Бе́лое мо́ре'' [White Sea]). A more recent etymology by Xavier Delamarre would derive it from a Common Celtic ''*Beltinijā'', cognate with the name of the [[Lithuania]]n goddess of death ''[[Giltinė]]'', the root of both being [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*gʷelH-'' &quot;suffering, death&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, Xavier. Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, Editions Errance, Paris, 2003, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

According  to Dáithí Ó hÓgáin{{year needed|date=December 2010}}, the term ''Céad Shamhain'' or ''Cétshamhainin'' means &quot;first half&quot;, which he links to the Gaulish word ''samonios'' (which he suggests means &quot;half a year&quot;) as in the end of the &quot;first half&quot; of the year that begins at [[Samhain]]. According to Ó hÓgáin this term was also used in Scottish Gaelic and Welsh.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
In Ó Duinnín's Irish dictionary{{year needed|date=December 2010}} it is referred to as ''Céadamh(ain)'' which it explains is short for Céad-shamh(ain) meaning &quot;first (of) summer&quot;. The dictionary also states that ''Dia Céadamhan'' is May Day and ''Mí Céadamhan'' is May.

==Toponymy==
Place names in Ireland that contain remnants of the word 'Bealtaine' include a number of places called 'Beltany' – indicating places where Bealtaine festivities were once held. There are three Beltanys in [[County Donegal]] – one near [[Raphoe]] – another near Killybegs [Bealtine Bridge} and the third in the parish of Tulloghobegly. Two others are located in [[County Tyrone]], one near [[Clogher]] and the other in the parish of Cappagh. In the parish of Kilmore, [[County Armagh]], there is a place called Tamnaghvelton/''Tamhnach Bhealtaine'' ('field of the Bealtaine festivities'). Lisbalting/''Lios Bealtaine'' ('fort or enclosure of Bealtaine') is located in Kilcash Parish, County Tipperary. Glasheennabaultina ('the Bealtaine stream') is the name of a stream joining the River Galey near Athea, [[County Limerick]].

==Revival==
===Edinburgh festival===
[[Image:Beltane Dancers 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Beltane Fire Festival]] dancers, 2006]]
A revived [[Beltane Fire Festival]] has been held every year since 1988 during the night of 30 April on [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland and attended by up to 15,000 people (except in 2003 when local council restrictions forced the organisers to hold a private event elsewhere).

===Gaelic diaspora===
The lighting of a community Bealtaine fire from which individual hearth fires are then relit is observed in modern times in some parts of the [[Gaelic diaspora (disambiguation)|Gaelic diaspora]], though in the majority of these cases this practice is a cultural revival rather than an unbroken survival of the ancient tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danaher&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dames&quot;&gt;Dames, Michael (1992) ''Mythic Ireland''. London, Thames &amp; Hudson ISBN 0-500-27872-5. pp. 206–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeill&quot;&gt;McNeill, F. Marian (1959) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 2. William MacLellan, Glasgow ISBN 0-85335-162-7 p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Paganism===
Beltane is observed by [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] in various forms, and by a variety of names. As forms of Neopaganism can vary largely from tradition to tradition, representations can vary considerably despite the shared name. Some celebrate in a manner as close as possible to how the Ancient Celts and Living Celtic cultures have maintained the traditions, while others observe the holiday with rituals taken from numerous other unrelated sources, Celtic culture being only one of the sources used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler1&quot;&gt;Adler, Margot (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston, Beacon Press ISBN 0-8070-3237-9. p.3&lt;/ref&gt;{{FV|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;McColman1&quot;&gt;McColman, Carl (2003) ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom''. Alpha Press ISBN 0-02-864417-4. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic Reconstructionist====
Like other [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]] traditions, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans]] place emphasis on historical accuracy. They base their celebrations and rituals on traditional lore from the living Celtic cultures, as well as research into the older beliefs of the [[Celtic polytheism|polytheistic]] Celts.&lt;ref name=&quot;McColman2&quot;&gt;McColman (2003) pp.12, 51&lt;/ref&gt;{{FV|date=May 2011}}

Celtic Reconstructionists usually celebrate ''Lá Bealtaine'' when the local [[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]] trees are in bloom, or on the full moon that falls closest to this event. Many observe the traditional bonfire rites, to whatever extent this is feasible where they live, including the dousing of the household hearth flame and relighting of it from the community festival fire.{{cn|date=May 2011}} Some decorate May Bushes and prepare traditional festival foods.{{cn|date=May 2011}} Pilgrimages to [[Clootie well|holy wells]] are traditional at this time, and offerings and prayers to the spirits or deities of the wells are usually part of this practice.{{cn|date=May 2011}} Crafts such as the making of equal-armed [[rowan]] crosses are common, and often part of rituals performed for the blessing and protection of the household and land.&lt;ref name=&quot;McColman2&quot;/&gt;{{FV|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonewits184-5&quot;&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, Kensington Publishing Group ISBN 0-8065-2710-2. pp. 130 7&lt;/ref&gt;{{FV|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Healy&quot;&gt;Healy, Elizabeth (2001) ''In Search of Ireland's Holy Wells''. Dublin, Wolfhound Press ISBN 0-86327-865-5 p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====
{{Main|Wheel of the Year}}
[[Wicca]]ns and Wiccan-inspired [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] celebrate a variation of Beltane as a [[Wheel of the Year|Sabbat]], one of the eight solar holidays. Although the holiday may use features of the Gaelic Bealtaine, such as the [[bonfire]], it bears more relation to the Germanic May Day festival, both in its significance (focusing on fertility) and its rituals (such as [[maypole]] dancing). Some Wiccans celebrate &quot;High Beltaine&quot; by enacting a ritual union of the [[Horned God|May Lord]] and [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|May Lady]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiralDance&quot;&gt;[[Starhawk]] (1979, 1989) ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]''. New York, Harper and Row ISBN 0-06-250814-8 pp. 181 196 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Wiccan Sabbats, Beltane is a [[cross-quarter day]]; it is celebrated in the northern hemisphere on 1 May and in the southern hemisphere on 1 November. Beltane follows [[Ostara]] and precedes [[Midsummer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiralDance&quot;/&gt;

The [[New Testament]] Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] identify Bethlehem as the birthplace of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]. The town is inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, though the size of the community has shrunk due to emigration. 

The city was sacked by the [[Samaritan]]s in 529 AD, during their revolt, but was rebuilt by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]]. Bethlehem was conquered by the [[Rashidun|Arab Caliphate]] of [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]] in 637, who guaranteed safety for the city's religious shrines. In 1099, Crusaders captured and fortified Bethlehem and replaced its [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy with a [[Catholic Church|Latin]] one. The Latin clergy were expelled after the city was captured by [[Saladin]], the [[sultan]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. With the coming of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] in 1250, the city's walls were demolished, and were subsequently rebuilt during the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The British wrested control of the city from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during [[World War I]] and it was to be included in an [[Corpus separatum|international zone]] under the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. [[Jordan]] annexed the city in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. It was occupied by [[Israel]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Since 1995, Bethlehem has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;

Bethlehem has a [[Muslim]] majority, but is also home to one of the largest [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian]] communities.

== History ==
The first historical reference to the town appears in the [[Amarna letters|Amarna Letters]] (c. 1400 BC) when the King of Jerusalem appeals to his overlord, the King of Egypt, for help in retaking &quot;''Bit-Lahmi''&quot; in the wake of disturbances by the [[Habiru|Apiru]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Oxford Archeological Guides: The Holy Land''&quot;, [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], pp. 198–199, Oxford University Press, 1998, ISBN 0-19-288013-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Jews and Arabs had not yet arrived in the area it is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that this was a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Vol 4, Middle East and Africa''&quot;, Trudy Ring,  K.A Berney,  Robert M. Salkin,  Sharon La Boda,  Noelle Watson,  Paul Schellinger, p. 133, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996, ISBN 1-884964-03-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical era ===
Bethlehem, located in the &quot;hill country&quot; of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], may be the same as the Biblical [[Ephrath]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Gen.|35:16}}, {{bibleverse||Gen.|48:27}}, {{bibleverse||Ruth|4:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means &quot;fertile&quot;, as there is a reference to it in the [[Book of Micah]] as Bethlehem Ephratah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as Beth-Lehem Judah,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Sam|17:12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;a city of David&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;qjukjz&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|2:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first mentioned in the Tanakh and the Bible as the place where the Abrahamic matriarch [[Rachel]] died and was buried &quot;by the wayside&quot; (Gen. 48:7). [[Rachel's Tomb]], the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the [[Book of Ruth]], the valley to the east is where [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] of [[Moab]] gleaned the fields and returned to town with [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]]. Bethlehem is the traditional birthplace of [[David]], the second king of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]], and the place where he was anointed king by [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Sam|16:4-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of [[Adullam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Sam|23:13-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman and Byzantine periods ===
[[File:Nativity vorobiev.jpg|thumb|right|View of Church of the Nativity in 1833, painting by M.N.Vorobiev]]
Between 132–135 the city was occupied by the Romans after its capture during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba Revolt]]. Its Jewish residents were expelled by the [[military order]]s of [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091026193840/http://geocities.com/bethlehem74/history.htm History of Bethlehem] Bethlehem Homepage.&lt;/ref&gt; While ruling Bethlehem, the Romans built a shrine to the mythical [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[cult following|cult figure]] [[Adonis]] on the site of the Nativity. A church was erected in 326, when [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], the mother of the first [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], visited Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; 

During the [[Samaritan]] revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed, but they were soon rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In 614, the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Sassanid Empire]] invaded [[Palestine]] and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the [[magi]] depicted in [[Iranian art|Persian]] clothing in a mosaic.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;

==== Birthplace of Jesus ====
{{see|Church of the Nativity|Nativity of Jesus}}
[[File:Jesus birthplace in Bethlehem.jpg|thumb|right|Silver star marking the place where Jesus was born according to Christian tradition]]
Two accounts in the [[New Testament]] describe [[Jesus]] as born in Bethlehem. According to the [[Gospel of Luke]],&lt;ref name = &quot;qjukjz&quot;/&gt; [[Jesus]]' parents lived in [[Nazareth]] but traveled to Bethlehem for [[Census of Quirinius|the census of AD 6]], and Jesus was born there before the family returned to Nazareth. 

The [[Gospel of Matthew]] account implies that the family already lived in Bethlehem when Jesus was born, and later moved to Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|2:1-23|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermes, 2006, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew reports that [[Herod the Great]], told that a 'King of the Jews' has been born in Bethlehem, ordered the killing of all the children aged two and under in the town and surrounding areas. Jesus' earthly father [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] is warned of this in a dream, and the family escapes this fate by fleeing to Egypt and returning only after Herod has died. But being warned in another dream not to return to Judea, Joseph withdraws the family to [[Galilee]], and goes to live in Nazareth. 

[[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] interpreted a verse in the [[Book of Micah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a prophecy of the birth of the [[Messiah]] in Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, 2004, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern scholars question whether Jesus was really born in Bethlehem, and suggest that the different Gospel accounts were invented to present the birth of Jesus as fulfillment of prophecy and imply a connection to the lineage of King David.&lt;ref&gt;Vermes, 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1993, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crossan and Watts, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;344–345.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of Mark]] and the [[Gospel of John]] do not include a nativity narrative or any hint that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and refer to him only as being from Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;Mills and Bullard, 1990, pp.445-446. See [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6:1-4 Mark 6:1-4]; and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1:46 John 1:46].&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 article in [[Archaeology (magazine)|''Archaeology'']] magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri pointed to the absence of evidence of settlement of the area at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in [[Bethlehem of Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;Aviram Oshri, &quot;Where was Jesus Born?&quot;, ''Archaeology'', Volume 58 Number 6, November/December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposing him, Jerome Murphy-O’Connor argues for the traditional position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/nativity-03.asp Jerome Murphy-O’Connor, ''Bethlehem…Of Course''], Biblical Archaeology Review.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The existence of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Justin Martyr]], who stated in his ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (c. 155–161) that the [[Holy Family]] had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–100. &quot;Joseph ... took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found him.&quot;(Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'', chapter LXXVIII).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]], writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where he was born, and the manger in the cave where he was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians. (Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', book I, chapter LI).&lt;/ref&gt; This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1993, pp. 96–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic rule and the Crusades ===
[[File:Bethlehem-Manger-Square.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mosque of Omar (Bethlehem)|Mosque of Omar (Umar)]] was built in 1860 to commemorate the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]]'s visit to Bethlehem upon its capture by the [[Muslim]]s. It is Bethlehem's only mosque.]]

In 637, shortly after [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|Jerusalem was captured]] by the [[Rashidun army|Muslim armies]], [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], the second [[Caliph]] Bethlehem and promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; A [[Mosque of Omar (Bethlehem)|mosque]] dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATT&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethlehem then passed from the control of the Islamic caliphates of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Ummayads]] in the 8th century, then the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the 9th century. [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, [[Arab people|Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the &quot;Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;le Strange, 1890, pp. 298–300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's south transept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]], who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy were removed from their Sees and replaced with [[Catholic Church|Latin]] clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], first king of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Bethlehem Polenov.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Bethlehem, 1882]]

In 1187, [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] who led the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Muslim Ayyubids]], captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; 

[[William IV, Count of Nevers]] had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of [[Clamecy, Nièvre|Clamecy]] in present-day [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], France. As such, The Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous '[[Titular see|in partibus infidelium]]' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;de Sivry, L: &quot;Dictionnaire de Geographie Ecclesiastique&quot;, p. 375., 1852 ed, from ecclesiastical record of letters between the Bishops of Bethlehem 'in partibus' to the bishops of Auxerre.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlehem—along with Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]] and [[Sidon]]—was briefly ceded to the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by a treaty between [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and Ayyubid Sultan [[al-Kamil]] in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239 and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Reed, 2000, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1250, with the coming to power of the [[Mamluk]]s under [[Baibars|Rukn al-Din Baibars]], tolerance of Christianity declined; the clergies left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;

=== Ottoman and Egyptian era ===
[[File:Bethlehem street 1880.jpg|thumb|right|A street in Bethlehem, 1880]]

[[File:Bethlehem 1898.jpg|thumb|right|View of Bethlehem, 1898]]

From 1517, during the years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; By the end of the 16th century, Bethelem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;/&gt; The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1994, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley, and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader; five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain as opposed to grapes, the former being a more valuable commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1994, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1860, p. 647.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once more and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration particularly to [[South America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; An American missionary in the 1850s reports a population of under 4,000, 'nearly all of them belong to the Greek Church.' He also comments that 'there is a fatal lack of water' and hence it could never become a large town.&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Thomson, p. 647.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twentieth century ===
Bethlehem was administered by the British Mandate from 1920 until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63429/Bethlehem Bethlehem].&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 resolution to partition Palestine]], Bethlehem was included in the special [[Corpus separatum|international enclave of Jerusalem]] to be administered by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Jordan]] annexed the city during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideout.org/documentaries/jerusalem/land/timeline2.html A Jerusalem Timeline, 3,000 Years of The City's History] (2001-02) [[National Public Radio]] and [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many refugees from areas captured by [[Israel]]i forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in the what became the official refugee camps of [['Azza|'Azza (Beit Jibrin)]] and [[Aida (camp)|'Aida]] in the north and [[Dheisheh]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071113114509/http://www.bethlehem.ps/about/ About Bethlehem] The Centre for [[Cultural heritage|Cultural Heritage]] Preservation via Bethlehem.ps.&lt;/ref&gt; The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethlehem.ps/facts/population.php Population in the Bethlehem District]{{dead link|date=July 2009}} Bethlehem.ps.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Bethlehem1978.jpg|right|thumb|Israeli Soldiers in Bethlehem, 1978.]]

Jordan retained control of the city until the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when Bethlehem was occupied by Israel, along with the rest of the [[West Bank]]. On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]], accounting for 30.3% of the city's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCBSCensus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/_PCBS/census/phc_97/bet_t6.aspx |title=Palestinian Population by Locality and Refugee Status |accessdate=2008-01-22  |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20-29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45-64 and 5.3% above the age of 65.

According to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and Muslim population became equal in the mid-16th century. There were no Muslim inhabitants by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male tax-payers.

[[File:Bethlehem4.jpg|thumb|right|Four Bethlehem Christian women, 1911]]

The majority of Bethlehem's Christian inhabitants claim ancestry from [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] clans from the [[Arabian Peninsula]], including the city's two largest: al-Farahiyya and an-Najajreh. The former claims to have descended from the [[Ghassanids]] who migrated from [[Yemen]] to the [[Wadi Musa]] area in present-day [[Jordan]] and an-Najajreh descend from the Arabs of [[Najran]] in the southern [[Hejaz]]. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anantreh, also trace their ancestry to the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admusallam.bethlehem.edu/bethlehem/beth-hlccni.htm Bethlehem, The Holy Land’s Collective Cultural National Identity: A Palestinian Arab Historical Perspective] Musallam, Adnan. [[Bethlehem University]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the past decades, the percentage of Christians in the town has been steadily falling, primarily due to continuous emigration. The lower birth rate of Christians than Muslims also accounts for some of the decline. In 1947, Christians made up 75% of the population, but by 1998 this figure had declined to 23%.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;/&gt; The current mayor of Bethlehem, [[Victor Batarseh]] told the [[Voice of America]] that, &quot;due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VOA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Christians Disappearing in the Birthplace of Jesus|author=Jim Teeple|publisher=Voice of America|date=24 December 2005|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-12/2005-12-24-voa17.cfm?CFID=43253380&amp;CFTOKEN=44091067|accessdate=2009-07-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080505012318/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-12/2005-12-24-voa17.cfm?CFID=43253380&amp;CFTOKEN=44091067 |archivedate = May 5, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Palestinian Authority rule following the Interim Agreements is officially committed to equality for Bethlehem area Christians, although there have been a few incidents of violence against them by the [[Preventive Security Force|Preventive Security Service]] and militant factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp490.htm|publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]|title=The Beleaguered Christians of the Palestinian-Controlled Areas: Official PA Domination of Christians|author=David Raab|date=5 January 2003|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of the [[Second Intifada]] and the resultant decrease in tourism has also affected the Christian minority, leaving many economically stricken as they are the owners of many Bethlehem hotels and services that cater to foreign tourists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Day&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=423126&amp;in_page_id=1770 |title=O, Muslim town of Bethlehem... |work=the Daily Mail |accessdate=2008-01-22 | location=London | date=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of why Christians are leaving the area blamed the lack of economic and educational opportunities, especially due to the Christians' [[middle class|middle-class]] status and [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Palestinian Christianity – A Study in Religion and Politics|journal=International Journal for the Study of the Christian Church|month=July | year=2005|first=Leonard|last=Marsh|coauthors=|volume=57|issue=7|pages=147–66|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/14742250500220228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;VOA&quot;/&gt;

A 2006 poll of Bethlehem's Christians conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue, found that 90% reported having Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the Palestinian National Authority treats Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the ongoing exodus of Christians from Bethlehem to the Israeli travel restrictions in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans not sure where Bethlehem is, survey shows|publisher=[[Christian Church|Ekklesia]]|date=2006-12-20|accessdate=2007-05-07|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_061220bethlehem.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:BethlehemShuq.JPG|right|thumb|Central Bethlehem]]

=== Shopping and industry ===
Shopping is a major sector in Bethlehem, especially during the [[Christmas]] season. The city's main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling handicrafts, [[Middle East]]ern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as [[baklava|baklawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/GeneralInfo/Shopping.php |title=Bethlehem Municipality(Site Under Construction) |accessdate=2008-01-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080226054520/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/GeneralInfo/Shopping.php |archivedate = February 26, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tradition of making [[Palestinian handicrafts|handicrafts]] in the city dates back to its founding. Numerous shops in Bethlehem sell olive [[wood carving]]s — for which the city is renowned — made from the local olive groves.&lt;ref name=&quot;BethTour&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelershub.com/destination_guide/middle_east/bethlehem.html|title= Bethlehem: Shopping|publisher=TouristHub|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings are the main product purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=&quot;handicrafts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/Heritage/HnadCraft.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071121193814/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/Heritage/HnadCraft.php|archivedate=2007-11-21|title=Handicrafts: Olive-wood carving|publisher=Bethlehem Municipality }}{{dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious handicrafts are also a major industry in Bethlehem, and some products include ornaments handmade from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]], as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses.&lt;ref name=&quot;BethTour&quot;/&gt; The art of creating [[Mother-of-Pearl carving in Bethlehem|mother-of-pearl handicrafts]] was introduced to Bethlehem by [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s from [[Damascus]] during the 14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;handicrafts&quot;/&gt; Stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings are other prevalent industries. Bethlehem also produces paints, plastics, [[synthetic rubber]], pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPS2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem.ps/facts/economy.php |title=Economy: Tourism |publisher=Bethlehem.ps |accessdate=2008-03-29}}{{dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlehem has a wine-producing company, [[Cremisan|Cremisan Wine]], founded in 1885, that currently exports wine to several countries. The wine is produced by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan, and the majority of the grapes are harvested from the [[al-Khader]] area. The monastery's wine production is around 700,000 liters per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem.ps/shopping/wine.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071117144242/http://www.bethlehem.ps/shopping/wine.php |archivedate=2007-11-17 |title=Wine |last=Jahsan |first=Ruby |publisher=The Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Bethlehem-03-Church of the Nativity.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Church of the Nativity]]]]
Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry and unlike other Palestinian localities before 2000, the majority of the working residents did not work in Israel.&lt;ref name=OCHA/&gt; Over 25% of the working population was employed directly or indirectly in the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPS2&quot;/&gt; Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/896CF7DD-9446-44C0-9B4D-4BA24A502BDF.htm |title=Bethlehem's Struggles Continue |work=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Church of the Nativity]] is one of Bethlehem's major [[tourist attraction]]s and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the [[Manger Square]] — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus supposedly was born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. [[Jerome]] spent thirty years [[Vulgate|translating the Hebrew Scriptures into Latin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; 

There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patience&quot;/&gt; [[Jacir Palace]], built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem's most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the violence of the Second Intifada, but reopened in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiatraveltips.com/news05/129-JacirPalace.shtml Jacir Palace, InterContinental Bethlehem re-opens for business] InterContinental Hotels Group&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic conference ===
{{main|Palestine Investment Conference}}
Bethlehem hosted the largest ever economic conference in the [[Palestinian territories]] on May 21, 2008. It was initiated by [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Prime Minister]] and former [[Finance Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Finance Minister]] [[Salam Fayyad]] to convince over 1,000 businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the [[Middle East]] to invest in the West Bank and [[Gaza Strip]], although Fayyad admitted the territories were &quot;far from the perfect business environment&quot;, being directly linked with the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. Nonetheless, 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7412129.stm  Palestinians bidding for business] Maqbool, Aleem.

== Culture ==
=== Embroidery ===
{{See also|Palestinian costumes}}

[[File:Bethlehem woman edited.jpg|thumb|right|A woman in Bethlehem. Her headdress and short jacket are typical of the Bethlehem area.]]

Before the establishment of Israel as a state, Bethlehem costumes and embroidery were popular in villages throughout the Judaean Hills and the [[coastal plain]]. The women embroiderers of Bethlehem and the neighboring villages of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour were known to be professional producers of wedding costumes.&lt;ref name=PCA2&gt;{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |accessdate=2008-01-28 |url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061024053919/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm |archivedate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethlehem was a center for embroidery producing a &quot;strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stillman |first=Yedida Kalfon |title=Palestinian costume and jewelry |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |year=1979 |location=Albuquerque |pages=&amp;nbsp;46 |isbn=0-8263-0490-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less formal dresses in Bethlehem were generally made of indigo fabric and a sleeveless coat (''bisht''), made from locally woven wool, was worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves and the short ''taqsireh'' jacket, known throughout Palestinian as the Bethlehem jacket, was worn over it. The taqsireh was made of [[velvet]] or [[broadcloth]], usually with heavy embroidery.&lt;ref name=PCA2/&gt; 

Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for &quot;royal&quot; [[wedding dress]]es (''thob malak''), taqsirehs and the ''shatwehs'' worn by married women. It has been traced by some to [[Byzantium]], and by others to the more formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As Bethlehem was a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.&lt;ref name=PCA2/&gt;

=== Mother-of-Pearl carving ===
[[File:Workers in mother-of-pearl2.jpg|thumb|left|Craftsmen working with mother-of-pearl, early 20th century]]
{{main|Mother-of-Pearl carving in Bethlehem}}

The art of mother-of-pearl carving has been a Bethlehem tradition since the 14th century when it was introduced to the city by [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s from [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BM&quot;&gt;[http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/Heritage/HnadCraft.php  Bethlehem municipality website]{{dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethlehem's position as an important Christian city has for centuries attracted a constant stream of [[pilgrim]]s. This generated much local work and income, also for women, including making mother-of-pearl souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp. 128, 280, n.30&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted by [[Richard Pococke]], who travelled there in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=wY4qAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA436,M1   ''A Description of the East and Some other Countries''], p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural centers and museums ===
[[File:Bethlehem Christmas2.JPG|thumb|right|Catholic procession on [[Christmas Eve]] in Bethlehem, 2006]]
Bethlehem is home to the [[Palestinian Heritage Center]], established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote [[Palestinian costumes|Palestinian embroidery]], [[Palestinian art|art]] and folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinianheritagecenter.com/objectives.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071112225031/http://www.palestinianheritagecenter.com/objectives.htm|archivedate=2007-11-12|title=Palestinian Heritage Center: Objectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and [[arts and crafts]] displays, and training.&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot;/&gt; 

A branch of [[the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music]] is located in Bethlehem and has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncm.birzeit.edu/new/page.php?page=branches+ |title=The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlehem has four museums located within its municipal borders. The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 3D models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The [[Badd Giacaman Museum]], located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of [[olive oil]] production.&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot;/&gt; 

[[Baituna al-Talhami Museum]], established in 1972, contains displays of the culture of Bethlehem's inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot;/&gt; The International Museum of Nativity was designed by [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) for the purpose of showing works of &quot;high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot;/&gt;

=== Festivals ===
[[File:Bethlehem Christmas pilgrims enter town 1890.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas pilgrims, 1890]]

Christmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, but Greek, [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodox]] Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity. Roman Catholic services take place in [[Saint Catherine's Church (Bethlehem)|St. Catherine's Church]] and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/bethlehem-christmas.htm |title=Christmas in Bethlehem |publisher=Sacred Destinations |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlehem, like other Palestinian localities, participates in festivals related to saints and prophets that are attached to Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual [[Feast of Saint George]] ([[Al-Khidr|al-Khadr]]) on 5–6 May. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of [[al-Khader]] to baptize newborns in the waters around the [[Monastery of Saint George, al-Khader|Monastery of St. George]] and sacrifice a sheep in ritual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:fJV8drrNIiAJ:www.bethlehem.ps/religious_sites/feasts/st_george.php+Khader+Feast+of+Saint+George&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a St. George's Feast] Bethlehem.ps.&lt;/ref&gt; The Feast of St. [[Elijah]] is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.

== Government ==
[[File:Bethlehem-hamasrally.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Hamas]] rally in Bethlehem]]
Bethlehem is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) or district capital of the [[Bethlehem Governorate]]. 

Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the ''mukhtars'' (&quot;heads&quot;) of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A [[Basic law|Basic Law]] was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.&lt;ref name=&quot;BME&quot;/&gt; 

Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah [[Bedouin]]s and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the amount of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;BME&quot;&gt;[http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/TempVewMenuSub.php?Mid=6 Municipal Council Elections during the British and Jordanian Periods] Bethlehem Municipal Council.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the Bethlehem Municipal Council consists of 15 elected members, including the mayor and deputy mayor. A special statute requires that the mayor and a majority of the municipal council be Christian, while the remainder are open seats, not restricted to any religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Day&quot;/&gt; 

There are several branches of political parties on the council, including [[Communism|Communist]], [[Islamism|Islamist]], and secular. The leftist factions of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and the [[Palestinian People's Party]] (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. [[Hamas]] gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 [[Palestinian municipal elections, 2005|Palestinian municipal elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |title=Bethlehem Municipality(Site Under Construction) |accessdate=2008-01-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080118135922/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |archivedate = January 18, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in [[primary education|primary school]], 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/bet_t3.aspx |title=Palestinian Population (10 Years and Over) by Locality, Sex and Educational Attainment |accessdate=2008-01-22 |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 135 schools in the [[Bethlehem Governorate]] in 2006; 100 run the [[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority]], seven by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) and 28 were private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mohe.gov.ps/downloads/pdffiles/statisticE.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061014122612/http://www.mohe.gov.ps/downloads/pdffiles/statisticE.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-14 |title=Statistics about General Education in Palestine 2005-2006 |publisher=[[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority]] |accessdate=2008-01-22|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bethlehem is home to [[Bethlehem University]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle Christian Brothers]] opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem.edu/about/history.shtml |title=Bethlehem University - History |publisher=[[Bethlehem University]] |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
[[File:Bethlehem-street2.JPG|thumb|left|A street in Bethlehem lined with taxis]]

=== Services ===
Bethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, [[Hebron]], [[Nahalin]], [[Battir]], [[al-Khader]], [[al-Ubeidiya]] and [[Beit Fajjar]]. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, [[Tuqu']] and [[Herodium]]. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/TransSys.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071227075741/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/City/TransSys.php |archivedate=2007-12-27 |title=Bethlehem Public Transport System |accessdate=2008-01-22 }} Bethlehem Municipality.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movement restrictions ===
[[File:BethlehemRoad.jpg|right|thumb|Main entrance to Bethlehem from the Jerusalem direction,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}flanked by reinforced concrete walls, 2005]]

The Israeli construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]] has had an impact on Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier runs along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within meters of houses in 'Aida [[refugee camp]] on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other.&lt;ref name=OCHA/&gt;

Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the [[West Bank]] are currently subject to [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Israeli checkpoints]] and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into [[Jerusalem]] is regulated by a permit-system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/b45e8d8caacda74785256dbb0062e7b9!OpenDocument |title=Impact of Israel's separation barrier on affected West Bank communities - OCHA update report #2 (30 September 2003) |accessdate=2008-01-22 |work=}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring such permits to enter, what in the past served in many ways as an urban anchor to Bethlehem, has become exceedingly rare since the onset of the violence surrounding the Second Intifada, though Israel has subsequently erected a terminal to ease transit between the two adjoining cities.&lt;ref name=OCHA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/0306124470443c948525712b006a70b7!OpenDocument |title=Question of the violation of human rights in the occupied Arab territories, including Palestine 17 January 2006 |accessdate=2008-01-22 |author=John Dugard |work=Commission on Human Rights }} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinians are not allowed to enter the Jewish holy site of [[Rachel's Tomb]], which is on the outskirts of the city, without a permit. Since Bethlehem and the nearby biblical [[Solomon's Pools]] lie in Area A (territory under both PNA military and civil administration), Israeli citizens are barred without a permit from the Israeli military authorities.&lt;ref name=OCHA/&gt;

[[Image:BenjaminandJoseph.jpg|thumb|right|Benjamin (right) embracing his brother, [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]]]
'''Benjamin''' ({{Hebrew Name|בִּנְיָמִין|Binyamin|Binyāmîn}} בִּנְיָמִין) was the last-born of [[Jacob]]'s twelve sons, and the second and last son of [[Rachel]] in [[Jewish]], [[Christian]] and [[Islamic]] [[tradition]]. He was the founder of the [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[Tribe of Benjamin]]. In the Biblical account, unlike Rachel's first son, [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], Benjamin was born in [[Canaan]]. He died in Egypt on the 11th of [[Marcheshvan]] (which was also his birthday) 1443 BC at the age of 111.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. In the [[Qur'an]], Benjamin is referred to as righteous young child, who remained with [[Jacob]] when the older brothers plotted against [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]].

==Name==
'''Ben its self means son in Hebrew, but Benjamin means son of my right hand ( Favorite Son)''
According to the [[Torah]], Benjamin's name arose when Jacob deliberately corrupted the name ''Benoni'', the original name of ''Benjamin'', since ''Benoni'' was an allusion to Rachel's [[Maternal death|dying just after she had given birth]], as it means ''son of my pain''.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 35:19&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholars regard these two names as fragments of naming narratives coming from different sources - one being the Jahwist and the other being the [[Elohist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Benjamin2.JPG|thumb|left|Portuguese sketch.]]

The [[etymology]] of the name ''Benjamin'' is a matter of dispute, though most agree that it is composed of two parts - ''ben'' and ''jamin'' - the former meaning ''son of''. The literal translation of ''Benjamin'' is ''son of right'' (as opposed to ''left''), generally interpreted as meaning ''son of my right hand'', though sometimes interpreted as ''son of the right side''. Being associated with the right hand side was traditionally a reference to strength and virtue (cf ''[[wikt:sinister|sinister]]'', which derives from the [[latin]] for ''left''). This is, however, not the only literal translation, as the [[root word|root]] for ''right'' is identical to that for ''south'', hence ''Benjamin'' also literally translates as ''son of the south''. This meaning is advocated by several [[classical rabbinical literature|classical rabbinical sources]], which argue that it refers to the birth of Benjamin in Canaan, as compared with the birth of all the other sons of Jacob in [[Aram-Naharaim|Aram]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern scholars have instead proposed that, with the eponymous Benjamin being just a metaphor, ''son of the south''/''son of the right'' are references to the tribe's  being subordinate to the more dominant tribe of Ephraim.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], the name is consistently written as '''בן ימים''', with a terminal [[mem]], making it ''Benjamim'', and would literally translate as ''son of days''. Some [[classical rabbinical literature]] argues that this was the original form of the name and was a reference to the advanced age of Jacob when Benjamin was born.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; 

According to classical rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after Rachel had [[fasted]] for a long time, as a religious devotion with the hope of a new child as a reward. By then Jacob had become over 100 years old.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative,&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons.&lt;ref name = &quot;xhbyqx&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|46:21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholars believe that this is the result of the genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the [[Jahwist]] and [[Elohist]] narratives, which make up most of the Joseph narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

==Israelites in Egypt==
[[File:Morgan-bible-fl06.jpg|thumb|right|420px|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of Benjamin being returned to Egypt (Genesis 44).]]
The Torah's Joseph narrative, at a stage when Joseph is unrecognised by his brothers, describes Joseph as testing whether his brothers have reformed, by secretly planting a silver cup in Benjamin's bag, then publicly searching the bags for it, and after ''finding'' it in Benjamin's possession, demanding that Benjamin become his [[slave]] as a punishment.&lt;ref name=Gen44&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|44|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative goes on to state that when [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]] (on behalf of the other brothers) begged Joseph not to enslave Benjamin and instead enslave him, since enslavement of Benjamin would break Jacob's heart. This caused Joseph to recant and reveal his identity.&lt;ref name=Gen44/&gt; The [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|midrashic book of Jasher]] argues that prior to revealing his identity, Joseph asked Benjamin to find his missing brother (i.e. Joseph) via [[astrology]], using an [[astrolabe]]-like tool;&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; it continues by stating that Benjamin [[divination|divined]] that the ''man on the throne'' was Joseph, so Joseph identified himself to Benjamin (but not the other brothers), and revealed his scheme (as in the Torah) to test how fraternal the other brothers were.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; However, some classical rabbinical sources argue that Joseph identified himself for other reasons.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on the memory of Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph was so important to him that he had named his sons in Joseph's honour;&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; these sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

In the narrative, just prior to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his brothers (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|43|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|43:30|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he gives Benjamin five times as much food as he apportions to the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|43:34|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to textual scholars, this is really the Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

==Benjamin in Islam==
The [[Qur'an]], in the narrative of [[Joseph]], refers to Benjamin as the righteous youngest son of [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an XII: 8, 59-79&lt;/ref&gt;[[Muslim]] [[tradition]], however, fleshes out the details regarding Benjamin and refers to him as being born from Jacob's wife [[Rachel]], and further links a connection, as does [[Jewish]] [[tradition]], between the names of Benjamin's children and Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol. I, ''Binyamin'', A.J. Wensick/G. Vajda&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Kever Binyamin.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Exterior view of a [[Mamluk]] [[Caravanserai]] complex, including the mausoleum of Nabi Yamin, traditionally believed to be the tomb of Benjamin, at present located outside [[Kfar Sava]], [[Israel]].]]

Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe, that of ''Joseph''.&lt;ref name = &quot;gzuhsh&quot;&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Ephraim''&lt;/ref&gt; According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost.&lt;ref name = &quot;gzuhsh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Benjamin being born after the arrival in Canaan is thought by some scholars to refer to the tribe of Benjamin coming into existence by branching from the Joseph group after the tribe had settled in Canaan.&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt; A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the ''Joseph tribes'' (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to [[Egypt]] [[the Exodus|and returned]], while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in [[Canaan]] throughout.&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Bible Unearthed''&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] to obtain a wife originated as a [[metaphor]] for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt;&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt; according to [[textual criticism|textual scholars]], the [[Jahwist]] version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal [[matriarch]]s whatsoever.&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who Wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

==Benjamin's sons==
According to {{bibleverse||Genesis|46:21|HE}}, Benjamin had ten sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. The name of his wife/wives are not given. Classical rabbinical tradition adds that each son's name honors Joseph:&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;
*''Belah'' (meaning ''swallow''), in reference to Joseph disappearing (''being swallowed up'')
*''Becher'' (meaning ''first born''), in reference to Joseph being the first child of Rachel
*''Ashbel'' (meaning ''capture''), in reference to Joseph having suffered captivity
*''Gera'' (meaning ''grain''), in reference to Joseph living in a ''foreign'' land (Egypt)
*''Naaman'' (meaning ''grace''), in reference to Joseph having graceful speech
*''Ehi'' (meaning ''my brother''), in reference to Joseph being Benjamin's only full-brother (as opposed to half-brothers)
*''[[List of minor Biblical figures#Rosh|Rosh]]'' (meaning ''elder''), in reference to Joseph being older than Benjamin
*''Muppim'' (meaning ''double mouth''), in reference to Joseph passing on what he had been taught by Jacob
*''Huppim'' (meaning ''[[chuppah|marriage canopies]]''), in reference to Joseph being married in Egypt, while Benjamin was not there
*''Ard'' (meaning ''wanderer''/''fugitive''), in reference to Joseph being like a rose

'''Black Sabbath''' are&lt;!--UK English grammar uses plural terms rather than American singularised ones, so please DO NOT change ARE to IS.--&gt; an English rock&lt;!-- HEAVY METAL is in the infobox, per previous consensus, and &quot;rock&quot; here. Do not change &quot;Rock&quot; in this introduction without an agreement on talk page, whatever your point of view --&gt; band, formed in [[Aston]], Birmingham in 1969 by [[Ozzy Osbourne]] (lead vocals), [[Tony Iommi]] (guitar), [[Geezer Butler]] (bass guitar), and [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] (drums). The band has since experienced multiple line-up changes, with Tony Iommi the only constant presence in the band through the years. A total of twenty-two musicians have at one time been members of Black Sabbath. Originally formed as a heavy [[blues rock]] band named Earth, the band began incorporating [[occult]]- and horror-inspired lyrics with tuned-down guitars, changing their name to Black Sabbath and achieving multiple platinum records in the 1970s. Despite an association with occult and horror themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social and political issues such as drugs and war.

Black Sabbath are cited, along with [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Deep Purple]], as pioneers of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://heavymetal.about.com/od/heavymetal101/a/101_timeline.htm Heavy Metal Timeline – Important Heavy Metal Events – Timeline Of Heavy Metal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/227113/review/5946174/sabbath_bloody_sabbath|title=''Rolling Stone'' review of ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' 1974 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |first=Gordon |last=Fletcher |date=14 February 1974|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071230064106/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/227113/review/5946174/sabbath_bloody_sabbath |archivedate = 30 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band helped define the genre with releases such as quadruple-platinum ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'', released in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paranoid AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Huey, Steve |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1999|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG Paranoid Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were ranked by MTV as the &quot;Greatest Metal Band&quot; of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index2.jhtml |title=Greatest Metal Artists of All Time |publisher=MTV |accessdate=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed second in [[VH1]]'s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; list, behind [[Led Zeppelin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists: 1–25 |publisher=Rock On The Net |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolling Stone has posited the band as 'the heavy-metal kings of the '70s'.&lt;ref&gt;Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, 3rd Edition, 2001, Rolling Stone Press, U.S. pg.1028&lt;/ref&gt; They have sold over 15 million records in the United States alone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Top Selling Artists|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&amp;table=tblTopArt&amp;action=|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 100 million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8075397.stm | title=Ozzy sues Black Sabbath bandmate | date=30 May 2009 |work=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocalist Ozzy Osbourne's heavy alcohol and cocaine usage led to his being fired from the band on 27 April 1979, but Osbourne began a very successful solo career, selling more than 100 million albums. He was replaced by former [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. After a few albums with Dio's vocals and his songwriting collaborations, Black Sabbath endured a revolving line-up in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists [[Ian Gillan]], [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Ray Gillen]] and [[Tony Martin (musician)|Tony Martin]]. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer [[Vinny Appice]] to record ''[[Dehumanizer]]''. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album, ''Reunion''. The 1979–1982 and 1991–1992 line-up featuring Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Appice reformed in 2006 under the moniker [[Heaven &amp; Hell (band)|Heaven &amp; Hell]] until Dio's death on 16 May 2010.

== History ==
=== Formation and early days (1968–1969)===

Following the break-up of their previous band in 1968, guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] and drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] sought to form a heavy [[blues]] band in [[Aston]], Birmingham. The two enlisted bassist [[Geezer Butler]] and vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]], who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: &quot;Ozzy Zig Needs Gig- has own PA&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; |episodelink= |series= Seven Ages of Rock|serieslink= |credits= |network= |station= [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]] |airdate= 5 March 2009|minutes= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new group was initially named The Polka Tulk Blues Band (after a cheap brand of talcum powder Osbourne saw in his mother's bathroom)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Osbourne | first1=Ozzy | last2 = Ayres | first2 = Chris | title = I Am Ozzy | publisher=Grand Central Publishing | page = 63 | isbn = 0446569895 |ref = harv |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also featured slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips and saxophonist Alan &quot;Aker&quot; Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Osbourne | first1=Ozzy | last2 = Ayres | first2 = Chris | title = I Am Ozzy | publisher=Grand Central Publishing | page = 84 | isbn = 0446569895 |ref = harv |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Dwyer, Robert |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080120194400/http://www.sabbathlive.com/timelines.html Timeline |title=Black Sabbath Live Project – Beginnings |publisher=Sabbathlive.com |accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Sabbath member history&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Siegler, Joe |url=http://www.black-sabbath.com/personnel/timeline.html |title=Black Sabbath Online: Band Lineup History |publisher=Blacksabbath.com |accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the band was performing under the Earth title, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as &quot;The Rebel&quot;, &quot;Song for Jim&quot;, and &quot;When I Came Down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar World&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Eternal Idol |last=Gill |first=Chris |magazine=Guitar World |date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1968, Iommi abruptly left Earth to join [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Melody Maker 21&amp;nbsp;December 1968 |url=http://www.sabbathlive.com/sabtours/earth/mm211268 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070604013639/http://www.sabbathlive.com/sabtours/earth/mm211268 |archivedate=4 June 2007 |work=[[Melody Maker]] Magazine |accessdate=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his stint with the band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on the ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. &quot;It just wasn't right, so I left&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having a leader in the band, which was [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]]'s way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth, and decided to change their name again. A movie theatre across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 [[Boris Karloff]] horror film ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'' directed by [[Mario Bava]]. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was &quot;strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/ozzy_int.asp |title=Ozzy Osbourne: The Godfather of Metal |publisher=NYRock.com |accessdate=14 February 2008 |date=June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called &quot;[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]&quot;, which was inspired by the work of [[occult]] writer [[Dennis Wheatley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charles Strong|first=Martin|title=The Essential Rock Discography |publisher=Canongate |year=2006 |edition=8 |volume=1|page=97|isbn=1841958603|accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Dave|title=Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to How Band Names Were Formed|publisher=Cidermill Books |year=2004 |page=51 |isbn=0974848352 |accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ozzy Osbourne: Behind the Music'' by [[VH1]]; first aired 19 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Making use of the musical [[tritone]], also known as &quot;The Devil's Interval&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Satanism today&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=R.

Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969,&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Sharpe-Young, Garry |url=http://www.musicmight.com/linkto/artist/{3F545B39-F8C3-4439-90A9-F33EA37 |title=MusicMight.com Black Sabbath Biography|publisher=MusicMight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.

=== ''Black Sabbath'' and ''Paranoid'' (1970–1971) ===
Black Sabbath were signed to [[Philips Records]] in December 1969, and released their first single, &quot;[[Evil Woman (Crow song)|Evil Woman]]&quot; through Philips subsidiary [[Fontana Records]] in January 1970. Later releases were handled by Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, [[Vertigo Records]]. Although the single failed to chart, the band were afforded two days of studio time in late January to record their debut album with producer [[Rodger Bain]]. Iommi recalls recording live: &quot;We thought 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'' was released on [[Friday the 13th]], February 1970. The album reached number 8 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], and following its US and Canadian release in May 1970 by [[Warner Bros.

To capitalise on their chart success in the US, the band quickly returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after ''Black Sabbath'' was released. The new album was initially set to be named ''War Pigs'' after the song &quot;[[War Pigs]]&quot;, which was critical of the [[Vietnam War]]. However Warner changed the title of the album to ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'', fearing backlash by supporters of the Vietnam War. The album's lead-off single &quot;[[Paranoid (song)|Paranoid]]&quot; was written in the studio at the last minute. As Bill Ward explains: &quot;We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the (Paranoid) guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single was released ahead of the album in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone Biography&quot;/&gt; Their first concert on US soil was held at a New York City club called Ungano's, at 210 West 70th Street, on 28 October 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[I Am Ozzy]] (by Ozzy Osbourne with Chris Ayres; pg. 117)&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Sabbath released their second full-length album, ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' in the UK in October 1970. Pushed by the success of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; single, the album hit number one in the UK. The US release was held until January 1971, as the ''Black Sabbath'' album was still on the charts at the time of ''Paranoid'''s UK release. The album reached #12 in the US in March 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard_200&quot;&gt;{{cite web | datepublished = | url        ={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=black-sabbath-p3693/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}| title = Black Sabbth.

''Paranoid's'' chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in December 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single &quot;[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]&quot;. Although the single failed to reach the top 40, &quot;Iron Man&quot; remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting US single until 1998's &quot;Psycho Man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt;

=== ''Master of Reality'' and ''Volume 4'' (1971–1973) ===
In February 1971, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of ''Paranoid'', the band were afforded more studio time, along with a &quot;briefcase full of cash&quot; to buy drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We were getting into [[cocaine|coke]], big time&quot;, Ward explained. &quot;[[stimulants|Uppers]], [[depressants|downers]], [[Methaqualone|Quaaludes]], whatever you like. It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them, because you were just so out of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production completed in April 1971, and in July the band released ''[[Master of Reality]]'', just six months after the US release of ''Paranoid''. The album reached the top ten in both the US and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months,&lt;ref name=MOR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=master%20of%20reality&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Master of Reality''|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually receiving platinum certification in the 1980s&lt;ref name=MOR/&gt; and Double Platinum in the early 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;ref name=MOR/&gt; ''Master of Reality'' contained Black Sabbath's first [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs, alongside fan favourites such as &quot;[[Children of the Grave]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sweet Leaf]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Master of Reality AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2000|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG Master of Reality Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical response of the era was again unfavourable, with [[Lester Bangs]] delivering an ambivalent review of ''Master of Reality'' in ''Rolling Stone'', describing the closing song &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; as &quot;naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel – but in the tradition [of rock'n'roll] .... The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath's got it&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Master of Reality Album Rebiew&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21209|title=Master of Reality Rolling Stone Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the very same magazine would in 2003 place the album at number 298 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

Following the ''Master of Reality'' world tour in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Bill Ward explained: &quot;The band started to become very fatigued and very tired. We'd been on the road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think ''Master of Reality'' was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|pp=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1972, the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the [[Record Plant Studios|Record Plant]]. The recording process was plagued with problems, many as a result of [[substance abuse]] issues. While struggling to record the song &quot;Cornucopia&quot; after &quot;sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Ward was nearly fired from the band. &quot;I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible&quot; Ward said. &quot;I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was originally titled &quot;Snowblind&quot; after the song of the same name, which deals with [[cocaine]] abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to ''[[Black Sabbath Vol. 4]]'', with Ward stating &quot;There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Sabbath's ''[[Black Sabbath Vol. 4|Volume 4]]'' was released in September 1972, and while critics of the era were again dismissive of the album, it achieved gold status in less than a month,&lt;ref name=V4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=BLACK%20SABBATH%20-%20VOL.%204&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Vol. 4''|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the band's fourth consecutive release to sell a million copies in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=V4/&gt; With more time in the studio, ''Volume 4'' saw the band starting to experiment with new textures, such as strings, piano, orchestration and multi-part songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Huey, Steve |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2001|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG Volume 4 Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;[[Black Sabbath Vol. 4|Tomorrow's Dream]]&quot; was released as a single—the band's first since ''Paranoid''—but failed to chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Albums&quot;/&gt; Following an extensive tour of the US, the band travelled to Australia and New Zealand for the first time in 1973, and later mainland Europe.

=== ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' and ''Sabotage'' (1973–1976) ===
Following the ''Volume 4'' world tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release. Pleased with the ''Volume 4'' album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a &quot;giant synthesiser&quot;. The band rented a house in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. &quot;Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on ''Volume 4'' and we really got discontent&quot; Iommi said. &quot;Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen76&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BlackSabbath19720012200.sized.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Tony Iommi and Ozzy Osbourne on stage 1973.]]
After a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England, where they rented [[Clearwell Castle]] in [[Forest of Dean|The Forest of Dean]]. &quot;We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of &quot;[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (song)|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]],&quot; which set the tone for the new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on ''Volume 4'', new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings, and complex arrangements. [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] was brought in as a session player, appearing on &quot;[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath|Sabbra Cadabra]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1973, Black Sabbath released the critically acclaimed ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]''. For the first time in their career, the band began to receive favourable reviews in the mainstream press, with Gordon Fletcher of ''Rolling Stone'' calling the album &quot;an extraordinarily gripping affair,&quot; and &quot;nothing less than a complete success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=1974 |month=February |author=Fletcher, Gordon |title=''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath'' Album Review |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/227113/review/5946174/sabbath_bloody_sabbath |work=Rolling Stone Magazine #154, 14&amp;nbsp;February 1974 |accessdate=25 February 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071230064106/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/227113/review/5946174/sabbath_bloody_sabbath |archivedate = 30 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reviewers such as ''AllMusic'''s Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a &quot;masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection,&quot; while also displaying &quot;a newfound sense of finesse and maturity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SBS AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2002|pure_url=yes}} |title=Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath AMG Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=SABBATH,%20BLOODY%20SABBATH&amp;artist=Black%20Sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath''|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching number four on the UK charts, and number eleven in the US.

The band began a world tour in January 1974, which culminated at the [[California Jam]] festival in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], California on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath appeared alongside 1970s rock and pop giants [[Deep Purple]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], [[Seals and Crofts|Seals &amp; Crofts]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], and [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]]. Portions of the show were telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager [[Don Arden]]. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the US, Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation.&lt;ref name=Rosen76/&gt;

Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in [[Willesden]], this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from ''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath''. &quot;We could've continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – ''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath'' wasn't a rock album, really.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, ''[[Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)|Sabotage]]'' was released in July 1975. Again the album initially saw favourable reviews, with ''Rolling Stone'' stating &quot;''Sabotage'' is not only Black Sabbath's best record since ''Paranoid'', it might be their best ever&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=1975 |month=September |author=Altman, Billy |title=''Sabotage'' Album Review |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/170807/review/5946986/sabotage |work=Rolling Stone Magazine #196, 25&amp;nbsp;September 1975 |accessdate=25 February 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071231125738/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/170807/review/5946986/sabotage |archivedate = 31 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; although later reviewers such as Allmusic noted that &quot;the magical chemistry that made such albums as ''Paranoid'' and ''Volume 4'' so special was beginning to disintegrate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Sabotage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Prato, Greg |title=''Sabotage'' AMG Album Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2003|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sabotage'' reached the top 20 in both the US and the UK, but was the band's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the US, only achieving Gold certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Sabotage''|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=sabotage&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the album's only single &quot;[[Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)|Am I Going Insane (Radio)]]&quot; failed to chart, ''Sabotage'' features fan favourites such as &quot;[[Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)|Hole in the Sky]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Symptom of the Universe (song)|Symptom of the Universe]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Sabotage&quot;/&gt; Black Sabbath toured in support of ''Sabotage'' with openers [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band's record companies released a [[Greatest hits album]] without input from the band, titled ''[[We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll]]''. The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum Database-''We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll''|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=we%20sold%20our%20soul&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Technical Ecstasy'' and ''Never Say Die!'' (1976–1979) ===
Black Sabbath began work for their next album at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida, in June 1976. To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerry Woodruffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on ''Sabotage''. ''[[Technical Ecstasy]]'', released on 25 September 1976, was met with mixed reviews. For the first time the reviews did not become more favourable as time passed, two decades after its release ''AllMusic'' gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was &quot;unravelling at an alarming rate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TE AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Prato, Greg |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2004|pure_url=yes}} |title=Technical Ecstasy AMG Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. ''Technical Ecstasy'' failed to reach the top 50 in the US, and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status, although it was later certified gold in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Technical Ecstasy'' |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=Technical%20Ecstasy&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album included &quot;[[Dirty Women]]&quot;, which remains a live staple, as well as Bill Ward's first lead vocal on the song &quot;It's Alright&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TE AMG Review&quot; /&gt; Touring in support of ''Technical Ecstasy'' began in November 1976, with openers [[Boston (band)|Boston]] and [[Ted Nugent]] in the US, and completed in Europe with [[AC/DC]] in April 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt;

In November 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album, and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, [[Ozzy Osbourne]] quit the band. &quot;The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me&quot;, Osbourne said. &quot;I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen93-94&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Savoy Brown]] vocalist [[Dave Walker]] was brought into rehearsals in October 1977, and the band began working on new songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- On 8 January 1978, --&gt;Black Sabbath made their first and only appearance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song &quot;Junior's Eyes&quot; on the [[BBC]] Television program &quot;Look! Hear!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:Iommi at the Forum a.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Tony Iommi in 2005.]]
Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project, which featured ex-[[Dirty tricks]] members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. &quot;Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band,&quot; Iommi explained. &quot;He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy, so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen93-94&quot;/&gt;

The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], writing and recording what would become ''[[Never Say Die!]]''. &quot;It took quite a long time,&quot; Iommi said. &quot;We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen93-94&quot;/&gt; The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was again unfavourable and again did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of ''[[Allmusic|AllMusic]]'' stating two decades after its release that the album's &quot;unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NSD AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2006|pure_url=yes}} |title=Never Say Die!

It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Never Say Die!''|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=Never%20Say%20Die&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Touring in support of ''Never Say Die!'' began in May 1978 with openers [[Van Halen]]. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance &quot;tired and uninspired&quot;, a stark contrast to the &quot;youthful&quot; performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt; The band filmed a performance at the [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as ''Never Say Die''. The final show of the tour, and Osbourne's last appearance with the band (until later reunions) was in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], New Mexico on 11 December.

Following the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on material for the next album. With pressure from the record label, and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of ideas coming to a head, Tony made the decision to fire [[Ozzy Osbourne]] in 1979. &quot;At that time, Ozzy had come to an end&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer Bill Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer. &quot;I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid,&quot; Ward said. &quot;Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Heaven and Hell'' and ''Mob Rules'' (1979–1982) ===
Sharon Arden, (later [[Sharon Osbourne]]) daughter of Black Sabbath manager [[Don Arden]], suggested former [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] to replace [[Ozzy Osbourne]] in 1979. Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. &quot;They were totally different altogether&quot;, Iommi explains. &quot;Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing ''across'' the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dio's term in Black Sabbath has also brought the &quot;[[sign of the horns|metal horns]]&quot; gesture to popularity in heavy metal subculture. Dio adopted it, originally a superstitious move to ward off the &quot;[[evil eye]]&quot;, as a greeting to the audience. Since then, the gesture became widely copied by fans and other musicians alike.&lt;ref name= Steve&gt;[http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=1216&amp;IssueNum=66 Oodyssey of the Devil Horns by Steve Appleford]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/columns/junkyard/the_devils_horns_a_rock_and_roll_symbol.html |title=The Devil’s Horns: A Rock And Roll Symbol |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979, and was initially replaced by [[Geoff Nicholls]] of [[Quartz (metal band)|Quartz]] on bass. The new line-up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980, and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by [[Martin Birch]], ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'', was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release ''AllMusic'' said the album was &quot;one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Prato, Greg |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r30740|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG Heaven and Hell Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heaven and Hell'' peaked at number 9 in the UK, and number 28 in the US, the band's highest charting album since ''Sabotage''. The album eventually sold a million copies in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=heaven%20and%20hell&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Heaven and Hell''|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980.

Black Sabbath toured the US throughout 1980 with [[Blue Öyster Cult]] on the &quot;Black and Blue&quot; tour, with a show at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Nassau Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]], New York filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as ''Black and Blue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=5 January 1981 |title=Brief Reviews: New Films |journal=New York Magazine |publisher=New York Media |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=&amp;nbsp;72 |issn=0028-7369 |accessdate=24 April 2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles with [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Molly Hatchet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=9 August 1980 |title=Stadiums &amp; Festivals |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume=92 |issue=32 |page=&amp;nbsp;34 |issn=0006-2510 |accessdate=24 April 2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 [[Days on the Green|Day on the Green]] at [[Overstock.com Coliseum|Oakland Coliseum]]. While on tour, Black Sabbath's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year old performance, entitled ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the British charts, and saw the re-release of &quot;Paranoid&quot; as a single, which reached the top&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:Dio IronFest.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Vocalist Ronnie James Dio]]
On 18 August 1980, after a show in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]], Bill Ward was fired from Black Sabbath. &quot;I was sinking very quickly&quot;, Ward later said. &quot;I was an unbelievable drunk, I was drunk twenty-four hours a day. When I went on stage, the stage wasn't so bright. It felt like I was dying inside. The live show seemed so bare, Ron was out there doing his thing and I just went 'It's gone'. I like Ronnie, but musically, he just wasn't for me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned with Ward's declining health, Iommi brought in drummer [[Vinny Appice]], without informing Ward. &quot;They didn't talk to me, they booted me from my chair and I wasn't told about that. I knew they'd have to bring in a drummer to save the (tour), but I'd been with the band for years and years, since we were kids. And then Vinny was playing and it was like 'What the fuck?' It hurt a lot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band completed the ''Heaven and Hell'' world tour in February 1981, and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2460156B&quot;&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=Mob Rules |albumlink= |bandname=Black Sabbath |year=1981 |notestitle= |first=Bryan |last=Reesman |pages=2–9 |format=CD booklet; 2008 reissue |publisher=Warner Bros./Rhino |publisherid=R2&amp;nbsp;460156&amp;nbsp;B |location=[[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Sabbath's second studio album produced by Martin Birch and featuring Ronnie James Dio as vocalist, ''[[Mob Rules (album)|Mob Rules]]'' was released in October 1981, to be well received by fans, but less so by the critics.

Unhappy with the quality of 1980's ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'', the band recorded another live album—titled ''[[Live Evil (Black Sabbath album)|Live Evil]]''—during the ''Mob Rules'' world tour, across the United States in [[Dallas]], [[San Antonio]], and [[Seattle]], in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=Live Evil |bandname=Black Sabbath |year=1983 |notestitle=Mob Rules World Tour 1981–1982 |first=Hugh |last=Gilmour |pages=3–5 |format=CD booklet; 1996 reissue |publisher=Gimcastle/Castle Communications |publisherid=ESM&amp;nbsp;CD&amp;nbsp;333 |location=England}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio.

''Live Evil'' is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody!

Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start [[Dio (band)|his own band]], and took drummer Vinny Appice with him. ''Live Evil'' was released in January 1983, but was overshadowed by [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s ''[[Speak of the Devil (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Speak of the Devil]]'', a platinum selling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Speak of the Devil''|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=speak%20of%20the%20devil&amp;artist=&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; live album that contained only Black Sabbath songs, released five months earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt;

=== ''Born Again'' (1983–1984) ===
The two original members left, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, began auditioning new singers for the band's next release. [[Whitesnake]]'s [[David Coverdale]] was reportedly approached and declined.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Also considered were [[Samson (band)|Samson]]'s Nicky Moore, and [[Lone Star (band)|Lone Star]]'s [[John Sloman]].

Although he performed on the album, drummer Bill Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. &quot;I fell apart with the idea of touring,&quot; Ward later said. &quot;I got so much fear behind touring, I didn’t talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=20215 |title=From Jazz to Black Sabbath |publisher=AllAboutJazz.com |accessdate=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was replaced by former [[Electric Light Orchestra]] drummer [[Bev Bevan]] for the [[Born Again Tour 1983|''Born Again'' '83 -'84 world tour]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Purple Story&quot; /&gt; (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]], and later in the US with [[Quiet Riot]] and [[Night Ranger]]. The band headlined the 1983 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], adding the Deep Purple song &quot;[[Smoke on the Water]]&quot; to their set list.

The [[Born Again Tour 1983|tour in support of ''Born Again'']] included a giant set of the [[Stonehenge]] monument. In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. As Geezer Butler later explained:

{{quote|We had Sharon Osbourne's dad, [[Don Arden]], managing us. He came up with the idea of having the stage set be Stonehenge. He wrote the dimensions down and gave it to our tour manager. He wrote it down in meters but he meant to write it down in feet. The people who made it saw fifteen meters instead of fifteen feet. It was 45 feet high and it wouldn't fit on any stage anywhere so we just had to leave it in the storage area. It cost a fortune to make but there was not a building on earth that you could fit it into.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic Rock Revisited interview&quot;/&gt;}}

=== Hiatus and ''Seventh Star'' (1984–1986) ===
Following the completion of the [[Born Again Tour 1983|''Born Again'' tour]] in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join [[Deep Purple]], which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like &quot;hired help&quot; by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named [[David Donato]]. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist [[Geezer Butler]] quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. &quot;When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me&quot;, Butler later said. &quot;I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to [[Warner Bros.]] and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn’t have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic Rock Revisited interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://classicrockrevisited.com/Interviews05/geezerbutler.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060829011113/http://classicrockrevisited.com/Interviews05/geezerbutler.htm | archivedate=29 August 2006 |title=Geezer Butler Interview |publisher=ClassicRockRevisited.com |accessdate=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Butler's exit, sole remaining original member Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist [[Geoff Nicholls]]. While working on new material, the original Black Sabbath line-up were offered a spot at [[Bob Geldof]]'s [[Live Aid]] benefit concert; the band agreed, performing at the [[Live Aid#JFK Stadium|Philadelphia]] show, on 13 July 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Purple Story&quot; /&gt; The event marked the first time the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of [[The Who]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504968/20050629/geldof_bob.jhtml|title=Live Aid: A Look Back at a Concert That Actually Changed the World|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=29 June 2005|publisher=MTV News|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist [[Dave Spitz]] and drummer [[Eric Singer]], and initially intended to use multiple singers, including [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]], ex-[[Deep Purple]] and [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]] vocalist [[Glenn Hughes]], and ex-Black Sabbath vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Purple Story&quot; /&gt; &quot;We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen123&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band spent the remainder of the year in the studio, recording what would become ''[[Seventh Star]]''. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seventh Star AMG Review&quot; /&gt; Pressured by the band's manager, [[Don Arden]], the two compromised and released the album as &quot;Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi&quot; in January 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ann Vare|first=Ethlie|date=8 March 1986|title=Sabbath's 'Seventh Star' Spotlights Iommi|work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media|location=Los Angeles|volume=98|issue=10|page=&amp;nbsp;47|issn=0006-2510|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It opened up a whole can of worms really,&quot; Iommi explained, &quot;because I think if we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seventh Star'', which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more [[hard rock]] elements popularised by the 1980s [[Sunset Strip]] hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as ''AllMusic'' gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album &quot;often misunderstood and underrated&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seventh Star AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r30742|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG Seventh Star Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new line-up rehearsed for six weeks, preparing for a full world tour, although the band were again forced to use the Black Sabbath name. &quot;I was into the 'Tony Iommi project', but I wasn't into the Black Sabbath moniker,&quot; Hughes said. &quot;The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn't appeal to me ''whatsoever''. Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like [[James Brown]] singing in [[Metallica]]. It wasn't gonna work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen123&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just four days before the start of the tour, vocalist Glenn Hughes got into a bar fight with the band's production manager John Downing which splintered the singer's [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital bone]]. The injury interfered with Hughes' ability to sing, and the band brought in vocalist [[Ray Gillen]] to continue the tour with [[W.A.S.P.]] and [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]], although nearly half of the US dates would eventually be cancelled because of poor ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Dwyer, Robert |url=http://www.sabbathlive.com/lists/CG83BA.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071229233848/http://www.sabbathlive.com/lists/CG83BA.html| archivedate=29 December 2007|title=Sabbath Live Cancelled tourdates 1985 |publisher=SabbathLive.com |accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One vocalist whose status is disputed, both inside and outside Black Sabbath, is Christian evangelist [[Jeff Fenholt]]. He has insisted that he was a singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot; /&gt; Tony Iommi has never confirmed this, as he was working on a solo release that was later named as a Sabbath album. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe-Young's book ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pDs5AgAACAAJ|title=Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath, book details|publisher=Google Book Search|publisher=Google|accessdate=24 April 2009|isbn=9780958268424|author1=Sharpe-Young, Garry|date=2006-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Eternal Idol'', ''Headless Cross'' and ''TYR'' (1986–1990) ===
Black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at [[Associated Independent Recording|Air Studios]] in [[Montserrat]] with producer [[Jeff Glixman]]. The recording was wrought with problems from the beginning, as Glixman left after the initial sessions, and was replaced by producer [[Vic Coppersmith-Heaven]]. Bassist Dave Spitz quit over &quot;personal issues&quot;, and ex-[[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]] bassist [[Bob Daisley]] was brought in. Daisley re-recorded all of the bass tracks, and wrote the album's lyrics, but before the album was complete, he left to join [[Gary Moore]]'s backing band, taking drummer [[Eric Singer]] with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; After problems with second producer Coppersmith-Heaven, the band returned to Morgan Studios in England in January 1987 to work with new producer [[Chris Tsangarides]]. While working in the UK, new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form [[Blue Murder (band)|Blue Murder]] with [[John Sykes]]. The band enlisted ex-Alliance vocalist [[Tony Martin (musician)|Tony Martin]] to re-record Gillen's tracks, and former drummer [[Bev Bevan]] to complete a few percussion overdubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt; Before the release of the new album, Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], South Africa during the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] era. The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with [[Artists United Against Apartheid]], who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drewett|first=Michael|title=Popular Music Censorship in Africa|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2006|page=27|chapter=The Cultural Boycott against Apartheid South Africa|isbn=0754652912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows, and was replaced by [[Terry Chimes]], formerly of [[The Clash]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt;

After nearly a year in production, ''[[The Eternal Idol]]'' was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. [[Allmusic]] said that &quot;Martin's powerful voice added new fire&quot; to the band, and the album contained &quot;some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eternal Idol AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2012|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG Eternal Idol Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blender'' gave the album two stars, claiming the album was &quot;Black Sabbath in name only&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eternal Idol Blender Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2225 |title=Blender Eternal Idol Review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=10 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album would stall at #66 in the UK, while peaking at 168 in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Albums&quot;/&gt; The band toured in support of ''Eternal Idol'' in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece. Unfortunately, in part because of a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident, other European shows were cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Live Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Dwyer, Robert | url=http://www.sabbathlive.com/80s-timeline.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071211002803/http://www.sabbathlive.com/80s-timeline.html| archivedate=11 December 2007|title=Sabbath Live Timeline 1980s |publisher=SabbathLive.com |accessdate=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist Dave Spitz left the band shortly before the tour, and was replaced by Jo Burt, formerly of Virginia Wolf.

Following the poor commercial performance of ''Eternal Idol'', Black Sabbath were dropped by Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with [[I.R.S. Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt; The band took time off in 1988, returning in August to begin work on their next album. As a result of the recording troubles with ''Eternal Idol'', Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. &quot;It was a completely new start&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen129&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iommi enlisted ex-[[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]] drummer [[Cozy Powell]], long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist [[Laurence Cottle]], and rented a &quot;very cheap studio in England&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen129&quot;/&gt;

Black Sabbath released ''[[Headless Cross]]'' in April 1989, and again ignored by contemporary reviewers. Eventually, Allmusic would give the album four stars, calling ''Headless Cross'' &quot;the finest non-Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Headless Cross AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2011|pure_url=yes}} |title=Headless Cross AMG review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anchored by the number 62 charting single &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, the album reached number 31 on the UK charts, and number 115 in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Albums&quot;/&gt; [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]], a good friend of Iommi's, played a guest solo on the song &quot;When Death Calls&quot;. Following the album's release, the band added touring bassist [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]], formerly of [[Whitesnake]] and [[Gary Moore]]'s backing band.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt;

The ill-fated ''Headless Cross'' US tour began in May 1989 with openers [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]] and [[Silent Rage]], but because of poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt; The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows, the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with [[Girlschool]]. Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia, after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Live Timeline&quot;/&gt;

The band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record ''[[TYR]]'', the follow-up to ''Headless Cross''. While not technically a [[concept album]], some of the album's lyrical themes are loosely based on [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt; ''Tyr'' was released on 6 August 1990, and reached number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the ''Billboard 200'' in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Albums&quot;/&gt; The album again would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with Allmusic noting that the band &quot;mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyr AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Chrispell, James |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1997|pure_url=yes}} |title=Tyr AMG review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=11 March 2008}}{{cite web| author=Chrispell, James |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1997|pure_url=yes}} |title=Tyr AMG review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Blender'' gave the album just one star, claiming that &quot;Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyr Blender Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Mitchell, Ben |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2228 |title=Tyr Blender review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=11 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band toured in support of ''TYR'' with [[Circus of Power]] in Europe, but the final seven UK dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Dwyer, Robert |url=http://sabbathlive.com/lists/CG90TYR.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051219022836/http://sabbathlive.com/lists/CG90TYR.html| archivedate=19 December 2005|title=Sabbath Live Timeline 1990s Cancelled shows |publisher=SabbathLive.com |accessdate=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in their career, the band's touring cycle did not include US dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Dwyer, Robert | url=http://www.sabbathlive.com/lists/90TYR.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060116055140/http://www.sabbathlive.com/lists/90TYR.html| archivedate=16 January 2006|title=Sabbath Live Timeline 1990s |publisher=SabbathLive.com |accessdate=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Dehumanizer'' (1990–1993) ===
[[Image:Heaven And Hell 4.jpg|thumb|Following a performance in 1990, both Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler ''(pictured)'' expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath]]
While on his own ''[[Lock Up the Wolves|Lock Up The Wolves]]'' US tour in August 1990, former Black Sabbath vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] was joined on stage at the Minneapolis Forum by former Black Sabbath bassist [[Geezer Butler]] to perform &quot;Neon Knights&quot;. Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. &quot;I do regret that in a lot of ways&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;We were at a good point then. We decided to [reunite with Dio] and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen129&quot;/&gt;

[[Ronnie James Dio]] and [[Geezer Butler]] joined [[Tony Iommi]] and [[Cozy Powell]] in the fall of 1990 to begin working on the next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blender Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2229|title=Blender Dehumanizer Review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=17 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer [[Vinny Appice]], reuniting the ''Mob Rules'' era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer [[Reinhold Mack]]. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio, and some songs were re-written multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;''Dehumanizer'' took a long time, it was just hard work&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen129&quot;/&gt; Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. &quot;It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works&quot;, he said. &quot;Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iommi &amp; Dio Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Wiederhorn, Jon |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=65255 |title=Interview with Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting album, ''[[Dehumanizer]]'' was released on 22 June 1992. In the US, the album was released on 30 June 1992 by [[Reprise Records]], as Ronnie James Dio and his [[Dio (band)|namesake band]] were still under contract with the label at the time. While the album received mixed {{nowrap|reviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blender Review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=2381e |title=Revelation Z Magazine ''Dehumanizer'' Review |publisher=RevolutionZ.net |accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} it was the band's biggest commercial success in a decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single &quot;TV Crimes&quot;, the album peaked at number 44 on the ''Billboard 200.''&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; The album also featured the song &quot;Time Machine&quot;, a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. Additionally, the perception by many fans of a return of some semblance of the &quot;real&quot; Black Sabbath provided the band with some much needed momentum.

Black Sabbath began touring in support of ''Dehumanizer'' in July 1992 with [[Testament (band)|Testament]]
