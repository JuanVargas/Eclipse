In practice, there have been three sources of unwritten constitutional law:

; Conventions : [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|Constitutional convention]]s form part of the constitution, but they are not legally enforceable. They include the existence of a Prime Minister and Cabinet, the fact that the Governor General is required to grant Royal assent to bills adopted by both Houses of Parliament, and the requirement that the Prime Minister either resign or request a new general election upon losing a vote of non-confidence in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].
; Royal prerogative : Reserve powers of the [[Monarchy in Canada|Canadian Crown]]; being remnants of the powers once held by the British Crown, reduced over time by the parliamentary system. Primarily, these are the [[Order-in-Council|orders-in-council]] which give the government the authority to declare war, conclude treaties, issue passports, make appointments, make regulations, incorporate, and receive lands that [[escheat]] to the Crown.
; Unwritten principles : Principles that are incorporated into the Canadian constitution by reference from the preamble of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. Unlike conventions, they are legally binding. Amongst the recognized constitutional principles are [[federalism]], [[democracy]], [[constitutionalism]] and the [[rule of law]], and respect for minorities.&lt;ref&gt;these were identified in [[Reference re Secession of Quebec]] [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Other principles include [[responsible government]], [[representation by population]]{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[judicial independence]], [[parliamentary supremacy]] and an [[implied bill of rights]].  In one case, the ''[[Provincial Judges Reference]]'' (1997), it was found a law can be held invalid for contradicting unwritten principles, in this case judicial independence.

'''Crochet''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ}}) is a process of creating fabric from [[yarn]], [[thread]], or other material strands using a [[crochet hook]]. The word is derived from the [[French language|French]] word &quot;crochet&quot;, meaning ''hook.'' Hooks can be made of materials such as metals, woods or plastic and are commercially manufactured as well as produced by artisans. Crocheting, like [[knitting]], consists of pulling loops through other loops, but additionally incorporates wrapping the working material around the hook one or more times. Crochet differs from knitting in that only one stitch is active at one time (the sole exception being [[Tunisian crochet]]), stitches made with the same diameter of yarn are comparably taller, and a single [[crochet hook]] is used instead of two [[knitting needle]]s. Additionally, crochet has its own system of symbols to represent stitch types.

==History==
===Origins===
Lis Paludan theorizes that crochet evolved from traditional practices in [[Arabia]], [[South America]], or [[China]], but there is no decisive evidence of the craft being performed before its popularity in [[Europe]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crochet.org/newslet/nl0997a.html|The History of Crochet] by Ruthie Marks.  ''Chain Link Newsletter'', September 1997.  Reprinted by ''Crochet Guild Newsletter''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest written reference to crochet refers to ''[[slip stitch crochet|shepherd's knitting]]'' from ''The Memoirs of a Highland Lady'' by Elizabeth Grant in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=vYXGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Memoirs%20of%20a%20Highland%20Lady&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|The Memoirs of a Highland Lady: the autobiography of Elizabeth Grant of Rothiemurchus, afterward Mrs. Smith of Baltiboys] by Elizabeth Grant, Longmans, Green, &amp; Co.,  New York, pp. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The first published crochet patterns appeared in the Dutch magazine ''Pénélopé'' in 1824. Other indicators that crochet was new in the 19th century include the 1847 publication ''A Winter's Gift'', which provides detailed instructions for performing crochet stitches, although it presumes that readers understand the basics of other needlecrafts. Early references to the craft in ''Godey's Lady's Book'' in 1846 and 1847 refer to ''crotchet'' before the spelling standardized in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;''Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Crochet'' by Donna Kooler, Leisure Arts, Inc., Little Rock, Arkansas, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Baby blanket detail.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a crocheted baby blanket. The corner square shows a common crochet pattern, the [[granny square]].]]
Knit and knotted textiles survive from very early periods, but there are no surviving samples of crocheted fabric in any [[ethnology|ethnological]] collection, or [[archeology|archeological]] source prior to 1800. These writers point to the [[tambour hook]]s used in [[tambour lace|tambour]] [[embroidery]] in [[France]] in the 18th century, and contend that the hooking of loops through fine fabric in tambour work evolved into &quot;crochet in the air.&quot;  Most samples of early work claimed to be crochet turn out to actually be samples of [[nålebinding]]. Donna Kooler identifies a problem with the tambour hypothesis: period tambour hooks that survive in modern collections cannot produce crochet because the integral wing nut necessary for tambour work interferes with attempts at crochet.&lt;ref&gt;''Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Crochet'' by Donna Kooler, Leisure Arts, Inc., Little Rock, Arkansas, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kooler proposes that early industrialization is key to the development of crochet. Machine spun cotton thread became widely available and inexpensive in Europe and North America after the invention of the [[cotton gin]] and the [[spinning jenny]], displacing hand spun linen for many uses. Crochet technique consumes more thread than comparable textile production methods and cotton is well suited to crochet.&lt;ref&gt;''Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Crochet'' by Donna Kooler, Leisure Arts, Inc., Little Rock, Arkansas, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early crochet hooks ranged from primitive bent needles in a cork handle, used by poor Irish lace workers, to expensively crafted silver, brass, steel, ivory and bone hooks set into a variety of handles, some of which were better designed to show off a lady's hands than they were to work with thread. By the early 1840s, instructions for crochet were being published in England, particularly by Eleanor Riego de la Blanchardiere and Frances Lambert. These early patterns called for cotton and linen thread for lace, and wool yarn for clothing, often in vivid color combinations.

===Early history===

[[Image:Irish crochet.jpg|thumb|[[Irish crochet]] lace, late 19th century. The design of this example is closely based on Flemish [[needle lace]] of the 17th century.]]
In the 19th century, as Ireland was facing the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845-1849)]], crochet [[lace]] work was introduced as a form of famine relief&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143651/crochet|Encyclopædia Britannica Entry on Crochet]&lt;/ref&gt; (the production of crocheted lace being an alternative way of making money for impoverished Irish workers).&lt;ref name=&quot;Crochet Lace Exhibit Catalog&quot;&gt;[http://lacismuseum.org/exhibit/Irish%20Crochet%20Lace.pdf| Irish Crochet Lace Exhibit Catalog] Lacis Museum of Lace and Textiles. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Mademoiselle Riego de la Blanchardiere is generally credited with the invention of Irish Crochet, publishing the first book of patterns in 1846.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crochet Lace Exhibit Catalog&quot;/&gt; Irish lace became popular in Europe and America, and was made in quantity until the first World War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2005-04-19/article/21207?headline=The-Art-That-Saved-the-Irish-From-Starvation-By-ZELDA-BRONSTEIN-&amp;status=301|The Art That Saved the Irish From Starvation] by Zelda Bronstein.  Berkeley Daily Planet, April 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern practice===
Fashions in crochet changed with the end of the Victorian era in the 1890s. Crocheted laces in the new Edwardian era, peaking between 1910 and 1920, became even more elaborate in texture and complicated stitching.

[[File:AnselAdamscrochet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Filet crochet]] by an internee at [[Manzanar]] War Relocation Center, 1943.  Photograph by [[Ansel Adams]]]]
The strong Victorian colours disappeared, though, and new publications called for white or pale threads, except for fancy purses, which were often crocheted of brightly colored silk and elaborately beaded. After World War I, far fewer crochet patterns were published, and most of them were simplified versions of the early 20th century patterns. After World War II, from the late 40s until the early 60s, there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts, particularly in the United States, with many new and imaginative crochet designs published for colorful doilies, potholders, and other home items, along with updates of earlier publications. These patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included wonderful variegated colors. The craft remained primarily a homemaker's art until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the new generation picked up on crochet and popularized granny squares, a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.
Although crochet underwent a subsequent decline in popularity, the early 21st century has seen a revival of interest in handcrafts and [[DIY]], as well as great strides in improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn. There are many more new pattern books with modern patterns being printed, and most yarn stores now offer crochet lessons in addition to the traditional knitting lessons.
[[Filet crochet]], [[Tunisian crochet]], [[broomstick lace]], [[hairpin lace]], [[cro-hook]]ing, and [[Irish crochet]] are all variants of the basic crochet method.

Crochet patterns have an underlying mathematical structure and have been used to illustrate shapes in [[hyperbolic geometry]] that are difficult to reproduce using other media or are difficult to understand when viewed two-dimensionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;hyperbolic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date = December 21, 2006  | url = http://www.theiff.org/oexhibits/oe1e.html | title = Hyperbolic Space | work = The Institute for Figuring | accessdate = January 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted, most commonly [[yarn]] or [[wiktionary:thread|thread]]. Additional tools are convenient for keeping stitches counted, measuring crocheted fabric or making related accessories. Examples include cardboard cutouts, which can be used to make [[tassels]], [[fringe (trim)|fringe]], and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a [[tape measure]] and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a [[row counter (hand knitting)|row counter]]; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.

=== Hook ===
[[Image:Crohook.jpg|thumb|upright|Aluminum crochet hooks]]
{{Main|Crochet hook}}
The crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminum, plastic and steel. Sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, and a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern. If gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size. Crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use. Hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters.

Steel crochet hooks range in size from 0.4 to 3.5 millimeters, or from 00 to 16 in American sizing. These hooks are used for fine crochet work such as doilies and lace.

Aluminum, bamboo, and plastic crochet hooks are available from 2.5 to 19 millimeters in size, or from B to S in American sizing.

Artisan-made hooks are often made of hand-turned woods, sometimes decorated with semi-precious stones or beads.

Crochet hooks used for [[Tunisian crochet]] are elongated and have a stopper at the end of the handle, while double-ended crochet hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle. There is also a double hooked apparatus called a [[Cro-hook]] that has become popular. 

A hairpin loom is often used to create lacey and long stitches, known as hairpin lace. While this is not in itself a hook, it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches.

=== Yarn ===

{{main|Yarn}}
[[Image:Yarn hank uncoiled.png|thumb|A hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop. A tie is visible at the left; after untying, the hank may be wound into a ball or balls suitable for crocheting. Crocheting from a normal hank directly is likely to tangle the yarn, producing snarls.]]

Yarn for crochet is usually sold as balls or skeins (hanks), although it may also be wound on spools or cones.  Skeins and balls are generally sold with a ''yarn band'', a label that describes the yarn's [[YarnWeight|weight]], length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc.  It is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased.  Crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot.  The dye lot specifies a group of skeins that were dyed together and thus have precisely the same color; skeins from different dye lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible stripe when added onto existing work.  If insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.

The thickness or [[YarnWeight|weight]] of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern.  Thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks.  Hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project.  Patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate patternwork.  Yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky. Quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (WPI).  The related ''weight per unit length''  is usually measured in [[Units of textile measurement|tex or dernier]].

[[Image:Yarn hank and ball.png|thumb|left|Transformation of a hank of lavender silk yarn (top) into a ball in which the yarn emerges from the center (bottom). Using the latter is better for needlework, since the yarn is much less likely to tangle.]]

Before use, hanks are wound into balls in which the yarn emerges from the center, making crocheting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled. The winding process may be done by hand, or with a ballwinder and swift.

A yarn's usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its ''loft'' (its ability to trap air), its ''resilience'' (elasticity under tension), its [[laundry|washability]] and colorfastness, its ''hand'' (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to [[pill (textile)|pilling]], its ''hairiness'' (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.  Other factors include allergenicity, speed of drying, resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew, melting point and flammability, retention of static electricity, and the propensity to accept dyes.  Desirable properties may vary for different projects, so there is no one &quot;best&quot; yarn.  
[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.png|thumb|upright|right|The two possible twists of yarn]]

Although crochet may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] fibers.  In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in an Z-twist or S-twist yarn.  If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a ''worsted''; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called ''woolen-spun''.  The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous ''filament'' fibers such as [[silk]] and many synthetics, or they may be ''[[staple (wool)|staples]]'' (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning.  The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn.  In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called ''worst''), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.  The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a ''slub'' is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.  

The spun fibers are generally divided into [[animal fiber]]s, plant and [[synthetic fiber]]s.  These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and synthetic [[polymer]]s, respectively.  Animal fibers include [[silk]], but generally are long hairs of animals such as [[sheep]] ([[wool]]), [[goat]] ([[angora goat|angora]], or [[cashmere goat]]), [[rabbit]] ([[angora rabbit|angora]]), [[llama]], [[alpaca]], [[dog]], [[cat]], [[camel]], [[yak]], and [[muskox]] ([[qiviut]]).  Plants used for fibers include [[cotton]], [[flax]] (for [[linen]]), [[bamboo]], [[ramie]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[nettle]], [[raffia]], [[yucca]], [[coconut]] husk, [[banana tree]]s, [[soy]] and [[Maize|corn]].  [[Rayon]] and [[cellulose acetate|acetate]] fibers are also produced from [[cellulose]] mainly derived from [[tree]]s.  Common synthetic fibers include [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Masson | first = James | title = Acrylic Fiber Technology and Applications | publisher = Marcel Dekker, Inc. | year = 1995 | location = New York 	| page = 172 | isbn = 0-8247-8977-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[polyester]]s such as [[polyethylene terephthalate|dacron]] and [[ingeo]], [[nylon]] and other polyamides, and [[olefin]]s such as [[polypropylene]].  Of these types, wool is generally favored for crochet, chiefly owing to its superior [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], warmth and (sometimes) [[felt]]ing; however, wool is generally less convenient to [[laundry|clean]] and some people are allergic to it.  It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk.  Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, [[Merino]] wool and [[Gossypium barbadense|Egyptian cotton]] are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.

A single spun yarn may be crochet as is, or [[braid]]ed or [[plying|plied]] with another.  In plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist.  The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, ''balanced'' yarn.  Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing ''cabled yarns'' or ''multi-stranded yarns''.  Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in [[bouclé]].  The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.

The dyeing of yarns is a complex art.  Yarns need not be dyed; or they may be dyed one color, or a great variety of colors.  Dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn.  A great variety of synthetic dyes have been developed since the synthesis of [[indigo dye]] in the mid-19th century; however, [[natural dye]]s are also possible, although they are generally less brilliant.  The color-scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its [[colorway]].  Variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes.

==Process==
Crocheted fabric is begun by placing a [[Slip knot|slip-knot]] loop on the hook, pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length. The chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds. Rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop. Stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain. At any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook. Tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time.
[[File:Crochet symbols.gif|left|thumb|Some crochet symbols, abbreviations, and US/UK terms]]
==International crochet terms and notations==
{{Main|List of crochet stitches}}
In the English-speaking crochet world, [[List of crochet stitches|basic stitches]] have different names that vary by country. The differences are usually referred to as UK/US or British/American.  To help counter confusion when reading patterns, a diagramming system using a standard international notation has come into use (illustration, right).

Another terminological difference is known as ''tension'' (UK) and ''gauge'' (U.S.). Individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches. In order to control for this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric. An individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook. North Americans call this ''gauge'', referring to the end result of these adjustments; British crocheters speak of ''tension'', which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.

==Differences from knitting==

One of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch is supported by the corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished croc heted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed. 

Round or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles. 

Freeform crochet is a technique that can create interesting shapes in several dimensions because new stitches can be made independently of previous stitches almost anywhere in the crocheted piece. It is generally accomplished by building shapes or structural elements onto existing crocheted fabric at any place the crafter desires.

Knitting can be accomplished by machine, while many crochet stitches can only be crafted by hand. Although some crochet patterns can emulate the appearance of knitting, distinctive crochet patterns such as the [[Granny square]] cannot be simulated by other methods. The height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubert|first=Margaret|title=Knit Or Crochet - Have It Your Way|year=2009|publisher=Creative Publishing International, Inc|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=978-1-58923-431-4|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, and tends to have less &quot;give&quot; than knitted fabric. It also uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items do, since each crochet stitch is composed of several loops versus a single loop as in knitting.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Charity==
It has been very common for people and groups to crochet clothing and other garments and then donate them to soldiers during war. People have also crocheted clothing and then donated it to hospitals, for sick patients and also for newborn babies. Sometimes groups will crochet for a specific charity purpose, such as crocheting for [[homeless shelters]], [[nursing homes]], etc.
It is also becoming increasingly popular to crochet hats and donate them to cancer treatment centers, for those undergoing chemotherapy.

==Mathematics==
[[Image:Crochet hyperbolic kelp.jpg|thumb|A collection of crocheted hyperbolic planes, in imitation of a coral reef.]]
Crochet has been used by mathematician [[Daina Taimina]] in order to create a version of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. A paper model based on the [[pseudosphere]] was created by [[William Thurston]], however, it was quite delicate. Daina Taimina used the art of crochet to create a strong, durable model, which received an exhibition by the [[Institute For Figuring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hyperbolic&quot; /&gt;

==Graffiti==
In the past few years, a practice called [[yarn bombing]], or the use of knitted or crocheted cloth to modify and beautify one's (usually outdoor) surroundings, emerged in the U.S. and spread worldwide.&lt;ref name=yarnbombing&gt;{{cite news | last = Anonymous  | title = Knitters turn to graffiti artists with 'yarnbombing' | language = English, U.K. | publisher = ''The Telegraph''  | date = 2009-01-21  | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4305406/Knitters-turn-to-graffiti-artists-with-yarnbombing.html  | accessdate = 2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification.

A '''coil''' is a series of [[wiktionary:loop|loop]]s. A '''coiled coil''' is a structure where the coil itself is in turn also looping. These objects are used commonly and are very important; some of their functions may be in bikes, cars trains and planes and are often used in conjunction with a thread.

==Electromagnetic coils==

[[File:Transformers.png|thumb|Diagram of typical transformer configurations]]
An ''electromagnetic coil'' (or simply a &quot;coil&quot;) is formed when a conductor (usually an insulated solid copper [[wire]]) is wound around a core or form to create an [[inductor]] or [[electromagnet]]. One loop of wire is usually referred to as a ''turn'', and a coil consists of one or more turns. For use in an [[electronic circuit]], [[electrical connection]] terminals called taps are often connected to a coil. Coils are often coated with varnish  and/or wrapped with insulating tape to provide additional [[Electrical insulation|insulation]] and secure them in place. A completed coil assembly with taps etc. is often called a ''winding''. A [[transformer]] is an electromagnetic device that has a ''primary winding'' and a ''secondary winding'' that transfers energy from one electrical circuit to another by magnetic coupling without moving parts. The term ''tickler coil'' usually refers to a third coil placed in relation to a primary coil and secondary coil. A [[coil tap]] is a wiring feature found on some electrical transformers, inductors and coil pickups, all of which are sets of wire coils. The coil tap(s) are points in a wire coil where a conductive patch has been exposed (usually on a loop of wire that extends out of the main coil body). As self induction is larger for larger coil diameter the current in a thick wire tries to flow on the inside. The ideal use of copper is achieved by foils. Sometimes this means that a [[spiral]] is a better alternative. Multilayer coils have the problem of interlayer [[capacitance]], so when multiple layers are needed the shape needs to be radically changed to a short coil with many layers so that the voltage between consecutive layers is smaller (making them more spiral like). 

===Analysis===
The [[inductance]] of single-layer air-cored cylindrical coils can be calculated to a reasonable degree of accuracy with the simplified formula
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\mu H}= \frac{R^2 N^2}{9 R + 10 L}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
where Henry [µH] (microhenries) are units of inductance, ''R'' is the coil [[radius]] (measured in inches to the center of the conductor), ''N'' is the number of turns, and ''L'' is the length of the coil in inches. The online [http://www.66pacific.com/calculators/coil_calc.aspx Coil Inductance Calculator] calculates the inductance of any coil using this formula. Higher accuracy estimates of coil inductance require calculations of considerably greater complexity.

'''Note''' that if the coil has a ferrite core, or one made of another metallic material, its inductance cannot be calculated with this formula.

===Coil examples===

==Chemistry, biology and medicine==

A [[Coil (chemistry)|chemistry coil]] is a tube of spiral form, used commonly to cool originating steam of the distillation and thus to condense them in liquid form.  In the [[Chemistry|study of how molecules interact with each other]], there are a few specific references to ''organic coils''.  During [[self-assembly]],  organic elements organize to form this structural pattern. [[Molecular self-assembly]] assembles the molecules, without guidance or management from an outside source, into these shapes. 

Examples of these structural patterns include:

* A ''[[coiled coil]]'' is a [[structural motif]] found in many proteins.
* A ''[[random coil]]'' is a [[polymer]] conformation where the [[monomer]]s are arranged at [[random]].
 
As an acronym, ''COIL'' denotes the [[Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser]].

In medicine, the ''[[Guglielmi Detachable Coil]]'' is a platinum coil commonly used in intracranial non-invasive surgery, for the occlusion of brain aneurysms.

==In Ceramics (Fine Arts)==
Coiling has been used to shape clay into useful beautiful vessels for many of thousands of years. It ranges from Africa to Greece and from China to New Mexico. They have used this method in a variety of ways. Using the coiling technique, it is possible to build thicker or taller walled vessels, which may not have been possible using earlier methods. The technique permits control of the walls as they are built up and allows building on top of the walls to make the vessel look bigger and bulge outward or narrow inward with less danger of collapsing. There are many ways to build ceramic objects using the coiling technique.  To do this, you take a pliable material (usually clay) then roll it until is forms a long roll.  Then, by placing a coil on top of another, you can form different shapes.

==Seafaring==
In sailing terms, a rope is said to be &quot;cheesed down&quot; when it needs to be stowed away neatly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tstiger.org.uk/resources/ropework.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles I''' (19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649) was the second son of [[James I of England|James VI of Scots and I of England]]. He was [[List of English monarchs|King]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[List of monarchs of Scotland|King]] of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]],  and [[List of Irish monarchs|King]] of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/charles_i_king.shtml|title= History—Charles I (1600–1649)| publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles engaged in a struggle for power with the [[Parliament of England]], attempting to obtain royal revenue whilst Parliament sought to curb his [[Royal prerogative]] which Charles believed was [[divine right of kings|divinely ordained]]. Many of his English subjects opposed his actions, in particular his interference in the English and Scottish Churches and the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent which grew to be seen as those of a tyrannical [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;royalukwebsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles I (r. 1625–49)|publisher=Royal.gov.uk|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheStuarts/CharlesI.aspx|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious conflicts permeated Charles's reign. His failure to successfully aid Protestant forces during the [[Thirty Years' War]], coupled with such actions as marrying a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Henrietta Maria of France|princess]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HenriettaMariaBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/henrietta-maria.htm|title=Queen Henrietta Maria, 1609–69|accessdate=20 April 2008|publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MarriageParliamentViews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/parliament-1625-29.htm|title= Queen Henrietta Maria, 1609–69|accessdate=20 April 2008|publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; generated deep mistrust concerning the king's [[dogma]]. Charles further allied himself with controversial religious figures, such as the [[ecclesiastic]] [[Richard Montagu]], and [[William Laud]], whom Charles appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Many of Charles' subjects felt this brought the [[Church of England]] too close to the Catholic Church. Charles' later attempts to force religious reforms upon Scotland led to the [[Bishops' Wars]], strengthened the position of the English and Scottish Parliaments and helped precipitate the king's downfall.

Charles' last years were marked by the [[English Civil War]], in which he fought the forces of the English and Scottish Parliaments, which challenged the king's attempts to overrule and negate Parliamentary authority, whilst simultaneously using his position as head of the English Church to pursue religious policies which generated the antipathy of [[reformed]] groups such as the [[Puritan]]s. Charles was defeated in the First Civil War (1642–45), after which Parliament expected him to accept its demands for a constitutional monarchy. He instead remained defiant by attempting to forge an alliance with Scotland and escaping to the [[Isle of Wight]]. This provoked the Second Civil War (1648–49) and a second defeat for Charles, who was subsequently captured, tried, convicted, and executed for [[high treason]]. The [[British monarchy|monarchy]] was then abolished and a republic called the [[Commonwealth of England]], also referred to as the [[English Interregnum|Cromwellian Interregnum]], was declared. Charles' son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], though he became king at the death of his father, did not take up the reins of government until [[English Restoration|the restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660.&lt;ref name = &quot;royalukwebsite&quot; /&gt; In that same year, Charles I was [[Canonization|canonised]] as '''Saint Charles Stuart''' and '''King Charles the Martyr''' by the [[Church of England]] and is venerated throughout the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles, King and Martyr|publisher=SKCM|url= http://www.skcm.org/SCharles/scharles_main.html|accessdate=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The second son of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] and [[Anne of Denmark]], Charles was born in [[Dunfermline Palace]], [[Fife]] on 19 November 1600.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalukwebsite&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/92.html|title = Memorable Christians|publisher=justus.anglican.org|accessdate= 20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandmother was [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Charles was baptised on 2 December 1600 by the [[David Lindsay (d. 1613)|Bishop of Ross]], in a ceremony held in [[Holyrood Abbey]] and was created [[Duke of Albany]], [[Earl of Ormond (Scottish)|Marquess of Ormond]], [[Earl of Ross]] and Lord Ardmannoch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlton, 2&quot;&gt;Carlton, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles was a weak and sickly infant. When [[Elizabeth I of England]] died in March 1603 and James VI of Scotland became [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] as James I, Charles was not considered strong enough to survive the journey to London due to his fragile health. While his parents and older siblings left for England in April and May that year, Charles remained in Scotland, with his father's friend and the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]], [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seton, Lord Fyvie]], appointed as his guardian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlton, 2&quot;/&gt;

By the spring of 1604, Charles was three and a half and was by then able to walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace unaided. It was decided that he was now strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family, and on 13 July 1604 Charles left Dunfermline for England, where he was to spend most of the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 3&lt;/ref&gt; In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Alletta (Hogenhove) Carey, the Dutch-born wife of courtier Sir [[Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth|Robert Carey]], who taught him how to walk and talk, and insisted that he wear boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help strengthen his weak ankles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 11&quot;&gt;Gregg, 11&lt;/ref&gt; However, Charles apparently eventually conquered his physical infirmity,&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 22&lt;/ref&gt; which may be attributable to [[rickets]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 11&quot;/&gt; and grew to an about average height of 5&amp;nbsp;feet 4&amp;nbsp;inches (162.56&amp;nbsp;cm).

[[File:Charles I as Duke of York and Albany Robert Peake.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Charles as Duke of York and Albany, c. 1611]]
Charles was not as valued as his physically stronger, elder brother, [[Henry Frederick Stuart|Henry]], [[Prince of Wales]]; whom Charles personally adored and attempted to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1605, Charles was created [[Duke of York]], which is customary in the case of the sovereign's second son. However, when Henry died of suspected [[typhoid]] (or possibly [[porphyria]])&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 29&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 18 in 1612, two weeks before Charles' 12th birthday, Charles became [[heir apparent]]. As the eldest living son of the sovereign Charles automatically gained several titles (including [[Duke of Cornwall]]&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 38&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duke of Rothesay]]), and subsequently was created Prince of Wales and [[Earl of Chester]] in November 1616.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles, Prince of Wales (later Charles I) by Isaac Oliver.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Charles as Prince of Wales by [[Isaac Oliver]], 1615.]]
In 1613, his sister [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] married [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] and moved to [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Loades, 352&quot;&gt;Loades, 352&lt;/ref&gt; In 1617 the Catholic [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] was elected king of Bohemia. The following year, the people of [[Bohemian Revolt|Bohemia rebelled]] against their monarch, choosing to crown Frederick V of the Palatinate, and leader of the [[Protestant Union]] in his stead. Frederick's acceptance of the crown in November 1619 thus marked the beginning of turmoil which would develop into the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This conflict made a great impression upon the English Parliament and public, who quickly grew to see it as a polarised continental struggle between Catholic and Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 356&lt;/ref&gt; James, who was supportive of Frederick, and had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and the Spanish Infanta, [[Maria Anna of Spain]], since Prince Henry's death,&lt;ref name=&quot;Loades, 352&quot;/&gt; began to see the [[Spanish Match]] as a possible means of achieving peace in Europe.

Unfortunately for James, this diplomatic negotiation with Spain proved generally unpopular, both with the public and James' court,&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 152&lt;/ref&gt; with '[[Arminism|Arminian']] divines providing a unique source of support for the proposed union.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament was actively hostile towards the [[Philip I of Spain|Spanish throne]], and thus, when called by James, hoped for a crusade under the leadership of the king&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 107&lt;/ref&gt; to rescue Protestants on the continent from Habsburg rule.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 110&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks upon the monopolists by Parliament for the abuse of prices led to the scapegoating of [[Francis Bacon]] by [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 108&lt;/ref&gt; leading to Bacon's impeachment before the Lords; the first of its kind which was not officially sanctioned by the King in the form of a [[Bill of attainder]] since 1459. The incident set an important precedent in terms of the apparent authority of Parliament to safeguard the nation's interests and its capacity to launch legal campaigns, as it later did against Buckingham, Archbishop Laud, the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]] and Charles I. However, parliament and James came to blows when the issue of foreign policy was discussed, with James insisting that the Commons be exclusively concerned with domestic affairs. The members of the Commons, meanwhile, protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons' walls.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 111&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1622 James dissolved the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Amith, 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles, and the Duke of Buckingham, James' favourite&lt;ref&gt;The Western Heritage, Eighth Edition, chapter 13, page 420&lt;/ref&gt; and a man who had great influence over the prince, together travelled incognito to Spain in 1623 in an attempt to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish Match.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amith, 156&quot;&gt;Amith, 156&lt;/ref&gt; The trip ended as an embarrassing failure however as the Spanish demanded that Charles must convert to Roman Catholicism and remain in Spain for a year after the wedding as hostage to ensure England's compliance with all the terms of the treaty. Moreover, a personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Spanish nation between whom was mutual misunderstanding and ill temper.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was outraged, and upon their return in October, he and Buckingham demanded that King James declare war on Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amith, 156&quot;/&gt;

With the encouragement of his Protestant advisers, James summoned Parliament in 1624 so that he could request subsidies for a war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loades 367&quot;&gt;Loades 367&lt;/ref&gt; At the behest of Charles and Buckingham, James assented to the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex]] by the House of Commons, who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loades 367&quot;/&gt; James also requested that Parliament sanction the marriage between the Prince of Wales and Princess [[Henrietta Maria of France]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 106&lt;/ref&gt; whom Charles had met in Paris while ''en route'' to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 80&lt;/ref&gt; It was a good match since she was a sister of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner, 577&quot;&gt;Gardiner, 577&lt;/ref&gt; (their father, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], had died during her childhood). Parliament reluctantly agreed to the marriage,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner, 577&quot;/&gt; with the promise from both James and Charles that the marriage would not entail a liberty of religion being accorded to any Roman Catholic not of the Princess' own household.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner, 577&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- However, the episode soured Charles' alliance with the Puritans. --&gt; By 1624, James was growing sick, and as a result was finding it extremely difficult to control Parliament. By the time of his death, February 1625, Charles and the Duke of Buckingham had already achieved de facto control of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 113&lt;/ref&gt;
{{House of Stuart|charles1}}
Both Charles and James were advocates of the [[divine right of kings]], but whilst James' lofty ambitions concerning [[Absolutism (European history)|absolute prerogative]]&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 359&lt;/ref&gt; were tempered by compromise and consensus with his subjects, Charles I believed that he had no need of Parliamentary approval, that his foreign ambitions (which were greatly expensive and fluctuated wildly) should have no legal impediment, and that he was himself above reproach. Charles believed he had no need to compromise or even explain his actions and that he was answerable only to God, famously stating: &quot;Kings are not bound to give an account of their actions but to God alone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/earlymod/lecture7c.html|title=Lecture 7: The English Civil War|publisher=History Guide|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyonthenet.com/Chronology/timelinecivilwar.htm|title=Timeline - English Civil War|publisher=History on the Net|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==

On 11 May 1625, Charles was [[Proxy marriage|married by proxy]] to [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] in front of the doors of the [[Notre Dame de Paris]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Trevelyan,117&quot;&gt;Trevelyan,117&lt;/ref&gt; before his first Parliament could meet to forbid the banns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trevelyan,117&quot;/&gt; Many members were opposed to the king marrying a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Roman Catholics and undermine the official establishment of [[Protestantism]]. Although he stated to Parliament that he would not relax restrictions relating to [[Recusancy|recusants]], he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with [[Louis XIII of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the price of marriage with the French princess was a promise of English aid for the French crown in the suppressing of the Protestant Huguenots at [[La Rochelle]], thereby reversing England's long held position in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The couple were married in person on 13 June 1625 in [[Canterbury]]. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at [[Westminster Abbey]], but without his wife at his side due to the controversy. Charles and Henrietta had seven children, with three sons and three daughters surviving infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0920728.html|title=Info Please: Charle I's Early Life|publisher=Infoplease.com|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles I of England.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Anthony van Dyck|Sir Anthony Van Dyck]]: Charles I painted in April 1634]]

Distrust of Charles' religious policies increased with his support of a controversial ecclesiastic, [[Richard Montagu]]. In his pamphlets ''A New Gag for an Old Goose'', a reply to the Catholic pamphlet ''A New Gag for the new Gospel'', and also his ''Immediate Addresse unto God alone'', Montagu argued against [[Calvinist]] [[predestination]], thereby bringing himself into disrepute amongst the Puritans.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 130,131&lt;/ref&gt; After a Puritan member of the House of Commons, [[John Pym]], attacked Montagu's pamphlet during debate, Montagu requested the king's aid in another pamphlet entitled &quot;[[Richard Montagu#The Appello|Appello Caesarem]]&quot;(1625), (a reference to an appeal against Jewish persecution made by [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul the Apostle]]).&lt;ref&gt;See Acts 25:10-12 (NRSV translation): &quot;Paul said, 'I am appealing to the emperor's tribunal; this is where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Now if I am in the wrong and have committed something for which I deserve to die, I am not trying to escape death; but if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can turn me over to them. I appeal to the emperor.' &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;Then Festus, after he had conferred with his council, replied, 'You have appealed to the emperor; to the emperor you will go.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions as to where Charles would lead the Church, fearing that his favouring of Arminianism was a clandestine attempt on Charles' part to aid the resurgence of Catholicism within the English Church.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles' primary concern during his early reign was foreign policy. The [[Thirty Years' War]], originally confined to Bohemia, was spiralling into a wider European war. In 1620 [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] was defeated at the [[Battle of White Mountain]]&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, 38&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1622, despite the aid of English volunteers, had lost his hereditary lands in the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]].&lt;ref&gt;Reddaway, 129&lt;/ref&gt; Having agreed to help his brother-in-law regain the Palatinate, Charles declared war on Spain, which under the Catholic King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] had sent forces to help occupy the Palatinate.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament preferred an inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World, hoping that the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets could finance the war. Charles, however, preferred more aggressive (and more expensive) action on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 368&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament only voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000; an insufficient sum for Charles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 129&quot;&gt;Gregg, 129&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of [[tonnage and poundage]] (two varieties of customs duties) to a period of one year, although previous sovereigns since 1414 had been granted the right for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 129&quot;/&gt; In this manner, Parliament could keep a check on expenditures by forcing Charles to seek the renewal of the grant each year. Charles' allies in the House of Lords, led by the Duke of Buckingham, refused to pass the bill. Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cadiz Expedition (1625)|war with Spain]] under the leadership of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] went badly, and the House of Commons began proceedings for the impeachment of the duke.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Charles nominated Buckingham as Chancellor of Cambridge University in response&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 150&quot;&gt;Gregg, 150&lt;/ref&gt; and on 12 June 1626, the House of Commons launched a direct protestation, stating,
'We protest before your Majesty and the whole world that until this great person be removed from intermeddling with the great affairs of state, we are out of hope of any good success; and we do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of your kingdom.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 150&quot;/&gt; Despite Parliament's protests, however, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead.

Charles provoked further unrest by trying to raise money for the war through a &quot;forced loan&quot;: a tax levied without Parliamentary consent. In November 1627, the test case in the King's bench, the '[[Darnell's Case|Five Knights' Case']] — which hinged on the king's prerogative right to imprison without trial those who refused to pay the forced load — was on a general basis, upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Summoned again in 1628, Parliament adopted a [[Petition of Right]] on 26 May, calling upon the king to acknowledge that he could not levy taxes without Parliament's consent, impose martial law on civilians, imprison them without due process, or quarter troops in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 116&lt;/ref&gt; Charles assented to the petition,&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 163&lt;/ref&gt; though he continued to claim the right to collect customs duties without authorisation from Parliament.

Despite Charles' agreement to suppress La Rochelle as a condition of marrying Henrietta Maria, Charles reneged upon his earlier promise and instead launched a poorly conceived and executed [[Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré (1627)|defence of the fortress]] under the leadership of Buckingham in 1628&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, 128&lt;/ref&gt; — thereby driving a wedge between the English and French Crowns that was not surmounted for the duration of the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan 119&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham's failure to protect the Huguenots — indeed, his attempt to capture [[Saint-Martin-de-Ré]] then spurred Louis XIII's [[Siege of La Rochelle|attack on the Huguenot fortress of La Rochelle]]&lt;ref&gt;Quintrell, 32&lt;/ref&gt; — furthered Parliament's detestation of the Duke and the king's close proximity to this ''eminence grise''.

On 23 August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 518&lt;/ref&gt; The public rejoicing at his death accentuated the gulf between the court and the nation, and between the crown and the Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 111&lt;/ref&gt; Although the death of Buckingham effectively ended the war with Spain and eliminated his leadership as an issue, it did not end the conflicts between Charles and Parliament over taxation and religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 96-97, 101-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 69-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal rule==
[[File:Charlesx3.JPG|thumb|''Charles I, King of England, from Three Angles'', the ''Triple Portrait'' by Anthony van Dyck.]]
In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the Parliament, which had been [[Legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice their opposition in light of the Rolle case, in which the eponymous MP had had his goods confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the confiscation as a breach of the [[Petition of Right]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0920729.html|title=Info Please: Charles I's Reign|publisher=Infoplease.com|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the petition's freedom-from-arrest privilege extended to goods. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 10 March, members held the Speaker, Sir [[John Finch]], down in his chair so that the dissolving of Parliament could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and poundage and tonnage to be read out.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, 16&lt;/ref&gt; The lattermost resolution declared that anyone who paid tonnage or poundage not authorised by Parliament would &quot;be reputed a betrayer of the liberties of England, and an enemy to the same&quot;, and, although the resolution was not formally passed, many members declared their approval. Nevertheless, the provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved parliament the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 105-06&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, eight parliamentary leaders, including [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], were imprisoned on the foot of the matter,&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 375&lt;/ref&gt; thereby turning these men into martyrs, and giving popular cause to a protest that had hitherto been losing its bearings.

Shortly after the proroguing of Parliament, without the means in the foreseeable future to raise funds for a European War from Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 170&lt;/ref&gt; or the influence of Buckingham, Charles made peace with France and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 172&lt;/ref&gt; The following eleven years, during which Charles ruled without a Parliament, are referred to as the [[Personal Rule]] or the Eleven Years' Tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 154&lt;/ref&gt; (Ruling without Parliament, though an exceptional exercise of the royal prerogative, was supported by precedent. By the middle of the 17th century, opinion shifted, and many held the Personal Rule to be an illegitimate exercise of arbitrary, absolute power.)
&lt;!-- Roger Maynwaring and Robert Sibthorp were major supports of abolutism --&gt;

===Economic problems===

The reigns of [[Elizabeth I]] and James I had generated a large fiscal deficit for the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 40&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the failure of Buckingham in the short lived campaigns against both Spain and France, there was in reality little economic capacity for Charles to wage wars overseas. England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg,220&lt;/ref&gt; Without the consent of Parliament, Charles' capacity to acquire funds for his treasury was theoretically hamstrung, legally at least. To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles first resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the &quot;Distraint of Knighthood&quot;, promulgated in 1279, which required anyone who earned £40 or more each year to present himself at the King's coronation to join the royal army as a knight.&lt;ref&gt;Quintrell, 460&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on this old statute, Charles fined all individuals who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626.

Later, Charles reintroduced obsolete feudal taxes such as purveyance, wardship, and forest laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quintrell, Brian 1993&quot;&gt;Quintrell, 62&lt;/ref&gt; Chief among these taxes was one known as [[Ship Money]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Quintrell, Brian 1993&quot;/&gt; which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than poundage and tonnage before it. Under statutes of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, argued that there was no legal bar to collecting the tax during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship Money provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634–1638, after which yields declined steeply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson, 8&quot;&gt;Adamson, 8&lt;/ref&gt; This was paid directly to Treasury of the Navy, thus making [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland]] the most direct beneficiary of the tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson, 9&quot;&gt;Adamson, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to Ship Money steadily grew, with [[John Hampden]]'s legal challenge in 1637 providing a platform of popular protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson, 8&quot;/&gt; However, the royal courts declared that the tax was within the King's prerogative.

The king also derived money through the granting of monopolies, despite a statute forbidding such action ([[Statute of Monopolies 1623|The Monopolies Act]], 1624), which, though inefficient, raised an estimated £100,000 a year in the late 1630s in royal revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 385&lt;/ref&gt; Charles also gained funds through the Scottish nobility, at the price of considerable acrimony, by the Act of Revocation (1625), whereby all gifts of royal or church land made to the nobility were revoked, with continued ownership being subject to an annual rent.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious conflicts==
Throughout Charles's reign, the issue of how far the [[English Reformation]] should progress was constantly brought to the forefront of political debate. [[Arminianism|Arminian]] theology contained an emphasis on clerical authority and the individual's capacity to reject salvation, and was consequently viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism by its opponents. Charles's sympathy to the teachings of Arminianism, and specifically his wish to move the Church of England away from [[Calvinism]] in a more traditional and sacramental direction,&lt;ref name=&quot;spiritus-temporis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/charles-i-of-england/|title=Charles I of England|publisher=Spiritus-temporis.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; consistently affirmed [[Puritan]]s' suspicions concerning the perceived irreligious tendencies of the crown. A long history of opposition to tyrants who oppressed Protestants had developed since the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most notably during the [[French Wars of Religion]] (articulated in the [[Vindiciae contra tyrannos]]),&lt;ref&gt;Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos, edited by George Garnett, Cambridge, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judson, 10&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in the [[Defenestration of Prague#Second Defenestration of Prague|Second Defenestration of Prague]] and eruption of the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, 35&lt;/ref&gt; Such cultural identifications resonated with Charles's subjects. These allegations would haunt Charles because of the continued exacerbating actions of both king and council, particularly in the form of Archbishop [[William Laud]].

William Laud was appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1633,&lt;ref name=&quot;WilliamLaud-BCW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/laud.htm|title=Archbishop William Laud, 1573-1645|publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nndb.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/435/000107114/|title=William Laud|publisher=Nndb.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began a series of unpopular reforms such as attempting to ensure religious uniformity by dismissing non-conformist clergymen, and closing Puritan organisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coward, 175&quot;&gt;Coward, 175&lt;/ref&gt; His policy was opposed to Calvinist theology, and he insisted that the Church of England's [[liturgy]] be celebrated using the form prescribed in the [[Book of Common Prayer]], and that the internal architecture of English churches be reorganised so as to emphasise the sacrament of the altar, thereby attacking predestination.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 174&lt;/ref&gt; To punish those who refused to accept his reforms, Laud used the two most feared and most arbitrary courts in the land, the [[Court of High Commission]] and the Court of [[Star Chamber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coward, 175&quot;/&gt; The former could compel individuals to provide self-incriminating testimony, whilst the latter, essentially an extension of the [[Privy Council]], could inflict any punishment whatsoever (including torture), with the sole exception of death.
[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Laud shared Charles's views on Calvinism]]

The first years of the Personal Rule were marked by peace in England, partly because of tighter central control. Several individuals opposed Charles's taxes and Laud's policies, and some left as a result, such as the Puritan minister [[Thomas Hooker]], who set sail for America along with other religious dissidents in the ''[[Griffin (ship)|Griffin]]'' (1634). By 1633 Star Chamber had, in effect, taken the place of High Commission as the supreme tribunal for religious offences as well as dealing with Crown cases of a secular nature.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Under Charles's reign, defendants were regularly brought before the Court without indictment, due process of the law, or right to confront witnesses, and their testimonies were routinely extracted by the Court through torture.

However, when Charles attempted to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his kingdom; not even paying visit until his Scottish coronation in 1633.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch, 521&quot;&gt;MacCulloch, 521&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637 the king ordered the use of a new Prayer Book to be used within Scotland that was almost identical to the English ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', without consultation with either the Scottish Parliament or [[Kirk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch, 521&quot;/&gt; Although this move was supported by the Scottish Bishops,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch, 522&quot;&gt;MacCulloch, 522&lt;/ref&gt; it was resisted by many [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Scots, who saw the new Prayer Book as a vehicle for introducing Anglicanism to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, 166&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, spontaneous unrest erupted throughout the Kirk upon the first Sunday of its usage, and the public began to mobilise around rebellious nobles in the form of the [[National Covenant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch, 522&quot;/&gt; When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland abolished Episcopalian government (that is, governance of the Church by bishops) in 1638, replacing it with Presbyterian government (that is, governance by elders and deacons),&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 180&lt;/ref&gt; Charles sought to put down what he saw as a rebellion against his authority.

In 1639, when the [[Bishops' Wars|First Bishops' War]] broke out, Charles did not seek subsidies to wage war, but instead raised an army without Parliamentary aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson, 9&quot;/&gt; However, Charles's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king was afraid of the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;Cust, 246-7&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Treaty of Berwick (1639)|Pacification of Berwick]], Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses, and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession whereby both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles's military failure in the First Bishops' War in turn caused a financial and military crisis for Charles, which ultimately ended the period of Personal Rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy211-235&quot;&gt;Murphy, 211-235&lt;/ref&gt; Charles's peace negotiations with the Scots were merely a bid by the king to gain time before launching a new military campaign. However, because of his financial weakness, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session by 1640 in an attempt to raise funds for such a venture. The risk for the king lay in the forum that Parliament would provide to his opponents, whilst the intransigence of the 1628 Parliament augured badly for the prospects of obtaining the necessary subsidy for war.

==The Second Bishops' War==
{{Main|Bishops' Wars}}
Charles collectively summoned both English and Irish parliaments in the early months of 1640.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson, 11&quot;&gt;Adamson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 1640 the [[Irish Parliament]] duly voted in a subsidy of £180,000 with the promise to raise an army 9,000 strong by the end of May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson, 11&quot;/&gt; However, in the English General Election in March, court candidates fared badly,&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 401&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles' dealings with the English Parliament in April quickly reached stalemate. Northumberland and Strafford together attempted to reach a compromise whereby the king would agree to forfeit Ship Money in exchange for £650,000 (although the coming war was estimated at around £1&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this alone was insufficient to produce consensus in the Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliamentarians' calls for further reforms were ignored by Charles, who still maintained the support of the House of Lords. Despite the protests of Northumberland,&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament was dissolved less than a month after it assembled, in May 1640; thus causing it to be known as the &quot;[[Short Parliament]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page76.asp|title=CHARLES I (r. 1625-49)|publisher=Royal.gov.uk|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carolus I Angliae.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Charles I with Seignior de St Antoine]]

By this stage [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]], created Earl of Strafford and elevated to Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in January 1640,&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, 124&lt;/ref&gt; had emerged as Charles' right hand man and together with Laud, pursued a policy of '[[Thorough]]' in support of [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Alan G.R. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally a major critic of the king, Strafford defected to royal service in 1628 (due in part to Buckingham's persuasion),&lt;ref&gt;Quintrell, 46&lt;/ref&gt; and had since emerged as the most capable of Charles' ministers. Having trained up a large army in Ireland in support of the king and seriously weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, particularly those members of parliament belonging to the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]],&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, 125&lt;/ref&gt; Strafford had been instrumental in obtaining an independent source of both royal revenue and forces within the three kingdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson, 9&quot;/&gt; As the Scottish Parliament declared itself capable of governing without the king's consent and, in September 1640, moved into Northumberland under the leadership of [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]],&lt;ref&gt;Glover, 171&lt;/ref&gt; Strafford was sent north to command the English forces following [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland's]] illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 313&quot;&gt;Gregg, 313&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, 101&lt;/ref&gt; had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts, and met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle where, at the [[Battle of Newburn]], Newcastle-upon-Tyne — and hence England's coal supply — fell into the hands of the [[Covenanter]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 216&lt;/ref&gt; At this critical juncture, the English host based at York was unable to mount a counterattack because Strafford was incapacitated by a combination of gout and dysentery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg, 313&quot;/&gt;

On 24 September Charles took the unusual step of summoning the ''[[magnum concilium]]'', the ancient council of all the [[Peers of the Realm]], who were considered the King's hereditary counsellors, who recommended making peace with the Scots and the recalling of Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loades, 404&quot;&gt;Loades, 404&lt;/ref&gt; A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was agreed in the humiliating [[Treaty of Ripon]], signed October 1640.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, 212&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day, until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled (which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces).&lt;ref name=&quot;Loades, 404&quot;/&gt; 

Consequently, in November Charles summoned what was later to become known as the [[Long Parliament]]. Of the 493 MPs of the Commons, 399 were opposed to the king, and only 94 could be counted on, by Charles, for support.

==The &quot;Long Parliament&quot;==
{{Main|Long Parliament}}
{{See also|Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}

The Long Parliament assembled in November 1640 and proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. The Parliament quickly began proceedings to impeach Laud of High Treason, which it succeeded in doing on 18 December.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 325&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Keeper Finch was impeached the following day, and he consequently fled to the Hague with Charles' permission on 21 December. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the [[Triennial Act]], to which the Royal Assent was granted in February 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 222&lt;/ref&gt; The Act required that Parliament was to be summoned at least once every three years, and that when the King failed to issue proper summons, the members could assemble on their own.

On 22 March 1641, Strafford, who had become the immediate target of the Parliamentarians, particularly that of [[John Pym]], went on trial for high treason.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, 151&lt;/ref&gt; The incident provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]], Gaelic Irish and New English settlers joined together in a legal body to present evidence against Strafford.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence supplied by [[Henry Vane the Elder|Sir Henry Vane]] in relation to Strafford's alleged improper use and threat to England via the Irish army was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym's case collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, 154&lt;/ref&gt; Pym immediately launched a Bill of Attainder, simply stating Strafford's guilt and that the Earl be put to death.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles, however guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlton, 225&quot;&gt;Carlton, 225&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Lords were opposed to the severity of the sentence of death imposed upon Strafford. Yet, increased tensions and an attempted coup by the army in support of Strafford began to sway the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlton, 225&quot;/&gt; On 21 April, in the Commons the Bill went virtually unopposed (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, 123&quot;&gt;Smith, 123&lt;/ref&gt; the Lords acquiesced, and Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, 123&quot;/&gt; The Earl of Strafford was beheaded two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1641, Charles assented to an unprecedented act, which forbade the dissolution of the English Parliament without Parliament's consent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon, 127&quot;&gt;Kenyon, 127&lt;/ref&gt; Ship money, fines in destraint of knighthood and forced loans were declared unlawful, monopolies were cut back severely, and the Courts of [[Star Chamber]] and [[High Commission]] were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, 335&lt;/ref&gt; All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 129&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles' government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he made several important concessions, Charles improved his own military position by securing the favour of the Scots that summer by promising the official establishment of Presbyterianism. In return, he was able to enlist considerable anti-parliamentary support.&lt;ref&gt;Starky, 112&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the attempted coup of '[[The Incident (conspiracy)|The Incident']] in Scotland, Charles' credibility was significantly undermined.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Irish Rebellion===
{{Main|Irish Rebellion of 1641}}

In a similar manner as pursued by the English Parliament in their opposition to Buckingham, albeit from a far less disingenuous stance, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that their opposition to Strafford had not negated their loyalty to Charles.  They argued that Charles had been led astray by the malign influence of the Earl,&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, 131&lt;/ref&gt; and that, moreover, the ambiguity surrounding [[Poynings' Law]] meant that, instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in the governance of Ireland, that a viceroy such as Strafford, the Earl of Wentworth, could emerge as a despotic figure.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, 137&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike their Old English counterparts who were Catholic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillespie, 3&quot;&gt;Gillespie, 3&lt;/ref&gt; the New English settlers in Ireland were Protestant and could loosely be defined as aligned with the English Parliament and the Puritans; thereby fundamentally opposed to the crown due to unfolding events within England herself.

Various disputes between native and coloniser concerning a transference of land ownership from Catholic to Protestant,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillespie, 3&quot;/&gt; particularly in relation to the [[plantation of Ulster]],&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 413&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with the gradual overshadowing of the Irish Parliament by the English Parliament&lt;ref&gt;Ó Siochrú, 108&lt;/ref&gt; would sow the seeds of conflagration in Ireland that, despite its initial chaos, provide the catalyst for direct armed combat within England between royalists and parliamentarians. The success of the trial against Strafford weakened Charles' influence in Ireland, whilst also providing a natural conduit for cooperation between the Gaelic Irish and Old English,&lt;ref&gt;Moody, Martin, 197&lt;/ref&gt; who had hitherto been antagonistic towards one another.&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, 322&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the conflict between the Gaelic Irish, and New English settlers, in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish whilst simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, Martin, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in November 1641 the House of Commons passed the [[Grand Remonstrance]], a long list of grievances against actions by Charles' ministers committed since the beginning of his reign that were asserted to be part of a grand Catholic conspiracy which the king was an unwitting member,&lt;ref name=&quot;Starky, 113&quot;&gt;Starky, 113&lt;/ref&gt; it was in many ways a step too far by Pym (passed by 6 votes, 200 abstained).&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 415&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the Remonstrance attacked the members of the House of Lords as being guilty of blocking reform, who duly defeated the Remonstrance when brought before them.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 135&lt;/ref&gt; The tension was heightened when news of the Irish rebellion reached Parliament, coupled with rumours of Charles' complicity.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 414&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish Catholic army, established by Strafford, whose dissolution had been demanded thrice by the House of Commons, professed their loyalty to the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon, 127&quot;/&gt; This was combined with the massacres of Protestant New English in Ireland by Gaelic Irish who could not be controlled by their lords, and proved to be the final antinomy between the English Parliament and the king in relation to Charles' authority to govern.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, 144&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout November a storm of publicity concerning the Irish depositions, coupled with stories concerning 'Papist conspiracies' alive within England herself circulated the kingdom, and were published in the form of a series of alarmist pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 416&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henrietta Maria.jpg|thumb|upright|Henrietta Maria (c. 1633) by Sir Anthony van Dyck]]
The English Parliament did not trust Charles' motivations when he called for funds to put down the rebellion, many members of the House of Commons fearing that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself. The [[Militia Bill]] was intended to wrest control of the army from the King, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone the king.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Militia Ordinance appears to have been the single most decisive moment in prompting an exodus from the Upper House to support Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 129&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into anarchy, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel [[Thomas Lunsford]], an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 137&lt;/ref&gt; When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his Catholic Queen, [[Henrietta Maria]],&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 417&lt;/ref&gt; the king decided to take drastic action which would not only end the diplomatic stalemate between himself and Parliament, but signal the beginning of the civil war.

Charles suspected, correctly, that there were members of the English Parliament who had colluded with the invading Scots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starky, 113&quot;/&gt; On 3 January, Charles directed Parliament to give up six members on the grounds of High Treason. When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which Charles intended to carry out personally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starky, 113&quot;/&gt; However, news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men — Pym, [[John Hampden]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]], [[William Strode]] and Sir [[Arthur Haselrig]] — slipped away shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January 1642.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starky, 114&quot;&gt;Starky, 114&lt;/ref&gt; Having displaced the Speaker, [[William Lenthall]] from his chair, the king asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall famously replied, &quot;May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4790900/Some-predecessors-kept-their-nerve-others-lost-their-heads.html|title=Some predecessors kept their nerve, others lost their heads|date=28 October 2000|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=3 June 2009 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Sparrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles abjectly declared 'all my birds have flown', and was forced to retire, empty-handed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starky, 114&quot;/&gt;

The botched arrest attempt was politically disastrous for Charles. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' arguments that the king was the only bulwark against a rising tide of innovation and disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 418&lt;/ref&gt; No English sovereign ever had (or has since that time) entered the House of Commons by force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luminarium&quot; /&gt; 

Parliament quickly seized London, and on 10 January 1642, Charles was forced to leave the capital, where he began travelling north to raise an army against his Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Civil War==
{{Main|English Civil War}}
The [[English Civil War]] had not yet started, but both sides began to arm as the summer of 1642 progressed. Following futile negotiations, Charles raised the royal standard in [[Nottingham]] on 22 August 1642.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 422&lt;/ref&gt; He then set up his court at [[Oxford]], when his government controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and north of England. Parliament remained in control of London and the south-east as well as East Anglia.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, 423&lt;/ref&gt; Charles raised an army using the archaic method of the [[Commission of Array]]. The [[First English Civil War|First Civil War]] started on 26 October 1642 with the inconclusive [[Battle of Edgehill]] and continued indecisively through 1643 and 1644, until the [[Battle of Naseby]] tipped the military balance decisively in favour of Parliament. There followed a great number of defeats for the Royalists, and then the [[Siege of Oxford]], from which Charles escaped in April 1646.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0920730.html|title=Info Please: Charles I's Civil War|publisher=Infoplease.com|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put himself into the hands of the Scottish Presbyterian army at [[Newark, England|Newark]], and was taken to nearby [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] while his &quot;hosts&quot; decided what to do with him. The Presbyterians finally arrived at an agreement with Parliament and delivered Charles to them in 1647. He was imprisoned at [[Holdenby House]] in [[Northamptonshire]], until cornet [[George Joyce]] took him by force to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in the name of the [[New Model Army]]. At this time mutual suspicion had developed between the New Model Army and Parliament, and Charles was eager to exploit it.

He was then transferred first to [[Oatlands]] and then [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court]], where more involved but fruitless negotiations took place. He was persuaded that it would be in his best interests to escape—perhaps abroad, to France, or to the custody of Colonel [[Robert Hammond (Governor)|Robert Hammond]], Parliamentary Governor of the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=List|title=of Persons Desired by His Majesty to Attend Him the Isle of Wight, The Parliamentary or Constitutional History of England, 1763}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided on the last course, believing Hammond to be sympathetic, and fled on 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Carisbrooke, Charles continued to try to bargain with the various parties. In direct contrast to his previous conflict with the Scottish Kirk, Charles on 26 Dec. 1647 signed a secret treaty with the Scots. Under the agreement, called the &quot;[[Engagers|Engagement]]&quot;, the Scots undertook to invade England on Charles' behalf and restore him to the throne on condition of the establishment of [[Presbyterianism]] for three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luminarium&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/kingcharles.htm |title=King Charles I |publisher=[[Luminarium Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royalists rose in July 1648, igniting the [[Second English Civil War|Second Civil War]], and as agreed with Charles, the Scots invaded England. Most of the uprisings in England were put down by forces loyal to Parliament after little more than skirmishes, but uprisings in [[Kent]], [[Essex]], and [[Cumberland]], the rebellion in Wales, and the Scottish invasion involved the fighting of pitched battles and prolonged sieges. But with the defeat of the Scots at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]], the Royalists lost any chance of winning the war.

==Trial==
{{Main|High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I}}
[[File:Court-charles-I-sm.jpg|thumb|upright|A plate depicting the Trial of Charles I on 4 January 1649.]]
Charles was moved to [[Hurst Castle]] at the end of 1648, and thereafter to [[Windsor Castle]]. In January 1649, in response to Charles' defiance of Parliament even after defeat, and his encouraging the second Civil War while in captivity, the House of Commons passed an Act of Parliament creating a court for Charles' trial. After the first Civil War, the parliamentarians accepted the premise that the king, although wrong, had been able to justify his fight, and that he would still be entitled to limited powers as King under a new constitutional settlement. It was now felt that by provoking the second Civil War even while defeated and in captivity, Charles showed himself responsible for unjustifiable bloodshed. The secret treaty with the Scots was considered particularly unpardonable; &quot;a more prodigious treason&quot;, said Cromwell, &quot;than any that had been perfected before; because the former quarrel was that Englishmen might rule over one another; this to vassalise us to a foreign nation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Luminarium&quot; /&gt; Cromwell had up to this point supported negotiations with the king, but now rejected further diplomacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luminarium&quot; /&gt;

The idea of trying a king was a novel one; previous monarchs ([[Edward II of England|Edward II]], [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]) had been overthrown and murdered by their successors, but had never been brought to trial as monarchs. Charles was accused of treason against England by using his power to pursue his personal interest rather than the good of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur082.htm | author=Samuel Rawson Gardiner (ed.) |title= The Charge against the King |work=The Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revoltion 1625-1660 |year=1906 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge against Charles I stated that the king, &quot;for accomplishment of such his designs, and for the protecting of himself and his adherents in his and their wicked practices, to the same ends hath traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented...&quot;, that the &quot;wicked designs, wars, and evil practices of him, the said Charles Stuart, have been, and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a personal interest of will, power, and pretended prerogative to himself and his family, against the public interest, common right, liberty, justice, and peace of the people of this nation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot; /&gt;

The High Court of Justice established by the Act consisted of 135 Commissioners but only 68 ever sat in judgement (all firm Parliamentarians); the [[prosecutor|prosecution]] was led by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[John Cooke (prosecutor)|John Cooke]]. Charles' trial on charges of high treason and &quot;other high crimes&quot; began on 20 January 1649, but Charles refused to enter a plea, claiming that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch.&lt;ref name=hrs&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes'', 5&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that his own authority to rule had been given to him by God and by the traditions and laws of England when he was crowned and anointed, and that the power wielded by those trying him was simply that of force of arms. Charles insisted that the trial was illegal, explaining, &quot;Then for the law of this land, I am no less confident, that no learned lawyer will affirm that an impeachment can lie against the King, they all going in his name: and one of their maxims is, that the King can do no wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur083.htm | author=Samuel Rawson Gardiner (ed.) |title= The King's reasons for declining the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice |work=The Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revoltion 1625-1660 |year=1906 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When urged to enter a plea, he stated his objection with the words: &quot;I would know by what power I am called hither, by what lawful authority...?&quot;&lt;ref name=hrs/&gt; The court, by contrast, proposed an interpretation of the law that legitimised the trial, which was founded on

: &quot;...the fundamental proposition that the King of England was not a person, but an office whose every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern 'by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoffrey Robertson 2005&quot;&gt;Robertson, ''Tyrannicide''&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period of a week, when Charles was asked to plead three times, he refused. It was then normal practice to take a refusal to plead as ''pro confesso'': an admission of guilt, which meant that the prosecution could not call witnesses to its case. However, the trial did hear witnesses. 

The King was declared guilty at a public session on Saturday 27 January 1649 and sentenced to death. [[List of regicides of Charles I|Fifty-nine of the Commissioners]] signed Charles' death warrant.

After the ruling, he was led from [[St. James's Palace]], where he was confined, to the [[Palace of Whitehall]], where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the [[Banqueting House at Whitehall|Banqueting House]].

==Execution==
[[File:Contemporary German print depicting Charles Is beheading.jpg|thumb|This contemporary German print depicts Charles I's decapitation.]]
Charles Stuart, as his death warrant states, was [[decapitation|beheaded]] on Tuesday, 30 January 1649. Before the execution it was reported that he wore two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear or weakness.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalukwebsite&quot; /&gt;

The execution took place at Whitehall on a scaffold in front of the [[Banqueting House]]. Charles was separated from the people by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, &quot;but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government.... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Luminarium&quot; /&gt;

Charles put his head on the block after saying a prayer and signalled the executioner when he was ready; he was then beheaded with one clean stroke. His last words were, &quot;I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;royalukwebsite&quot; /&gt;

[[Philip Henry (clergyman)|Philip Henry]] records that moments after the execution, a moan was heard from the assembled crowd, some of whom then dipped their handkerchiefs in his blood, thus starting the cult of the [[Society of King Charles the Martyr|Martyr King]]; however, no other eyewitness source, including [[Samuel Pepys]], records this. Henry's account was written during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], some 12 years after the event though Henry was 19 when the King was executed and he and his family were Royalist propaganda writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-history&quot; /&gt;

The executioner was masked, and there is some debate over his identity. It is known that the Commissioners approached [[Richard Brandon]], the common Hangman of London, but that he refused, and contemporary sources do not generally identify him as the King's headsman. ''Ellis's Historical Inquiries'', however, names him as the executioner, contending that he stated so before dying. It is possible he relented and agreed to undertake the commission, but there are others who have been identified. An Irishman named Gunning is widely believed to have beheaded Charles, and a plaque naming him as the executioner is on show in the Kings Head pub in
Galway, Ireland. [[William Hewlett (regicide)|William Hewlett]] was convicted of [[regicide]] after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axtellfamily.org/axfamous/regicide/DanielAxtellTrial1660.htm|title= Selections from the Trial and Execution of Col. Daniel Axtell in October 1660|publisher=Axtell Family|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1661, two people identified as &quot;Dayborne and Bickerstaffe&quot; were arrested but then discharged. Henry Walker, a revolutionary journalist, or his brother William, were suspected but never charged. Various local legends around England name local worthies. An examination performed in 1813 at Windsor suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.

It was common practice for the head of a traitor to be held up and exhibited to the crowd with the words &quot;Behold the head of a traitor!&quot; Although Charles' head was exhibited, the words were not used. In an unprecedented gesture, one of the revolutionary leaders, [[Oliver Cromwell]], allowed the King's head to be sewn back onto his body so the family could pay its respects. Charles was buried in private on the night of 7 February 1649, inside the Henry VIII vault in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]], Windsor Castle. The royal retainers [[Sir Thomas Herbert]], Capt. Anthony Mildmay, [[Sir Henry Firebrace]], [[William Levett]] Esq. and Abraham Dowcett (sometimes spelled Dowsett) conveyed the King's body to Windsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jMMBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA410&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;dq=levet+mildmay|title=A Narrative by John Ashburnham of His Attendance on King Charles I, 1830|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=27 October 2008|year=1830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=czoIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=%22thomas+herbert%22+levet|title=Memoirs of the two last years of the Reign of King Charles I, Thomas Herbert, 1815|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=27 October 2008|year=1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King's son, [[King Charles II of England|King Charles II]], later planned an elaborate royal mausoleum, but it was never built.

Ten days after Charles' execution, a memoir purporting to be written by the king appeared for sale. This book, the ''[[Eikon Basilike]]'' (Greek: the &quot;Royal Portrait&quot;), contained an ''apologia'' for royal policies, and it proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda. William [[Levett]], Charles' groom of the bedchamber, who accompanied Charles on the day of his execution, swore that he had personally witnessed the King writing the ''Eikon Basilike''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Hv__9MKX1aMC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=%22william+levett%22+king+charles|title=The Life of Charles the First, the Royal Martyr, Charles Wheeler Coit, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1926|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=27 October 2008 | isbn=9781428656673|date=2006-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cooke (prosecutor)|John Cooke]] published the speech he would have delivered if Charles had entered a plea, while Parliament commissioned [[John Milton]] to write a rejoinder, the ''[[Eikonoklastes]]'' (&quot;The Iconoclast&quot;), but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2H6gpNM-yFcC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=%22william+levet%22+marlborough|title=The Life of Charles the First, the Royal Martyr, Charles Wheeler Coit, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1926|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=27 October 2008 | first=Edward | last=Almack|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of the king, several works were written expressing the outrage of the people at such an act. The ability to execute a king, believed to be the spokesman of God, was a shock to the country. Several poems, such as Katherine Phillips' ''[[Upon the Double Murder of King Charles]]'', express the depth of their outrage. In her poem, Phillips describes the &quot;double murder&quot; of the king; the execution of his life as well as the execution of his dignity. By killing a king, Phillips questioned the human race as a whole—what they were capable of, and how low they would sink.&lt;ref&gt;Broadview Anthology of British Literature, Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

With the monarchy overthrown, and the [[Commonwealth of England]] declared, power was assumed by a Council of State, which included [[Lord Fairfax]], then Lord General of the Parliamentary Army, and [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The final conflicts between Parliamentary forces and Royalists were decided in the [[Third English Civil War]] and [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], whereby all significant military opposition to the Parliament and [[New Model Army]] was extinguished. The Long Parliament (known by then as the [[Rump Parliament]]) which had been called by Charles I in 1640 continued to exist (with varying influence) until Cromwell forcibly disbanded it completely in 1653, thereby establishing [[The Protectorate]]. Cromwell then became [[Lord Protector]] of England, Scotland and Ireland; a monarch in all but name: he was even 'invested' on the royal coronation chair. Upon his death in 1658, Cromwell was briefly succeeded by his son, [[Richard Cromwell]]. Richard Cromwell was an ineffective ruler, and the Long Parliament was reinstated in 1659. The Long Parliament dissolved itself in 1660, and the first elections in twenty years led to the election of a [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] which restored Charles I's eldest son to the monarchy as [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Oliver Cromwell was exhumed and posthumously beheaded.

Republicanism thus had a brief tenure in British governance, but nevertheless, the monarchy never regained the heights of power it had experienced under the Tudors and early Stuarts. Moreover, continued fears concerning the accession of a Catholic heir, and consequent persecution of the Protestant Church (as under [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]), or foreign intervention by the Habsburgs or French, meant that the right of succession was closely guarded. Ultimately, in the conflict between [[William III of England|William III]], and [[James II of England|James II]], it was William, the foreign usurper, who became the popular defender of Protestantism. Throughout the 19th century Parliament gradually assumed greater effective control of British government, whereby the king's prime minister became the de facto leader of the United Kingdom.

The [[Province of Carolina|Colony of Carolina]] in North America, which later separated into [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]] was named after Charles I, as was the major city of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. To the north in the [[Virginia Colony]], [[Cape Charles, Virginia|Cape Charles]], [[Charles River Shire]] and the [[Charles City Shire]] were all likewise named after him, although the king personally named the [[Charles River (Virginia)|Charles River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R.

During the reign of his son Charles II, Charles I was officially canonised by the [[Church of England]] as '''King Charles the Martyr''' and '''Saint Charles Stuart''', the only saint to be officially canonised within the [[Anglican Communion]]. His feast day varies depending on local Anglican liturgical calendars. He is considered a martyr who died for the preservation of [[Apostolic Succession]] in the Anglican Church. There are many societies dedicated to his devotion.

===Assessments===

Archbishop [[William Laud]] described Charles as &quot;A mild and gracious prince who knew not how to be, or how to be made, great.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Archbishop Laud, quoted by his chaplain Peter Heylin in ''Cyprianus Angelicus'', 1688&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralph Dutton says - &quot;In spite of his intelligence and cultivation, Charles was curiously inept in his contacts with human beings. Socially, he was tactless and diffident, and his manner was not helped by his stutter and thick Scottish accent, while in public he was seldom able to make a happy impression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dutton,232&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles was father to a total of nine legitimate children, two of whom would eventually succeed him as king. His wife also had two [[stillbirth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon47.html|title=Britannia: Monarchs of Britain|publisher=Britannia|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles is also believed to have had a daughter, prior to his marriage with Henrietta Maria. Her name was Joanna Brydges, born 1619-20, the daughter of a Miss Brydges (&quot;a member of a younger branch of the ancient Kentish family of that name&quot;), possibly from the line of Brydges of Chandos and Sudeley. Joanna Brydges, who was provided for by the estate of Mandinam, Carmarthenshire, was brought up in secrecy at Glamorgan, Wales. She went on to become second wife to Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]], author of ''Holy Living'' and ''Holy Dying'' and chaplain to both Archbishop Laud and Charles I. The Bishop and his wife Joanna Brydges left for Ireland, where Jeremy Taylor became Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore in 1660. Joanna Brydges and Jeremy Taylor had several children, including two daughters, Joanna Taylor (Harrison) and Mary Taylor (Marsh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblestudy.churches.net/CCEL/T/TAYLOR/HOLY_LIV/HOLY_LI1.HTM|title=A Sketch of the Life and Times of Bishop Taylor|publisher=Bible Study|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satucket.com/lectionary/Jeremy_Taylor.htm|title=Jeremy Taylor, Bishop and Theologian (13 August 1667)|publisher=Satucket.com|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Counter-Strike''''' (shortened sometimes to '''''CS''''') is a [[tactical shooter|tactical]] [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Valve Corporation]] which originated from a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' [[Game mod|modification]] by [[Minh Le|Minh &quot;Gooseman&quot; Le]] and [[Jess Cliffe|Jess &quot;Cliffe&quot; Cliffe]]. The game has been expanded into a series since its original release, which currently includes ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', ''Counter-Strike: Anthology'' and ''Counter-Strike'' on [[Xbox]].
''Counter-Strike'' pits a team of [[counter-terrorist]]s against a team of [[terrorism|terrorists]] in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force.

The game was the most played ''Half-Life'' modification in terms of players, according to [[GameSpy]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-12 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/stats/mods.asp?id=15&amp;s=1 |title=Top Mods For Half Life By Players |publisher=[[GameSpy]]}}{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

''Counter-Strike'' is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist or counter-terrorist team (or become a spectator). Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams [[spawning (computer gaming)|spawning]] simultaneously.

A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as &quot;freeze time&quot;) to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or walk/move (a player can still take damage, having the player drop from a certain height during freeze time was the only way a map designer could control the players starting &quot;[[Health (gaming)|HP]]&quot;). They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral &quot;buy zones&quot; that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.

Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage or planting (Terrorist)/defusing (Counter terrorist) the bomb.

The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and [[Ping (video gaming)|ping]] (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.

Killed players become &quot;spectators&quot; for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names until they spawn (come alive) again, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players; and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them (unless the [[CVAR|cvar]] &lt;tt&gt;sv_alltalk&lt;/tt&gt; is set to 1). Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of [[Internet cafe]]s and [[Voice over IP]] programs such as [[TeamSpeak]] or [[Ventrilo]]). This form of cheating is known as &quot;ghosting&quot;.

==Development==
{{Expand section|date=February 2009}}

===Mods and scripts===
Though ''Counter-Strike'' is itself a mod, it has developed its own community of script writers and mod creators. Some mods add [[Computer game bot|bots]], while others remove features of the game, and others create different modes of play. Some of the mods give server administrators more flexible and efficient control over his or her server. &quot;Admin plugins&quot;, as they are mostly referred as, have become very popular (see [[Metamod]], [[AMX Mod]] and [[AMX Mod X]]). There are some mods which affect gameplay heavily, such as Gun Game, where players start with a basic pistol and must score kills to receive better weapons, and Zombie Mod, where one team consists of [[zombies]] and must &quot;spread the infection&quot; by killing the other team (using only the knife). There are also the Superhero and ''[[Warcraft III]]'' mods which mix the first-person gameplay of ''Counter-Strike'' with an experience system, allowing a player to become more powerful as they continue to play. The game is also highly customizable on the player's end, allowing the user to install or even create their own custom skins, HUDs, sprites, and sound effects, given the proper tools.

===Cheating===
''Counter Strike'' has been a prime target for exploitation by cheaters since its release. In-game, cheating is often referred to as &quot;[[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]&quot; in reference to programs or &quot;[[hacker (hobbyist)|hacks]]&quot; executed by the user.

* '''Wallhacks''' allow the player to see through walls. These work by displaying objects that are normally obscured or by replacing opaque game textures with translucent ones. As the engine only [[Potentially visible set|renders the immediate area]] around the player, this does not allow a player to see the entire level at once.
* '''Speedhacks''' give the player increased foot speed. These work by sending false synchronization data to the server.
* '''Recoil hack''' removes any recoil (and thus improves accuracy) from a player's firearm.
* '''No spread''' is used to remove the random deviation normally experienced when the player shoots. This is similar to the recoil hack.
* '''Aimbots''' help the player aim at enemies. Practically the same as auto-targeting, These work by automatically moving the player's crosshair onto an enemy.
* '''[[Extrasensory perception|ESP]]''' shows textual information about the enemy; such as health, name and distance; also information about weapons lying around the map, which could be missed without the hack. Most ESP cheats show info through walls.
* '''Barrel hack''' depict's an enemy's gaze as a visible line.
* '''Anti-flash''' and '''anti-smoke''' remove the effects of the [[Flashbangs|flashbang]] and [[smoke grenade]]. Implementation is derived from the wall hack.

Valve has implemented an anti-cheat system called [[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (VAC). Players cheating on a VAC-enabled server risk having their account permanently banned from all VAC-secured servers.

With the first version of VAC, a ban took hold almost instantly after being detected and the cheater had to wait 2 years to have the account unbanned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/2346665/Counter-Strike?query2=cs%20skin%20nazi Counter Strike]&lt;/ref&gt; Since VAC's second version, cheaters are not banned automatically. With the second version, Valve instituted a policy of 'delayed bans,' the theory being that once a new hack is developed which circumvents the VAC system, it will spread amongst the 'cheating' community. By delaying the initial ban, Valve hopes to identify (and ban) as many cheaters as possible. Like any software detection system, some cheats are not detected by VAC and at times, the only effective anti-cheat solution is a human administrator watching an online game. Some servers implement a voting system, in which case players can call for a vote to kick or ban the accused cheater. VAC's success at identifying cheats and banning those who use them has also provided a boost in the purchasing of private cheats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869 |title=Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC) |accessdate=2011-01-21 |publisher=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cheats are updated frequently to minimize the risk of detection, and are generally only available to a trusted list of recipients who collectively promise not to reveal the underlying design.

The ESL wire anti-cheat program is one of the most modern anti-cheat programs. It took the developers, Turtle Entertainment, six months of work and more than $500,000{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} to finish the project. Although successfully preventing hacks from being run, the program faced strong criticism by the counter-strike community{{who|date=December 2010}} for its frequent crashing. It is still, however, the official anti-cheat program used by the Electronic Sports League in the league's online tournaments and competitions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Release==
When ''Counter-Strike'' was published by [[Sierra Entertainment]]/[[Vivendi Games|Vivendi Universal Games]], it was bundled with ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'' multiplayer, and the ''Wanted'', ''[[Half-Life: Absolute Redemption|Redemption]]'' and [[Firearms (video game)|''Firearms'']] mods.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;old bundle&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= IGN: Counter-Strike Review | url= http://pc.ign.com/articles/165/165191p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate= May 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 1999{{Verify source|date=October 2007}} [[Planet Half-Life]] opened its ''Counter-Strike'' section. Within two weeks, the site had received 10,000 hits. On June 19, 1999, the first public beta of ''Counter-Strike'' was released, followed by numerous further &quot;beta&quot; releases. On April 12, 2000, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] announced that the ''Counter-Strike'' developers and Valve had teamed up.

The non-beta release dates of ''Counter-Strike'' are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstrike-planet.com/view.php/csinfo/history/ Counter-Strike – CS info » history]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Version 1.0: November 1, 2000
* Version 1.1: March 13, 2001
* Version 1.3: September 12, 2001
* Version 1.4: April 24, 2002
* Version 1.5: June 12, 2002
* Version 1.6: September 15, 2003

'''Note:''' Version 1.6 effectively coincided with the release of [[Steam (software)|Valve Software's Steam content delivery system]]. All further updates and bug fixes have been dynamically delivered via Steam, without any specific new version numbers.

On January 25, 2003, a world wide competition was held by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] and hosted by [[Dell]]. Numerous Dell desktops and laptops were awarded in the competition which attracted over 10,000 participants. The competition was held over a two week period, with the winners &quot;b0b&quot; and &quot;jsrawr&quot; being announced on February 15 on Valve's website.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

On March 20, 2004, ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' was released. It contained a single player campaign and bots, as well as other changes.

''Counter-Strike'' received a major technology update and refresh on November 1, 2004 with the release of ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', which was heavily updated using [[Source engine|Valve's Source game engine]] to take advantage of more modern graphics and audio hardware. However, the original ''Counter-Strike'' is still available and played by many people via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], as the two variants are quite different, and players inevitably prefer one variant over the other.  Both versions continue to co-exist today.

''Counter-Strike'' was originally played online through the [[World Opponent Network|WON]] gaming service, which was shut down in 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;wonshutdown&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Valve to Close WON Servers | url= http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/530/530797p1.html | publisher=IGN.Com |date=2004-07-15 | accessdate= January 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forcing players to switch to [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. The non-Steam version of ''Counter-Strike'' (version 1.5) can still be downloaded from sites such as [[FilePlanet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fileplanet.com/57255/50000/fileinfo/Counter-Strike-1.5-Full-Mod-Client-%5BWin32%5D FilePlanet: Counter-Strike 1.5 Full Mod Client [Win32&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the closure of WON, part of the player community responded by creating their own WON network, dubbed [[WON2]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In March 2007, Valve implemented mandatory advertisements through Steam in official maps and in the game's GUI overhead. Customers have expressed frustration with the ads, including an over 200 page thread on Valve's official forums, saying that they violate original terms of service and distract from the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;csads&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Ads Now In CS1.6 | url= http://www.csnation.net/comments.php?id=8645 | publisher=CSNation | date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2007-06-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070316175637/http://www.csnation.net/comments.php?id=8645 |archivedate = March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thread was later deleted by an unknown moderator.

{{Main|Counter-Strike Online}}
As of February 2008, ''Counter-Strike Online'' is only available in [[South Korea]] and is now in open beta test.  It is being developed by [[Nexon Corporation]] with oversight from license-holder [[Valve Corporation]], and is an attempt to increase market share of Valve's games in the Korean gaming market.

}}

Counter-Strike received favorable reviews, and after the first release of the game, it sold over 4 million copies.

==Legacy==
''Counter Strike'' is famous for the culture surrounding it, which includes everything from professional gamers and leagues, to excessive cheating and disruptive behavior. Certain professional teams (such as [[SK Gaming]], 3D, [[mTw]], [http://www.navi-gaming.com Na`Vi] and [[fnatic]]) have come to earn a living out of it, while other clans and community based groups neither lose nor earn money via member donations which are self-sustaining in return for administrator rights in servers involved in the community.

''Counter-Strike'' remains extremely popular to this day. There are currently professional online leagues supporting ''Counter-Strike'', such as the [[E-Sports Entertainment]] League (ESEA), [[Virtual Entertainment Gaming Association]] League (VEGA) and [[CyberEvolution]], a pay-to-play league. Various LAN tournaments are held throughout the world such as the [[Electronic Sports World Cup]] (ESWC), the [[World e-Sports Games]] (WEG), and the [[World Cyber Games]] (WCG). Championship matches in these events are televised with commentary and analysis.

''Half-Life'' and other contemporary games took full advantage of hardware graphics acceleration in the late 1990s, replacing earlier software-rendered games such as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''. The continued popularity of ''Counter-Strike'' has meant that older video cards such as the [[3dfx]] [[Voodoo3]], [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]], and [[Nvidia]] [[RIVA TNT2]] remain useful.

There have been a multitude of games claimed by their developers, reviewers and fans to be &quot;''Counter-Strike'' killers,&quot; but none have seriously been able to dent its overall popularity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Server statistics in 2002 showed that ''Counter-Strike'' servers outnumbered their ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Unreal Tournament 2003]]'' or ''[[Quake III Arena|Quake III]]'' first-person shooter counterparts at least 3 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats Steam: Game and Player Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2008}}

However, as criticism of ''Condition Zero'' showed, the [[GoldSrc]] engine has already been surpassed by several generations of newer engines. Even ''Counter-Strike: Source'' has been criticized for not progressing the gameplay enough and failing to take full advantage of the [[Source engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.boomtown.net/en_uk/articles/art.view.php?id=6460 Boomtown - cs - Counter-Strike &amp;#91; link broken &amp;#93;]{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Globalize|section|date=September 2010}}

{{See also|l1=Video game controversy – Brazil|Video game controversy#Brazil}}
''Counter-Strike'' faced controversy in April 2007 when [[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]], now a disbarred attorney from Florida, predicted that the perpetrator of the [[Virginia Tech Massacre]] had been trained to kill in the game, well before [[Seung-Hui Cho]] (the shooter) was identified. News sources originally stated that Seung-Hui Cho only played the game in high school, however no video games whatsoever were found in the gunman's dorm room, and there is no evidence that he ever played Counter-Strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18220228 Were video games to blame for massacre?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23204875 Playing the blame game]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thompson also blamed Counter-Strike for the February 14, 2008 [[Northern Illinois University shooting]] perpetrated by [[Steven Kazmierczak]] on the day after the shooting. While it is reported that Kazmierczak played Counter-Strike in college, news agencies point out that mental health issues, and not video games, were the likely culprits in the shootings.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;/&gt;

On January 17, 2008, a Brazilian federal court order prohibiting all sales of ''Counter-Strike'' and ''[[Everquest]]'' and imposing the immediate withdrawal of these from all stores began to be enforced. The federal Brazilian judge [[Carlos Alberto Simões de Tomaz]], of the [[Minas Gerais]] judiciary section, ordered the ban in October 2007 because, according to him, the games &quot;bring imminent stimulus to the subversion of the social order, attempting against the democratic and rightful state and against the public safety&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/346800/brazilian-government-bans-counter+strike-everquest-fun Only In Brazil: Brazilian Government Bans Counter-Strike, EverQuest, Fun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080118/tc_afp/brazilcomputergamelaw Brazil bans popular video games seen to incite violence – Yahoo!

'''Camille Pissarro''' (10 July 1830 – 13 November 1903) was a French [[Impressionist]] and [[Neo-Impressionist]] painter born on the island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St Thomas]] (now in the [[US Virgin Islands]], but then in the [[Danish West Indies]]). His importance resides in his contributions to both [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]], as he was the only artist to exhibit in both forms. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including [[Courbet]] and [[Corot]]. He later studied and worked alongside [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]] when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54.

In 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the “pivotal” figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Impressionism historian [[John Rewald]] called Pissarro the “dean of the Impressionist painters&quot;, not only because he was the oldest of the group, but also &quot;by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality”.&lt;ref name=Rewald&gt;Rewald, John. ''Camille Pissarro'', Harry N. Abrams (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] said &quot;he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord,&quot; and he was also one of [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]]'s masters. [[Renoir]] referred to his work as “revolutionary”, through his artistic portrayals of the &quot;common man&quot;, as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without &quot;artifice or grandeur&quot;.

Pissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886. As a stylistic forerunner of Impressionism, he is today considered a &quot;father figure not only to the Impressionists&quot; but to all four of the major Post-Impressionists, including Paul Cézanne, [[Vincent van Gogh]] and Paul Gauguin.&lt;ref name=Bade&gt;Bade, Patrick. ''Monet and the Impressionists'', Fog City Press (2003) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:Pissarro-zwei schwatzende Frauen am Meer.jpg|thumb|&quot;Two Women Chatting By The Sea,&quot; St. Thomas, (1856)]]'''Camille Pissarro''' was born on July 18, 1830 on the island of [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] to Frederick and Rachel Pissarro.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hamilton |first=George Heard |editor=William D. Halsey |encyclopedia=''Collier's Encyclopedia'' |title=Pissarro, Camille |year=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Corporation |volume=19 |location=New York |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wold Eiermann, &quot;Camille Pissarro 1830–1903,&quot; in Christoph Becker, ''Camille Pissarro'' (Hatje Cantz: Ostfildern-Ruit, 1999), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, who was of [[Jews of Portugal|Portuguese Jewish]] descent, held French nationality and his mother was native [[Creole]].&lt;ref name=Bade/&gt; His father was a merchant who came to the island from France to deal with the business affairs of a deceased uncle, and married his widow. The marriage, however, caused a stir within St. Thomas’ small Jewish community, either because Rachel was outside the faith or because she was previously married to Frederick's uncle, and in subsequent years his four children were forced to attend the all-black primary school.&lt;ref name=Mendez&gt;Mendez, Serafin. ''Notable Caribbeans and Caribbean Americans: a Biographical Dictionary'', Greenwood Publishing (2003) pp. 349-350&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death, his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and St. Thomas’ Protestant church.&lt;ref name=Joachim&gt;Pissarro, Joachim.

When Camille was twelve his father sent him to boarding school in France.  He studied at the Savary Academy in [[Passy]] near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature when he returned to St. Thomas, which he did when he was seventeen. However, his father preferred he work in his business, giving him a job working as a cargo clerk. He took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practice drawing during breaks and after work.&lt;ref name=Masters&gt;''The Great Masters'', Quantum Books (2004) pp. 279-319&lt;/ref&gt;

When he turned twenty-one, Danish artist [[Fritz Melbye]], then living on St. Thomas, inspired Pissarro to take on painting as a full-time profession, becoming his teacher and friend. Pissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in [[Venezuela]], where he and Melbye spent the next two years working as artists in [[Caracas]]. He drew everything he could, including landscapes, village scenes, and numerous sketches, enough to fill up multiple sketchbooks. In 1855 he moved back to Paris where he began working as assistant to Anton Melbye, Fritz Melbye's brother.&lt;ref name=Gallery&gt;''Camille Pissarro'', Art Gallery of New South Wales, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pissarro.vi/exhibition.htm|title=Exhibition|publisher=St. Thomas Synagogue|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in France==

In Paris he worked as assistant to Danish painter [[Anton Melbye]]. He also studied paintings by other artists whose style impressed him: [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Charles-François Daubigny]], [[Millet]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]. He also enrolled in various classes taught by masters, at schools such as [[École des Beaux-Arts]] and [[Académie Suisse]]. But Pissarro eventually found their teaching methods “stifling,” states art historian [[John Rewald]]. This prompted him to search for alternative instruction, which he requested and received from Corot.&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Paris Salon and Corot's influence===

His initial paintings were in accord with the standards at the time in order to be displayed at the Paris [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], the official body whose academic traditions dictated the kind of art that was acceptable. The Salon’s annual exhibition was essentially the only marketplace for young artists to gain exposure. As a result, Pissarro worked in the traditional and prescribed manner in order to satisfy the tastes of its official committee.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

In 1859 his first painting was accepted and exhibited. His other paintings during that period were influenced by [[Camille Corot]], who tutored him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artknowledgenews.com/Pissarro Pissarro Exhibition PowerPoint with sound]&lt;/ref&gt; He and Corot both shared a love of rural scenes painted from nature. It was from Corot that Pissarro was inspired to paint outdoors, also called &quot;[[plein air]]&quot; painting. Pissarro found Corot, along with the work of [[Gustave Courbet]], to be “statements of pictorial truth,” writes Rewald. He discussed their work often. [[Millet]] was another whose work he admired, especially his “sentimental renditions of rural life”.&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|12}}

===Use of outdoor natural settings===
[[File:Camille Pissarro 012.jpg|thumb|left|''Entrée du village de Voisins'' (1872)]]

During this period Pissarro began to understand and appreciate the importance of expressing on canvas the beauties of nature without adulteration.&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|12}} After a year in Paris, he therefore began to leave the city and paint scenes in the countryside to capture the daily reality of village life. He found the French countryside to be “picturesque,” and worthy of being painted. It was still mostly agricultural and sometimes called the “golden age of the peasantry”.&lt;ref name=Gallery&gt;’’Camille Pissarro’’, Art Gallery of New South Wales, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} Pissarro later explained the technique of painting outdoors to a student:

:”Work at the same time upon sky, water, branches, ground, keeping everything going on and equal basis and unceasingly rework until you have got it. Paint generously and unhesitatingly, for it is best not to lose the first impression.”&lt;ref&gt;Rewald, John. ''The History of Impressionism'', Harry Abrams, (1990) p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

Corot, however, would complete his own scenic paintings back in his studio where they would often be revised to his preconceptions. Pissarro, on the other hand, preferred to finish his paintings outdoors, often at one sitting, which gave his work a more realistic feel. As a result, his art was sometimes criticized as being “vulgar,” because he painted what he saw: “rutted and edged hodgepodge of bushes, mounds of earth, and trees in various stages of development.” According to one source, details such as those were equivalent to today’s art showing garbage cans or beer bottles on the side of a street scene. This difference in style created disagreements between Pissarro and Corot.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

===With Monet, Cézanne, and Guillaumin===
In 1859, while attending the free school, the [[Academie Suisse]], Pissarro, became friends with a number of younger artists who likewise chose to paint in the more realistic style. Among them were [[Claude Monet]], [[Armand Guillaumin]] and [[Paul Cézanne]]. What they shared in common was their dissatisfaction with the dictates of the Salon. Cézanne’s work had been mocked at the time by the others in the school, and, writes Rewald, in his later years Cézanne &quot;never forgot the sympathy and understanding with which Pissarro encouraged him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|16}}  As a part of the group, Pissarro was comforted from knowing he was not alone, and that others similarly struggled with their art.

Pissarro agreed with the group about the importance of portraying individuals in natural settings, and expressed his dislike of any artifice or grandeur in his works, despite what the Salon demanded for its exhibits. In 1863 almost all of the group’s paintings were rejected by the Salon, and French president [[Napoleon III]] instead decided to place their paintings in a separate exhibit hall, the [[Salon des Refuses]]. However, only works of Pissarro and Cézanne were included, and the separate exhibit brought a hostile response from both the officials of the Salon and the public.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

In subsequent Salon exhibits of 1865 and 1866, Pissarro acknowledged his influences from Melbye and Corot, whom he listed as his masters in the catalog. But in the exhibition of 1868 he no longer credited other artists as an influence, in effect declaring his independence as a painter. This was noted at the time by art critic and author [[Emile Zola]], who offered his opinion:

:”Camille Pissarro is one of the three or four true painters of this day . . . I have rarely encountered a technique that is so sure.”&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;
[[Image:Camille Pissaro et sa femme Julie Vellay en 1877 à Pontoise.jpg|thumb|right|''Camille Pissarro and his wife, Julie Vellay'', 1877, [[Pontoise]]]]
Another writer tries to describe elements of Pissarro's style:
:”The brightness of his palette envelops objects in atmosphere. . . He paints the smell of the earth.”&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|35}}

In the late 1860s or early 1870s, Pissarro became fascinated with [[Japanese prints]], which influenced his desire to experiment in new compositions. He described the art to his son Lucien:

:”It is marvelous. This is what I see in the art of this astonishing people . . . nothing that leaps to the eye, a calm, a grandeur, an extraordinary unity, a rather subdued radiance. . . “&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|19}}

===Marriage and children===
In 1871 he married his mother’s maid, Julie Vellay, a vineyard grower’s daughter, with whom he would later have seven children. They lived outside of Paris in [[Pontoise]] and later in [[Louveciennes]], both of which places inspired many of this paintings, including scenes of village life, along with rivers, woods, and  people at work. He also kept in touch with the other artists of his earlier group, especially Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, and Bazille.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

==The London years==
After the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, having only Danish nationality and being unable to join the army, he moved his family to Norwood, a village outside of London. However, his style of painting, which was a forerunner of what was later called “Impressionism,” did not do well. He writes to his friend, Theodore Duret, that “my painting doesn’t catch on, not at all. . .”&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

Pissarro met the Paris art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], in London, who became dealer who helped sell his art for most of his life. Durand-Ruel put him in touch with [[Monet]] who was likewise in London during this period. They both viewed the work of British landscape artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]], which confirmed to their belief that their style of open air painting gave the truest depiction of light and atmosphere, an effect that they felt could not be achieved in the studio alone. Pissarro’s paintings also began to take on a more spontaneous look, with loosely blended brushstrokes and areas of impasto, giving more depth to the work.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

;Paintings
Through the paintings Pissarro completed at this time, he records Sydenham and the Norwoods at a time when they were just recently connected by railways, but prior to the expansion of suburbia. One of the largest of these paintings is a view of ''St. Bartholomew's Church'' at Lawrie Park Avenue, commonly known as [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6493 ''The Avenue, Sydenham''], in the collection of the [[London National Gallery]]. Twelve oil paintings date from his stay in Upper Norwood and are listed and illustrated in the [[catalogue raisonné]] prepared jointly by his fifth child Ludovic-Rodolphe Pissarro and Lionello Venturi and published in 1939. These paintings include ''Norwood Under the Snow'', and ''[[Lordship Lane (Dulwich)|Lordship Lane Station]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/artchive/P/pissarro/pissarro_lordship.jpg.html artchive.com] entry for Pissarro Lordship Lane&lt;/ref&gt; views of [[The Crystal Palace]] relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], ''[[Dulwich College]]'', ''[[Sydenham Hill]]'', ''[[All Saints Church]]'', and a lost painting of St. Stephen's Church.

Returning to France, in 1890 Pissarro again visited England and painted some ten scenes of central London. He came back again in 1892, painting in [[Kew Gardens]] and [[Kew Green]], and also in 1897, when he produced several oils of [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], [[Chiswick]].&lt;ref&gt;For more details of his British visits, see Nicholas Reed, ''Camille Pissarro at Crystal Palace'' and ''Pissarro in West London'', published by Lilburne Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Impressionism==
[[File:Camille Pissarro 023.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape at [[Pontoise]]'', 1874]]
When Pissarro returned to his home in France after the war, he discovered that of the 1,500 paintings he had done over 20 years, which he was forced to leave behind when he moved to London, only 40 remained. The rest had been damaged or destroyed by the soldiers, who often used them as floor mats outside in the mud to keep their boots clean. It is assumed that many of those lost were done in the Impressionist style he was then developing, thereby “documenting the birth of [[Impressionism]],&quot; a style that some credit him with inventing.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

He soon reestablished his friendships with the other Impressionist artists of his earlier group, including Cézanne, Monet, Manet, Renoir, and Degas. Pissarro now expressed his opinion to the group that he wanted an alternative to the Salon so their group could display their own unique styles. 

To assist in that endeavor, in 1873 he helped establish a separate collective, called the &quot;Societe Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs,&quot; which included fifteen artists. Pissarro created the group’s first charter and became the “pivotal” figure in establishing and holding the group together. One writer noted that with his prematurely gray beard, the forty-three year old Pissarro was regarded as a “wise elder and father figure” by the group.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt; Yet he was able to work alongside the other artists on equal terms due to his youthful temperament and creativity. Another writer said of him that “he has unchanging spiritual youth and the look of an ancestor who remained a young man”.&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|36}}

===Impressionist Exhibitions===
The following year, in 1874, the group held their first Impressionist Exhibition, which shocked and “horrified” the critics, who primarily appreciated only scenes portraying religious, historical, or mythological settings. They found fault with the Impressionist paintings on many grounds:&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

*The subject matter was considered “vulgar” and “commonplace,” with scenes of street people going about their everyday lives. Pissarro’s paintings, for instance, showed scenes of muddy, dirty, and unkempt settings;
*The manner of painting was too sketchy and looked incomplete, especially compared to the traditional styles of the period. The use of visible and expressive brushwork by all the artists was considered an insult to the craft of traditional artists, who often spent weeks on their work. Here, the paintings were often done in one sitting and the paints were applied wet-on-wet;
*The use of color by the Impressionists relied on new theories they developed, such as having shadows painted with the reflected light of surrounding, and often unseen, objects.

===A &quot;revolutionary&quot; style===
[[File:Camille Pissarro, Le verger (The Orchard), 1872.jpg|thumb|'' Orchard in Bloom, Louveciennes'' (1872)]]Pissarro showed five of his paintings, all landscapes, at the exhibit, and again [[Emile Zola]] praised his art and that of the others. One critic, Armand Silvestre, credited Pissarro with being “basically the inventor of this [Impressionist] painting”. In the Impressionist exhibit of 1876 however, art critic Albert Wolf complained in his review, “Try to make M Pissarro understand that trees are not violet, that sky is not the color of fresh butter . . .”  Journalist and art critic [[Octave Mirbeau]] on the other hand, writes, “Camille Pissarro has been a revolutionary through the revitalized working methods with which he has endowed painting”.&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|36}}
According to Rewald, Pissarro had taken on an attitude more simple and natural than the other artists. He writes:

:“Rather than glorifying—consciously or not—the rugged existence of the peasants, he placed them without any ‘pose’ in their habitual surroundings, thus becoming an objective chronicler of one of the many facets of contemporary life.”&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In later years, Cézanne also recalled this period and referred to Pissarro as “the first Impressionist”.  In 1906, a few years after Pissarro’s death, Cézanne, then sixty-seven and a role model for the new generation of artists, paid Pissarro a debt of gratitude by having himself listed in an exhibition catalog as “Paul Cézanne, pupil of Pissarro”.&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Pissarro, [[Degas]], and American impressionist [[Mary Cassatt]] self-published a journal of their original prints in the late 1870s, which contained a large group of their own fine etchings.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt; Joachim Pissarro notes that they “professed a passionate disdain for the Salons and refused to exhibit at them.”&lt;ref name=Joachim/&gt; Together they shared an “almost militant resolution” against the Salon, and through their later correspondences it is clear that their mutual admiration “was based on a kinship of ethical as well as aesthetic concerns”.&lt;ref name=Joachim/&gt;

Cassatt had befriended Degas and Pissarro years earlier when she joined Pissarro's newly formed French Impressionist group and gave up opportunities to exhibit in the United States. She and Pissarro were often treated as &quot;two outsiders&quot; by the Salon since neither were French or had become French citizens. However, she was &quot;fired up with the cause&quot; of promoting Impressionism and looked forward to exhibiting &quot;out of solidarity with her new friends&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, Sue. ''The Private Lives of the Impressionists'', HarperCollins (2006) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the Impressionist period, she began to avoid Degas, against whose &quot;wicked tongue&quot; she was unable to defend herself. Instead, she came to prefer the company of &quot;the gentle Camille Pissarro&quot;, with whom she could speak frankly about the changing attitudes toward art.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, Nancy Mowll. ''Mary Cassatt: A Life'', Yale Univ. Press (1994) pp. 139, 190-197, 239&lt;/ref&gt; She once described him as a teacher &quot;that could have taught the stones to draw correctly.&quot;&lt;ref name= Masters/&gt;

==Neo-Impressionism period==

By the 1880s, Pissarro began to explore new themes and methods of painting in order to break out of what he felt was an artistic “mire”. As a result, Pissarro went back to his earlier themes by painting the life of country people, which he had done in Venezuela in his youth. Degas described Pissarro’s subjects as “peasants working to make a living”.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

However, this period also marked the end of the Impressionist period due to Pissarro’s leaving the movement. As Joachim Pissarro points out, “Once such a die-hard Impressionist as Pissarro had turned his back on Impressionism, it was apparent that Impressionism had no chance of surviving. . . “&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|52}}

It was Pisssarro’s intention during this period to help “educate the public” by painting people at work or at home in realistic settings, without idealizing their lives. [[Renoir]], in 1882, referred to Pissarro’s work during this period as “revolutionary,” in his attempt to portray the &quot;common man.&quot; Pissarro himself did not use his art to overtly preach any kind of political message, however, although his preference for painting humble subjects was intended to be seen and purchased by his upper class clientele. He also began painting with a more unified brushwork along with pure strokes of color.

===Studying with Seurat and Signac===
[[File:Pissarro recolte-des-foins.jpg|thumb|left|''La Récolte des Foins, Eragny'' (1887)]]
In 1884 he met [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]], both of whom relied on a more “scientific” theory of painting by using very small patches of pure colors to create the illusion of blended colors and shading when viewed from a distance. Pissarro then spent the next four years, from 1885 to 1888, practicing this more time-consuming and laborious technique, referred to as [[pointillism]]. His work was distinctly different from his Impressionist works, and were on display in the 1886 Impressionist Exhibition, but under a separate section, along with works by Seurat, Signac, and his son [[Lucien Pissarro|Lucien]]. 

All four works were considered an “exception” to the eighth exhibition. Joachim Pissarro notes that virtually every reviewer who commented on Pissarro’s work noted “his extraordinary capacity to change his art, revise his position and take on new challenges.”&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|52}} One critic writes:

:”It is difficult to speak of Camille Pissarro . . . What we have here is a fighter from way back, a master who continually grows and courageously adapts to new theories.”&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|51}}

Pissarro explained the new art form as a “phase in the logical march of Impressionism”,&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;{{rp|49}} but he was alone among the other Impressionists with this attitude, however. Art historian Joachim Pissarro states that Pissarro thereby became the &quot;only artist who went from Impressionism to [[Neo-Impressionism]]&quot;. 

In 1884, art dealer [[Theo van Gogh]] asked Pissarro if he would take in his younger brother, [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent]], as a boarder in his home. According to Pissarro’s son Lucien, his father was impressed by Vincent’s work and had “foreseen the power of this artist”, who was 23 years younger. Although Vincent never boarded with him, Pissarro did explain to him the various ways of finding and expressing light and color, ideas which he later used in his paintings, notes Lucien.&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|43}}

===Abandoning Neo-Impressionism===
Pissarro eventually turned away from Neo-Impressionism, claiming its system was too artificial. He explains in a letter to a friend:

:”Having tried this theory for four years and having then abandoned it . . . I can no longer  consider myself one of the neo-impressionists. . . It was impossible to be true to my sensations and consequently to render life and movement, impossible to be faithful to the effects, so random and so admirable, of nature, impossible to give an individual character to my drawing, [that] I had to give up.”&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|41}}

However, after reverting back to his earlier style, his work became, according to Rewald, “more subtle, his color scheme more refined, his drawing firmer. . . So it was that Pissarro approached old age with an increased mastery.”&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|41}}

But the change also added to Pissarro’s continual financial hardship which he felt until his sixties. His “headstrong courage and a tenacity to undertake and sustain the career of an artist”, writes Joachim Pissarro, was due to his “lack of fear of the immediate repercussions” of his stylistic decisions. In addition, his work was strong enough to “bolster his morale and keep him going”, he writes.&lt;ref name=Joachim/&gt; His Impressionist contemporaries, however, continued to view his independence as a “mark of integrity”, and they turned to him for advice, referring to him as “Père Pissarro” (father Pissarro).&lt;ref name=Joachim/&gt;
[[Image:Camille Pissarro 008.jpg|thumb|''Boulevard Montmartre au printemps'', (1897) viewed from hotel window]]

==Later years==
In his older age Pissarro suffered form a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather. As a result of this disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms. He often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. He moved around northern France and painted from hotels in Rouen, Paris, Le Havre and Dieppe. On his visits to London, he would do the same.&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

Pissarro died in [[Paris]] on 13 November 1903 and was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy and influence==

According to Pissarro’s son, Lucien, his father painted regularly with [[Cézanne]] beginning in 1872. He recalls that Cézanne walked a few miles to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger Cézanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro’s eyes, as he admired Pissarro’s landscapes from the 1860s. Cézanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that “he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord.”&lt;ref name=Masters/&gt;

[[Lucien Pissarro]] was taught painting by his father, and described him as a “splendid teacher, never imposing his personality on his pupil.”  [[Gauguin]], who also studied under him, referred to Pissarro “as a force with which future artists would have to reckon”.&lt;ref name=Gallery/&gt;  He wrote a letter to a friend in 1902, shortly before Pissarro’s death:

:”If we observe the totality of Pissarro’s work, we find there, despite fluctuations, not only an extreme artistic will, never belied, but also an essentially intuitive, purebred art . . . He was one of my masters and I do not deny him.”&lt;ref name=Rewald/&gt;{{rp|45}}

The American impressionist [[Mary Cassatt]], who at one point lived in Paris to study art,  noted that he was “such a teacher that he could have taught the stones to draw correctly.”&lt;ref name= Masters/&gt;

===Paintings===
During his lifetime, Camille Pissarro sold few of his paintings. By 2005, however, some of his works were selling in the range of[[United States dollar|U.S. $]]2 to 4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/news/waltzer/waltzer5-9-00.asp|title =Artnet Auction Report|author= Waltzer, Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2011, it was disclosed that the government of Spain, at the request of the U.S. ambassador, agreed to help return a 1897 Pissarro painting, valued at as much as $20 million, to a California family that claims it &quot;was illegally taken by Nazis in Germany&quot; during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/us/07treasure.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss &quot;WikiLeaks Cables Make Appearance in a Tale of Sunken Treasure and Nazi Theft&quot;], ''New York Times'', January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In other legal cases, Pissarro's &quot;Le Quai Malaquais, Printemps,&quot; is said to have been similarly stolen, along with an estimated 650,000 other works of art, including those by French Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedartcommission.com/MO89VR49433 &quot;Nazi-Looted Pissarro in Zurich Bank Pits Heiress Against Dealer&quot;], Commission for Looted Art in Europe, June 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants and family==
Camille's granddaughter (Lucien Pissarro's daughter) [[Orovida Camille Pissarro|Orovida Pissarro]] became a painter. Camille's great-grandson, Joachim Pissarro, is former Head Curator of Drawing and Painting at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City and is now a professor in Hunter College's Art Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_11_91/ai_110963203|title=MOMA names two curators - Artworld - Ann Temkin and Joachim Pissarro - Brief Article|publisher=Art in America,  Nov, 2003}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-granddaughter, Lélia, is a painter and resides in London. From the only daughter of Camille, Jeanne Pissarro, other painters include Henri Bonin-Pissarro also known as BOPI (1918–2003) and [[Claude Bonin-Pissarro]] (born 1921), who is the father of Abstract artist Frédéric Bonin-Pissarro (born 1964).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''diagnostic tests in cardiology''' are methods of identifying [[heart]] conditions associated with healthy vs. unhealthy, [[pathology|pathologic]], [[heart]] function.

==Bedside==
===History===
Obtaining a [[medical history]] is always the first &quot;test&quot;, part of understanding the likelihood of significant disease, as detectable within the current limitations of clinical medicine. Yet heart problems often produce no symptoms until very advanced, and many symptoms, such as palpitations and sensations of extra or missing heart beats correlate poorly with relative heart health ''vs'' disease. Hence, a history alone is rarely sufficient to diagnose a heart condition.

===Auscultation===
''[[Auscultation]]'' employs a [[stethoscope]] to more easily hear various normal and abnormal sounds, such as normal heart beat sounds and the usual heart beat sound changes associated with breathing versus [[heart murmur]]s.

==Laboratory==
===Blood tests===
A variety of ''[[blood test]]s'' are available for analyzing [[cholesterol]] transport behavior, [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]], [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], [[triglyceride]]s, [[lipoprotein little a]], [[homocysteine]], [[C-reactive protein]], blood sugar control: fasting, after eating or averages using glycosylated albumen or hemoglobin, [[myoglobin]], [[creatine kinase]], [[troponin]], [[brain-type natriuretic peptide]], etc. to assess the evolution of [[coronary artery disease]] and evidence of existing damage. A great many more [[physiology|physiologic]] markers related to [[atherosclerosis]] and [[heart]] function are used and being developed and evaluated in [[research]].

==Electrophysiology==
===Electrocardiogram===
''[[Electrocardiography]]'' (ECG/EKG in German vernacular. Elektrokardiogram) monitors [[electricity|electrical]] activity of the [[heart]], primarily as recorded from the skin surface. A 12 lead recording, recording the electrical activity in three planes, anterior, posterior, and lateral is the most commonly used form. The ECG allows observation of the heart electrical activity by visualizing waveform beat origin (typically from the sinoatrial or SA node) following down the bundle of HIS and ultimately stimulating the ventricles to contract forcing blood through the body. Much can be learned by observing the QRS morphology (named for the respective portions of the polarization/repolarization waveform of the wave, P,Q,R,S,T wave). Rhythm abnormalities can also be visualized as in slow heart rate [[bradycardia]], or fast heart rate [[tachycardia]].

===Holter monitor===
A ''[[Holter monitor]]'' records a continuous EKG rhythm pattern (rarely a full EKG) for 24 hours or more. These monitors are used for suspected frequent rhythm abnormalities, especially ones the wearer may not recognize by symptoms. They are more expensive than event monitors.

===Event monitor===
An ''[[Event monitor]]'' records short term EKG rhythm patterns, generally storing the last 2 to 5 minutes, adding in new and discarding old data, for 1 to 2 weeks or more. There are several different types with different capabilities. When the wearer presses a button on the monitor, it quits discarding old and continues recording for a short additional period. The wearer then plays the recording, via a standard phone connection, to a center with compatible receiving and rhythm printing equipment, after which the monitor is ready to record again.  These monitors are used for suspected infrequent rhythm abnormalities, especially ones the wearer does recognize by symptoms.  They are less expensive than Holter monitors.

===Cardiac stress testing===
''[[Cardiac stress testing]]'' is used to determine to assess cardiac function and to disclose evidence of exertion-related cardiac [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. [[Radionuclide test]]ing using [[thallium]] or [[technetium]] can be used to demonstrate areas of perfusion abnormalities. With a maximal stress test the level of exercise is increased until the patient heart rate will not increase any higher, despite increased exercise. A fairly accurate estimate of the target heart rate, based on extensive clinical research, can be estimated by the formula 220 beats per minute minus patient's age. This linear relation is accurate up to about age 30, after which it mildly underestimates typical maximum attainable heart rates achievable by healthy individuals. Other formulas exist, such as that by Miller (217 - (0.85 × Age)) and others [http://www.brianmac.co.uk/maxhr.htm]. Achieving a high enough heart rate at the end of exercise is critical to improving the sensitivity of the test to detect high grade heart artery [[stenosis]].

===[[Electrophysiology study]]===
The [[electrophysiology study]] or EP study is the end all of electrophysiological tests of the heart.  It involves a catheter with electrodes probing the endocardium, the inside of the heart, and testing the conduction pathways and electrical activity of individual areas of the heart.

==Medical imaging==
===Coronary catheterization===
''[[Coronary catheterization]]'' uses [[pressure]] monitoring and blood sampling through a [[catheter]] inserted into the [[heart]] through blood vessels in the leg to determine the functioning of the [[heart]], and, following injections of [[radiocontrast dye]], uses [[X-ray fluoroscopy]], typically at 30 frames per second, to visualize the position and size of blood within the [[heart]] chambers and [[artery|arteries]]. [[Coronary angiography]] is used to determine the patency and configuration of the [[coronary artery]] [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]s.

===Echocardiogram===
''[[Transthoracic echocardiogram]]'' uses [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] waves for continuous [[heart]] chamber and blood movement visualization. In recent times, it has become one of the most commonly used tools in diagnosis of heart problems, as it allows non-invasive visualization of the heart and the blood flow through the heart, using a technique known as Doppler.

''[[Transoesophageal echocardiogram]]'' uses a specialized probe containing an ultrasound transducer at its tip is passed into the patient's esophagus.  It is used in diagnosis of various thoracic defects or damage, i.e. heart and lung imaging.  It has some advantages and disadvantages over thoracic or intravasular ultrasound.

===Intravascular ultrasound===
''[[Intravascular ultrasound]]'', also known as a percutaneous echocardiogram is an imaging methodology using specially designed, long, thin, complex manufactured [[catheter]]s attached to computerized [[ultrasound]] equipment to visualize the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and the interior wall of [[blood vessel]]s.

===Positron emission tomography===
''[[Positron emission tomography]]'', an imaging methodology for [[positron]] emitting [[radioisotopes]]. PET enables visual image analysis of multiple different metabolic chemical processes and is thus one of the most flexible imaging technologies. Cardiology uses are growing very slowly due to technical and relative cost difficulties. Most uses are for [[research]], not [[physical examination|clinical]] purposes. Appropriate [[radioisotopes]] of elements within chemical compounds of the [[metabolic]] pathway being examined are used to make the location of the chemical compounds of interest visible in a PET scanner constructed image.

===Computed tomography angiography===
[[Computed tomography|Computed tomography angiography]] (CTA), an imaging methodology using a ring-shaped machine with an [[X-Ray]] source spinning around the circular path so as to bathe the inner circle with a uniform and known X-Ray density. Cardiology uses are growing with the incredible developments in CT technology.  Currently, multidetector CT, specially the 64 detector-CT are allowing to make cardiac studies in just a few seconds (less than 10 seconds, depending on the equipment and protocol used).  These images are reconstructed using algorithms and software.  Great development and growth will be seen in the short term, allowing [[radiologists]] to diagnose cardiac artery disease without [[anesthesia]] and in a non-invasive way.

===Magnetic resonance imaging===
''[[Magnetic resonance imaging]]'' (originally called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), an imaging methodology based on aligning the spin axis of nuclei within [[molecule]]s of the object being visualized using both powerful [[superconducting magnet]]s and [[radio frequency]] [[Wiktionary:signal|signals]] and [[detector]]s. [[Cardiology]] uses are growing, especially since MRI differentiates [[soft tissue]]s better than [[Computed axial tomography|CT]] and allows for comprehensive exams including the quantitative assessment of size, morphology functino and tissue characteristics in one single session. Current implementations for [[Cardiology]] uses are sometimes limited by lengthy protocols, claustrophobia and contraindications based on some complex metallic implants (pacemakers, defibrillators, insulin pumps), while artificial valves and coronary stents are generally not problematic. Image quality can be reduced by the continuous movement of [[heart]] structures. There is a promising future in cardiac MRI by more efficient scans, increasing availability of scanners and more widespread knowledge about its clinical application.

'''Carlo Lorenzini''' (November 24, 1826 &amp;ndash; October 26, 1890), better known by the [[pen name]] '''Carlo Collodi''', was an  [[Italians|Italian]] [[children's writer]] known for the world-renowned [[fairy tale]] [[novel]], ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.

==Biography==
Collodi was born in [[Florence]].

During the [[Italian Independence wars|Wars of Independence]] in 1848 and 1860 Collodi served as a volunteer with the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] army. His active interest in political matters may be seen in his earliest literary works as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper ''Il Lampione''.  This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1849 but re-emerged in May 1860.

Lorenzini had won fame as early as 1856 with his novel ''In vapore'' and had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as ''Il Fanfulla''; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including ''[[Macchiette]]'' (1880), ''[[Occhi e nasi]]'' (1881), ''[[Storie allegre]]'' (1887).

In 1875, he entered the domain of children's literature with ''Racconti delle fate'', a translation of French fairy tales by [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]. In 1876 Lorenzini wrote ''[[Giannettino]]'' (inspired by [[Alessandro Luigi Parravicini]]'s ''Giannetto''), the ''[[Minuzzolo]]'', and ''Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino'', a series which explored the re-unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character [[Giannettino]].

Lorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through [[allegory]]. In 1880 he began writing ''Storia di un burattino'' (&quot;The story of a [[marionette]]&quot;), also called ''Le avventure di [[Pinocchio]]'', which was published weekly in ''[[Il Giornale dei Bambini]]'' (the first Italian newspaper for children).

Lorenzini died in Florence in 1890, unaware of the fame and popularity that awaited his work: as in the allegory of the story, Pinocchio eventually went on to lead his own independent life, distinct from that of the author.

Lorenzini is buried at [[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte|San Miniato al Monte Basilica]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{for|numbers &quot;constructible&quot; in the sense of [[set theory]]|Constructible universe}}
A [[point (geometry)|point]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] is a '''constructible point''' if, given a fixed [[coordinate system]] (or a fixed [[line segment]] of unit [[length]]), the point can be constructed with [[Compass and straightedge constructions|unruled straightedge and compass]]. A [[complex number]] is a '''constructible number''' if its corresponding point in the Euclidean plane is constructible from the usual ''x''- and ''y''-coordinate axes.

It can then be shown that a [[real number]] is constructible [[if and only if]], given a line segment of unit length, a line segment of length |''r'' | can be constructed with compass and straightedge.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Beachy, William D. Blair; ''Abstract Algebra''; [http://www.math.niu.edu/~beachy/abstract_algebra/study_guide/63.html Definition 6.3.1]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be shown that a complex number is constructible if and only if its [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary part]]s are constructible.

The set of constructible numbers can be completely [[characterization (mathematics)|characterized]] in the language of [[field (algebra)|field theory]]: the constructible numbers form the smallest [[field extension]] of the [[rational number]]s which is closed under [[square root]] and [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]]. This has the effect of transforming geometric questions about compass and straightedge constructions into [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. This transformation leads to the solutions of many famous mathematical problems, which defied centuries of attack.

== Geometric definitions ==

The geometric definition of a constructible point is as follows. First, for any two distinct points ''P'' and ''Q'' in the plane, let ''L''(''P'', ''Q'' ) denote the unique line through ''P'' and ''Q'', and let ''C'' (''P'', ''Q'' ) denote the unique circle with center ''P'', passing through ''Q''. (Note that the order of ''P'' and ''Q'' matters for the circle.) By convention, ''L''(''P'', ''P'' ) = ''C'' (''P'', ''P'' ) = {''P'' }. Then a point ''Z'' is ''constructible from E, F, G and H'' if either

#''Z'' is in the [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] of ''L''(''E'', ''F'' ) and ''L''(''G'', ''H'' ), where ''L''(''E'', ''F'' ) ≠ ''L''(''G'', ''H'' );
#''Z'' is in the intersection of ''C'' (''E'', ''F'' ) and ''C'' (''G'', ''H'' ), where ''C'' (''E'', ''F'' ) ≠ ''C'' (''G'', ''H'' );
#''Z'' is in the intersection of ''L''(''E'', ''F'' ) and ''C'' (''G'', ''H'' ).

Since the order of ''E'', ''F'', ''G'', and ''H'' in the above definition is irrelevant, the four letters may be [[permutation|permuted]] in any way. Put simply, ''Z'' is constructible from ''E'', ''F'', ''G'' and ''H'' if it lies in the intersection of any two distinct lines, or of any two distinct circles, or of a line and a circle, where these lines and/or circles can be determined by ''E'', ''F'', ''G'', and ''H'', in the above sense.

Now, let ''A'' and ''A''&amp;prime; be any two distinct fixed points in the plane. A point ''Z'' is ''constructible'' if either

#''Z'' = ''A'';
#''Z'' = ''A''&amp;prime;;
#there exist points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; , with ''Z'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; , such that for all ''j'' ≥ 1, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; is constructible from points in the set {''A'', ''A''&amp;prime;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; }.

Put simply, ''Z'' is constructible if it is either ''A'' or ''A''&amp;prime;, or if it is obtainable from a finite sequence of points starting with ''A'' and ''A''&amp;prime;, where each new point is constructible from previous points in the sequence.

For example, the center point of ''A'' and ''A''&amp;prime; is defined as follows. The circles ''C'' (''A'', ''A''&amp;prime;) and ''C'' (''A''&amp;prime;, ''A'') intersect in two distinct points; these points determine a unique line, and the center is defined to be the intersection of this line with ''L''(''A'', ''A''&amp;prime;).

== Transformation into algebra ==

All [[rational number]]s are constructible, and all constructible numbers are [[algebraic number]]s. Also, if ''a'' and ''b'' are constructible numbers with ''b'' ≠ 0, then {{nowrap|''a'' &amp;minus; ''b''}} and ''a''/''b'' are constructible. Thus, the set ''K'' of all constructible complex numbers forms a [[field (algebra)|field]], a subfield of the field of algebraic numbers.

Furthermore, ''K'' is closed under square roots and [[complex conjugation]]. These facts can be used to characterize the field of constructible numbers, because, in essence, the equations defining lines and circles are no worse than quadratic. The characterization is the following: a complex number is constructible [[if and only if]] it lies in a field at the top of a [[finite tower of fields|finite tower]] of [[quadratic extension]]s, starting with the rational field '''Q'''. More precisely, ''z'' is constructible if and only if there exists a [[tower of fields]]

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} = K_0 \subseteq K_1 \subseteq \dots \subseteq K_n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and for all 0 ≤ ''j'' &lt; ''n'', the dimension [''K''&lt;sub&gt;''j'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ] = 2.

== Impossible constructions ==

The algebraic characterization of constructible numbers provides an important ''necessary'' condition for constructibility: if ''z'' is constructible, then it is algebraic, and its minimal irreducible polynomial has degree a power of 2, or equivalently, the field extension '''Q'''(''z'')/'''Q''' has dimension a power of 2. One should note that it is true, (but not obvious to show) that the converse is false &amp;mdash; this is not a ''sufficient'' condition for constructibility. However, this defect can be remedied by considering the normal closure of '''Q'''(''z'')/'''Q'''.

The non-constructibility of certain numbers proves the impossibility of [[Compass and straightedge constructions|certain problems]] attempted by the philosophers of [[ancient Greece]]. In the following chart, each row represents a specific ancient construction problem. The left column gives the name of the problem. The second column gives an equivalent algebraic formulation of the problem. In other words, the solution to the problem is affirmative [[if and only if]] each number in the given set of numbers is constructible. Finally, the last column provides the simplest known [[counterexample]]. In other words, the number in the last column is an element of the set in the same row, but is not constructible.

==History==
[[Image:Abraham Curry.png|thumb|125px|left|Abraham Curry]]
[[Image:Carson City, 1877.jpg|thumb|260px|Illustration of Carson City in 1877.]]
The first European Americans to arrive in what is known as Eagle Valley were [[John C. Fremont]] and his exploration party in January 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/nevada/carson.htm|title=National Park Service: Three Historic Cities|publisher=Travel Nevada.com|accessdate=6=2-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fremont named the river flowing through the valley [[Carson River]] in honor of [[Kit Carson|Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Carson]], the [[mountain man]] and scout he had hired for his expedition.  Prior to the Fremont expedition, only [[Washoe Indians]] inhabited the valley and surrounding areas.  Settlers named the area Washoe in reference to the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayer|first=C.W.|title=Profits, plots &amp; lynching; the creation of Nevada Territory|year=1995|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|location=Carson, City NV|isbn=0962889032|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1851 the [[Eagle Station]] ranch located along the [[Carson River]] served as a trading post and stopover for travelers on the [[California Trail]]'s [[Carson Branch]] which ran through [[Eagle Valley (Nevada)|Eagle Valley]].  The valley and trading post received their name from a [[bald eagle]] that was hunted and killed by one of the early settlers and was featured on a wall inside the post.

As the area was part of the Utah Territory, it was governed from Salt Lake City, where the territorial government was headquartered.  Early settlers bristled at the control exterted by Mormon-influenced officials and desired the creation of the Nevada territory.  A vigilante group of influential settlers, headed by Abraham Curry, sought a site for a capital city for the envisioned territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oldham|first=Willa|title=Carson City: Nevada’s Capital City|year=1991|publisher=Nevada State Museum|location=Carson City, NV|isbn=B0006QSL8Q|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1858, [[Abraham Curry]] bought Eagle Station and thereafter renamed the settlement Carson City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcarsoncity.com/history/|title=Carson City Living History|author=Carson City website|accessdate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Curry and several other partners had Eagle Valley surveyed for development.  Curry had decided for himself that Carson City would someday serve as the capital city and left a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot open in the center of town for a future capitol building.

Following the discovery of gold and silver in 1859 on the nearby [[Comstock Lode]], Carson City's population began to rise.  Curry built the Warm Springs Hotel a mile to the east of  the center of town.  As predicted, Carson City was selected as the territorial capital, besting [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and American Flat.  Curry loaned the Warm Springs Hotel to the territorial Legislature as a meeting hall.  The Legislature named Carson City to be the seat of [[Ormsby County, Nevada|Ormsby County]] and selected the hotel as the territorial prison with Curry serving as its first warden.  Today the property still serves as part of the state prison.

When Nevada became a state in 1864 during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital.  Carson City's development was no longer dependent on the mining industry and instead became a thriving commercial center.  The [[Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad]] was built between Virginia City and Carson City.  A [[Log Flume|wooden flume]] was also built from the Sierra Nevadas into Carson City.  The current capitol building was constructed from 1870–71.  The [[United States Mint]] operated a [[Carson City Mint|branch mint]] in Carson City between the years 1870 and 1893, which struck gold and silver coins.

Carson City's population and transportation traffic decreased when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a line through [[Donner Pass]], too far to the north to benefit Carson City.  The city was slightly revitalized with the mining booms in [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]] and [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]].  The US federal building (now renamed the [[Paul Laxalt]] Building) was completed in 1890 as was the [[Stewart Indian School]].  Carson City resigned itself to small city status, advertising itself as &quot;America's smallest capital.&quot;

==20th-century revitalization and growth==
The city slowly grew; by 1960 it had reached its 1880, boom-time population.  Portions of Ormsby County had been given over to neighboring counties and by this time the county was not much larger than the city itself.  In 1969 Ormsby County was officially dissolved and Carson City took over all municipal services with an [[independent city]] status.  With this consolidation, Carson City absorbed former town sites such as Empire City, which had grown up in the 1860s as a milling center along the Carson River and current [[US 50 (NV)|US 50]]. Carson City could now advertise itself as one of America's largest state capitals with its {{convert|146|sqmi|km2}} of city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carson-city.nv.us/Index.aspx?page=140|title=Carson City: History|author=Carson City Government|accessdate=6-2-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the city adopted a downtown master plan, specifying that no building within 500 feet (152 m) of the capitol would surpass it in height.  This plan prohibited future high-rise development in the center of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=carsoncity-nv-usa|title=About Carson City|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Emporis|accessdate=6-2-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ormsby House]] is currently the tallest building in downtown Carson City, at a height of 117 feet.  The structure was completed in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=102264&amp;bt=2&amp;ht=2&amp;sro=0 Carson City High Rise Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
Carson City is governed via the mayor-council system. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote to a four year term. The city council is called the Board of Supervisors and has four members. Members are elected from single member wards. Nevada's capital is generally considered a Republican stronghold, often voting for Republicans by wide margins. In 2004, George Bush defeated John Kerry 57-40%. In 2008 however [[Barack Obama]] became the first Democrat since 1964 to win Carson City, defeating [[John McCain]] 49% to 48%, by 204 votes, a margin of under 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carson-city.nv.us/Index.aspx?page=95|title=Carson City Politics|page=95|publisher=www.carson-city.nv.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Carson City features a [[semiarid climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Bsk'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/North-America_Koppen_Map.png Updated North American Map of the Koppen climate classification system.]&lt;/ref&gt; with cool but not inordinately cold winters and hot summers. The city is situated in a high desert river valley approximately {{convert|4730|ft|m}} above sea level. There are four fairly distinct seasons, all of which are relatively mild compared to many parts of the country and to what one may expect given its elevation. Winters see typically light to moderate snowfall, with a median of {{convert|8.9|in|cm|0}}.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Most precipitation occurs in winter and spring, with summer and fall being fairly dry, drier than neighboring California. Mid-summer highs typically top out in the 90s, doing so 36 times per year,&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; but temperatures of {{convert|100|°F|°C}} and above do occur on occasion.

The Carson River flows from Douglas County through the southwestern edge of Carson City.

'''Clark Joseph Kent''' (middle name is also '''Jerome''' according to some versions)&lt;ref&gt;While ''Joseph'' is more commonly used, some sources claim that Clark Kent's middle name is in fact ''Jerome'' in honor of creator [[Jerry Siegel]]. The name ''Jerome'' was used in the &quot;Season's Greedings&quot; episode of the television series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]. Appearing regularly in stories published by [[DC Comics]], he debuted in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938) and serves as the [[civilian]] and [[secret identity]] of the [[superhero]] '''[[Superman]]'''.

Over the decades there has been considerable debate as to which personality the character identifies with most. From his first introduction in 1938 to the mid-1980s, &quot;Clark Kent&quot; was seen mostly as a disguise for Superman, enabling him to mix with ordinary people. This was the view in most comics and other media such as TV (starring [[George Reeves]]) and radio. In 1986, during [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s revamping of the character, the emphasis was on Superman being the manufactured persona of Clark Kent, the side of the character he most identifies with. Different takes persist in the present.

==Overview==
Through the popularity of his Superman [[alter ego]], the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become ingrained in popular culture as well, becoming synonymous with [[secret identity|secret identities]] and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the Toronto Star, that the name derived from 1930's cinematic leading men [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]], but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic [[Harold Lloyd]] and himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidschutz.tripod.com/superman3.html |title=When Superman Worked at The Star |publisher=Davidschutz.tripod.com |date=1992-04-26 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that his name alludes to two pulp characters: [[Doc Savage]], whose full name is Clark Savage Jr., and [[The Shadow]], whose alias in the pulps was Kent Allard (though in the radio serial it was Lamont Cranston).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  Another theory is that &quot;Kent&quot; was a combination of the real and pen names of Doc Savage's creator, Lester DENT, who wrote as KENNETH Robeson, because Superman's co-creator and first writer was an avid fan of the pulp genre.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Beginnings===
In the earliest Superman
comics, Clark Kent's primary purpose was to fulfill the perceived dramatic requirement that a costumed superhero cannot remain on full duty all the time.  Clark thus acted as little more than a front for Superman's activities. Although his name and history were taken from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' he receives late-breaking news before the general public, has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his story deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities, bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.batman-superman.com/superman/cmp/index.html | title=The New Batman/Superman Adventures | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a largely passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as &quot;mild-mannered,&quot; perhaps most famously by the opening narration of [[Max Fleischer]]'s [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|''Superman'' animated theatrical shorts]]. These traits extended into Clark's wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses (which in [[Pre-Crisis]] stories had lenses of Kryptonian material that would not be damaged when he fired his [[Energy blasts|heat vision]] through them), combed-back hair, and occasionally a [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]]. 

Fellow reporter [[Lois Lane]] became the object of Clark's/Superman's romantic affection. Lois' affection for Superman and her rejection of Clark's clumsy advances have been a recurring theme in Superman comics, television, and movies.

===Transitions===
Clark wears his Superman costume underneath his street clothes, allowing easy changes between the two [[persona]]e — and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar &quot;S&quot; emblem when called into action.  Superman usually stores his Clark Kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape, though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location (such as a [[telephone booth]]) for later retrieval.

In the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] comic book title ''[[Superman Family]],'' Clark is featured in a series of stories called &quot;The Private Life of Clark Kent,&quot; where he solves problems subtly without changing into Superman.

===Adoption===
Adopted by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]] from the [[Kansas]] town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], Clark (and thus Superman) was raised with the values of a typical rural American town, including attending the local [[Methodist Church]] (though it is debated by comic fans if Superman is a Methodist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Superman.html | title=The religion of Superman (Clark Kent / Kal-El) | work=Adherents.com | date=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most continuities state that the Kents had been unable to have biological children. In the traditional versions of his origin, after the Kents retrieved Clark from his rocket, they brought him to the Smallville [[Orphanage]] and returned a few days later to formally adopt the orphan, giving him as a first name Martha's maiden name, &quot;Clark.&quot; In [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 origin version ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]],'' instead of adopting him through an orphanage, the Kents passed Clark off as their own child after their farm was isolated for months by a series of snowstorms that took place shortly after they found his rocket, using their past medical history of various miscarriages to account for their reasons for keeping Martha's pregnancy secret.

===Silver Age===
In the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] comics continuity, Clark gained superpowers upon landing on Earth, and gradually learned to master them, adopting the superhero identity of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] at the age of eight. He subsequently developed Clark's timid demeanor as a means of ensuring that no one would suspect any connection between the two alter-egos.

===Modern Age retroactive continuity===
In the wake of [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s reboot of Superman continuity in ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', many traditional aspects of Clark Kent were dropped in favor of giving him a more aggressive and extroverted personality (although not as strong as Lois), including such aspects as making Clark a top [[American football|football]] player in high school, along with being a successful author and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning writer. Furthermore, Clark's motivations for his professional writing were deepened as both a love for the art which contributes at least as much social good as his Superman activities and as a matter of personal fulfillment in an intellectual field where his abilities give no unfair competition to his colleagues beyond typing extraordinarily fast. Following ''[[One Year Later]]'', Clark adopts some tricks to account for his absences, such as feigning illness or offering to call the police. These, as well as his slouching posture, are references to his earlier mild-mannered Pre-Crisis versions, but he still maintains a sense of authority and his assertive self. Feeling that Clark is the real person and that Clark is not afraid to be himself in his civilian identity, John Byrne has stated in interviews that he took inspiration for this portrayal from the [[George Reeves]] version of Superman.

Clark Kent's favorite movie is ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (in which [[Gregory Peck]] wears glasses not unlike Kent's).  According to the ''DC Comics Official Guide to Superman,'' Clark enjoys peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, football games, and the smell of Kansas in the springtime.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 2) #67, #81&lt;/ref&gt; His favorite baseball team is the Metropolis Monarchs and his favorite football team is the Metropolis Sharks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} As of ''[[One Year Later]]'', Clark is in his mid-thirties, stands at 6' 3&quot;, and weighs about 225 pounds. Unlike in the Silver Age, his powers developed over several years, only coming to their peak when he was an adult.

==In other media==
===''The Adventures of Superman'' radio series (1940-1951) ===
In the early ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|Adventures of Superman]]'' radio episodes, Kal-El landed on Earth as an adult. He saved a man and his son and they gave him the idea of living as a normal person. They gave him the name of Clark Kent, and he later got a job as a newspaper reporter under that name.  In that role he adopted a higher voice and a more introverted personality – clearly establishing that Kent is the secret identity and Superman is the true person.

Later episodes shifted to the usual origin story, in which Kal-El landed on Earth as a baby and was raised by the Kent family.

[[Bud Collyer|Clayton &quot;Bud&quot; Collyer]] voiced both Clark Kent and Superman, until [[Michael Fitzmaurice]] replaced him in the final episodes.

===Kirk Alyn film serials (1948-1950) ===
In the film serials ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948) and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950), [[Kirk Alyn]] portrays as a mild-mannered reporter who comes to Metropolis and secures a job at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', following the death of his foster parents.  While he quickly gains the respect of ''Planet'' editor Perry White, he is forced to contend with rival reporter Lois Lane, who often uses to trickery to prevent Clark from pursuing a lead (giving her the chance to scoop him).  Nevertheless, his journalistic skills are useful as he pursues stories on the crime boss known as the Spider Lady, and the criminal scientist [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] (who had yet to receive his first name, Lex).

===''Adventures of Superman'' TV series (1952-1958) ===
In the 1950s [[George Reeves]] series, Clark Kent is portrayed as a cerebral character who is the crime reporter for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and who as Kent uses his intelligence and powers of deduction to solve crimes (often before [[Inspector Henderson]] does) before catching the villain as Superman.  Examples include the episodes ''Mystery of the Broken Statues'', ''A Ghost for Scotland Yard'', ''The Man in the Lead Mask'', and ''The Golden Vulture''.  George Reeves' Kent/Superman is also established as a champion of justice for the oppressed in episodes like ''The Unknown People'' and ''The Birthday Letter''.  Although Kent is described in the show introduction as &quot;mild-mannered&quot;, he can be very assertive, often giving orders to people and taking authoritative command of situations, though, as in the Pre-Crisis Superman stories at that time, Clark is still considered the secret identity.  He gets people to trust his judgment very easily and has a good, often wisecracking, sense of humor. Reeves, who first appeared as the character in the 1951 film ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', was older than subsequent Superman actors.

===Christopher Reeve films (1978-1987) ===
In 1978, the [[Superman (film)|first]] of four Superman films was made in which Clark Kent and Superman were portrayed by [[Christopher Reeve]] (with teenage Kent played by [[Jeff East]] in the first film).  This was followed nearly two decades later by a fifth film called ''[[Superman Returns]]'' with [[Brandon Routh]] giving a performance very similar to Reeve's. In contrast to George Reeves' intellectual Clark Kent, Reeve's version is much more of an awkward fumbler and bungler, although Reeve is also an especially athletic, dashing and debonair Superman. Clark Kent's hair is always absolutely flat, while Superman's hair has a slight wave and is parted on the opposite side as Kent's. These films leave the impression that Clark Kent is really a ''secret'' identity that is used to enable Superman to serve humanity better, rather than just a role to help him assimilate into the human community.

A great deal of emphasis is placed on his origins on the planet Krypton with exotic crystalline sets designed by [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]], effectively giving Superman a third persona as Kal-El. The first film is in three sections: Kal-El's infancy on Krypton (shot in London on the 007 stage), Clark Kent's teen years in Smallville, and Kent/Superman's adult life in Metropolis (shot in New York City). In earlier sections of the film, Reeve's Kent interacts with both his earthly parents and the spirit of his Kryptonian father through a special crystal, in a way George Reeves never did. The film has a fair amount of quasi-Biblical imagery suggestive of Superman as a sort of Christ-figure sent by Jor-El &quot;to show humans the way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This is discussed by the producers in their DVD commentary to the original theatrical cut.&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Superman (film)#Themes]]). In ''Superman II'' Reeve's Superman has to sacrifice his powers (effectively becoming just Clark Kent) in order to have a love relationship with Lois Lane, a choice he eventually abrogates to protect the world.

The relationship between Superman and Kent came to actual physical blows in ''[[Superman III]]''. Superman is given a piece of manufactured [[Kryptonite]], but instead of weakening or killing him it drives him crazy, depressed, angry, and casually destructive, committing crimes which range from petty acts of vandalism to environmental disasters, like causing an [[oil spillage]] in order to bed a lusty woman by the name of Loreli in league with the villains. Driven [[alcoholic]], Superman, his outfit dirty and neglected, eventually goes to a [[Wrecking yard|car wrecking yard]] where Kent, in a proper business suit and glasses, suddenly emerges from within him. A fight ensues in which the &quot;evil&quot; Superman tries to dispose of the &quot;good&quot; Kent, but the latter fights back, &quot;kills&quot; the evil side to his nature and, reclaiming the Superman mantle, sets off to repair the damage and capture the villains.

The indirect &quot;Christianization&quot; of Superman in the Reeve films (admitted by film producer [[Pierre Spengler]] on the [[DVD]] commentaries) has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi [[Simcha Weinstein]]'s book ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey|Up, Up and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero]]'' says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a &quot;nebbish,&quot; saying, &quot;He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's [[Woody Allen]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/10036 | title=Super...

This same theme is pursued about '40s superheroes generally in ''Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero'' by [[Danny Fingeroth]].

===''Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'' (1993-1997) ===
Clark Kent's character is given one of its heaviest emphases in the 1990s series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. It is made very clear during the series, even discussed directly by the characters, that Clark Kent is who he really is, rather than his superheroic alter-ego. 

In ''Lois and Clark'', Kent ([[Dean Cain]]) is a stereotypical wide-eyed farm kid from Kansas with the charm, grace and humor of George Reeves, but without the awkward geekiness of Christopher Reeve. Emphasis is laid on the comic elements of his dual relationship with Lois Lane ([[Teri Hatcher]]). The ban on Christopher Reeve's Superman having a relationship with a mortal while retaining his superpowers is entirely absent in the world of ''Lois and Clark.'' In the final season, Clark Kent marries Lois Lane (a few years after her almost-marriage to his arch-enemy [[Lex Luthor]], whom she refused at the altar), finding love, happiness, and completeness in this relationship which does not jeopardize his Superman persona.

===''Smallville'' TV series (2001-2011) ===
{{See|Clark Kent (Smallville)}}
''[[Smallville]]'' was adapted to television in 2001, by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.  Clark Kent is played by [[Tom Welling]], with others portraying Clark as an infant.  Throughout the series, Clark never officially adopted a costume until around the eighth season, but prior to this was seen wearing Superman's traditional colors of red and blue, more often as the series progresses (more commonly a blue shirt underneath a red jacket, reflecting Superman's uniform and cape colors). He is going through a process of character formation, making many mistakes in his youth, over time forming better and better judgment, while always self-consciously aware of his status as an alien from another planet who is different from other people.  In season 8, he begins a fight against evil, hoping to be a source of inspiration and hope to others.  A modest amount of religious imagery is seen occasionally in the series, but to a lesser degree than in the Christopher Reeve series.

''[[Smallville]]'''s Kent is particularly inwardly conflicted as he attempts to live the life of a normal human being, while keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|year=2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=8–17|isbn=1840237955}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the series he has an intermittent relationship with Lana Lang, which is strained by his secret&lt;ref&gt;Episode in which the pair start and end their relationship: season two's &quot;Exodus&quot;, season three's &quot;Phoenix&quot;, season five's &quot;Arrival&quot; &amp; &quot;Hypnotic&quot;, season seven's &quot;Fierce&quot; &amp; &quot;Arctic&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as his self-perceived guilt over the fact that the meteor shower that killed Lana's parents and created most of the superhumans he fought in the show's first few years was caused by his rocket coming to Earth and dragging pieces of Krypton with it. Clark's powers appear over time.  He is not aware of all of his powers at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and [[Clark's powers in Smallville|super breath]] do not develop until seasons [[Smallville (season 2)|two]] and [[Smallville (season 6)|six]], respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Heat|series=Smallville|credits=Mark Verheiden (writer) &amp; James Marshall (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2002-10-01|season=2|number=2|minutes=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sneeze|series=Smallville|credits=Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer (writers) &amp; Paul Shapiro (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2006-10-06|season=6|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his power of flight has yet to fully emerge, appearing only in a few rare cases, such as when he was temporarily 're-programmed' to assume a Kryptonian persona or when he was trapped in a virtual reality.
 
In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title=Pilot | series=Smallville | credits=[[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]] (writers); [[David Nutter]] (director) | network=The WB | airdate=October 16, 2001 | season=1 | number=1 | minutes=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Boyhood friendship with Lex Luthor had been the basis of a ''[[Superboy]]'' adventure published in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;''Adventure Comics'' #271 (April 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; and was retained as Silver Age canon until 1986.)

In ''[[Smallville]]'', Clark and Lex remain entangled for most of the series. Lex Luthor's father, Lionel Luthor, is an unscrupulous industrialist with whom Lex has a troubled relationship.  Lex would like to transcend his family background and be a better person than his father, but after multiple setbacks he slowly slips into evil, becoming convinced that only he can 'protect' the world from the perceived alien threats by taking control of it, regardless of the cost to others. In turn, Clark Kent has a slightly dark side with which he comes to grips over time, made even worse by his experiences with red kryptonite, which causes him to lose his morals and act solely on impulse while under its influence.  In different ways to Luthor, Clark also does not have fully ideal relationship either with his adoptive father, Jonathan, nor with an A.I. based on Jor-El that was sent by the original to guide him, Jonathan occasionally having trouble relating to Clark while Jor-El's lack of his template's emotions causes him to treat Clark too harshly at times.  The younger Luthor slightly envies Clark's 'clean-cut' and wholesome parents (who disapprove of Clark's friendship with Luthor), while Clark is impressed with Luthor's wealth.  Even in his better days, Luthor is highly ambitious for power and wealth, at one time noting that he shares his name with [[Alexander the Great]]. Clark Kent, on the other hand, has no idea what he is going to do with his life while bewildered by his powers, and his uncertainty as to why he was sent to Earth.

In Season 8 of ''Smallville'', Clark Kent begins a career as an anonymous superhero crimefighter, but issues are raised by his closest friend [[Chloe Sullivan]] (a cousin of [[Lois Lane]] invented for this series) as to whether his methods of catching criminals are ethical. In Season 9, Clark begins to formalize his dual identity and has introduced the well-known glasses. Additionally, during the opening scene of the season nine finale, Clark dreams of 2013, by which time he has embraced his identity as Superman, and, upon waking up, finds a package from his mother containing his Superman suit. He fully adopts the Superman identity at the Season Ten finale when he takes action to save Earth from the influence of [[Darkseid]], who was drawn to Earth by Clark's actions and sought to take the hero as a host.

''Smallville''{{'}}s Kent has also appeared in various literature (including comics and over a dozen [[young adult novels]]) based on the television series, none of which directly continue from or into the television episodes.

===Animated series===
In the 1940s Superman shorts, Clark is shown to have a wisecraking sense of humor and he and Lois are good friends. At the near end of each short, Clark gives out a smile and a wink to the audience (that was carried over the 1966 Superman animated series).

In the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' of the late 1990s, Kent is based on John Byrne's version of him, becoming more assertive and intelligent. He is also considered to be the real person, with Superman the &quot;alter ego&quot;, though Kent often appears less in most episodes.

==Secret identity security==
[[File:Lois Lane No 93.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A classic Silver Age &quot;gag&quot; cover based on the Clark Kent/Superman duality.]]
Various reasons over the decades have been offered for why people have never suspected Superman and Clark Kent of being one and the same. The most common offered is simply that, despite their physical resemblance, Superman and Clark are perceived as too different in mannerisms and personality to be the same individual. In the 1970s, one suggestion was that the lenses of Clark Kent's glasses (made of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] materials) constantly amplified a low-level super-[[hypnosis]] power, thereby creating the illusion of others viewing Clark Kent as a weak and frailer being.&lt;ref name=&quot;superman 330&quot;&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 1) #330 (December 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this reason was abandoned almost as quickly as it was introduced, since it had various flaws (such as stories where [[Batman]] would disguise himself as Clark Kent, among others).

Another reason given in the 1987 story &quot;The Secret Revealed&quot; was the public simply does not know that Superman has a secret identity, considering he does not wear a [[mask]], which implies to most that he has nothing to hide. As an added precaution, Superman would vibrate his face (like [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick, the Golden-Age Flash]]), slightly so that photographs would only show his features as a blur, thus preventing the danger of photographs of both identities being reliably compared.&lt;ref name=&quot;superman v2n2&quot;&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 2) #2 (February 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, more recent stories showing Superman being photographed have tended to ignore this factor. The 2004 series ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' also explained that Superman's eyes are an inhumanly vivid shade of blue. Clark's glasses diffuse the color and make his eyes appear more human in that identity.

It is also stated by [[Barry Allen]] that &quot;Clark slouches, wears clothes two sizes too big and raises his voice an octave&quot; as part of the disguise, making him seem shorter and overweight instead of muscular.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' #44 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed, with very similar words, in the [[One Year Later]] reload of the Superman mythology, ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'', in which Lois Lane upon meeting Clark Kent for the first time notices his slouch and his apparent bad taste in clothing, attributing them to a general desire to be underestimated.&lt;ref name=SSO3&gt;''Superman: Secret Origin'' #3 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Lois Lane (and sometimes others) would often suspect Superman of truly being Clark Kent, though more recent comics often feature the general public assuming that Superman has no secret identity. In &quot;The Secret Revealed,&quot; a super-computer constructed by [[Lex Luthor]] calculated Superman's true identity, but Lex dismissed the idea because he could not believe that someone so powerful would want another, weaker identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;superman v2n2&quot;/&gt;  In modern comic continuity as of 2006, Lois Lane, feeling that someone like Clark could not be Superman, never suspected the dual identity beyond one isolated incident, before Clark finally revealed it to her. In &quot;Visitor,&quot; Lois finds Superman at the Kent [[farm]] with [[Lana Lang]] and asks him point-blank if he is Clark Kent. Before he can answer, the Kents tell her that they raised Superman alongside Clark like a brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Action 597&quot;&gt;''Action Comics'' #597 (February 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 [[retcon]] of the mythos, Lois Lane is fully aware from the beginning, along with [[Perry White]], that the meek, pudgy and bumbling Clark Kent deliberately holds himself back: however, still far from associating him to Superman, they simply believe he's hiding his qualities as a good reporter.&lt;ref name=SSO3 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Clarksupescompare.jpg|thumb|200px|Christopher Reeve's technique in making the disguise credible.]] --&gt;
Some fans have noted that in order for the disguise to be credible, Clark has to be at least as skilled an actor as [[Christopher Reeve]]. The films have Clark Kent being massively clumsy, paranoid and of course mild mannered. The actor's portrayal of Clark in the [[Superman film series]] was praised for making the disguise's effectiveness credible to audiences. In his book ''[[Still Me]],'' Reeve says he based Clark Kent on [[Cary Grant]]'s nerdy character in ''[[Bringing up Baby]]''.  

In the commentary track for ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', [[Tom Mankiewicz]] spoke about describing the dual role to Reeve as that he was always playing Superman but when he was Clark, he was playing Superman who was playing Clark Kent.  

According to the 2004 limited series ''[[Superman: Birthright]],'' which retells Superman's origin, young Clark Kent studies the [[Meisner technique]] so that he can seamlessly move between his Clark and Superman personas. As Clark, he drops his head, lowers his shoulders, bends his back forward a little bit and talks in a lighter tone, while as Superman, he stands straight and talks in a deeper tone. In [[Superman Returns|the 2006 feature film]], [[Brandon Routh]]'s performance echoed Reeve's.

Actor George Reeves, in the 1950s live-action television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]],'' brought a naturalistic approach to the dual role, perhaps reasoning that if Clark were too much of a [[Caspar Milquetoast|milquetoast]], he would not do well in the tough world of investigative journalism, particularly with an aggressive editor like [[Perry White]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Reeves played Clark as moderately assertive, often taking charge in dangerous or risky situations and unafraid to take reasonable risks. This fact was one the main inspirations for the 1980s reboot of the Clark Kent half of the Superman character as described by writer and artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] in the article &quot;Super-Discussions&quot; published by [[Attic Books]] in ''Comics Values Monthly'' Special #2 (1992).

Actor [[Dean Cain]]'s approach in the 1990s series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' was to have Clark as a normal, shy, everyday guy demonstrating occasional touches of clumsiness (e.g., pretending to burn his mouth on coffee), but still a highly skilled journalist, much like the current post-''Crisis'' portrayal. His Superman, by contrast, was very much the model of the classic hero who stood up straight and spoke in a more formal and authoritative voice. In the episode &quot;Tempus Fugitive,&quot; the time-traveler [[Tempus (Lois and Clark)|Tempus]] mocks Lois, saying that future historians laugh at her for being fooled by a pair of glasses. On the other hand, [[H.G. Wells]] tells Lois that in truth the people of the future simply considered Lois to be blinded by love, and that this has made her story a compelling one throughout the intervening years.&lt;ref name = &quot;tempus&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Tempus Fugitive|series=[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]] |credits=Lee Hutson, Jack Weinstein (writers) &amp; James R. Bagdonas (director)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=1995-03-26|season=2|number=18|minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge of the secret identity===
Superman's secret identity as Clark Kent is one of the [[DC Universe]]'s greatest secrets. Beyond Lois Lane, only a few, trusted people are aware of it. Examples include [[Batman]] and other members of the [[Justice League]], Superman's cousin [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and Clark's childhood friend [[Lana Lang]] (In pre-Crisis stories, Lana did not know but their friend [[Pete Ross]] did, unbeknownst to anyone -- including Clark). Lex Luthor, other supervillains, and various civilians have learned the secret identity several times. Their knowledge has usually been removed through various means; boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] is one of the very few to [[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali|deduce the identity and retain the knowledge]].

In the future of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], his secret identity is historical fact, with exhibits at a Superman Museum depicting the hero and his friends and family's adventures.

==Identity change as a plot device and stylistic choice==
When crises arise, Clark quickly changes into Superman.  Originally during his appearances in ''[[Action Comics]]'' and later in his own magazine, the Man of Steel would strip to his costume and stand revealed as Superman, often with the transformation having already been completed.  But within a short time, Joe Shuster and his ghost artists began depicting Clark Kent ripping open his shirt to reveal the &quot;S&quot; insignia on his chest &amp;mdash; an image which became so iconic that other superheroes, during the Golden Age and later periods, would copy the same type of change during transformations (only [[Spider-Man]], through his appearances in comics and [[Sam Raimi]]'s films, has come remotely close to matching Superman in being connected with the famed shirt-rip shot). 

In the Fleischer animated series of theatrical cartoons released by Paramount, the mild-mannered reporter often ducked into a telephone booth or stock room to make the transformation.  Since the shorts were produced during the rise of [[film noir]] in cinema, the change was usually represented as a stylized sequence: Clark Kent's silhouette is clearly seen behind a closed door's pebble glass window (or a shadow thrown across a wall) as he strips to his Superman costume.  Then, the superhero emerges having transformed from his meek disguise to his true self. In the comic books and in the George Reeves television series, he favors the ''Daily Planet''{{'}}s store room for his changes of identities. (The heroic change between identities within the store room is almost always seen in the comics, but never viewed in the Reeves series.) 

The [[CBS]] Saturday morning series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'' produced by Filmation Studios &amp;mdash; as well as ''[[The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' from the same animation house &amp;mdash; featured the iconic &quot;shirt rip&quot; to reveal the &quot;S&quot; or Clark Kent removing his unbuttoned white dress shirt in a secluded spot, usually thanks to stock animation which was re-used over dozens of episodes, to reveal his costume underneath while uttering his famed line &quot;This is a job ''for '''Superman!'''&quot;

As a dramatic plot device, Clark often has to quickly improvise in order to find a way to change unnoticed.  For example, in ''Superman'' (1978), Clark, unable to use a newer, open-kiosk pay phone (and getting a nice laugh from the theater audience), runs down the street and rips open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath.  He quickly enters a revolving door, spinning through it at incredible speed while changing clothes. Thus made invisible, he appears to have entered the building as Clark Kent and exited seconds later as Superman. Later in the film, when the need to change is more urgent (as he believes the city is about to be poisoned by Lex Luthor), he simply jumps out a window of the Daily Planet offices, changing at super-speed as he falls (the film merely shows the falling Kent blurring into a falling Superman), and flies off. Further films in the series continued this tradition, with Clark blurring into Superman, changing at super-speed while he runs.

In ''Lois &amp; Clark,'' Clark's usual method of changing was to either &quot;suddenly&quot; remember something urgent that required his immediate attention or leave the room/area under the pretense of contacting a source, summoning the police, heading to a breaking story's location, etc. The change would then frequently occur off-screen, although the shirt-rip reveal was a prominently used move well-associated with the show. Clark also developed a method of rapidly spinning into his costume at super speed which became a trademark change, especially during the third and fourth seasons of the series, and extremely popular with the show's fans. 

In one scene of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Clark becomes aware of an emergency while talking with [[Bruce Wayne]], and in the next [[panel (comics)|panel]] he has flown out of his Kent clothing and glasses so quickly that they have had no time to fall.

In Season 8 of ''Smallville,'' Clark begins to show a bit more of his double identity. He starts slowing down his superspeed enough for surveillance cameras to see his iconic red and blue streak. This reveals to the citizens of Metropolis that a superhero is among them, and the name &quot;The Red-Blue Blur&quot; is coined.  When Jimmy Olsen becomes suspicious, Clark decides to reserve his usual red-and-blue for saving people. He carries a backpack with him to work every day, containing his change of clothes. He begins to practice his speed change at home and at the ''Daily Planet.'' He changes in a superspeed spin in the ''Daily Planet''{{'}}s phone booth, and once even in his office chair.

==Debate over true identity==
A relatively recent debate is which of the two identities (Superman or Clark Kent) is the real person and which is the facade, mainly by the climactic scene in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill Vol. 2]]'' when Bill ([[David Carradine]]), citing [[Jules Feiffer]]'s ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', tells [[Beatrix Kiddo|The Bride]] ([[Uma Thurman]]) that Superman is the real identity of Superman, while Clark Kent is a facade based on mankind's less impressive traits.  Pre-Crisis interpretations of Superman very much assumed that Clark Kent was the &quot;mask&quot; and Kal-El the person (in the classic story ''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'', when Superman's dual life is revealed, he completely abandons his Clark Kent persona).  With John Byrne's more assertive revamp of Clark Kent as well as Superman's greater grounding in Earth culture and humanity (as opposed to the everpresent Kryptonian heritage of the Pre-''Crisis'' version), Superman is considered the &quot;mask&quot; and Clark the person.  This is made explicit by Clark himself in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #53, when following his revelation to Lois of his role as Superman (''Action Comics'' #662), he states: &quot;I'm Clark, the man you love.  Superman is the creation &amp;ndash; you named me, Lois.&quot;  In pre-Crisis continuity, Kal-El was already a toddler before leaving Krypton, and retained memories of that childhood that later resurfaced; in Post-''Crisis'' continuity, he was sent to Earth pre-natally in a &quot;birthing matrix&quot; (more recently [[retcon]]ned as an infant) and raised entirely by the Kents.  As a result of their rearing, Kal-El has grown to think of himself as Clark Kent, and in fact was completely unaware of his alien heritage until he was well into adulthood.  Although the morals instilled in him by the Kents have motivated Kal-El to use his abilities to help others, he developed the Superman persona to protect his Clark Kent identity.  Thus he is Clark Kent, who some think of as Kal-El, wearing a Superman &quot;mask&quot;.

Many fans and Superman scholars believe there to actually be three interpretations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  There is firstly who Clark is when he is around trusted friends and family, particularly while on the farm with Martha, or in moments alone with Lois.  He is a regular guy, brave, and moral.  He then wears two other masks: that of the heroic Superman, and that of the bumbling and goofy Clark Kent who works at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.  It should be noted that &quot;bumbling&quot; Clark is an act, but some fans dislike the portrayal of Clark as bumbling and goofy, as they feel it marginalizes his importance to the character.  This idea has appeared in comics and various adaptations.  In a pre-''Crisis'' story by [[Alan Moore]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #85, a sick Kal-El has [[hallucination]]s of both the Superman costume and Clark's suit, both offering advice from different viewpoints, and insists that neither of them are real.  Rather the reverse relationship exists between [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Batman]], in whose case Bruce Wayne is the fiction and Batman is the reality.

A more academic approach developed by [[Jules Feiffer]] in his series of articles published in ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'' is that Superman is the real identity of Superman. Feiffer states that while most comic book characters were born as their alter egos ([[Spider-Man]] was &quot;Peter Parker&quot; first, [[Batman]] was born &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot;), Kal-El uses the very blanket he was wrapped in for his trip to Earth as his &quot;costume&quot;, which means that Clark Kent is truly the manufactured identity used in order to blend in with humanity, and most importantly, a device to pursue Lois Lane's affections.  A good example of this view is an adventure published in the 1960s when Kent finds himself at a loose end when staff at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' go on strike and seriously considers it a chance to try out a new identity in case he has &quot;to abandon [his] Clark Kent role permanently&quot;.  His options include becoming a full-time policeman or even a mere tramp &quot;whom no one would ever suspect of being the Man of Steel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Illustration included in the ''Penguin Book of Comics'' by George Perry and Alan Aldridge, published in 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other concepts have become the current accepted canon in most modern versions of the Superman myth (for example, in the [[DC animated universe]] Superman cartoon episode &quot;The Late Mr. Kent&quot;, wherein Clark Kent is presumed dead, Superman expresses frustration at the idea of not being Clark and having to be someone else instead, because, in his words: &quot;I ''am'' Clark Kent.  I need to be Clark.  I'd go crazy if I'd have to be Superman all the time.&quot;  In a previous episode, actually the third part of the &quot;Last Son of Krypton&quot; arc, Jonathan &quot;Pa&quot; Kent assures his adoptive son that he will &quot;always be Clark Kent&quot; and that &quot;Superman just helps out every now and then.&quot;)

It has also been implied, especially in the 'alternate future' story ''Kingdom Come'', that the Clark Kent persona is symbolic of the values taught to him by his wholesome, Midwestern parents, the values he holds most dear: his instinctive knowledge of right and wrong that allows him to adopt his Superman persona, without being consumed by the moral implications of his actions; Superman is the means through which he can bring this example to the world.  At the very end of the novel, where Superman stands posed to destroy the United Nations, Norman McCay makes him realise that, when, fifteen years ago, after the murder of Lois Lane by The Joker,he abandoned Clark Kent and retreated into his Superman self, he lost this instinctive morality, and thus loss the ability to be the hero Superman. With this knowledge, and a pair of glasses given to him as a gift by Wonder Woman, 'Clark' regains his humanity, and sets out to become a hero again by re-fertilizing the irradiated fields of Kansas.

If we take this example as a serious insight into the identity of Clark Kent/Superman, then it is perfectly feasible to say that neither Superman nor Clark Kent is the 'true' man, and that they are an almost perfect equilibrium of the grounded, moral Clark Kent and the almost godlike Kal-El/Superman. In fact, many of the most potent and emotive storylines to come from the Man of Steel's history are those where he abandons one side or the other, with huge ramifications. Examples include the Superman of Earth-Two, who retired and allowed his world to slip partially back into its old ways with a floundering Justice Society trying to hold the delicate peace together; Kingdom Come, where he abandons his Clark Kent identity and loses his human touch; 'Clark Kent No More' through to 'Shattered Illusions' in which he abandons Clark Kent, becomes Superman 24/7, but gradually goes insane and attempts to become 'King of the world' with an army of androids; and many others besides.

Both [[Richard Donner]], director of the first Reeve movie and [[Bryan Singer]], director of the Brandon Routh followup, have stated that Clark Kent is intended to be the disguise.  However, while the Donner films tend to imply that Superman is the actual persona, Singer stated at the 2006 [[Comic-Con]] that he favored the three-persona concept, stating that there was Clark Kent on the farm, the bumbling Metropolis Clark and Superman, the Last Son of Krypton.  Brandon Routh himself even stated, in an ''[[HBO First Look]]'' interview that he was playing three characters; Clark Kent, the reporter/farm boy, Superman, the protagonist and savior of Metropolis and Kal-El, the Last Son of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].

In ''Lois &amp; Clark'', Lois discovers his identity and angrily states that &quot;you are Superman&quot;, but Clark famously says, &quot;No, Lois.  ''Superman'' is what I can do.  ''Clark'' is who I am.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;tempus&quot;/&gt;  They are eventually married. In the season two episode &quot;That Old Gang of Mine&quot;, Clark is shot and must pretend to have died or his secret will be revealed. While speaking with his parents after the shooting, he expresses his desire to be Clark Kent rather than Superman because his relationships with Jimmy, Perry and Lois are very different with Clark than how they treat him as Superman. This episode happened several years before the animated episode &quot;The Late Mr. Kent&quot;.

In the ''Smallville'' episode &quot;Masquerade&quot;, Clark tells Lois that Clark Kent is just a name, just two words, and that the Blur is who he really is.

Clark Kent has also been depicted without the Superman alter ego.  In the [[Elseworlds]] stories starting with ''[[Superman: Last Son of Earth]]'', he is the son of Jonathan Kent, who saves his son from the destruction of the Earth.  Clark ends up on Krypton, where he is adopted by Jor-El and becomes the planet's [[Green Lantern]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''classification of the finite simple groups''' is a theorem stating that every [[List of finite simple groups|finite simple group]] belongs to one of four categories described below. These [[group (mathematics)|groups]] can be seen as the basic building blocks of all [[finite group]]s, in much the same way as the [[prime number]]s are the basic building blocks of the [[natural number]]s. The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] is a more precise way of stating this fact about finite groups.

The proof of the theorem consists of tens of thousands of pages in several hundred journal articles written by about 100 authors, published mostly between 1955 and 2004.  [[Daniel Gorenstein|Gorenstein]], Lyons, and Solomon are gradually publishing a simplified and revised version of the proof.

==Statement of the  classification theorem==
{{Main|List of finite simple groups}}
'''Theorem'''. Every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of the following groups:

* A [[cyclic group]] with [[prime number|prime]] order;
* An [[alternating group]] of degree at least 5;
* A [[Group of Lie type|simple group of Lie type]], including both
** the [[classical group|classical Lie groups]], namely the groups of [[projective special linear group|projective special linear]],  [[unitary group|unitary]], [[symplectic group|symplectic]], or [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] transformations over a [[finite field]];
** the [[Group of Lie type#Chevalley groups|exceptional]] and [[Group of Lie type#Steinberg groups|twisted]] groups of Lie type (including the [[Tits group]] which is not strictly a [[group of Lie type]]).
* The 26 [[sporadic group|sporadic simple group]]s.

The classification theorem has  applications in many branches of mathematics, as questions about the structure of [[finite group]]s (and their action on other mathematical objects) can sometimes be reduced to questions about finite simple groups. Thanks to the classification theorem, such questions can sometimes be answered by checking each family of simple groups and each sporadic group.

[[Daniel Gorenstein]] announced in 1983 that the finite simple groups had all been classified, but this was premature as he had been misinformed about the proof of  the classification of [[quasithin group]]s. The completed proof of the classification was announced by {{harvtxt|Aschbacher|2004}} after Aschbacher and Smith published a 1221 page proof for the missing quasithin case.

==Overview of the proof of the classification theorem==

{{harvs|txt|last=Gorenstein|year1=1982|year2=1983}} wrote two volumes outlining the low rank and odd characteristic part of the proof, and {{harvs|txt| | last1=Aschbacher | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Aschbacher | last2=Lyons | first2=Richard | last3=Smith | first3=Stephen D. | last4=Solomon | first4=Ronald | title=The Classification of Finite Simple Groups: Groups of Characteristic 2 Type | url=http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&amp;ikey=SURV-172 | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | isbn=978-0-8218-5336-8 | year=2011 | volume=172}}
wrote a 3rd volume covering the remaining characteristic 2 case. The proof can be broken up into several major pieces as follows:

===Groups of small 2-rank===

The simple groups of low [[rank of a group#Generalizations_and_related_notions|2-rank]] are mostly groups of Lie type of small rank over fields of odd characteristic, together with five alternating and seven characteristic 2 type and nine sporadic groups.

The simple groups of small 2-rank include:
*Groups of 2-rank 0, in other words groups of odd order, which are all solvable by the [[Feit-Thompson theorem]].
*Groups of 2-rank 1. The Sylow 2-subgroups are either cyclic, which is easy to handle using the transfer map, or generalized quaternion, which are handled with the [[Brauer-Suzuki theorem]]: in particular there are no simple groups of 2-rank 1.
*Groups of 2-rank  2. Alperin showed that the Sylow subgoup must be dihedral, quasidihedral, wreathed, or a Sylow 2-subgroup of ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4). The first case was done by the [[Gorenstein–Walter theorem]] which showed that the only simple groups are isomorphic to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') for ''q'' odd or ''A''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, the second and third cases were done by the [[Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem]] which implies that the only simple groups are isomorphic to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') or ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') for ''q'' odd or ''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, and the last case was done by Lyons who showed that ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4) is the only simple possibility.
*Groups of sectional 2-rank at most 4, classified by Gorenstein and Harada.
The classification of groups of small 2-rank, especially ranks at most 2, makes heavy use of ordinary and modular character theory, which is almost never directly used elsewhere in the classification.

All groups not of small 2 rank can be split into two major classes: groups of component type and groups of characteristic 2 type. This is because if a group has sectional 2-rank at least 5 then MacWilliams showed that its Sylow 2-subgroups are connected, and the [[balance theorem]] implies that any simple group with connected Sylow 2-subgroups is either of component type or characteristic 2 type. (For groups of low 2-rank the proof of this breaks down, because theorems such as the [[signalizer functor]] theorem only work for groups with elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 3.)

===Groups of component type===

A group is said to be of component type if for some centralizer ''C'' of an involution, ''C''/''O''(''C'') has a component (where ''O''(''C'') is the core of ''C'', the maximal normal subgroup of odd order).
These are more or less the groups of Lie type of odd characteristic of large rank, and alternating groups, together with some sporadic groups.
A major step in this case is to eliminate the obstruction of the core of an involution. This is accomplished by the [[B-theorem]], which states that every component of ''C''/''O''(''C'') is the image of a component of ''C''.

The idea is that these groups have a centralizer of an involution with a component that is a smaller quasisimple group, which can be assumed to be already known by induction. So to classify these groups one takes every central extension of every known finite simple group, and finds all simple groups with a centralizer of involution with this as a component. This gives a rather large number of different cases to check: there are not only 26 sporadic groups and 16 families of groups of Lie type and the alternating groups, but also many of the groups of small rank or over small fields behave differently from the general case and have to be treated separately, and the groups of Lie type of even and odd characteristic are also quite different.

===Groups of  characteristic 2 type ===

A group is of characteristic 2 type if the [[generalized Fitting subgroup]] ''F''*(''Y'') of every 2-local subgroup ''Y'' is a 2-group.
As the name suggests these are roughly the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2, plus a handful of others that are alternating or sporadic or of odd characteristic. Their classification is divided into the small and large rank cases, where the rank is  the largest rank of an odd abelian subgroup normalizing a nontrivial 2-subgroup, which is often (but not always) the same as the rank of a Cartan subalgebra when the group is a group of Lie type in characteristic 2.

The rank 1 groups are the [[thin group]]s, classified by Aschbacher, and the rank 2 ones are the notorious [[quasithin group]]s, classified by Aschbacher and Smith. These correspond roughly to groups of Lie type of ranks 1 or 2 over fields of characteristic 2.

Groups of rank at least 3 are further subdivided into 3 classes by the [[trichotomy theorem]],  proved by Aschbacher for rank 3 and by Gorenstein and Lyons for rank at least 4.
The three classes are groups of GF(2) type (classified mainly by Timmesfeld), groups of &quot;standard type&quot; for some odd prime (classified by the Gilman-Griess theorem and work by several others), and groups of uniqueness type, where  a result of Aschbacher implies that there are no simple groups.
The general higher rank case consists  mostly of the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2 of rank at least 3 or 4.

===Existence and uniqueness of the simple groups===

The main part of the classification produces a characterization of each simple group. It is then necessary to check that there exists a  simple group for each characterization and that it is unique. This gives a large number of separate problems; for example, the original proofs of existence and uniqueness of the monster totaled about 200 pages, and the identification of the [[Ree groups]] by Thompson and Bombieri was one of the hardest parts of the classification. Many of the existence proofs and some of the uniqueness proofs for the sporadic proofs originally used computer calculations, some of which have since been replaced by shorter hand proofs.

==History of the proof==
===Gorenstein's program===

In 1972 {{harvtxt|Gorenstein|1979|loc=Appendix}} announced a program for completing the classification of finite simple groups, consisting of the following 16 steps:
#Groups of low 2-rank. This was essentially done by Gorenstein and Harada, who classified the groups with sectional 2-rank at most 4. Most of the cases of 2-rank at most 2 had been done by the time Gorenstein announced his program.
#The semisimplicity of 2-layers. The problem is to prove that the 2-layer of the centralizer of an involution in a simple group is semisimple.
#Standard form in odd characteristic. If a group has an involution with a 2-component that is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic, the goal is to show that it has a centralizer of involution in &quot;standard form&quot; meaning that a centralizer of involution has a component that is of Lie type in odd characteristic and also has a centralizer of 2-rank 1.
#Classification of groups of odd type. The problem is to show that if a group has a centralizer of involution in &quot;standard form&quot; then it is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic. This was solved by Aschbacher's [[classical involution theorem]].
#Quasi-standard form
#Central involutions
#Classification of alternating groups. More precisely, show that if a simple group has
#Some sporadic groups
#Thin groups. The simple [[thin finite groups]], those with 2-local ''p''-rank at most 1 for odd primes ''p'',  were classified by Aschbacher in 1978
#Groups with a strongly p-embedded subgroup for ''p'' odd
#The signalizer functor method for odd primes. The main problem is to prove a [[signalizer functor]] theorem for nonsolvable signalizer functors. This was solved by McBride in 1982.
#Groups of characteristic ''p'' type. This is the problem of groups with a strongly ''p''-embedded 2-local subgroup with  ''p'' odd, which was handled by Aschbacher.
#Quasithin groups. A [[quasithin group]] is one whose 2-local subgroups have ''p''-rank at most 2 for all odd primes ''p'', and the problem is to classify the simple ones of characteristic 2 type. This was completed by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004.
#Groups of low 2-local 3-rank. This was essentially solved by Aschbacher's [[trichotomy theorem]] for groups with ''e''(''G'')=3. The main change is that 2-local 3-rank is replaced by 2-local ''p''-rank for odd primes.
#Centralizers of 3-elements in standard form. This was essentially done by the [[Trichotomy theorem]].
#Classification of simple groups of characteristic 2 type. This was handled by the [[Gilman-Griess theorem]], with 3-elements replaced by ''p''-elements for odd primes.

== Second-generation classification ==
The proof of the theorem, as it stood around 1985 or so, can be called ''first generation''. Because of the extreme length of the first generation proof, much effort has been devoted to finding a simpler proof, called a '''second-generation classification proof'''. This effort, called &quot;revisionism&quot;, was originally led by [[Daniel Gorenstein]].

As of 2005, six volumes of the second generation proof have been published {{harvs|last=Gorenstein|last2=Lyons|last3=Solomon|year1=1994|year2=1996|year3=1998|year4=1999|year5=2002|year6=2005}}, with most of the balance of the proof in manuscript. It is estimated that the new proof will eventually fill approximately 5,000 pages. (This length stems in part from second generation proof being written in a more relaxed style.) Aschbacher and Smith wrote their two volumes devoted to the quasithin case in such a way that those volumes can be part of the second generation proof.

Gorenstein and his collaborators have given several reasons why a simpler proof is possible.
* The most important is that the correct, final statement of the theorem is now known. Simpler techniques can be applied that are known to be adequate for the types of groups we know to be finite simple. In contrast, those who worked on the first generation proof did not know how many sporadic groups there were, and in fact some of the sporadic groups (e.g., the [[Janko group]]s) were discovered while proving other cases of the classification theorem. As a result, many of the pieces of the theorem were proved using techniques that were overly general.

*Because the conclusion was unknown, the first generation proof consists of many stand-alone theorems, dealing with important special cases. Much of the work of proving these theorems was devoted to the analysis of numerous special cases. Given a larger, orchestrated proof, dealing with many of these special cases can be postponed until the most powerful assumptions can be applied. The price paid under this revised strategy is that these first generation theorems no longer have comparatively short proofs, but instead rely on the complete classification.

*Many first generation theorems overlap, and so divide the possible cases in inefficient ways. As a result, families and subfamiles of finite simple groups were identified multiple times. The revised proof eliminates these redundancies by relying on a different subdivision of cases.

*Finite group theorists have more experience at this sort of exercise, and have new techniques at their disposal.

{{harvtxt|Aschbacher|2004}} has called the work on the classification problem by Ulrich Meierfrankenfeld, Bernd Stellmacher, Gernot Stroth, and a few others, a '''third generation program'''. One goal of this is to treat all groups in characteristic 2 uniformly using the amalgam method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Neolithic}}
The '''Chalcolithic''' ({{lang-grc|χαλκός}} ''khalkos'' &quot;[[copper]]&quot; + {{lang-grc|λίθος}} ''lithos'' &quot;[[Rock (geology)|stone]]&quot;) period or '''Copper Age''', also known as the '''Eneolithic'''/'''Æneolithic''' (from [[Latin]] ''aeneus'' &quot;of [[bronze]]&quot;), is a phase in the development of human culture in which the use of early [[metal]] [[tool]]s appeared alongside the use of [[stone tools]]. 

The period is a transitional one outside of the traditional [[three-age system]], and occurs between the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]]s. It appears that copper was not widely exploited at first and that efforts in alloying it with [[tin]] and other metals began quite soon, making it difficult to distinguish the distinct Chalcolithic cultures from later periods. The boundary between the Copper and Bronze Ages is indistinct, since alloys sputtered in and out of use due to the erratic supply of tin.

The emergence of [[metallurgy]] occurred first in the [[Fertile Crescent]], where it gave rise to the Bronze Age in the [[4th millennium BC]]. There was an [[Bronze Age#Americas|independent and limited invention of copper and bronze smelting]] by the [[Incas]] in [[South America]] and the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization in West [[Mexico]] (see [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]]).

The literature of European archaeology, in general, avoids the use of 'chalcolithic' (the term 'Copper Age' is preferred), whereas [[Middle East]]ern archaeologists regularly use it. The Copper Age in the Middle East and the [[Caucasus]] began in the late [[5th millennium BC]] and lasted for about a millennium before it gave rise to the [[Early Bronze Age]]. Transition from the European Copper Age to [[Bronze Age Europe]] occurs about a millennium later, between the late 4th and the late [[3rd millenium BC|3rd millennia BC]].

According to Parpola,&lt;ref&gt;A.Parpola, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ceramic similarities between the [[Indus Civilization]], southern [[Turkmenistan]], and northern [[Iran]] during 4300–3300 BC of the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age) suggest considerable mobility and trade.

==Europe==
{{Main|Chalcolithic Europe|Metallurgy during the Copper Age in Europe}}
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|Chalcolithic copper mine in Timna Valley, [[Negev Desert]], [[Israel]].]]
[[Ötzi the Iceman]], who was found in the Ötztal [[Alps]] and whose remains were dated to about 3300 BC, was found with a copper axe, which indicates that copper mining existed in Europe at least 5,300 years ago (500 years earlier than previously believed).&lt;ref&gt;Oetzi: The 5000 Year Old Murder Case --SOLVED! http://www.mondovista.com/oetzi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Serbia a copper axe was found at [[Prokuplje]], which indicates that human use of metals started in Europe around 7,500 years ago (~5,500BCE), many years earlier than previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/ancient-axe-find-suggests-copper-age-began-earlier-than-believed_100105122.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of the use of copper was far wider spread than the metal itself. The European [[Battle Axe culture]] used stone axes modeled on copper axes, with imitation &quot;[[Molding (process)|mold]] marks&quot; carved in the stone.&lt;ref&gt;J. Evans, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Chalcolithic cultures in Europe include [[Vila Nova de São Pedro]] and [[Los Millares]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Pottery of the [[Beaker people]] has been found at both sites, dating to several centuries after copper-working began there. The Beaker culture appears to have spread copper and bronze technologies in Europe, along with [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;D.W.Anthony,'' The Horse, The Wheel and Language: How Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Asia==
The [[South Asia]]n inhabitants of [[Mehrgarh]] fashioned tools with local copper ore between 7700–3300 BCE.&lt;ref name=Possehl&gt;Possehl, Gregory L. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Asia==
[[5th millennium BCE|5th millennia BCE]] copper artifacts start to appear in East Asia, such as [[Jiangzhai]] and [[Hongshan culture]], but those metal artifacts were not widely used.

==Africa==
{{Main|Copper metallurgy in Africa|Iron Metallurgy in Africa}}
The [[Iron Age]] and Bronze Age occurred simultaneously in much of Africa. In [[North Africa]] and the Nile Valley imported its iron technology from the [[Near East]] and followed Near Eastern course of Bronze Age and [[Iron Age]] development. The earliest dating of iron in [[Sub-Saharan]] Africa is 2500 BCE. at Egaro, west of Termit, making it contemporary to the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3432&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html IRON IN AFRICA: REVISING THE HISTORY](2002).

Alpern (2005). pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The Termit date of 1500 BCE. is widely accepted. Iron use, in [[smelting]] and forging for tools, appears in West Africa by 1200 BCE, making it one of the first places for the birth of the Iron Age.&lt;ref name=&quot;millermintz&quot;&gt;Duncan E.

In the region of the [[Aïr Mountains]] in [[Niger]] we have the development of independent copper smelting between 3000–2500 BCE. The process was not in a developed state, indication smelting was not foreign. It became mature about the 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret, Christopher (2002). The Civilizations of Africa.

==Americas==
{{Main|Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica}}
The term is also applied to American civilizations that already used copper and copper [[alloy]]s thousands of years before European conquest. The [[Old Copper Complex]], located in present-day [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] in the [[United States]], used copper for tools, [[weapon]]s, and other implements. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] from these sites have been dated from 4000 to 1000 BCE, making them some of the oldest Chalcolithic sites in the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;T.C.Pleger, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{about|laws concerning male circumcision|the legal status of female genital cutting|female genital cutting}}

There exist laws restricting or regulating '''circumcision,''' some dating back to ancient times.  In a number of modern states, circumcision of males is presumed to be legal, but under certain circumstances, more general laws, such as laws about assault or child custody, may sometimes be interpreted as applying to situations involving circumcision.  Some countries have placed restrictions on circumcision.

==History==
{{See also|Brit milah}}
There are ancient religious requirements for [[circumcision]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] commands [[Jew]]s to circumcise their male children on the eighth day of life, and to circumcise their male slaves ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:11-12|HE}}).

Laws banning circumcision are also ancient. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] prized the foreskin and disapproved of the Jewish custom of circumcision.&lt;ref name=Hodges2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hodges |first=Frederick M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |month= |title=The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme |journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=75 |issue= |pages=375&amp;ndash;405 |id= |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/ |accessdate= 2008-01-22 |quote=|doi=10.1353/bhm.2001.0119 |pmid=11568485}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[1 Maccabees]], 1:60–61 states that [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|King Antiochus IV]] of [[Syria]], the occupying power of [[Judea]] in 170 BC, outlawed circumcision on penalty of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Maccabees]], 1:60–61&lt;/ref&gt; one of the grievances leading to the [[Maccabean Revolt]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Miller&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

| quote       = Ritual circumcision of boys is a durable tradition. Jews of ancient times refused to abandon the practice despite enormous pressure to do so. In 167 BCE the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV, as part of a campaign to Hellenise the Jews, condemned to death every Hebrew who allowed a son to be circumcised. The Jews responded with the Maccabean revolt, a campaign of guerrilla warfare that resulted in major victories for the rebels and, eventually, a peace treaty that restored Jewish ritual prerogatives.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the [[Roman empire|Roman]] emperor [[Hadrian]] issued a decree banning circumcision in the empire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/ The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and some modern scholars argue that this was a main cause of the Jewish [[Bar Kokhba]] revolt of 132 AD.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Alfredo M. Rabello, The Ban on Circumcision as a Cause of Bar Kokhba’s Rebellion, 29 ISRAEL L. REV. 176 (1995) (Arguing that the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule was primarily motivated by the superimposition of foreign religious standards, rather than by some important notion of independence or sovereignty).&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]], however, made no mention of such a law, and blamed the Jewish uprising instead on Hadrian's decision to rebuild [[Jerusalem]] as [[Aelia Capitolina]], a city dedicated to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].

[[Antoninus Pius]] permitted Jews to circumcise their own sons. However, he forbade the circumcision of non-Jews that were either foreign-slaves or non-Jewish members of the household, contrary to {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:12|HE}} He also made it illegal for a man to convert to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2004/2004-03-29.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.03.29&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Antoninus Pius exempted the [[Egypt]]ian priesthood from the otherwise universal ban on circumcision.

==Modern Law==
===Australia===
In 1993, a non-binding research paper of the [[Queensland Law Reform Commission]] (''Circumcision of Male Infants'') concluded that &quot;On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the [[Queensland]] Criminal Code, routine circumcision of a male infant could be regarded as a criminal act&quot;, and that doctors who perform circumcision on male infants may be liable to civil claims by that child at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/QLRC/ QLRC: Circumcision of Male Infants&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  No prosecutions have occurred in Queensland, and circumcisions continue to be performed.

In a case of [[sexual assault]] in [[Queensland, Australia]] (1997), a district court awarded a man damages for nervous shock after a botched attempt to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle in a drunken attack. Making Australian legal history, the award was made against the assailant for unlawful wounding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.co.za/1997/10/09/page%2015.htm &quot;Man sues for circumcision&quot;, (October 9, 1997) ''Daily Dispatch'']{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] man won $A360,000 in damages after a doctor admitted he botched a circumcision operation at birth which left the man with a badly deformed penis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/news/perth1/ Man Receives $360,000 Compensation for Childhood Circumcision&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Queensland police charged a father with grievous bodily harm for having his two sons, then aged nine and five, circumcised without the knowledge and against the wishes of the mother. The mother and father were in a family court dispute. The charges were dropped when the police prosecutor revealed that he did not have all family court paperwork in court and the magistrate refused to grant an adjournment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/news/thesundaymail08-11-02/ Mother's Fury as Boys Circumcised]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic circumcision for newborn males is currently banned in all Australian public hospitals, South Australia being the last state to adopt the ban in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22744548-5006787,00.html|title=Public hospitals ban circumcision |date=2007-11-12 |publisher=The Australian}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Tasmanian President of the Australian Medical Association, Haydn Walters, stated that they would support a call to ban circumcision for non-medical, non-religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/09/2113665.htm |title=Doctors back call for circumcision ban |date=2007-12-09 |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute released its Issues Paper investigating the law relating to male circumcision in Tasmania, it &quot;highlights the uncertainty in relation to whether doctors can legally perform circumcision on infant males&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.utas.edu.au/reform/malecircumcision.htm |title=Male circumcision |publisher=Tasmanian Law Reform Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
Male circumcision was very strongly discouraged in Bulgaria in the 1980s as part of attempts to pressure the country's Muslim minority but there was no actual legislation against the practice.&lt;ref&gt;'Under the Fez and the Foreskin', p113, ''The Orient Within'' (Cornell University Press, 2004) http://theorientwithin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
Male circumcision has traditionally been presumed to be legal under British law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=English Criminal Law and Ethnic Minority Customs |last=Poulter |first=Sebastian |publisher=Butterworths,London |isbn=00113259765 |year=1986 |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/poulter/|quote=&lt;small&gt; , no amount of parental agreement or support can legitimise the circumcision, excision or infibulation of a young girl in this country, unless the operation is for therapeutic purposes.&lt;small&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some authors have argued that there is no solid foundation for this view in English law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/UKlaw/fox-thomson2005/ A covenant with the status quo?

The passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has led to some speculation that the lawfulness of the circumcision of male children is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/edge1/ Circumcision After the Human Rights Act 1998&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One 1999 case, ''Re &quot;J&quot; (child's religious upbringing and circumcision)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/ Re J (child's religious upbringing and circumcision)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; said that circumcision in Britain required the consent of all those with parental responsibility, or the permission of the court, acting for the best interests of the child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing [[Muslim]] father and non-practicing [[Christian]] mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without [[medical necessity]]; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a hypothetical case of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father refuses his agreement. In such a case, a decision in favor of circumcision was said to be likely.

In 2001 the General Medical Council had found a doctor who had botched circumcision operations guilty of abusing his professional position and that he had acted &quot;inappropriately and irresponsibly&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1502729.stm | work=BBC News | title=Circumcision doctors 'abused position' | date=2001-08-21 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and struck him off the register.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2003/3/3/101692.html Circumcision case GP told he can resume career&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A doctor who had referred patients to him, and who had pressured a mother into agreeing to the surgery, was also condemned.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; He was put on an 18 month period of review and retraining, and was allowed to resume unrestricted practice as a doctor in March 2003, after a committee found that he had complied with conditions it placed on him. According to the ''Northern Echo'', he &quot;told the committee he has now changed his approach to circumcision referrals, accepting that most cases can be treated without the need for surgery.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Fox and Thomson (2005) argue that consent cannot be given for non-therapeutic circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/UKlaw/fox-thomson2005/ A covenant with the status quo? Male circumcision and the new BMA guidance to doctors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They say there is &quot;no compelling legal authority for the common view that circumcision is lawful.&quot;

In 2009 it was reported that a 20 year old man whose father had him ritually circumcised as a baby is preparing to sue the doctor who circumcised him. This is believed to be the first time a person who was circumcised as an infant has made a claim in the UK. The case is expected to be heard in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/11/17/snip-op-illegal-115875-21828059/|title=Ritual circumcisions 'illegal'|work=[[Daily Mirror]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In August 2006, a [[Finland|Finnish]] court ruled that the circumcision of a four-year-old boy arranged by his mother, who is Muslim, to be an illegal assault. The boy's father, who had not been consulted, reported the incident to the police.  A local prosecutor stated that the prohibition of genital mutilation is not gender-specific in Finnish law.  A lawyer for the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health stated that there is neither legislation nor prohibition on male circumcision, and that &quot;the operations have been performed on the basis of common law.&quot;  The case was  appealed &lt;ref name=&quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Court rules circumcision of four-year-old boy illegal |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Court+rules+circumcision+of+four-year-old+boy+illegal/1135220958830}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2008 the Finnish Supreme Court ruled that the circumcision, &quot; carried out for religious and social reasons and in a medical manner, did not have the earmarks of a criminal offence. It pointed out in its ruling that the circumcision of Muslim boys is an established tradition and an integral part of the identity of Muslim men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://yle.fi/news/id104896.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Finnish government was reported to be considering a new law to legalise circumcision if the practitioner is a doctor and if the child consents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 2010, a Jewish couple were fined for causing bodily harm to their then infant son who was circumcised in 2008 by a [[mohel]] brought in from the UK. Normal procedure for persons of Jewish faith in Finland is to have a locally certified mohel who work in Finnish healthcare perform the operation. In the 2008 case, the infant was not anesthetized and developed complications that required immediate hospital care. The parents were ordered to pay 1500 euros in damages to their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Germany===
In October 2006, a [[Turkey|Turkish]] national who performed ritual circumcisions on seven boys was convicted of causing dangerous bodily harm by the state court in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/news/2006/Germany_fines_circumciser_for_initi_10172006.html The Raw Story | Germany fines circumciser for initiation of 7 boys&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, a [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]] appeals court found that the circumcision of an 11 year old boy without his approval was an unlawful personal injury. Reportedly, the boy, whose parents are divorced, was visiting his Muslim father during a vacation when his father forced him to be ritually circumcised . According to a report by the German ddp press agency, the boy, who lives with his mother,  plans to sue his father for 10,000 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071017044733/http://jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/104271.html Breaking News - JTA, Jewish &amp; Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In October 2005 a [[Nigeria]]n man was cleared of a charge of reckless endangerment over the death of a baby from haemorrhage and shock after he had circumcised the child. The judge directed the jury not to &quot;bring what he called their white western values to bear when they were deciding this case&quot; and after deliberating for an hour and a half they found the defendant not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1007/igbinediono.html RTÉ News: Nigerian cleared over circumcision death&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israel]], Jewish circumcision is entirely legal, as is after-death circumcision.

===South Africa===
The Children's Act 2007 makes the circumcision of male children under 16 unlawful except for religious or medical reasons. [[Eastern Cape Province]] passed a law (Application of Health Standards in Traditional Circumcision Act 2001) to regulate traditional circumcision, which causes the death or mutilation of many youths by traditional surgeons each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crin.org/violence/search/closeup.asp?infoID=14243 CRIN - Violence Study - SOUTH AFRICA: Clamping down on botched circumcisions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=73278|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Clamping down on botched circumcisions|date=1 August 2007|work=IRIN In-Depth|location=MTHATA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other provisions, the minimum age for circumcision is age 18.

In 2004, a 22 year old Rastafarian convert was forcibly circumcised by a group of [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] tribal elders and relatives. When he first fled, two police returned him to those who had circumcised him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, a medically circumcised Xhosa man was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. According to South African newspapers, the subsequent trial became &quot;a landmark case around forced circumcision.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Sweden===
In 2001, [[Sweden]] enacted a law allowing only persons certified by the National Board of Health to circumcise infants. It requires a medical doctor or an anesthesia nurse to accompany the circumciser and for anaesthetic to be applied beforehand. After the first two months of life circumcisions can only be performed by a [[physician]]. The stated purpose of the law was to increase the safety of the procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;SR&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1316&amp;artikel=974694 |newspaper=[[Sveriges Radio]] |date=22 October 2006 |title=Snitt som kostar - om omskärelse av pojkar |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

year. An estimated 2000 of these are performed by persons who are neither physicians nor have officially recognised certification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holender2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/manga-lakare-vagrar-utfora-omskarelse-av-unga-pojkar-1.918069 |title=Många läkare vägrar utföra omskärelse av unga pojkar |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish |date=24 July 2009 |author=Robert Holender}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare reviewed the law in 2005 and recommended that it be maintained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; but found that the law had failed with regard to the intended consequence of increasing the safety of circumcisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soc2007&quot;/&gt; A later report by the Board criticised the low level of availability of legal circumcisions, partly due to reluctance among health professionals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soc2007&quot;/&gt; To remedy this, the report suggested a new law obliging all county councils to offer non-therapeutic circumcision in their hospitals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soc2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite report |title=Omskärelse av pojkar |url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/publikationer2007/2007-107-7 |month=March |year=2007 |publisher=[[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] |language=Swedish |docket=2007-107-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was later abandoned in favour of a non-binding recommendation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holender2009&quot;/&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, circumcision is not specifically unlawful. However, some believe that the circumcision of a child violates general laws enacted for the protection of children. [[Physician|Doctors]] who circumcise children must take care that all applicable rules regarding informed consent are satisfied. If consent is invalid, then a circumcision is a battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/conundrum/ Informed Consent for Neonatal Circumcision&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; MGM Bill is currently lobbying to extend the ban on female circumcision to males, arguing that banning female circumcision but allowing male circumcision violates the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgmbill.org MGMbill.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disputes between parents'''
Occasionally the courts are asked to make a ruling when parents cannot agree on whether or not to circumcise a child.

In January  2001 a dispute between divorcing parents in New Jersey was resolved when the mother, who sought to have the boy circumcised withdrew her request. The boy had experienced two instances of foreskin inflammation and she wanted to have him circumcised. The father, who had experienced a traumatic circumcision as a child objected and they turned to the courts for a decision. The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both opposed any court ordered medical treatment. As the parties came to an agreement, no precedent was set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/news/star-ledger01-25-01/ Accord Not To Circumcise Son Still Leaves Heated Legal Debate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001 a Nevada court settled a dispute over circumcision between two parents but put a strict gag order on the terms of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/cgi-bin/printable.cgi?/lvrj_home/2001/Jun-25-Mon-2001/news/16387263.html|title=Gag order issued|last=Thevemot|first=Carri Geer|date=June 25, 2001|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2001 a dispute between parents in [[Kansas]] over circumcision was resolved when the mother's request to have the infant circumcised was withdrawn. In this case the father opposed circumcision while the mother asserted that not circumcising the child was against her religious beliefs. (The woman's pastor had stated that circumcision was &quot;important&quot; but was not necessary for salvation.) On 24 July 2001 the parents reached agreement that the infant would not be circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-24-01 |title=Agreement reached in circumcision case |date=Wednesday, July 25, 2001 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-13-01/ |title=Wichitans fight over their son's circumcision |author=Alex Branch |date=Friday, July 13, 2001 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] heard arguments from a divorced [[Oregon]] couple over the circumcision of their son. The father wants his son, who turned 13 on 2 March 2008, to be circumcised; the child's mother opposes the procedure.  The parents dispute whether the boy is in favor of the procedure.

Before [[glasnost]], according to an article in [[The Jewish Press]], Jewish ritual circumcision was forbidden in the [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Oka, [http://www.russianjewry.org/about/media/jp9.php &quot;Soviet Jews Of All Ages Seek Circumcision&quot;], ''The Jewish Press'', March 14, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; However, David E. Fishman, professor of Jewish History at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], states that, whereas the [[Cheder|''heder'']] and ''[[yeshiva]]'', the organs of Jewish education, &quot;were banned by virtue of the law separating church and school, and subjected to tough police and administrative actions,&quot; circumcision was not proscribed by law or suppressed by executive measures.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Fishman, &quot;Judaism in the USSR, 1917-1930: The Fate of Religious Education,&quot; in: Yaacov Ro'i, ed., ''Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union'' (Cummings Center Series; London: Cass, 1995), 251-262; pp. 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jehoshua A. Gilboa writes that while circumcision was not officially or explicitly banned, pressure was exerted to make it difficult. ''[[Mohel]]s'' in particular were concerned that they could be punished for any health issue that might develop, even if it arose some time after the circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There was no official prohibition of circumcision and, on the whole, even the propaganda attacks on it were relatively restrained, apparently out of consideration for the presence of many millions of Moslems [...] in the Soviet Union. But at the same time numerous pressures were exerted to make observance of this precept [i.e., circumcision] difficult. Needless to say, Jewish members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] were in an embarrassing situation when they personally faced the question whether to circumcise their sons [...] And the uncertainty weighed heaviest on the ''mohalim'' themselves [...] Any health problem developing in the baby some time after circumcision could serve to incriminate the ''mohel''. It is easy to imagine, for example, the impact of news items on the death of children because of [...] circumcision (and the punishments imposed on ''mohalim''), even if there were no explicit legal bans on circumcision.&quot; Jehoshua A. Gilboa, ''A Language Silenced: The Suppression of Hebrew Literature and Culture in the Soviet Union'' (London: Associated University Press, 1982), pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Called to Common Mission''' is an agreement between [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), establishing full communion between them. It was ratified by the ELCA in 1999, the ECUSA in 2000, after the narrow failure of a previous agreement. Its principal author on the Episcopal side was the Rev. Canon [[J. Robert Wright]].  Under the agreement, they recognize the validity of each other's [[baptism]]s and [[ordination]]s. The agreement provided that the ELCA would accept the [[historical episcopate]], something which became controversial in the ELCA. In response to concerns about the meaning of CCM, bishops in the ELCA drafted [http://www.elca.org/synods/bishopstucson.html Tucson Resolution], which presented the official ELCA position.

Some  within the ELCA argued that requiring the historic episcopate would contradict the traditional [[Lutheran doctrine]] that the church exists wherever the Word is preached and Sacraments are practiced. Others objected on the grounds that adopting the Episcopalian priesthood and  hierarchical structure was contrary to the Lutheran concept of the [[Priesthood of all believers]], which holds that all Christians stand on equal footing before God. They argued that the [[Old Covenant]] required a priest to mediate between God and humanity, but that [[New Covenant]] explicitly abolishes the need for priestly role by making every Christian a priest with direct access to God's grace. Still others objected because of the implied directive that [[Lay presidency]] would be abolished. This was a particularly issue for rural congregations that periodically &quot;called&quot; a congregation member to conduct communion services in the absence of ordained clergy.

[[Image:Context menu.png|frame|right|A desktop context menu in [[GNOME]] which can be customized]]

[[Image:Context_menu_windows.png|thumb|233px|right|Context menus in [[Windows XP]] are customizable by third-party software.]]

A '''context menu''' (also called '''contextual''', '''shortcut''', and '''popup''' or '''pop-up''' '''menu''') is a [[Menu_(computing)|menu]] in a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) that appears upon user interaction, such as a [[Right click#Common mouse operations|right mouse click]] or [[middle click]] mouse operation. A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application. Usually the available choices are actions related to the [[Selection (user interface)|selected object]].

==History==
Context menus first appeared in the [[Smalltalk]] environment on the [[Xerox Alto]] computer, where they were called ''pop-up menus.'' The [[NEXTSTEP]] operating system further developed the idea, incorporating a feature whereby the right or middle mouse button brought the main menu (which was vertical and automatically changed depending on context) to the location of the mouse, thereby eliminating the need to move the mouse pointer all the way across the large (for the time) NextStep screen.

==Implementation==
Context menus are opened via various forms of user interaction that target a region of the GUI that supports context menus. The specific form of user interaction and the means by which a region is targeted vary:
* On a computer running [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], or [[Unix]] running the [[X Window System]], clicking the secondary mouse button (usually the right button) opens a context menu for the region that is under the mouse pointer.
* On systems that support one-button mice, context menus are typically opened by pressing and holding the primary mouse button (this works on the icons in the Dock on [[Mac OS X]]) or by pressing a keyboard/mouse button combination (e.g. Ctrl-mouse click in [[Mac OS]]). A keyboard alternative for Mac OS is to enable [[Mouse keys]] in [[Universal Access]]. Then, depending on whether a laptop or compact or extended keyboard type is used, the shortcut is {{keypress|Function}}+{{keypress|Ctrl}}+5 or {{keypress|Ctrl}}+5 (numeric keypad) or {{keypress|Function}}+{{keypress|Ctrl}}+i (laptop).
* In Microsoft Windows, pressing the [[Menu key|Application key]] or Shift+F10 opens a context menu for the region that has [[Focus (computing)|focus]].

Context menus are sometimes hierarchically organized, allowing navigation through different levels of the menu structure. The implementations differ: [[Microsoft Word]] was one of the first applications to only show sub-entries of some menu entries after clicking an arrow icon on the context menu, otherwise executing an action associated with the parent entry. This makes it possible to quickly repeat an action with the parameters of the previous execution, and to better separate options from actions.

=== X Window Managers ===

The following [[window manager]]s provide context menu functionality:

* [[9wm]]
* [[icewm]] - [[middleclick]] and [[rightclick]] context menus on [[Desktop environment|desktop]], [[menubar]]. [[titlebar]]s, and [[titleicon]]
* [[olwm]]
* [[openbox]]
* [[Sawfish (window manager)|sawfish]]

==Usability==
Context menus have received some criticism from [[usability]] analysts when improperly used, as some applications make certain features ''only'' available in context menus, which may confuse even experienced users (especially when the context menus can only be activated in a limited area of the application's client window).

Context menus usually open in a fixed position under the [[Elements of graphical user interfaces#Pointer|pointer]], but when the pointer is near a screen edge the menu will be displaced - thus reducing consistency and impeding use of [[muscle memory]]. If the context menu is being triggered by keyboard, such as by using Shift + F10, the context menu appears instead near the focused widget instead of the position of the pointer, to save recognition efforts.

==In documentation==
Microsoft's guidelines call for using the term ''context menu'' only in programming and other technical documentation, while using ''shortcut menu'' in user documentation.&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511502.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}}
In Judaism, &quot;chosenness&quot; is the belief that the [[Jew]]s are the [[Chosen People]], chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]]. This idea is first found in the [[Torah]] (five books of [[Moses]] in the [[Bible]]) and is elaborated on in later books of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]. Much is written about these topics in [[rabbinic literature]].

The three largest Jewish denominations&amp;mdash;[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]&amp;mdash;maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose.

==Chosenness in the Bible==
According to the traditional Jewish interpretation of the Bible, Israel's character as the chosen people is unconditional as it says in {{Bible verse||Deuteronomy|14:2|HE}}, &quot;For you are a holy people to [[YHWH]] your God, and God has chosen you to be his treasured people from all the nations that are on the face of the earth.&quot;

Although the Torah also says, &quot;Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people&quot; ({{Bible verse||Exodus|19:5|HE}}), God promises that He will never exchange His people with any other. &quot;And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.&quot; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2017:7&amp;version=NKJV (Genesis 17:7)].

Other Torah verses about chosenness, &quot;For all the earth is mine: and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation&quot; ({{Bible verse||Exodus|19:6|HE}}). &quot;The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people; but because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your ancestors.&quot; ({{Bible verse||Deuteronomy|7:7-8|HE}}).

The obligation imposed upon the Israelites is emphasized by the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Amos|3:2|HE}}): &quot;You only have I singled out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.&quot;

==Rabbinic Jewish views of chosenness==

The idea of chosenness has traditionally been interpreted by Jews in two ways: one way is that God chose the Israelites, while the other idea is that the Israelites chose God. Although collectively this choice was made freely, religious Jews believe that it created individual obligation for the descendants of the Israelites. Another opinion is that the choice was free in a limited context; that is, although the Jews chose to follow precepts ordained by God, [[Kabbalah]] and [[Tanya]] teach that even prior to creation, the &quot;Jewish soul&quot; was already chosen.

Crucial to the Jewish notion of chosenness is that it creates obligations exclusive to Jews, while non-Jews receive from God other covenants and other responsibilities. Generally, it does not entail exclusive rewards for Jews. Classical rabbinic literature in the [[Mishnah]] Avot 3:14 has this teaching:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Rabbi Akiva]] used to say, &quot;Beloved is man, for he was created in God's image; and the fact that God made it known that man was created in His image is indicative of an even greater love. As the verse states [{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:6|HE}}], 'In the image of God, man was created.')&quot; The mishna goes on to say, &quot;Beloved are the people Israel, for they are called children of God; it is even a greater love that it was made known to them that they are called children of God, as it said, 'You are the children of the Lord, your God.  Beloved are the people Israel, for a precious article [the Torah] was given to them ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most Jewish texts do not state that &quot;God chose the Jews&quot; by itself. Rather, this is usually linked with a mission or purpose, such as proclaiming God's message among all the nations, even though Jews cannot become &quot;unchosen&quot; if they shirk their mission. This implies a special duty, which evolves from the belief that Jews have been pledged by the covenant which God concluded with the biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], their ancestor, and again with the entire Jewish nation at [[Mount Sinai]]. In this view, Jews are charged with living a holy life as God's priest-people.

In the [[Siddur|Jewish prayerbook (the Siddur)]], chosenness is referred to in a number of ways. The blessing for reading the [[Torah]] reads &quot;Praised are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has chosen us out of all the nations and bestowed upon us His Torah.&quot;

In the &quot;Kiddush&quot;, a prayer of sanctification in which the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] is inaugurated over a cup of wine, the text reads &quot;For you have chosen us and sanctified us out of all the nations, and have given us the Sabbath as an inheritance in love and favour. Praised are you, Lord, who hallows the Sabbath.&quot;

In the &quot;Kiddush&quot; recited on festivals it says, &quot;Blessed are You ... who have chosen us from among all nations, raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments.&quot;

The [[Aleinu]] prayer refers to the concept of Jews as a chosen people:

{{quote|It is our duty to praise the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like the nations of the world and has not placed us like the families of the earth; who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude. We bend the knee and bow and acknowledge before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, that it is he who stretched forth the heavens and founded the earth. His seat of glory is in the heavens above; his abode of majesty is in the lofty heights.|&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Philip Birnbaum, &quot;High Holyday Prayerbook&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An earlier form of this prayer, in use during the medieval era, contained an extra sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is our duty to praise the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like the nations of the world and has not placed us like the families of the earth; who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude, ''who worship mist and emptiness and pray to a God who cannot give success.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sentence in italics is an allusion to the Bible, [[Isaiah]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|45:20|HE}}). &quot;Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations; they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.&quot; In the medieval era some within the Christian community came to believe that this line referred to Christians worshipping Jesus; they demanded that it be excised. [[Ismar Elbogen]], a historian of the Jewish liturgy, held that the early form of the prayer pre-dated Christianity, and could not possibly have referred to it.

:''This section contains information from the Jewish Encyclopedia originally published between 1901-1906, which is in the public domain.''

According to the Rabbis, &quot;Israel is of all nations the most willful or headstrong one, and the Torah was to give it the right scope and power of resistance, or else the world could not have withstood its fierceness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beẓah, 25b&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The Lord offered the Law to all nations; but all refused to accept it except Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mek. Yitro, Pes. R. K. 103b, 186a, 200a&lt;/ref&gt;

How do we understand &quot;A Gentile who consecrates his life to the study and observance of the Law ranks as high as the high priest&quot;, says R. Meïr, by deduction from Lev. xviii. 5; II Sam. vii. 19; Isa. xxvi. 2; Ps. xxxiii. 1, cxviii. 20, cxxv. 4, where all stress is laid not on Israel, but on man or the righteous one.&lt;ref&gt;Sifra, Aḥare Mot, 86b; Bacher, &quot;Ag. Tan.&quot; ii. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gemara states this regarding a non-Jew who studies Torah [his 7 mitzvot] and regarding this, see Shita Mekubetzes, Bava Kama 38a who says that this is an exaggeration. In any case, this statement was not extolling the non-Jew. The Rishonim explain that it is extolling the '''Torah'''.

Tosfos explains that the reason it uses the example of a ''kohen gadol'' (high priest) is because this statement is based on the verse, &quot;''y'kara hi mipnimim''&quot; (it is more precious than pearls) which is explained elsewhere in the Gemara to mean that Torah is more precious ''pnimim'' (translated here as &quot;inside&quot; instead of as &quot;pearls&quot;--i.e. the Torah is introspectively absorbed into the person)- which refer to ''lifnai v'lifnim'' (translated as &quot;the most inner of places&quot;-- i.e. the Holy of Holies where the ''kahon gadol'' went.

In any case, in Midrash Rabba (Bamidbar 13:15) this statement is brought with an important addition: a non-Jew who converts and studies Torah etc.

(Nation of) Israel is likened to the olive. Just as this fruit yields its precious oil only after being much pressed and squeezed, so Israel's destiny is one of great oppression and hardship, in order that it may thereby give forth its illuminating wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Ex. R. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is the quality most befitting Israel as the chosen people (Ḥag. 9b). Only on account of its good works is Israel among the nations &quot;as the lily among thorns&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Cant. R. ii. 2&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;as wheat among the chaff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Midr. Teh. i. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber's &quot;System der Altsynagogalen Theologie&quot;, etc., pp. 59-69, is full of glaring errors and misstatements on the subject of Israel as the chosen people&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Orthodox views==
[[Rabbi]] Lord [[Immanuel Jakobovits]], former Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue of Great Britain (Modern Orthodox Judaism), describes chosenness in this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I do believe that the chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people - and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual - is &quot;chosen&quot; or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]]s were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the [[ancient Rome|Roman]]s for their pioneering services in law and government, the [[British Empire|British]] for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], a leader of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] writes:

{{quote|The chosenness of Israel relates exclusively to its spiritual vocation embodied in the Torah; the doctrine, indeed, was announced at Sinai. Whenever it is mentioned in our liturgy - such as the blessing immediately preceding the Shema....it is always related to Torah or Mitzvot (''commandments''). This spiritual vocation consists of two complementary functions, described as &quot;Goy Kadosh&quot;, that of a holy nation, and &quot;Mamlekhet Kohanim&quot;, that of a kingdom of priests. The first term denotes the development of communal separateness or differences in order to achieve a collective self-transcendence.... The second term implies the obligation of this brotherhood of the spiritual elite toward the rest of mankind; priesthood is defined by the prophets as fundamentally a teaching vocation.|&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-state-of-jewish-belief-10853?page=all ''The State of Jewish Belief: A Symposium Compiled by the Editors of Commentary Magazine'', August 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Conservative Judaism views==
[[Conservative Judaism]] and its Israeli counterpart [[Masorti]] Judaism, views the concept of chosenness in this way:

{{quote|Few beliefs have been subject to as much misunderstanding as the &quot;Chosen People&quot; doctrine.  The Torah and the Prophets clearly stated that this does not imply any innate Jewish superiority.  In the words of Amos (3:2) &quot;You alone have I singled out of all the families of the earth - that is why I will call you to account for your iniquities&quot;. The Torah tells us that we are to be &quot;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot; with obligations and duties which flowed from our willingness to accept this status. Far from being a license for special privilege, it entailed additional responsibilities not only toward God but to our fellow human beings. As expressed in the blessing at the reading of the Torah, our people have always felt it to be a privilege to be selected for such a purpose. For the modern traditional Jew, the doctrine of the election and the covenant of Israel offers a purpose for Jewish existence which transcends its own self interests. It suggests that because of our special history and unique heritage we are in a position to demonstrate that a people that takes seriously the idea of being covenanted with God can not only thrive in the face of oppression, but can be a source of blessing to its children and its neighbors. It obligates us to build a just and compassionate society throughout the world and especially in the [[land of Israel]] where we may teach by example what it means to be a &quot;covenant people, a light unto the nations.|&lt;ref&gt;''Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism'', JTSA, New York, 1988, p.33-34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rabbi [[Reuven Hammer]] of [[Masorti Judaism]] comments on the excised sentence in the Aleinu prayer mentioned above:

{{quote|Originally the text read that God has not made us like the nations who &quot;bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an impotent god&quot;, ...In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends to give the impression that the Aleinu teaches that we are both different and better than others. The actual intent is to say that we are thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, we are no longer the only ones to have a belief in one God.|&lt;ref&gt;Reuven Hammer, ''Or Hadash'', The Rabbinical Assembly, New York, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reform Judaism==
[[Reform Judaism]] views the concept of chosenness in this way:

{{quote|Throughout the ages it has been Israel's mission to witness to the Divine in the face of every form of paganism and materialism. We regard it as our historic task to cooperate with all men in the establishment of the kingdom of God, of universal brotherhood, Justice, truth and peace on earth. This is our Messianic goal.|&lt;ref&gt;''The Guiding Principles of Reform Judaism'', Columbus, [[Ohio]], 1937&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1999 the Reform movement stated:

{{quote|We affirm that the Jewish people are bound to God by an eternal covenant, as reflected in our varied understandings of Creation, Revelation and Redemption....We are Israel, a people aspiring to holiness, singled out through our ancient covenant and our unique history among the nations to be witnesses to God's presence. We are linked by that covenant and that history to all Jews in every age and place.|&lt;ref&gt;''Statement of Principles for Reform Judaism'', adopted at the 1999 [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] Convention, Central Conference of American Rabbis&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Alternative Kabbalistic and philosophical views==
{{Copy edit|section|for=structure|date=April 2011}}
Some prominent Kabbalists rejected this idea and believed in essential equality of all human souls. [[Menahem Azariah da Fano]], in his book ''Reincarnations of souls'', provides many examples of non-Jewish Biblical figures being reincarnated into Jews, and vice versa. Rabbi [[Abraham Cohen de Herrera]], another Kabbalist of the same school, quotes Greek, Christian and various Oriental mystics and philosophers without hesitation, and does not mention anything specific about the Jewish souls.

A number of known [[Chabad]] rabbis offered alternative readings of the Tanya, did not take this teaching literally and even managed to reconcile it with the [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] ideas of [[internationalism]] and [[class struggle]]. The original text of the Tanya refers to the &quot;idol worshippers&quot; and does not mention the &quot;nations of the world&quot; at all, though such interpretation was endorsed by the last [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|Lubavitcher Rebbe]] and is popular in contemporary Chabad circles. Rabbi Hillel of Parich, an early Tanya commentator, wrote that the souls of righteous Gentiles are more similar to the Jewish souls, and are generally good and not egoistic. This teaching was, indeed, accepted by the Lubavitcher Rebbe and is considered normative in Chabad.&lt;ref&gt;Lessons in Tanya, Vol. 1, Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the author of the Tanya himself, a righteous non-Jew can achieve a high level of spiritually, similar to an angel, though his soul is still fundamentally different in character, but not value, from a Jewish one.&lt;ref&gt;סידור הרב, שער אכילת מצה&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn|Tzemach Tzedek]], the third rebbe of Chabad, wrote that the [[Islam|Muslims]] are naturally good-hearted people. Rabbi Yosef Jacobson, a popular contemporary Chabad lecturer, teaches that in today's world most non-Jews belong to the category of righteous Gentiles, effectively rendering the Tanya's attitude anachronistic.

[[Dov Ber Pinson]], a contemporary Chabad mystic, denies the idea that there is any essential difference between the Jews and non-Jews. According to his theory, every person has a lower animalistic and higher Godly soul. The Tanya does not talk about Jews and non-Jews as social groups, but describes the internal struggle between the materialistic &quot;Gentile&quot; and spiritual &quot;Jewish&quot; levels of consciousness within every human soul.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Ber Pinson, Reincarnation and Judaism&lt;/ref&gt;

A radical [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] interpretation of Tanya was offered by [[Abraham Yehudah Khein]], a prominent [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Chabad rabbi, who supported [[anarchist communism]] and considered [[Peter Kropotkin]] a great [[Tzaddik]]. Rabbi Khein basically read the Tanya backwards: since the souls of idol worshippers are known to be evil, according to the Tanya, while the Jewish souls are known to be good, he concluded that truly altruistic people are really Jewish, in a spiritual sense, while Jewish nationalists and class oppressors are not. By this logic, he claimed that [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]] probably have Jewish souls, while [[Leon Trotsky]] and other totalitarianists do not, and many Zionists, whom he compared to [[ape]]s, are merely &quot;Jewish by birth certificate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ר' אברהם חן, במלכות היהדות (Rabbi Abraham Chen, &quot;In the Kingdom of Judaism&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

All the above-mentioned rabbis viewed the [[Kabbalah]] in general in the same way, because the Tanya is based on the teachings of the [[Zohar]], works of [[Isaac Luria]] and other Kabbalistic sources.

Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] also believed that Jewishness is a level of consciousness and not an intrinsic inborn quality. He wrote that, according to the [[Book of Malachi]], one can find &quot;potential Jews&quot; among all nations, whose souls are illuminated by the leap of &quot;holy faith&quot;, which &quot;activated&quot; the Jewishness in their soul. These people would otherwise convert to Judaism, but prefer not to do so. Instead, they recognize the Divine unity within their pagan religions.&lt;ref&gt;Likutei Moharan, Part 2 ,5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Isaac ben Moses Arama|Isaac Arama]], an influental pholosopher and mystic of the 15th century, believed that righteous non-Jews are spiritually  identical to the righteous Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Arama, Akedat Yitzchak, Ch. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]], a famous Catalan [[Talmud]]ic commentator and [[Maimonides|Maimonidian]] philosopher, considered all people, who sincerely profess an ethical religion, as a part of greater &quot;spiritual Israel&quot;. He explicitly included Christian and Muslims in this category. Meiri rejected all Talmudic laws that discriminate between the Jews and non-Jews, claiming that they only apply to the ancient idolators, who had no sense of morality. The only exception are a few laws related directly or indirectly to intermarriage, which Meiri did recognize.

Meiri applied his idea of &quot;spiritual Israel&quot; to Talmudic statements about unique qualities of the Jewish people. For example, he believed that the famous saying that Israel is above astrological predestination (&quot;Ein Mazal le-Israel&quot;) also applies to the followers of other ethical faiths. He also considered countries, inhabited by decent moral non-Jews, such as [[Languedoc]], as a spiritual part of the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy and Rabbinic Culture:
Jewish Interpretation and Controversy in Medieval Languedoc, by Gregg Stern, Routledge Jewish Studies Series&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spinoza ===
One Jewish critic of chosenness was the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]. In the third chapter of his ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', Spinoza mounts an argument against a naive interpretation of God's choice of the Jews. Bringing evidence from the [[Bible]] itself, he argues that God's choice of Israel was not unique (he has chosen other nations before choosing the Hebrew nation) and that the choice of the Jews is neither inclusive (it does not include all of the Jews, but only the 'pious' ones) nor exclusive (it also includes 'true gentile prophets'). Finally, he argues that God's choice is not unconditional. Recalling the numerous times God threatened the complete destruction of the Hebrew nation, he asserts that this choice is neither absolute, nor eternal, nor necessary. Moreover, in aphorism 12 he writes, &quot;Thus the Jews today have absolutely nothing that they can attribute to themselves but not to other peoples....&quot;

== Reconstructionist criticism ==
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] rejects the concept of chosenness. Its founder, Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]], said that the idea that God chose the Jewish people leads to racist beliefs among Jews, and thus must be excised from Jewish theology. This rejection of chosenness is made explicit in the movement's [[siddur]]im (prayer books).

For example, the original blessing recited before reading from the Torah from contains the phrase &quot;asher bahar banu mikol ha’amim&quot;; &quot;Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, ''who has chosen us from among all peoples'' by giving us the Torah.&quot;  The Reconstructionist version is rewritten as &quot;asher kervanu la’avodato&quot;, &quot;Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, ''who has drawn us to your service'' by giving us the Torah.&quot;

In the mid-1980s the Reconstructionist movement issued its ''Platform on Reconstructionism''. It states that the idea of chosenness is &quot;morally untenable&quot;, because anyone who has such beliefs &quot;implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot, newsletter, September 1986, pages D, E.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Reconstructionists accept this view. The newest siddur of the movement, ''Kol Haneshamah'', includes the traditional blessings as an option, and some modern Reconstructionist writers have opined that the traditional formulation is not racist, and should be embraced.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Mitchell Max, ''The Chosen People: Reclaiming Our Sacred Myth''&lt;/ref&gt;

An original prayer book by Reconstructionist feminist poet [[Marcia Falk]], ''The Book of Blessings'' has been widely accepted by both Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Falk rejects all concepts relating to hierarchy or distinction; she sees any distinction as leading to the acceptance of other kinds of distinctions, and thus leading to prejudice. She writes that as a politically liberal feminist, she must reject distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, Jews and non-Jews, and to some extent even distinctions between the Sabbath and the other six days of the week. She thus rejects idea of chosenness as unethical. She also rejects Jewish theology in general, and instead holds to a form of religious humanism. Falk writes:

{{quote|The idea of Israel as God's chosen people...is a key concept in rabbinic Judaism. Yet it is particularly problematic for many Jews today, in that it seems to fly in the face of monotheistic belief that all humanity is created in the divine image - and hence, all humanity is equally loved and valued by God...I find it difficult to conceive of a feminist Judaism that would incorporate it in its teaching: the valuing of one people ''over and above'' others is all to analogous to the privileging of one sex over another.|&lt;ref&gt;Falk, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reconstructionist author [[Judith Plaskow]] also criticises the idea of chosenness, for many of the same reasons as Falk. A politically liberal lesbian, Plaskow rejects most distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, and Jews and non-Jews. In contrast to Falk, Plaskow does not reject all concepts of differences as inherently leading to unethical beliefs, and holds to a more classical form of Jewish theism than Falk.

A number of responses to these views have been made by Reform and Conservative Jews; they hold that these criticisms are against teachings that do not exist within liberal forms of Judaism, and which are rare in Orthodox Judaism (outside certain [[Haredi]] communities, such as [[Chabad]]). A separate criticism stems from the very existence of feminist forms of Judaism in all denominations of Judaism, which do not have a problem with the concepts of chosenness.

==Views from other religions==
===Islam===
The children of Israel enjoy a special status in the Islamic book, the Quran: &quot;O children of Israel, remember my favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all creation.&quot; (Qur'an 2:47). 2:122).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askmusa.org/site/c.ehLKKZPJLuF/b.3125653/k.7027/The_Jews_and_the_Quran.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Jews were chosen by God as the Chosen people. {{Bible verse||Deuteronomy|14:2|HE}} &lt;ref&gt;''Liberation and reconciliation: a Black theology'' p.  24&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Christians believe that since [[Rejection of Jesus|they do not accept Jesus]], the Christians in turn received that special status.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collegeville Bible Commentary: Based on the New American Bible'', Robert J. Karris, Liturgical Press, 1992, p. 1042&lt;/ref&gt;  This doctrine is known as [[Supersessionism]].

== Influence on relations with other religions ==
[[Avi Beker]], a scholar and the former Secretary General of the [[World Jewish Congress]], regards the idea of the Chosen People as Judaism's defining concept which is &quot;the central unspoken psychological, historical, and theological problem at the heart of Jewish-Gentile relations.&quot; Beker views the concept of choseness as the driving force behind Jewish-Gentile relations which explains both the admiration and more pointedly the envy and hatred the world has felt for the Jews in religious and also secular terms. Beker argues that while Christianity has modified its doctrine on the displacement of the Jews, Islam's inability to reverse or reform its theology on the succession of both the Jews and the Christians presents a major barrier to conflict resolution in the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Avi Beker, The Chosen: The History of Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession, New York: Palgrave Macmilan, 2008, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charges of ethnocentrism and racism ==
Israeli philosopher [[Ze’ev Levy]]&lt;!-- notable, has page in he and de wikis --&gt; writes that chosenness can be &quot;(partially) justified only from the historical angle&quot; with respect to its spiritual and moral contribution to Jewish life thorough centuries, &quot;a powerful agent of consolation and hope&quot;. He points out however that modern [[anthropological]] theories &quot;do not merely proclaim the inherent universal equality of all people [as] human beings; they also stress the ''equivalence'' of all human cultures.&quot; (emphasis in original) He continues that &quot;there are no inferior and superior people or cultures but only different, ''other'', ones.&quot; He concludes that the concept of chosenness entails [[ethnocentrism]], &quot;which does not go hand in hand with otherness, that is, with unconditional respect of otherness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ze’ev Levy, ''Judaism and Chosenness: On Some Controversial Aspects from Spinoza to Contemporary Jewish Thought'', in {{cite book|editor=Daniel H. Frank|title=A People apart: chosenness and ritual in Jewish philosophical thought|year=1993|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791416310}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people{{Who|date=April 2011}} have claimed that Judaism's chosen people concept is racist because it implies that Jews are superior to non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;

*Brown, Wesley, ''Christian Perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict'', p 66
*Jacob, Jonathan, ''Israel: a divided Promised Land'', p 69
&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the ADL and other authorities{{Vague|date=April 2011}} assert that the concept of chosen people  within Judaism has nothing to do with racial superiority, but rather is a description of the special relationship between God and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;
*According to a report by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], &quot;By selectively citing various passages from the Talmud and Midrash, polemicists have sought to demonstrate that Judaism espouses hatred for non-Jews (and specifically for Christians), and promotes obscenity, sexual perversion, and other immoral behavior. To make these passages serve their purposes, these polemicists frequently mistranslate them or cite them out of context (wholesale fabrication of passages is not unknown)...&quot;

* In distorting the normative meanings of rabbinic texts, anti-Talmud writers frequently remove passages from their textual and historical contexts. Even when they present their citations accurately, they judge the passages based on contemporary moral standards, ignoring the fact that the majority of these passages were composed close to two thousand years ago by people living in cultures radically different from our own. They are thus able to ignore Judaism's long history of social progress and paint it instead as a primitive and parochial religion.

* Those who attack the Talmud frequently cite ancient rabbinic sources without noting subsequent developments in Jewish thought, and without making a good-faith effort to consult with contemporary Jewish authorities who can explain the role of these sources in normative Jewish thought and practice. - from ''[http://www.adl.org/presrele/asus_12/the_talmud.pdf The Talmud in Anti-Semitic Polemics]'' [[Anti-Defamation League]]. February 2003 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even as the Jew is moved by his private Sinaitic Covenant with God to embody and preserve the teachings of the Torah, he is committed to the belief that all mankind, of whatever color or creed, is &quot;in His image&quot; and is possessed of an inherent human dignity and worthiness. Man's singularity is derived from the breath &quot;He [God] breathed into his nostrils at the moment of creation&quot; (Genesis 2:7). Thus, we do share in the universal historical experience, and God's providential concern does embrace all of humanity. - ''Man of Faith in the Modern World'', p. 74&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Such misuse of Talmud by the Soviet authorities was exposed in a 1984 hearing record before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations in the US Congress concerning the [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Soviet Jewry]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;This vicious anti-Semitic canard, frequently repeated by other Soviet writers and officials, is based upon the malicious notion that the &quot;Chosen People&quot; of the Torah and Talmud preaches &quot;superiority over other peoples&quot;, as well as exclusivity. This was, of course, the principal theme of the notorious Tsarist ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].'' - from Soviet Jewry: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations, United States Congress. House. Committee on Foreign Affairs. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 1984. p.56 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Chaparral1.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Chaparral, Santa Ynez Mountains, near Santa Barbara, California]]
'''Chaparral''' is a [[shrubland]] or [[Heath (habitat)|heathland]] [[plant community]] found primarily in the U.S. state of [[California]] and in the northern portion of the [[Baja California peninsula]], [[Mexico]]. It is shaped by a [[Mediterranean climate]] (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and wildfire, having summer drought tolerant plants with hard [[sclerophyllous]] evergreen leaves, as contrasted with the associated soft leaved, [[drought deciduous]], [[scrubland|scrub]] community of [[Coastal sage scrub]], found below the chaparral biome.  Chaparral covers 5% of the state of California, and associated Mediterranean scrubland an additional 3.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;calacademy.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/california_hotspot/habitat_mediterranean_shrublands.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Chaparral is characterized by frequent fires, with intervals ranging between a few years to a hundred years.  Before fires, mature chaparral is characterized by nearly impenetrable dense thickets (except the more open chaparral of the desert).  The plants are highly flammable.  They grow as woody shrubs with hard and small leaves, are non-leaf dropping ([[deciduous|non-deciduous]]), and are drought tolerant.  After a the first rains following a fire, the landscape is dominated by soft leaved non-woody annual plants, known as fire followers, which die back with the summer dry period.  

Cismontane chaparral (&quot;this side of the mountain&quot;) refers to chaparral growing on the coastal side of large mountain ranges, such as west of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] or [[San Jacinto Mountains]] east of the San Diego area, or south of the [[Transverse ranges]] north of the Los Angeles area, while transmontane (&quot;the other side of the mountain&quot;) chaparral refers to the shrubland community growing in the [[rainshadow]] of these ranges, which has a [[desert]], not Mediterranean climate, and is referred to as [[Desert chaparral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;A Natural History of California, Allan A. Schoenerr, Figure 8.9 - 8.10, Table 8.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;County of San Diego Department of Planning and Land Use Multiple Species Conservation Program, [http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/dplu/mscp/docs/Biodiversity/handoutvegcomm14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The foothills west of the Sierra Nevada may be covered with cismontain chaparral, and have a hot and subhumid climate.&lt;ref&gt;Ecological subregions of California:  Sierra Nevada Foothills.  U.S. Department of Agriculture; U.S. Forest Service. [http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m261f.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some classify cismontane chaparral further into upper and lower chaparral.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Similar plant communities are found in the four other Mediterranean climate regions around the world, including the [[Mediterranean Basin]] (where it is known as [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]]), central [[Chile]] (where it is called [[Chilean Matorral|matorral]]), [[South Africa]]n Cape Region (known there as [[fynbos]]), and in Western and Southern [[Australia]].  According to the California Academy of Sciences, Mediterranean shrubland contains more than 20% of the world's plant diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;calacademy.org&quot;/&gt;  The word ''chaparral'' is a [[loanword|loan word]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The Spanish word comes from the word ''chaparro'', which means both small and dwarf evergreen oak, which itself comes from the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''txapar'', with the same meaning.

[[Conservation International]] and other conservation organizations consider the chaparral to be a [[biological community]] with a [[diversity|large number of different species]] that is under threat by human activity, know as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/california_floristic/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===California desert chaparral===
'''Desert chaparral''' (sometimes called [[transmontane chaparral]] - &quot;that side of the mountain&quot; chaparral; but for some, transmontane chaparral refers only to chapparal in the western [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevadas]], east of the [[California Coast Ranges]])  is the [[desert]] shrubland [[habitat]]s and [[chaparral]] [[Plant community|plant communities]] growing on the desert slopes of California's [[Transverse ranges|Transverse]] mountain ranges (north of the [[Los Angeles basin]]; Angeles Crest Mountains) and [[Peninsular ranges|Peninsular]] mountain ranges (formed as an extension of the Baja California [[peninsula]]), separating inland eastern [[Deserts of California]] from coastal southern California.&lt;ref name=NHC&gt;''A Natural History of California'', Allan A. Schoenherr, pp.8-9, 357, 327, ISBN 978-0-520-06922-0&lt;/ref&gt;  It is distinguished from cismontain (this side of the mountain) [[chapparal]] on the coastal side of the mountains, which experiences higher winter rainfall, but still at desert levels.  Chaparral grows in [[Mediterranean climate]]s characterized by hot dry summers and cool, moist winters, although desert chaparral experiences less winter rainfall than cismontain chaparral. Chaparral is characterized by small hard ([[sclerophyllic]]) evergreen (do not drop; non[[deciduous]]) leaves. It grows above California's desert [[cactus scrub]] plant community, and the below [[Pinyon pine|pinyon]]-[[juniper]] woodland. It is further distinguished from deiciduous [[sagebrush scrub]] of the above the [[pinyon-juniper woodlands]] on the same side of the Peninsular ranges.

California's deserts are created by rainfall blowing in from the ocean being absorbed by Peninsular Ranges on the east, and Transverse Ranges to the south which block the [[Pacific Ocean]] sourced rain clouds.

It typically grows on the northern lower (3,500–4500 ft. elevation) mountain slopes of the Transverse Ranges (which run east and west above Los Angeles) and on the eastern lower (2,500–3,500 ft.) eastern slopes of the Peninsular Ranges (running south to north from Baja California to the Transverse Ranges).&lt;ref&gt;''A Natural History of California'', Allan A. Schoenherr, pp.327, Figure 8.9, ISBN 978-0-520-06922-0&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be found in higher elevation [[sky island]]s in the interior of the deserts, such as in the upper [[New York Mountains]] within the [[Mojave National Preserve]] in the Mojave Desert.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Desert chaparral is a regional subset of the [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]] with some plant species from the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].

Unlike cismontain chaparral, which forms dense, impenatrable stands of plants, desert chaparral is open, with only about 50% of the ground covered.&lt;ref=NHC p.357/&gt;  Individual shrubs can reach up to ten feet in height.

===California desert chaparral distribution===
The California desert chaparral is found in the rain shadow deserts of the:
*[[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] created [[Great Basin Desert]] and northern Mojave Desert
*[[Transverse ranges]] created [[Mojave Desert]]
*[[Peninsular ranges]] created [[Colorado Desert]] and [[Yuha Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;A Natural History of California, Allan A. Schoenerr, Figure 8.9 - 8.10, Table 8.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;County of San Diego Department of Planning and Land Use Multiple Species Conservation Program, [http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/dplu/mscp/docs/Biodiversity/handoutvegcomm14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The chaparral and wildfires==
The Chaparral is a coastal biome with hot dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The Chaparral area gets about {{convert|38|–|100|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year. This makes the chaparral most vulnerable to fire in the late summer and fall.

The chaparral ecosystem as a whole requires periodic fires to survive, creating a conflict with human development in the area. Before a major fire, typical chaparral plant communities are dominated by [[manzanita]], chamise (also called greasewood or ''[[Adenostoma fasciculatum]]''), and ''[[Ceanothus]]'' species, [[Toyon]], which can sometimes be interspersed with [[Scrub Oak|scrub oak]]s, and other drought-resistant shrubs with hard ([[sclerophyllous]]) leaves which resprout (see [[resprouter]]) from underground [[burl]]s after a fire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Before a fire, some chaparral plant communities may grow so dense and tall that it becomes difficult for large animals and humans to penetrate, but may be teeming with smaller fauna in the understory. Many chaparral plant species require some fire cue (heat, smoke, or charred wood, and chemical changes in the soil following fires) for germination. Others, such as annual and herbaceous species like ''[[Phacelia]]'' require fires to allow sunlight to reach them, and are known as [[fire follower]]s{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.  During the time shortly after a fire, chaparral communities may contain soft-leaved herbaceuous annual plants dominating the community for the first few years until the burl resprouts and seedlings of chaparral perennials create an overstory, blocking the sunlight from other plants in the community. When the overstory regrows, seeds of annuals and smaller plants may lie dormant until the next fire creates the conditions required for germination. Mid-sized plants such as ''Ceonothus'' fix nitrogen, while others cannot, which together with the need for exposure to the sun creates a dependency of the entire community on fires.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Because of the hot, dry conditions that exist in the California summer and fall, chaparral is one of the most fire-prone plant communities in North America. Some fires are caused by lightning, but these are usually during periods of high humidity and low winds and are easily controlled. Nearly all of the very large wildfires are caused by humans during periods of very hot, dry easterly [[Santa Ana winds]]. These man-made fires are commonly caused by power line failures, vehicle fires and collisions, sparks from machinery, arson, or campfires.

==Controversy==
There are two assumptions relating to California chaparral fire regimes that appear to have caused considerable confusion and controversy within the fields of wildfire and land management: first, that older stands of chaparral become “[[senescent]]” or “[[decadent]]” implying that fire is necessary for the plants to remain healthy,&lt;ref&gt;(Hanes 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; and second, that [[wildfire suppression]] policies have allowed dead chaparral to accumulate unnaturally, creating ample fuel for large fires.&lt;ref&gt;(Minnich 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The perspective that older chaparral is unhealthy or unproductive may have originated during the 1940s when studies were conducted measuring the amount of forage available to deer populations in chaparral stands{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} . However, according to recent studies, California chaparral is extraordinarily resilient to very long periods without fire &lt;ref&gt;(Keeley, Pfaff, and Safford 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to maintain productive growth throughout pre-fire conditions.&lt;ref&gt;(Hubbard 1986, Larigauderie et al. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Seeds of many chaparral plants actually require 30 years or more worth of accumulated leaf litter before they will successfully germinate (e.g. scrub oak: ''[[Quercus berberidifolia]]'', toyon: ''[[Heteromeles arbutifolia]]'', holly-leafed cherry: ''[[Prunus ilicifolia]]''). When intervals between fires drop below 10 to 15 years, many chaparral species are eliminated and the system is typically replaced by non-native, weedy grassland.&lt;ref&gt;(Haidinger and Keeley 1993, Keeley 1995, Zedler 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that older chaparral is responsible for causing large fires was originally proposed in the 1980s by comparing wildfires in [[Baja California]] and southern California{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} . It was suggested that fire suppression activities in southern California allowed more fuel to accumulate, which in turn led to larger fires{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} (in Baja, fires often burn without active suppression efforts{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}). This is similar to the argument that fire suppression in western United States has allowed [[Ponderosa Pine]] forests to become “overstocked”.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In the past, surface-fires burned through these forests at intervals of anywhere between 4 and 36 years, clearing out the understory and creating a more ecologically balanced system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, chaparral has a crown-fire regime, meaning fires consume the entire system whenever they burn.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In one study, a detailed analysis of historical fire data concluded that fire suppression activities have failed to exclude fire from southern California chaparral as they have in Ponderosa Pine forests.&lt;ref&gt;(Keeley et al. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2010}} In addition, the number of fires is increasing in step with population growth. Chaparral stand age does not have a significant correlation to its tendency to burn.&lt;ref&gt;(Moritz et al. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Low humidity, low fuel moisture, and high winds appear to be the primary factors in determining when a chaparral stand burns.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}{{clarify|date=October 2010}}

[[Image:Vonstetinalightning.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Clipper Ship [[Lightning (clipper)|''Lightning'']]&quot; by Bruce Von Stetina- an American clipper ship of the 1850s]]
[[File:Unidentified tall ship near Cape Horn - Nla.pic-vn3299637-v.jpg|thumb|right|Many clippers sailed [[Clipper route|around Cape Horn]]]] 

A '''clipper''' was a very fast [[sailing ship]] of the 19th century that had three or more [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and a [[square rig]]. They were generally narrow for their length, could carry limited bulk freight, small by later 19th century standards, and had a large total [[sail]] area. Clipper ships were mostly made in British and American [[shipyard]]s, though [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its [[colony|colonies]] in the east, in trans-[[Atlantic]] trade, and the [[New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] route round [[Cape Horn]] during the [[California Gold Rush]].  [[Dutch clipper]]s were built beginning in 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to [[Java]].

Clipper bows were distinctively wide and lightly raked forward, which allowed them to rapidly clip through the waves. The cutting notion is also suggested by the other class of vessel built for speed, the [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]]. Many people consider the era of clipper ships the &quot;[[Golden age of sail]]ing&quot;.

The boom years of the Clipper Ship Era began in 1843 as a result of the growing demand for a more rapid delivery of tea from China. It continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851, and ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt;

== Origin of the nautical term &quot;clipper&quot;==
[[File:&quot;Sea Witch&quot; opium clipper 1831.jpg‎|thumb|right|200px|&quot;Opium clipper&quot; ''Water Witch'', a British ship built in 1831]]

The term '''&quot;clipper&quot;''' most likely derives from the verb &quot;clip&quot;, which in former times meant, among other things, to run or fly swiftly. [[John Dryden|Dryden]], the English poet, used the word &quot;clip&quot; to describe the swift flight of a falcon in the 17th century when he said &quot;And, with her eagerness the quarry missed, Straight flies at check, and '''clips''' it down the wind.&quot; The ships appeared  to clip along the ocean water. The term &quot;clip&quot; became synonymous with &quot;speed&quot; and was also applied to fast [[horse]]s and sailing ships. &quot;To clip it,&quot; and &quot;going at a good clip,&quot; are familiar expressions to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt; 

While the first application of the term &quot;clipper&quot; in a nautical sense is by no means certain, it seems to have had an American origin when applied to the [[Baltimore clipper]]s of the late 18th century. When these vessels of a new model were built, which were intended to &quot;clip&quot; over the waves rather than plough through them, the improved type of craft became known as &quot;clippers&quot; because of their speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt;

In England the nautical term &quot;clipper&quot; appeared a little later. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says its earliest quotation for &quot;clipper&quot; is from 1830. This does not mean, however, that little British opium clippers from prior to 1830 were not called &quot;opium clippers&quot; just as they are today. Cutler reports the first newspaper appearance was in 1835, and by then the term was apparently familiar. An undated painting of the British ''Water Witch'' built in 1831 is labeled ''OPIUM CLIPPER &quot;WATER WITCH&quot;'' so the term had at least passed into common usage during the time that this ship sailed.

==Brief History==
[[File:Sovereignoftheseasdockedphoto.jpg|thumb|right|Clipper [[Sovereign of the Seas (clipper)|''Sovereign of the Seas'']] set the record for World's Fastest Sailing Ship in 1854]]
[[File:Hornetclippership.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hornet (clipper)|''Hornet'']] - an American clipper ship of the 1850s]]
[[File:Portrait of an American Clipper Ship.jpeg|thumb|right|American clipper ship, painted in typical style by Chinese artist]]
The first ships to which the term &quot;clipper&quot; appears to have been applied were the [[Baltimore clipper]]s. Baltimore clippers were [[topsail]] [[schooner]]s developed in [[Chesapeake Bay]] before the [[American Revolution]], and which reached their zenith between 1795 and 1815.  They were small, rarely exceeding 200 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons OM]], and modelled after French luggers.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot;&gt;''THE CLIPPER SHIP ERA'', Clarke, Arthur H., 1912&lt;/ref&gt; Some were lightly armed in the [[War of 1812]], sailing under [[Letter of Marque|Letters of Marque and Reprisal]], when the type—exemplified by ''Chasseur'', launched at [[Fells Point, Baltimore]] in 1814 became known for her incredible speed; the deep [[draft (hull)|draft]] enabled the Baltimore clipper to sail [[Points of sail#Close hauled|close to the wind]].&lt;ref&gt;Villiers 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Clippers, running the British blockade of Baltimore, came to be recognized for speed rather than cargo space.

Fast speed was required for the Chinese opium trade between England, India and China. Small, sharp-bowed British vessels were the result. An early example, which is today known as an opium clipper, was the ''Transit'' of 1819. She was followed by many more.&lt;ref name=&quot;index&quot;&gt;[http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/becites/genealogy/immigrant/87062528.idx.html#s Fast Sailing Ships: Their Design and Construction, 1775-1875, MacGregor, David R., 1988, Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile Baltimore Clippers still continued to be built, and were built specifically for the China opium trade running opium between India and China, a trade that only became unprofitable for American shipowners in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=993 The Voyage of the ''Frolic'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt at building a larger swift vessel was in America with the ''Ann McKim'', 494 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons OM]], built on the enlarged lines of a Baltimore clipper, with sharply raked [[stem (ship)|stem]], [[transom (nautical)|counter stern]] and square rig. She was built in Baltimore in 1833 by Kennard &amp; Williamson.&lt;ref&gt;Dear, I.C.B., &amp; Kemp, Peter, eds. ''Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea'' (Oxford University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Website [http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Clippers/Ann_McKim(1833).html &quot;bruzelius.info&quot;]. Accessed 30 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ann McKim was the first large clipper ship ever constructed, it cannot be said that she founded the clipper ship era, or even that she directly influenced shipbuilders, since no other ship was built like her; but she may have suggested the clipper design in vessels of ship rig. She did, however, influence the building of the ''[[Rainbow (clipper)|Rainbow]]'' in 1845, the first [[Extreme Clipper|extreme clipper]] ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt;

In [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], the shipbuilders [[Alexander Hall and Sons]] developed the &quot;Aberdeen&quot; clipper bow in the late 1830s: the first was the ''[[Scottish Maid]]'' launched in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aberdeenships.com/sb_alexander_hall.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Scottish Maid'', 150 tons OM, was the first British clipper ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt; &quot;''Scottish Maid'' was intended for the Aberdeen-London trade, where speed was crucial to compete with steamships. The Hall brothers tested various hulls in a water tank and found the clipper design most effective. The design was influenced by tonnage regulations. Tonnage measured a ship's cargo capacity and was used to calculate tax and harbour dues. The new 1836 regulations measured depth and breadth with length measured at half midship depth. Extra length above this level was tax-free and became a feature of clippers. ''Scottish Maid'' proved swift and reliable and the design was widely copied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aberdeenships.com/related.asp?index=27234&amp;shipid=100020 Aberdeen Built Ships]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest British clipper ships were built for trade amongst the British Isles. Then followed the vast clipper trade of tea, opium, spices and other goods from the Far East to Europe, and the ships became known as &quot;tea clippers&quot;.

From 1839, larger American clipper ships started to be built beginning with the ''Akbar'', 650 tons OM, in 1839, and including the 1844 built [[Houqua (clipper)|Houqua]], 581 tons OM. These larger vessels were built predominantly for use in the China tea trade and known as &quot;tea clippers&quot;. Smaller clipper vessels also continued to be built predominantly for the China opium trade and known as &quot;opium clippers&quot; such as the 1842 built ''[[Ariel (clipper)|Ariel]]'', 100 tons OM.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt;

Then in 1845 the ''[[Rainbow (clipper)|Rainbow]]'', 757 tons OM, the first [[Extreme Clipper|extreme clipper]] was launched in New York. These American clippers were larger vessels designed to sacrifice cargo capacity for speed. They had a bow lengthened above the water, a drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, and the greatest breadth further aft. Extreme clippers were built in the period 1845 to 1855. From 1851 or earlier another type of clipper ship was also being built in American shipyards, the [[medium clipper]]. The medium clipper, though still very fast, had comparatively more allowance for cargo. After 1854 extreme clippers were replaced in American shipbuilding yards by medium clippers.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt; 

Clipper ships largely ceased being built in American shipyards in 1859 when, unlike the earlier boom years, only 4 clipper ships were built. That is except for a small number built in the 1860s, and the last American clipper ship from the East Boston shipyard of [[Donald McKay]] in 1869, the ''Glory of the Seas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Clippers/Builders.html Clipper ships built in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time from 1859 British clipper ships continued to be built. Earlier British clipper ships had become known as extreme clippers, and were considered to be &quot;as sharp as the American&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;index&quot; /&gt; built ships. From 1859 a new design was developed for British clipper ships that was nothing like the American clippers. These ships built from 1859 continued to be called extreme clippers. The new design had a sleek graceful appearance, less sheer, less freeboard, lower bulwarks, and smaller breadth. They were built for the China tea trade and began with the ''Falcon'' in 1859,  and finished with the last ships built in 1870. It is estimated that 25 to 30 of these ships were built, and no more than 4-5 per year. The earlier ships were made from wood, though some were made from iron, just as some British clippers had been made from iron prior to 1859. In 1863 the first tea clippers of composite construction were brought out, combining the best of both worlds. Composite clippers had the strength of iron spars with wooden hulls, and [[copper sheathing]] could be added to prevent the fouling that occurred on iron hulls.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt; 

After 1869 with the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] that allowed competition with steam vessels, the tea trade then collapsed for clippers. From 1870 the clipper trade increasingly focused on trade and the carrying of immigrants between England and Australia and New Zealand, a trade that had begun earlier with the Australian Gold Rush in the 1850s. British-built clipper ships were used for this trade, as were many American-built ships which were sold to British owners. Even in the 1880s, sailing ships were still the main carriers of cargoes to and from Australia and New Zealand. Eventually, however, even this trade became unprofitable, and the aging clipper fleet became unseaworthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;clark&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Clipper Ship Southern Cross Leaving Boston Harbor 1851.jpeg|thumb|right|Clipper ship ''Southern Cross'' leaving Boston Harbor, 1851, by [[Fitz Hugh Lane]]]]
The most significant clippers were the China clippers, also called Tea clippers or Opium clippers, designed to ply the trade routes between [[Europe]] and the [[East Indies]]. The last example of these still in reasonable condition is ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', preserved in [[dry dock]] at [[Greenwich]], [[United Kingdom]].

Before the early 18th century, the East India Company paid for its tea mainly in silver. However, when the price of silver rose, the East India Company began to manufacture a product that was desired by the Chinese as much as tea was by the British: opium. This had a significant influence on both India and China. Opium was also imported into Britain and was not prohibited because it was thought to be medically beneficial. Laudanum, which was made from opium was also used as a pain killer, to induce sleep and to suppress anxiety. The famous literary opium addicts [[Thomas De Quincey]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Wilkie Collins]] also took it for its pleasurable effects. The Limehouse area in London was notorious for its opium dens, many of which catered for Chinese sailors as well as English addicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/conMediaFile.3989/The-opium-clipper-Water-Witch-%281831%29.html The Opium Clippers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clippers were built for seasonal trades such as tea, where an early cargo was more valuable, or for passenger routes. The small, fast ships were ideally suited to low-volume, high-profit goods, such as [[tea]], [[opium]], [[spice]]s, people, and mail. The return could be spectacular. The ''[[Challenger (clipper)|Challenger]]'' returned from [[Shanghai]] with ''&quot;the most valuable cargo of tea and silk ever to be laden in one bottom&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = State Street Trust Co.  | last = Forbes | first = Allan | coauthors = Ralph Mason Eastman, State Street Trust Company (Boston, Mass.) | title = Yankee ship sailing cards...  | year = 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition among the clippers was public and fierce, with their times recorded in the newspapers. The ships had short-expected lifetimes and rarely outlasted two decades of use before they were broken up for salvage. Given their speed and maneuverability, clippers frequently mounted [[cannon]] or [[carronade]]s and were used for [[pirate|piracy]], [[privateer]]ing, [[smuggling]], or interdiction service.

The last China clippers were acknowledged as the fastest sail vessels. When fully rigged and riding a tradewind, they had peak average speeds over {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}. [[The Great Tea Race of 1866]] showcased their speed.  China clippers are also the fastest commercial sailing vessels ever made. Their speeds have been exceeded many times by modern [[yacht]]s, but never by a commercial sail vessel. Only the fastest [[windjammer]]s could attain similar speeds.
{{quotation|
There are many ways of judging the speed of a ship: by knots, by day's runs, by port-to-port records.  Judged by any test, the American clippers were supreme.

[[Donald McKay|Donald McKay's]] ''[[Sovereign of the Seas (clipper)|Sovereign of the Seas]]''  reported the highest speed ever achieved by a sailing ship - {{convert|22|kn|km/h}}, made while running her easting down to Australia in 1854.  (John Griffiths' first clipper, the ''Rainbow'', had a top speed of 14 knots...) There are eleven other instances of a ship's logging {{convert|18|kn|km/h}} or over.  Ten of these were recorded by American clippers...
 Besides the breath-taking {{convert|465|nmi|km|sing=on}} day's run of the ''[[Champion of the Seas]]'', there are thirteen other cases of a ship's sailing over {{convert|400|nmi|km}} in 24 hours...

And with few exceptions all the port-to-port sailing records are held by the American clippers.
| Lyon, Jane D | p. 138 ''Clipper Ships and Captains'' (1962) New York: American Heritage Publishing }}

The 24h record of the ''Champion of the Seas'' wasn't broken until 1984 (by a multihull), or 2001 (by another monohull).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clipper Ship Trading Cards==
[[Image:Free trade.jpg|thumb|right|''Clipper ship sailing card for the &quot;Free Trade&quot;'', printed by Nesbitt &amp; Co., NY, early 1860s]]

Departures of American clipper ships, mostly from [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], were advertised by clipper ship sailing cards, and represented the first pronounced use of color in American advertising art.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Decline==

Decline in the use of clippers started with the economic slump following the [[Panic of 1857]] and continued with the gradual introduction of the [[steamship]]. Although clippers could be much faster than early steamships, they depended on the vagaries of the wind, while steamers could keep to a schedule. The ''steam clipper'' was developed around this time, and had auxiliary steam engines which could be used in the absence of wind. An example was [[Royal Charter (ship)|''Royal Charter'']], built in 1857 and wrecked on the coast of [[Anglesey]] in 1859. The final blow was the [[Suez Canal]], opened in 1869, which provided a great shortcut for steamships between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], but was difficult for sailing ships to use. With the absence of the tea trade, some clippers began operating in the wool trade, between Britain and Australia.

Although many clipper ships were built in the mid-19th century, ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' was, perhaps until recently, the only survivor. ''[[Falls of Clyde (ship)|Falls of Clyde]]'' is a well-preserved example of a more conservatively designed, slower contemporary of the clippers, which was built for general freight in 1878. Other surviving examples of clippers of the era are less well preserved, for example the oldest surviving clipper [[City of Adelaide (1864)|''City of Adelaide'']]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityofadelaide.org.au/condensed-history.html City of Adelaide website - Condensed History]&lt;/ref&gt; (a.k.a. S.V. ''Carrick'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of the S.V. Carrick|author=Jim Carrick|publisher=History Scotland magazine|url=http://www.historyscotland.com/features/svcarrick.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first and second World Wars, several [[battleship]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s were built with a &quot;clipper bow&quot; for improved hydrodynamic efficiency. The clipper bow on carriers was an American peculiarity, Japanese ships did not feature it and British ships had the similar but differently-shaped &quot;hurricane bow,&quot; whose purpose was, like the clipper bow, to improve hydrodynamic efficiency and, unlike the clipper bow, protect the hangar deck from spray.
[[File:Museum of Science, Boston, MA - IMG 3197.JPG|thumb|right|Diorama of clipper ships under construction]]

==Modern clipper ships==

In 2000, two new clippers were built: ''[[Stad Amsterdam]]'' and ''[[Cisne Branco]]'' (Brazilian Navy). They are not replicas of any one ship, but an attempt to combine what their builders consider the &quot;best&quot; qualities of clipper ships.

{{quotation|
“They [clipper ships] still hold their own for long sea voyages.

There is a limit to the use of steam, and it is reached when the distance to be travelled makes the cost of coal and the space it occupies greater than the value of the cargo will warrant.

Until some new motive power replaces steam, or steam is replaced by the use of petroleum or other concentrated fuel, the clipper still has an occupation, and the hearts of all old-time skippers will be gladdened by the sight of her white wings upon the seas.”

His Scottish father was manager of the Midland Bank's Wembley branch.&lt;ref&gt;''What Became of the Bank Manager?'', BBC Radio 4, 22 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Anderson attended [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] where, from 1974 to 1975, he was President of [[Footlights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footlights.org/1970.html |title=Footlights: Alumni |accessdate=2007-07-29 |publisher=Cambridge Footlights}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Admission to practice law|called to the bar]] at the [[Middle Temple]] in 1976 and became a practising [[barrister]], specialising in [[criminal law]].

==Career==
===Television===
Anderson was involved in the fledgling [[alternative comedy]] scene in the early 1980s and was the first act to come on stage at [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]] when it opened in 1979.&lt;ref name=Radio2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/comedy/cliveanderson.shtml#biog |title=Clive Anderson's Chat Room |accessdate=2007-07-29 |publisher=BBC Radio 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his name as host of the improvised television comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', which ran for 10 series.&lt;ref name=TVbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uktv.co.uk/g2/item/aid/528014 |title=UKTV G2 Stars: Profile: Clive Anderson |accessdate=2007-07-29 |publisher=UKTV Interactive Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson hosted his own chat-show, ''Clive Anderson Talks Back'', on [[Channel 4]], which ran for 10 series. Anderson moved to the BBC in 1996 and the show's name changed to ''Clive Anderson All Talk'' and was aired on [[BBC One]]. In one famous incident in 1997, Anderson interviewed the [[Bee Gees]], and throughout the interview he repeatedly joked about their life and career, ultimately prompting them to walk out.&lt;ref name=TVbio/&gt; Anderson once had a glass of water poured over his head by a perturbed [[Richard Branson]]. He also famously asked [[Jeffrey Archer]], &quot;Is there no beginning to your talents?&quot; Archer retorted that &quot;The old jokes are always the best,&quot; for Anderson to reply &quot;Yes, I've read your books!&quot; The last series of ''Clive Anderson All Talk'' aired in 2001.

He has been a frequent participant on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', notching up ten appearances in total. He has also frequently appeared on ''[[QI]]''. In 2007, he featured as a regular panelist on the [[ITV]] comedy show ''[[News Knight]]''.
One of his most memorable exchanges on ''[[Have I Got News for You|HIGNFY]]'' occurred when he scathingly joked to fellow guest [[Piers Morgan]] that the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' was now, thanks to Morgan (then its editor), almost as good as ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''. When asked by Morgan, &quot;What do you know about editing newspapers?&quot;, he swiftly replied, &quot;About as much as you do.&quot;

As a journalist for the BBC, he travelled around the world looking at problems &quot;in out-of-the-way places,&quot; though mostly arguing about whether they could film there. ''Our Man in...'' featured episodes on [[ecotage|monkeywrenching]] in American logging and [[Advance-fee fraud|419 scams]] in [[Nigeria]].

In 2005 he presented the short-lived [[Celador]] [[panel game]], ''[[Back in the Day (Channel 4 program)|Back in the Day]]'' for [[Channel 4]].

In January 2008, he appeared on the second episode of ''[[Thank God You're Here (UK TV series)|Thank God You're Here]]'' and won.

On 25 February 2008, he started presenting ''[[Brainbox Challenge]]'', a new game show, for [[BBC Two]].

In 2008, he presented a reality TV talent show-themed television series produced by the BBC entitled [[Maestro (TV series)|Maestro]], starring eight celebrities who are &quot;famous amateurs with a passion for classical music.&quot;

In 2009, Anderson was the television host of the BBC's [[Last Night of the Proms]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stanley Pons]] in March 1989 where they reported anomalous heat production (&quot;excess heat&quot;) of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes. They further reported measuring small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts, including [[neutrons]] and [[tritium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} (&quot;It is inconceivable that this [amount of heat] could be due to anything but nuclear processes...

==History==
=== {{anchor|Before the Fleischmann-Pons experiment}}Before the Fleischmann&amp;ndash;Pons experiment ===
The ability of palladium to absorb hydrogen was recognized as early as the nineteenth century by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989_7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|US DOE|1989|ref=CITEREFDOE1989|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, two Austrian born scientists, [[Friedrich Paneth]] and [[Kurt Peters (chemist)|Kurt Peters]], originally reported the transformation of hydrogen into helium by spontaneous nuclear catalysis when hydrogen was absorbed by finely divided palladium at room temperature. However, the authors later retracted that report, acknowledging that the helium they measured was due to background from the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989_7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paneth and Peters|1926|ref=CITEREFPanethPeters1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Swedish scientist J. Tandberg stated that he had fused hydrogen into helium in an [[electrolytic cell]] with palladium electrodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989_7&quot;/&gt; On the basis of his work, he applied for a Swedish patent for &quot;a method to produce helium and useful reaction energy&quot;. After [[deuterium]] was discovered in 1932, Tandberg continued his experiments with [[heavy water]]. Due to Paneth and Peters' retraction, Tandberg's patent application was eventually denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989_7&quot;/&gt; His application for a patent in 1927 was denied as he could not explain the physical process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyteknik.se/popular_teknik/smatt_gott/article3092779.ece Kall fusion redan på 1920-talet], Ny Teknik, Kaianders Sempler, 9 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;cold fusion&quot; was used as early as 1956 in a New York Times article about [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis W. Alvarez]]' work on [[muon-catalyzed fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurence|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[E. Paul Palmer]] of [[Brigham Young University]] also used the term &quot;cold fusion&quot; in 1986 in an investigation of &quot;geo-fusion&quot;, the possible existence of fusion in a [[planetary core]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kowalski_2004_IIA2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kowalski|2004|loc=II.A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Fleischmann-Pons experiment}}Fleischmann&amp;ndash;Pons experiment===
==== Events preceding announcement ====

[[Image:Cold fusion electrolysis.svg|thumb|Electrolysis cell schematic]][[Martin Fleischmann]] of the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Stanley Pons]] of the [[University of Utah]] hypothesized that the high compression ratio and mobility of [[deuterium]] that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1989_301&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the [[heavy water]] being renewed at intervals.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1989_301&quot;/&gt; Some deuterium was thought to be accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1990&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fleischmann et al.|1990|ref=CITEREFFleischmann1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30&amp;nbsp;°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C without changes in the input power.  These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1990&quot;/&gt;

In 1988, Fleischmann and Pons applied to the [[United States Department of Energy]] for funding towards a larger series of experiments. Up to this point they had been funding their experiments using a small device built with $100,000 [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LADN_092489&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grant proposal was turned over for [[peer review]], and one of the reviewers was [[Steven E. Jones]] of [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LADN_092489&quot;/&gt; Jones had worked for some time on [[muon-catalyzed fusion]], a known method of inducing nuclear fusion without high temperatures, and had written an article on the topic entitled &quot;Cold nuclear fusion&quot; that had been published in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in July 1987. Fleischmann and Pons and co-workers met with Jones and co-workers on occasion in [[Utah]] to share research and techniques. During this time, Fleischmann and Pons described their experiments as generating considerable &quot;excess energy&quot;, in the sense that it could not be explained by [[chemical reaction]]s alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1990&quot;/&gt; They felt that such a discovery could bear significant commercial value and would be entitled to [[patent|patent protection]]. Jones, however, was measuring neutron flux, which was not of commercial interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;LADN_092489&quot;/&gt; In order to avoid problems in the future, the teams appeared to agree to simultaneously publish their results, although their accounts of their March 6 meeting differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewenstein_1994_8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lewenstein|1994|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Announcement====
In mid-March 1989, both research teams were ready to publish their findings, and Fleischmann and Jones had agreed to meet at an airport on March 24 to send their papers to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' via [[FedEx]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewenstein_1994_8&quot;/&gt; Fleischmann and Pons, however, pressured by the University of Utah which wanted to establish priority on the discovery,&lt;ref name=&quot;utah patent&quot;/&gt; broke their apparent agreement, submitting their paper to the ''Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry'' on March 11, and disclosing their work via a press conference on March 23.&lt;ref name=&quot;LADN_092489&quot;/&gt;  Jones, upset, faxed in his paper to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' after the press conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewenstein_1994_8&quot;/&gt;

Fleischmann and Pons' announcement drew wide media attention.&lt;ref name=Brooks&gt;For example, in 1989, the ''Economist'' editorialized that the cold fusion &quot;affair&quot; was &quot;exactly what science should be about.&quot; {{Citation|first=JK|last=Footlick|title=Truth and Consequences: how colleges and universities meet public crises|isbn=9780897749701|page=51|location=Phoenix|publisher=Oryx Press|year=1997}} as cited in {{Citation|first=M|last=Brooks|title=[[13 Things That Don't Make Sense]]|isbn=978-1-60751-666-8|page=67|location=New York|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1986 discovery of [[high-temperature superconductivity]] had caused the scientific community to be more open to revelations of unexpected scientific results that could have huge economic repercussions and that could be replicated reliably even if they had not been predicted by current theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=57–60}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold fusion was proposing the counter-intuitive idea that a nuclear reaction could be caused to occur inside a crystal structure, and many scientists immediately thought of the [[Mössbauer effect]], since it was an example of this happening. Its discovery 30 years earlier had also been unexpected though quickly replicated and explained within the existing physics framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodstein_1994&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of a new clean source of energy came at a crucial time: everyone still remembered the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the problems caused by oil dependence, anthropomorphic [[global warming]] was starting to become notorious, the [[anti-nuclear movement]] was labeling nuclear power plants as dangerous and getting them closed, people had in mind the consequences of [[strip mining]], [[acid rain]]  and the [[greenhouse effect]], and, to top it all, the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]] happened the day after the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Petit|2009|ref=CITEREFPetit2009}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the press conference, [[Chase N. Peterson|Peterson]], Fleischmann and Pons, backed by the solidity of their scientific credentials, repeatedly assured the journalists that cold fusion would solve all of these problems, and would provide a limitless inexhaustible source of clean energy, using only seawater as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|p=xviii-xx}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said the results had been confirmed dozens of times and they had no doubts about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|p=xx-xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response and fallout====
Several laboratories in several countries attempted to repeat the experiments. A few initially reported success, but most failed to validate the results; [[Nathan Lewis]], professor of Chemistry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], led one of the most ambitious validation efforts, trying many variations on the experiment without success, while [[CERN]] physicist Douglas R. O.

In April 1989, Fleischmann and Pons published a &quot;preliminary note&quot; in the ''[[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1989_301&quot;/&gt; This paper notably showed a gamma peak without its corresponding [[Compton edge]], which indicated they had made a mistake in claiming evidence of fusion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tate|1989|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Platt|1998}} {{harvnb|Taubes|1993|141,147,167-171,243-248,271-272,288}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|277-288,362-363}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|63,138-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleischmann and Pons replied to this critique,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Measurement of gamma-rays from cold fusion (letter by Fleischmann et al. and reply by Petrasso et al.) |journal= Nature |volume= 339 |date= 29 june 1989 |url= http://www.psfc.mit.edu/icf/Home%20Page/Papers/Petrasso_Nature.pdf |postscript= . }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the only thing left clear was that no gamma ray had been registered and that Fleischmann refused to recognize any mistakes in the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|310-314}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|286-287}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|63,138-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary note was followed up a year later with a much longer paper that went into details of calorimetry but did not include any nuclear measurements.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1990&quot;/&gt;

Nevertheless, Fleischmann and Pons and a number of other researchers who found positive results remained convinced of their findings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne_1989&quot;/&gt;  The University of Utah asked Congress to provide $25 million to pursue the research, and Pons was scheduled to meet with representatives of President Bush in early May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne_1989&quot;/&gt;

In May 1989, the [[American Physical Society]] held a session on cold fusion, at which were heard many reports of experiments that failed to produce evidence of cold fusion. At the end of the session, eight of the nine leading speakers stated they considered the initial Fleischmann and Pons claim dead with the ninth, [[Johann Rafelski]], abstaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne_1989&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven E. Koonin]] of [[Caltech]] called the Utah report a result of &quot;''the incompetence and delusion of Pons and Fleischmann''&quot; which was met with applause. [[Douglas R. O. Morrison]], a physicist representing [[CERN]], was the first to call the episode an example of [[pathological science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne_1989&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/physics/Cold-fusion/vince-cate/aps.ascii APS Special Session on Cold Fusion, May 1–2, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July and November 1989, ''Nature'' published papers critical of cold fusion claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gai et al.|ref=CITEREFGai1989|1989|pp=29–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams et al.|1989|ref=CITEREFWilliams1989|pp=375–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Negative results were also published in several [[scientific journal]]s including ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', and ''[[Physical Review|Physical Review C]]'' (nuclear physics).&lt;ref name=&quot;nature critical papers&quot; group=&quot;notes&quot; /&gt; In spite of this trend, in August 1989, the state of [[Utah]] invested $4.5 million to create the National Cold Fusion Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joyce|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Energy]] organized a special panel to review cold fusion theory and research.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|US DOE|1989|ref=CITEREFDOE1989|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}  The panel issued its report in November 1989, concluding that results as of that date did not present convincing evidence that useful sources of energy would result from phenomena attributed to cold fusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989&quot; /&gt;{{rp|36}}  The panel noted the inconsistency of reports of excess heat and the greater inconsistency of reports of nuclear reaction byproducts.  Nuclear fusion of the type postulated would be inconsistent with current understanding and, if verified, would require theory to be extended in an unexpected way.  The panel was against special funding for cold fusion research, but supported modest funding of &quot;focused experiments within the general funding system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989&quot; /&gt;{{rp|37}} Cold fusion supporters continued to argue that the evidence was strong, and in September 1990 the National Cold Fusion Institute listed 92 groups of researchers from 10 different countries that had reported corroborating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallove|1991|pp=246–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by this point, academic consensus had moved decidedly toward labeling cold fusion as a kind of &quot;[[pathological science]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytdoe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Case Studies in Pathological Science: How the Loss of Objectivity Led to False Conclusions in Studies of Polywater, Infinite Dilution and Cold Fusion |journal= [[American Scientist]]| author= [[D.

The [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Julian Schwinger]] declared himself a supporter of cold fusion after much of the response to the initial reports had turned negative. He tried to publish theoretical papers supporting the possibility of cold fusion in [[Physical Review Letters]], but was deeply insulted by their rejection, and resigned from the [[American Physical Society]] (publisher of ''Letters'') in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Climbing the Mountain: The Scientific Biography of Julian Schwinger|author=Jagdish Mehra, K.

In the ensuing years, several books came out critical of cold fusion research methods and the conduct of cold fusion researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to today,  the [[scientific community]] continues to maintain a [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]] [[scientific consensus|consensus]] with regards to the subject due to the seeming lack of experimental reproducibility&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cold fusion's [[Cold fusion#Unlikelihood of fusion|theoretical implausibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=3}}, {{harvnb|Adam|2005}} - (&quot;Extraordinary claims . . . demand extraordinary proof&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; New experimental claims are routinely dismissed or ignored by mainstream scientists and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer and Morrison|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=3}} (&quot;You mean it's not dead?&quot; – recounting a typical reaction to hearing a cold fusion conference was held recently)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing work===
A small but committed group of cold fusion researchers has continued to this day to conduct experiments using Fleischmann and Pons electrolysis set-ups in spite of the rejection by the mainstream community.&lt;ref name=&quot;simon13&quot;/&gt; In 1992, Fleischmann and Pons themselves relocated their laboratory to France under a grant from the [[Toyota Motor Corporation]]. The laboratory, IMRA, was closed in 1998 after spending £12 million on cold fusion work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voss|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 1997, Japan's [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] sponsored a &quot;New Hydrogen Energy Program&quot; of US$20&amp;nbsp;million to research cold fusion.  Announcing the end of the program in 1997, the director and one-time proponent of cold fusion research Hideo Ikegami&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Cold Fusion, Derided in U.S., Is Hot In Japan | author=Andrew J.

In February 2002, the U.S. Navy revealed that researchers at their [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center]] in [[San Diego, California]] had been quietly studying cold fusion continually since 1989, by releasing a two-volume report, entitled &quot;Thermal and nuclear aspects of the Pd/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system,&quot; with a plea for funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mullins|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/tr/1862/tr1862-vol1.pdf Szpak, Masier-Boss: Thermal and nuclear aspects of the Pd/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system], Feb 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 demonstration in Bangalore by Japanese researcher [[Yoshiaki Arata]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Cold fusion success in Japan gets warm reception in India | date = 2008-05-27 | work = [[Thaindian News]] | url = http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/sci-tech/cold-fusion-success-in-japan-gets-warm-reception-in-india_10053182.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; revived some interest for cold fusion research in India. Projects have commenced at several centers such as the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] and the [[National Institute of Advanced Studies]] has also recommended the Indian government to revive this research.&lt;ref name=&quot;jayaraman&quot;/&gt;

As recently as January 2011, researchers from the University of Bologna, Andrea Rossi and Sergio Focardi, claimed to have successfully demonstrated commercially viable cold fusion using an apparatus, built by themselves, which they call an [[Energy Catalyzer]].  In March 2011, two Swedish  physicists evaluated the [[Energy Catalyzer]], under the control of Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Swedish Researchers confirm Rossi and Focardi Energy Catalyzer as a Nuclear Process | date = 2011-04-06 | work =[[nextbigfuture.com]] | url = http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/04/swedish-researchers-confirm-rossi-and.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Experimental test of a mini-Rossi device at the Leonardocorp, Bologna 29 March 2011 |author= Hanno Essén and Sven Kullander |date=3 April 2011 |url= http://www.nyteknik.se/incoming/article3144960.ece/BINARY/Download+the+report+by+Kullander+and+Essén+(pdf). }} Participants in the test: Giuseppe Levi, David Bianchini, Carlo Leonardi, Hanno Essén, Sven Kullander, Andrea Rossi, Sergio Focardi.&lt;/ref&gt; As the target is immediate commercialization, the inventors say that details of the invention will not be published yet. Moreover, the international patent application was partially rejected because it seemed to &quot;offend against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories&quot; and to overcome this problem it should have contained either experimental evidence or a firm theorical basis on mainstream-accepted scientific theories.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisa&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Italian Scientists claim to have demonstrated cold fusion | author = Lisa Zyga | date = 2011-01-20 | work =[[Physorg.com]] | url = http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-01-italian-scientists-cold-fusion-video.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this secrecy, the Swedish evaluators were not allowed to examine the inside of the reactor, and there is still uncertainty about the viability of the invention.&lt;ref name=Nyteknik_Defkalion&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewan |first=Mats |url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3091266.ece |title=Cold Fusion: Here's the Greek company building 1 MW |work=[[Ny Teknik]] |date=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer-reviewed journals have not published papers on this invention, leading Rossi to create his own online journal.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisa&quot;/&gt;

===Publications===
The [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]] identified cold fusion as the scientific topic with the largest number of published papers in 1989, of all scientific disciplines; but the number of papers then went into sharp decline as scientists abandoned the controversy and journal editors declined to even review the papers.&lt;ref name=simon180 /&gt; After 1990, publication of cold fusion papers declined sharply, and it fell off the ISI charts.&lt;ref name=simon209&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=180–183,209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication in mainstream journals has kept going down but it has never gone down to zero; this can be interpreted variously as the work of aging proponents who refuse to abandon a dying field, or as the normal publication rate in a small field that has found its natural niche.&lt;ref name=simon180 /&gt;

In the 1990s, the groups that continued to research cold fusion and their supporters established periodicals such as ''Fusion Facts'', ''Cold Fusion Magazine'', ''[[Infinite Energy Magazine]]'' and ''New Energy Times'' to cover the developments in cold fusion and other radical claims in energy production that were being excluded from the mainstream journals and the scientific press. In 2007 they published their own peer-reviewed journal, the ''Journal of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science''. The Internet has also become a major means of communication and self-publication for CF researchers, allowing for revival of the research.&lt;ref name=simon183&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Journal of Fusion Technology'' (FT) established in 1990 a permanent feature for cold fusion papers, publishing over a dozen papers per year, giving a mainstream outlet for cold fusion researchers at a time when other journals were unwilling to review cold fusion papers. When editor-in-chief George Miley retired in 2001, the journal stopped accepting new cold fusion papers.&lt;ref name=simon180&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=180–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of how cold fusion survives in certain journals only thanks to the work of individual persons who are sympathetic to the field.&lt;ref name=simon180 /&gt;

Cold fusion reports have been published over the years in a small cluster of specialized journals like ''[[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry]]'' and ''[[Il Nuovo Cimento]]''. Some papers also appeared in ''[[Journal of Physical Chemistry]]'', ''[[Physics Letters A]]'', ''[[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]]'', and a number of Japanese and Russian journals of physics, chemistry and engineering.&lt;ref name=simon180 /&gt; Since 2005, ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'' has published CF papers and, in 2009, named a cold fusion researcher to its editorial board.

This decline of publications in cold fusion has been  described as a characteristic of pathological science&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bettencourt|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=labinger&gt;{{harvnb|Labinger|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of a &quot;failed information epidemics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ackermann|2006}} &quot;(p. 11) Both the Polywater and Cold Nuclear Fusion journal literatures exhibit episodes of epidemic growth and decline.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Cold fusion researchers occasionally succeed in publishing papers in prestigious journals; the 1993 paper in ''Physics Letters A'' is an important example because it was the last paper published by Fleischmann, and &quot;one of the last reports to be formally challenged on technical grounds by a cold fusion skeptic&quot;.&lt;ref name=labinger /&gt;{{rp|1919}}

===Conferences===
Cold fusion researchers were for many years unable to get papers accepted in scientific meetings, and had to put up their own conferences. The first International Conference on Cold Fusion (ICCF) was held in 1990 and has been held every 12 to 18 months in various countries around the world since then. By 1994, attendants made no internal criticism of papers for fear of giving ammunition to external critics, and this, according to physicist [[David Goldstein]], allowed for the proliferation of crackpots and prevented the normal process of serious science,&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodstein_1994&quot; /&gt; By 2002, critics and skeptics had stopped attending the conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the founding in 2004 of the International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (ISCMNS), the conference was renamed the International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science–an example of the approach the cold fusion community has adopted in avoiding ''cold fusion'' as a term due to its negative connotations.&lt;ref name=&quot;simon13&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=132–133,218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seife154&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Seife|2008|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold fusion research is often referenced today under the name of &quot;low-energy nuclear reactions&quot;, or LENR,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc march 2009&quot;/&gt; but according to sociologist [[Bart Simon]] the &quot;cold fusion&quot; label continues to serve a social function in creating a [[collective identity]] for the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;simon13&quot;/&gt;

Since 2006, the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) has included cold fusion sessions in their meetings, clarifying that this did not imply a softening of skepticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;aps meeting&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chubb et al.|2006|ref=CITEREFAPS2006}}, {{harvnb|Adam|2005}} (&quot;[Absolutely not]. Anyone can deliver a paper. We defend the openness of science&quot; - Bob Park of APS, when asked if hosting the meeting showed a softening of scepticism)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;noorden2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van Noorden|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) meetings also include &quot;invited symposium(s)&quot; on cold fusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;acs meeting&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van Noorden|2007|loc=para. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ACS program chair said that without a proper forum the matter would never be discussed and, &quot;with the world facing an energy crisis, it is worth exploring all possibilities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;noorden2007&quot;/&gt; On 22–25 March 2009, the American Chemical Society meeting included a four-day symposium in conjunction with the 20th anniversary of the announcement of cold fusion. Researchers working at the U.S. Navy's [[Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center]] (SPAWAR) reported detection of energetic [[neutrons]] in a standard cold fusion cell design&lt;ref name=&quot;reignites&quot;/&gt; using [[CR-39]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ACS Press Release&quot;/&gt; a result previously published in ''[[Die Naturwissenschaften]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns march 2009&quot;/&gt; The authors claim that these neutrons are indicative of nuclear reactions,&lt;ref name=&quot;afp march 2009&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j2QobOQnlULUZ7oalSRUVjnlHjng |title=Scientists in possible cold fusion breakthrough |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work= |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although skeptics indicated that, to have their claims accepted by the scientific community, the authors have to make a quantitative analysis and they have to exclude other possible sources for those neutrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns march 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;berger&quot;/&gt;

===Further reviews and funding issues===
Around 1998 the University of Utah had already dropped its research after spending over $1 million, and in the summer of 1997 Japan cut off research and closed its own lab after spending $20 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired steam&quot;/&gt; Cold fusion researchers have complained there has been virtually no possibility of obtaining funding for cold fusion research in the United States, and no possibility of getting published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feder_2004_27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Feder|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; University researchers, it has been claimed, are unwilling to investigate cold fusion because they would be ridiculed by their colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adam|2005}} (comment attributed to George Miley of the University of Illinois)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[David Goodstein]] described cold fusion as:

{{blockquote|1=&quot;a pariah field, cast out by the scientific establishment. Between cold fusion and respectable science there is virtually no communication at all. Cold fusion papers are almost never published in refereed scientific journals, with the result that those works don't receive the normal critical scrutiny that science requires. On the other hand, because the Cold-Fusioners see themselves as a community under siege, there is little internal criticism. Experiments and theories tend to be accepted at face value, for fear of providing even more fuel for external critics, if anyone outside the group was bothering to listen. In these circumstances, crackpots flourish, making matters worse for those who believe that there is serious science going on here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodstein_1994&quot;/&gt;}}

Particle physicist [[Frank Close]] has gone even further, stating that the problems that plagued the original cold fusion announcement are still happening (as of 2009): results from studies are still not being independently verified and inexplicable phenomena encountered are being labelled as &quot;cold fusion&quot; even if they are not, in order to attract the attention of journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc march 2009&quot;/&gt;

Cold fusion researchers themselves acknowledge that the flaws in the original announcement still cause their field to be marginalized and to suffer a chronic lack of funding,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc march 2009&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=Cold fusion debate heats up again | work=[[BBC]] | date=2009-03-23 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7959183.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a small number of old and new researchers have remained interested in investigating cold fusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;simon13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wired march 2009&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Randy|2009|ref=CITEREFRandy2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adam|2005}} - (&quot;Advocates insist that there is just too much evidence of unusual effects in the thousands of experiments since Pons and Fleischmann to be ignored&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|2004 DOE panel}}
In August 2003, responding to a April 2003 letter from MIT's [[Peter L. Hagelstein]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberger2004&quot;/&gt;{{rp|3}} the energy secretary Spencer Abraham ordered the DOE to organize a second review of the field.&lt;ref name=brumfiel&gt;{{harvnb|Brumfiel|2004|ref=CITEREFBrumfiel2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold fusion researchers were asked to present a review document of all the evidence since the 1989 review. The report was released in 2004. The reviewers were &quot;split approximately evenly&quot; on whether the experiments had produced energy in the form of heat, but they all complained about the lack of proof and the poor documentation of the experiments.&lt;ref name=brumfiel /&gt; In summary, the reviewers were not convinced and they didn't recommend a federal research program, but they did recommend individual well-thought studies.&lt;ref name=brumfiel /&gt; They summarized its conclusions thus:

{{quotation|While significant progress has been made in the sophistication of calorimeters since the review of this subject in 1989, the conclusions reached by the reviewers today are similar to those found in the 1989 review.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The current reviewers identified a number of basic science research areas that could be helpful in
resolving some of the controversies in the field, two of which were: 1) material science aspects of deuterated metals using modern characterization techniques, and 2) the study of particles reportedly emitted from deuterated foils using state-of-the-art apparatus and methods. The reviewers believed that this field would benefit from the peer-review processes associated with proposal submission to agencies and paper submission to archival journals.|Report of the Review of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions, US Department of Energy, December 2004}}

The mainstream and popular scientific press presented this as a setback for cold fusion researchers, with headlines such as &quot;cold fusion gets chilly encore&quot;, but cold fusion researchers placed a &quot;rosier spin&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feder 2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Feder|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the report, noting that it also recommended specific areas where research could resolve the controversies in the field.&lt;ref name=doe2004&gt;{{harvnb|US DOE|2004|ref=CITEREFDOE2004r}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Physics Today'' reported that new reports of excess heat and other cold fusion effects were still no more convincing than 15 years previous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feder 2005&quot;/&gt;

==Experiments and reported results==
A cold fusion experiment usually includes:

* a metal, such as [[palladium]] or [[nickel]], in bulk, thin films or powder;
* [[deuterium]] and/or [[hydrogen]], in the form of water, gas or plasma; and
* an excitation in the form of [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[laser]] beam(s), or of [[sound|acoustic waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Storms|2007|pp=144–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrolysis cells can be either open cell or closed cell.  In open cell systems, the electrolysis products, which are gaseous, are allowed to leave the cell.  In closed cell experiments, the products are captured, for example by catalytically recombining the products in a separate part of the experimental system.  These experiments generally strive for a steady state condition, with the electrolyte being replaced periodically. There are also &quot;heat after death&quot; experiments, where the evolution of heat is monitored after the electric current is turned off.

The most basic setup of a cold fusion cell consists of two electrodes submerged in a solution of palladium and heavy water. The electrodes are then connected to a power source to transmit electricity from one electrode to the other through the solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;reignites&quot;&gt;{{Citation

The Fleischmann and Pons early findings regarding helium, neutron radiation and tritium were later discredited.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE_1989_24&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|US DOE|1989|ref=CITEREFDOE1989|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neutron radiation has been reported in cold fusion experiments at very low levels using different kinds of detectors, but levels were too low, close to background, and found too infrequently to provide useful information about possible nuclear processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Storms|2007|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1994|ref=CITEREFHoffman1994|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excess heat and energy production===
An excess heat observation is based on an [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]]. Various sources of energy input and output are continuously measured. Under normal condition, the energy input can be matched to the energy output to within experimental error. In experiments such as those run by Fleischmann and Pons, a cell operating steadily at one temperature transitions to operating at a higher temperature with no increase in applied current.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1990&quot; /&gt; In other experiments, however, no excess heat was discovered, and, in fact, even the heat from successful experiments was unreliable and could not be replicated independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;saeta1999 p 2&quot;/&gt; If higher temperatures were real, and not experimental artifact, the energy balance would show an unaccounted term. In the Fleischmann and Pons experiments, the rate of inferred excess heat generation was in the range of 10-20% of total input. The high temperature condition would last for an extended period, making the total excess heat appear to be disproportionate to what might be obtained by ordinary chemical reaction of the material contained within the cell at any one time, though this could not be reliably replicated.&lt;ref name=doe2004 /&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubler_2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hubler|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent researchers who advocate for cold fusion report similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oriani|Nelson|Lee|Broadhurst|1990|ref=CITEREFOriani1990|pp=652–662}}, cited by {{harvnb|Storms|2007|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bush|Lagowski|Miles|Ostrom|1991|ref=CITEREFBushEtAl1991}}, cited by {{harvnb|Biberian|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Storms|1993|ref=CITEREFStorms1993}}{{Dead link|it's not listed in the bibliography|date=October 2009}}, {{harvnb|Hagelstein et al.|2004|ref=CITEREFDOE2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles et al.|1993|ref=CITEREFMilesEtAl1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Arata|Zhang|1998}}, {{harvnb|Hagelstein et al.|2004|ref=CITEREFDOE2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gozzi|1998|ref=CITEREFGozziEtAl1998}}, cited by {{harvnb|Biberian|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as early as 1997, at least one research group was reporting that, with the proper procedure, &quot;...5 samples out of 6 that had undergone the whole procedure showed very clear excess heat production.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|ref=CITEREFScaramuzzi2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main criticisms of cold fusion was that the predictions from deuteron-deuteron fusion into helium should have resulted in the production of [[gamma rays]] which were not observed and have never been observed in any subsequent cold fusion experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;saeta1999 p 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vern C. Rogers and Gary M. Sandquist ''Cold fusion reaction products and their measurement'', Journal of Fusion Energy Volume 9, Number 4, 483-485, DOI: 10.1007/BF01588284 http://www.springerlink.com/content/k57225273v232p10/&lt;/ref&gt; Cold fusion researchers have since claimed to find X-rays, helium, neutrons and even [[nuclear transmutation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;simon_215&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them even claim to have found them using only light water and nickel cathodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;simon_215&quot; /&gt;

In 1993, after the initial discrediting, Fleischmann reported &quot;heat-after-death&quot; experiments: where excess heat was measured after the electric current supplied to the electrolytic cell was turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleischmann|1993|ref=CITEREFFleischmann1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of report also became part of subsequent cold fusion claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mengoli|1998|ref=CITEREFMengoli1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Szpak2004&gt;{{harvnb|Szpak|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helium, heavy elements, and neutrons===
[[Image:Triple tracks in CR-39.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|&quot;Triple tracks&quot; in a [[CR-39]] plastic radiation detector claimed as evidence for neutron emission from palladium deuteride.]]
Known instances of nuclear reactions, aside from producing energy, also produce nucleons and particles on ballistic trajectories which are readily observable. In support of their claim that nuclear reactions took place in their electrolytic cells, Fleischmann and Pons reported a neutron flux of 4,000 neutrons per second, as well as detections of tritium. The classical branching ratio for previously known fusion reactions that produce tritium would predict, with 1 [[watt]] of power, the production of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second, levels that would have been fatal to the researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|p=[http://books.google.es/books?id=dEJJqgw8pvwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;vq=radiation+He-4+4,000+1012+neutrons&amp;dq=Voodoo+science&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 49]}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|pp=[http://books.google.es/books?id=xzCK6-Kqs6QC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=neutron+neutrons+tritium+gamma+rays 17–18]}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=306–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mosier-Boss et al. reported what they called the first scientific report of highly energetic neutrons, using [[CR-39]] plastic radiation detectors,&lt;ref name=mosier-boss2009&gt;{{harvnb|Mosier-Boss|Szpak|Gordon|Forsley|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the claims can not be validated without a [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative analysis]] of neutrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns march 2009&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barras|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;berger&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berger|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several medium and heavy elements like calcium, titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper and zinc have been reported as detected by several researchers, like Tadahiko Mizuno or George Miley; these elemental transmutations are totally unexpected products of nuclear fusion processes and won't be believed by the scientific community until iron-clad reproducible proof has been presented.&lt;ref name=&quot;saeta1999 p 2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report presented to the DOE in 2004 indicated that deuterium loaded foils could be used to detect fusion reaction products and, although the reviewers found the evidence presented to them as inconclusive, they indicated that those experiments didn't use [[state of the art]] techniques.&lt;ref name=doe2004 /&gt;{{rp|3,4,5}}

In response to skepticism about the lack of nuclear products, cold fusion researchers have tried to capture and measure nuclear products correlated with excess heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagelstein 2010&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hagelstein|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Storms 2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Storms|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable attention has been given to measuring &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagelstein et al. 2004&quot;/&gt; However, the reported levels are very near to the background, so contamination by trace amounts of helium which are normally present in the air cannot be ruled out. The lack of detection of gamma radiation seen in the fusion of hydrogen or deuterium to &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He has further strengthened the explanation that the helium detections are due to experimental error.&lt;ref name=&quot;saeta1999 p 2&quot;/&gt; In the report presented to the DOE in 2004, the reviewers' opinion was divided on the evidence for &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He; with the most negative reviews concluding that although the amounts detected were above background levels, they were very close to them and therefore could be caused by contamination from air. The panel also expressed concerns about the poor-quality of the theoretical framework cold fusion proponents presented to account for the lack of gamma rays.&lt;ref name=doe2004 /&gt;{{rp|3,4}}

==Explanations==
Skepticism about the cold fusion explanation for the reports of Fleishmann and Pons' began even before reports about failure to replicate their experimental claims were published, and the reported [[null result]]s only further encouraged the repudiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Nuclear fusion and subsequent proponent proposals===
The initial cold fusion explanation was motivated by the high relative amounts of energy claimed to have been observed in cold fusion experiments along with the insistence by the initial reviewer, Stephen E. Jones, that a nuclear fusion explanation was viable. Additionally, the fact that hydrogen and its isotopes can dissolve in certain solids at high densities so that the separation of the nuclei can be relatively small (albeit larger than the separation of nuclei in the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; deuterium molecule), and that electron charge inside metals can [[electron shielding|shield]] the repulsion between nuclei inspired the possibility of higher cold fusion rates than those expected from a simple application of [[Coulomb's law]]. However, theoretical calculations show that these effects are too small to cause significant fusion rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Other research groups that initially claimed that they were able to verify Fleischmann and Pons' results came to report alternative explanations for their original positive results. A group at [[Georgia Tech]] found problems in their neutron detector and [[Texas A&amp;M]] discovered bad wiring in their thermometers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird 1998 261–262&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|1998|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports, combined with negative results from some famous laboratories,&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne_1989&quot;/&gt; led most scientists to conclude that no positive result should be attributed to cold fusion, at least not on a significant scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird 1998 261–262&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heeter|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanations offered by cold fusion researchers are ad hoc and cannot coherently explain the experimental results,&lt;ref name=&quot;derry&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Derry|2002|pp=179,180}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they can't agree on a single theorical explanation or on a single method that can produce replicable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|214-216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to today, cold fusion proponents continue to offer and promote these and other theoretical explanations including relatively new proposals involving [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, special effects happening only in the surface of the electrode, and [[Free electron model|electron lattice responses]]. Proponents' attempts at theoretical explanation have either been explicitly rejected by mainstream physicists or lack independent review because mainstream scientists refuse to examine them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=3}}, {{harvnb|Adam|2005}} - (&quot;Extraordinary claims . . . demand extraordinary proof&quot;), {{harvnb|Collins|1993|72-74}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of cold fusion &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; point, for example, to astro-physics experiments where bombarding metals with multi-keV deuteron beams greatly increased reaction rates over those predicted by the accepted models. &quot;Inclusion of effective-charge reduction from electron screening raises the cross section by another 7-10 orders of magnitude.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Czerski2008&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Czerski|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested to the DOE commission in 2004 that electron screening could be one explanation for the enhanced reaction rate observed in LENR.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hagelstein et al.|2004|ref=CITEREFDOE2004}}{{rp|14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOE found the theoretical explanations to be the weakest part of cold fusion claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;US DOE 2004 ref=CITEREFDOE2004r&quot;/&gt;

===Unlikelihood of fusion===
There are many reasons fusion is an unlikely explanation for the experimental results described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|ref=CITEREFScaramuzzi2000|p=4}} (&quot;It has been said . . . three 'miracles' are necessary&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;  Because nuclei are all positively charged, they strongly repel one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;  Normally, in the absence of a catalyst such as a muon, very high kinetic energies are required to overcome this repulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer and Morrison|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=1,3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolating from known rates at high energies down to energies available in cold fusion experiments, the rate for uncatalyzed fusion at room-temperature energy would be 50 orders of magnitude lower than needed to account for the reported excess heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Czerski2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|ref=CITEREFScaramuzzi2000|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993}} page viii &quot;''Enhancing the probability of a nuclear reaction by 50 orders of magnitude (...) via the chemical environment of a metallic lattice, contradicted the very foundation of nuclear science.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional deuteron fusion is a two-step process,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|ref=CITEREFScaramuzzi2000|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an unstable high energy intermediary is formed:
:[[deuterium|D]] + D → [[Alpha particle|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]][[Nuclear isomer|&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]] + 24 [[MeV]]
High energy experiments have observed only three decay pathways for this excited-state nucleus, with the branching ratio showing the probability that any given intermediate will follow a particular pathway.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=2}}, {{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|ref=CITEREFScaramuzzi2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The products formed via these decay pathways are:
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; →  [[neutron|n]] + [[Helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] + 3.3 MeV ([[Branching fraction|ratio]]=50%)
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → [[proton|p]] + [[Tritium|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]] + 4.0 MeV (ratio=50%)
:[[Isomeric transition|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]] + [[gamma particle|γ]] + 24 MeV (ratio=10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt;)
Only about one in one million of the intermediaries decay along the third pathway, making its products comparatively rare when compared to the other paths.&lt;ref name=&quot;saeta1999 p 2&quot;/&gt;  If one watt of nuclear power were produced from deuteron fusion consistent with known branching ratios, the resulting neutron and tritium (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H) production would be easily measured.&lt;ref name=&quot;saeta1999 p 2&quot;/&gt;  Some researchers reported detecting &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He but without the expected neutron or tritium production; such a result would require branching ratios strongly favouring the third pathway, with the actual rates of the first two pathways lower by at least five orders of magnitude than observations from other experiments, directly contradicting mainstream-accepted branching probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|ref=CITEREFSaeta1999|p=2}}, {{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|ref=CITEREFScaramuzzi2000|p=4}} , {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}} (explaining Pons and Fleischmann would both be dead if they had produced neutrons in proportion to their measurements of excess heat)&lt;/ref&gt;  Those reports of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He production did not include detection of [[gamma ray]]s, which would require the third pathway to have been changed somehow so that gamma rays are no longer emitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;saeta1999 p 2&quot;/&gt; Proponents have proposed that the 24 MeV excess energy is transferred in the form of heat into the host metal lattice prior to the [[Reaction intermediate|intermediary's]] decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; However, the known rate of the decay process together with the inter-atomic spacing in a [[metallic crystal]] makes such a transfer inexplicable in terms of conventional understandings of momentum and energy transfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}, {{harvnb|Scaramuzzi|2000|ref=CITEREFScaramuzzi2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even then we would see measurable levels of radiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=308–309}} &quot;Some radiation would emerge, either electrons ejected from atoms or X-rays as the atoms are disturbed, but none were seen.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calorimetry errors===
The calculation of excess heat in electrochemical cells involves certain assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biberian|2007}} - (Input power is calculated by multiplying current and voltage, and output power is deduced from the measurement of the temperature of the cell and that of the bath&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;  Errors in these assumptions have been offered as non-nuclear explanations for excess heat.

One assumption made by Fleischmann and Pons is that the efficiency of electrolysis is nearly 100%, meaning nearly all the electricity applied to the cell resulted in electrolysis of water, with negligible resistive heating and substantially all the electrolysis product leaving the cell unchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1990&quot; /&gt; This assumption gives the amount of energy expended converting liquid D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into gaseous D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleischmann|1990|ref=CITEREFFleischmann1990|loc=Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of electrolysis will be less than one if hydrogen and oxygen recombine to a significant extent within the calorimeter.  Several researchers have described potential mechanisms by which this process could occur and thereby account for excess heat in electrolysis experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shkedi_1995&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shkedi et al.|1995|ref=CITEREFShkedi1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1995_1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jones et al.|1995|ref=CITEREFJones1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanahan 2002&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shanahan|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another assumption is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the calorimeter.&lt;ref name=&quot;FleischmannPons_1990&quot; /&gt; This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biberian|2007}} - (&quot;Almost all the heat is dissipated by radiation and follows the temperature fourth power law. The cell is calibrated . . .&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne_1989_para16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1989|loc=para. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson_1992&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1992|ref=CITEREFWilson1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the calorimeter would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanahan 2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanahan 2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shanahan|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanahan 2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shanahan|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents==
Although the details have not surfaced, it appears that the University of Utah forced the 23 March 1989 Fleischmann and Pons announcement in order to establish priority over the discovery and its patents before the joint publication with Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;utah patent&quot;/&gt; The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) announced on 12 April 1989 that it had applied for its own patents based on theoretical work of one of its researchers, [[Peter L. Hagelstein]], who had been sending papers to journals from the 5th to the 12th of April.&lt;ref name=Broad1989/&gt; On 2 December 1993 the University of Utah licensed all its cold fusion patents to ENECO, a new company created to profit from cold fusion discoveries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewenstein_1994_43&quot;/&gt; and on March 1998 it said that it would no longer defend its patents.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired steam&quot;&gt;{{citation |title= Cold Fusion Patents Run Out of Steam |author= Wired News Staff Email |date= 24 March 1998 |publisher= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url= http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/03/11179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) now rejects patents claiming cold fusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberger2004&quot;/&gt; Esther Kepplinger, the deputy commissioner of patents in 2004, said that this was done using the same argument as with [[perpetual motion machine]]s: that they do not work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberger2004&quot;/&gt; Patent applications are required to show that the invention is &quot;useful&quot;, and this [[Utility (patent)|utility]] is dependent on the invention's ability to function.&lt;ref name=&quot;incredible&quot;/&gt; In general USPTO rejections on the sole grounds of the invention's being &quot;inoperative&quot; are rare, since such rejections need to demonstrate &quot;proof of total incapacity&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;incredible&quot;/&gt; and cases where those rejections are upheld in a Federal Court are even rarer: nevertheless, in 2000, a rejection of a cold fusion patent was appealed in a Federal Court and it was upheld, in part on the grounds that the inventor was unable to establish the utility of the invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;incredible&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;patent case&quot; group=&quot;notes&quot; /&gt;

U.S. patents might still be granted when they are given a different name in order to disassociate it from cold fusion,&lt;ref name=&quot;simon patent&quot;/&gt; although this strategy has had little success in the US: the very same claims that need to be patented can identify it with cold fusion, and most of these patents cannot avoid mentioning Fleischmann and Pons' research due to legal constraints, thus alerting the patent reviewer that it is a cold-fusion-related patent.&lt;ref name=&quot;simon patent&quot;/&gt; David Voss said in 1999 that some patents that closely resemble cold fusion processes, and that use materials used in cold fusion, have been granted by the USPTO.&lt;ref name=&quot;voss-science&quot;/&gt; The inventor of three such patents had his applications initially rejected when they were reviewed by experts in nuclear science; but then he rewrote the patents to focus more in the electrochemical parts so they would be reviewed instead by experts in electrochemistry, who approved them.&lt;ref name=&quot;voss-science&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= A Case Study of Inoperable Inventions: Why Is the USPTO Patenting Pseudoscience?	|author= Daniel C.

At least one patent related to cold fusion has been granted by the [[European Patent Office]].&lt;ref name=Fox1994a/&gt;

A patent only legally prevents others from using or benefiting from one's invention. However, the general public perceives a patent as a stamp of approval, and a holder of three cold fusion patents said the patents were very valuable and had helped in getting investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;voss-science&quot;/&gt;

 |quote= So there matters stand: no cold fusion researcher has been able to dispel the stigma of 'pathological science' by rigorously and reproducibly demonstrating effects sufficiently large to exclude the possibility of error (for example, by constructing a working power generator), nor does it seem possible to conclude unequivocally that all the apparently anomalous behavior can be attributed to error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Coal tar''' is a brown or black liquid of high [[viscosity]], which smells of [[naphthalene]] and [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s. Coal tar is among the by-products when [[coal]] is 
[[carbonization|carbonized]] to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or [[coal gasification|gasified]] to make [[coal gas]]. Coal tars are complex and variable mixtures of [[phenols]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), and [[heterocyclic compound]]s, about 200 substances in all.&lt;ref name=&quot;c&quot;&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp85-c2.pdf Toxicological profile for wood creosote, coal tar creosote, coal tar, coal tar pitch, and coal tar pitch volatiles] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, page 19, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Pavement Sealcoat===

{{Main|Sealcoat}}

Coal tar is incorporated into some parking-lot [[sealcoat]] products, which are marketed as a means of protecting and beautifying underlying pavement.&lt;ref&gt;truthaboutcoaltar.com, [http://www.truthaboutcoaltar.com/aboutpavement.html ''About pavement sealer''], accessed April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sealcoat products that are coal-tar based typically contain 20 to 35 percent coal-tar pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs20113010&quot;&gt;Mahler, B.J., and Van Metre, P.C. [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/ ''Coal-Tar-Based Pavement Sealcoat, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and Environmental Health''], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial concerns have been raised about the safety of this application of coal tar, given that coal tar is known to cause cancer in humans &lt;ref&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer [http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s048coal.pdf ''Coal tars and coal tar pitches''], 1980, accessed September 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and that several PAH compounds in coal tar are toxic to aquatic life. Defenders of coal-tar use in sealcoat have pointed out that humans are exposed to PAHs through many pathways, and similarly that the urban environment has many potential sources of PAHs.&lt;ref&gt;truthaboutcoaltar.com, [http://www.truthaboutcoaltar.com/aboutcoaltar.html ''About Coal Tar and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)''], accessed April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of coal tar in sealcoats—at least in the United States—is regional,&lt;ref name=&quot;fs20113010&quot; /&gt; and several areas have banned its use in sealcoat products

===Industrial===
Being flammable, coal tar is sometimes used for heating or to fire [[boiler]]s. Like most heavy oils, it must be heated before it will flow easily.

Tar was a vital component of the first sealed, or &quot;[[tarmac]]&quot;, roads. Coal tar was formerly used as one of the primary ingredients of [[Tarmac]]adam pavements, when mixed with ironworks [[slag]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sheail, ‘Hooley, Edgar Purnell (1860–1942)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49486, accessed 21 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, petroleum derived binders and sealers are more commonly used. These sealers are used to extend the life and lower maintenance cost associated with [[asphalt]] pavements, primarily in asphalt road paving, car parks and walkways.

A large part of the binders used in the graphite industry for making &quot;Green Blocks&quot; are Coke Oven Volatiles or COV. A considerable portion of these COV used as binders is Coal Tar. During the heating / Baking process of the green blocks as a part of commercial graphite production, most part of the coal tar binders gets vaporised and is generally burned in Incinerator to prevent release in the atmosphere as the COV and Coal Tar can be injurious to health.

Coal tar is also used to manufacture paints,synthetic dyes and photographic materials.

===Medical===
Also known as liquor carbonis detergens (LCD),&lt;ref&gt;Paghdal &amp; Schwartz, Topical tar: Back to the future, Dermatology and Pathology, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; like [[pine tar]], it can be used in medicated [[shampoo]], [[Wrights Coal Tar Soap|soap]] and [[ointment]], as a treatment for [[dandruff]] and [[psoriasis]], as well as being used to kill and repel [[head lice]]. When used as a medication in the [[United States|U.S.]], coal tar preparations are considered an OTC ([[over-the-counter drug]]) pharmaceutical and are subject to regulation by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]]. Name brands include [[Denorex]], Balnetar, Psoriasin, Tegrin, [[T/Gel]], and Neutar. When used in the extemporaneous preparation of topical medications, it is supplied in the form of Coal Tar Topical Solution [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]], which consists of a [[percentage solution|20% w/v]] solution of coal tar in [[alcohol]], with an additional 5% w/v of [[polysorbate 80]];&lt;ref&gt;USP30-NF25 page 1817&lt;/ref&gt; this must then be diluted in an ointment base such as [[petrolatum]].

==Safety==
According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], preparations that include more than 5 percent of crude coal tar are [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]] [[carcinogen]]. 

According to the [[National Psoriasis Foundation]] and the FDA, coal tar is a valuable, safe and inexpensive treatment option for millions of people with psoriasis and other scalp or skin conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Psoriasis Foundation]], [http://www.psoriasis.org/news/stories/2001/20011202_coalcala.php The battle to save coal tar in California], December 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Coal tar concentrations between 0.5% and 5% are safe and effective for psoriasis, and no scientific evidence suggests that the coal tar in the concentrations seen in non-prescription treatments is carcinogenic. The NPF states that coal tar contains approximately 10,000 chemicals, of which only about 50% have been identified,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/topicals/tar.php National Psoriasis Foundation: Tar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the composition of coal tar varies with its origin and type of coal (for example,: [[lignite]], [[bituminous coal|bituminous]] or [[anthracite]]) used to make it.

Coal tar causes [[sun poisoning|increased sensitivity to sunlight]],&lt;ref name=&quot;medicinenet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Sun-Sensitive Drugs (Photosensitivity to Drugs) |url= http://www.medicinenet.com/sun-sensitive_drugs_photosensitivity_to_drugs/page5.htm |date= 2008-08-22 |page= 5 |work= MedicineNet |publisher= [[WebMD]] |accessdate=2010-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so skin treated with topical coal tar preparations should be protected from sunlight.

The residue from the [[distillation]] of high-temperature coal tar, primarily a complex mixture of three or more membered condensed ring [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, was listed on 28 October 2008 as a [[substance of very high concern]] by the [[European Chemicals Agency]].

'''Saint Catherine of Siena''' [[Third Order of St. Dominic|T.O.S.D]] (25 March 1347 in Siena – 29 April 1380 in Rome) was a [[Third order|tertiary]] of the [[Dominican Order]], and a [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]]. She also worked to bring the papacy of [[Gregory XI]] back to [[Rome]] from [[Avignon Papacy|its displacement in France]], and to establish peace among the Italian city-states. She was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1970. She is one of the two [[patron saint]]s of [[Italy]], together with [[Francis of Assisi]].

== Life ==
[[File:House Catherine Siena Apr 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The house of Saint Catherine in [[Siena]]]]
Caterina Benincasa was born in [[Siena]], Italy, to Giacomo di Benincasa, a cloth dyer who ran his enterprise with the help of his sons, and Lapa Piagenti, possibly the daughter of a local poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03447a.htm |title=St. Catherine of Siena |publisher=newadvent.org |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house where Catherine grew up is still in existence. Born in 1347, she arrived when the [[black death]] struck the area; Siena was badly ravaged. Lapa was about forty years old when she prematurely gave birth to twin daughters, Catherine and Giovanna. Lapa had already had 22 children, but half of them had died. Giovanna was handed over to a wet-nurse, and presently died, whereas Catherine was nursed by her mother, and developed into a healthy child. She was two years old when Lapa had her 25th child, another daughter named Giovanna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Finn |last=Skårderud |title=Holy anorexia: Catherine of Siena |publisher=Tidsskrift for norsk psykologforening |page=411 |location= Oslo |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catherine had her first vision of Christ when she was age five or six saying that Jesus smiled at her, blessed her, and left her in ecstasy. At age seven she vowed chastity.

Her older sister Bonaventura died in childbirth. Within a year, the younger sister named Giovanna also died. While tormented with sorrow, sixteen-year-old Catherine was now faced with her parents' wish that she marry Bonaventura's widower. Absolutely opposed to this, she started a massive fast, something she had learnt from Bonaventura, whose husband had not been considerate in the least. Bonaventura had changed his attitude by refusing to eat until he showed better manners. This had taught Catherine the power of fasting in close relationships. She claimed to feel &quot;jubilant&quot; when cutting off her long hair.

She would later advise her confessor and biographer [[Raymond of Capua]] to do during times of trouble what she did now as a teenager: &quot;Build a cell inside your mind, from which you can never flee.&quot; In this inner cell she made her father into a representation of Christ, Lapa into [[St. Mary]], and her brothers into the apostles. Serving them humbly became an opportunity for spiritual growth. The greater the suffering, the larger her triumph was. Eventually her father gave up and permitted her to live as she pleased. 

A vision of [[St. Dominic]] strengthened her, though, but her wish to join his order was no comfort to Lapa, who took her daughter with her to the baths in [[Bagno Vignoni]] to improve her health. Soon she fell seriously ill with violent rash, fever and pain, which conveniently made her mother accept her wish to join the Mantellate, a group of Dominican laywomen.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine of Siena. Available Means. Ed. Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald. Pittsburgh, Pa.: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Lapa went to the sisters of the order and persuaded them to take in her daughter. Within days, Catherine seemed entirely restored, rose from bed and donned the black and white nun habit. She lived outside the convent though, at home with her family like before. The Mantellate taught Catherine how to read, and she lived in almost total silence and solitude.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine of Siena. Available Means. Ed. Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald. Pittsburgh, Pa.: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Her habit of giving away food and clothes without asking anyone's permission cost her family significantly but she demanded nothing for herself. By staying in their midst, she could live out her rejection of them more strongly. She did not want their food, referring to the table laid for her in Heaven with her real family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Finn |last=Skårderud |title=Holy anorexia: Catherine of Siena |publisher=Tidsskrift for norsk psykologforening |pages= 412–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catherine received the habit of a Dominican [[Tertiaries|tertiary]], after vigorous protests from the Tertiaries themselves, who up to that point had been only widows.

[[File:San Domenico74.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;St Catherine's mystic communion&quot; by [[Francesco Brizzi]]]] 
In about 1366, Catherine experienced what she described in her letters as a &quot;Mystical Marriage&quot; with [[Jesus]], later a popular subject in art as the ''[[Mystic marriage of Saint Catherine]]''.  Her biographer Raymond of Capua also records that she was told by Christ to leave her withdrawn life and enter the public life of the world. Catherine dedicated much of her life to helping the ill and the poor, where she took care of them in hospitals or homes. Her early pious activities in Siena attracted a group of followers, both women and men, while they also brought her to the attention of the Dominican Order, which called her to Florence in 1374 to interrogate her for possible heresy. After this visit, in which she was deemed sufficiently orthodox, she began traveling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and the launch of a new crusade and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through &quot;the total love for God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Warren C. Hollister, and Judith M. Bennett |title=Medieval Europe: A Short History'', 9th edition |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies Inc |year=2002 |page= 342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Physical travel was not the only way in which Catherine made her views known. In the early 1370s, she began dictating letters to various scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine of Siena. Available Means. Ed. Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald. Pittsburgh, Pa.: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters were intended to reach men and women of her circle, increasingly widening her audience to include figures in authority as she begged for [[peace]] between the republics and principalities of Italy and for the return of the [[Papacy]] from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] to [[Rome]]. She carried on a long correspondence with [[Pope Gregory XI]], also asking him to reform the [[clergy]] and the administration of the [[Papal States]].

In June 1376 Catherine went to [[Avignon]] herself as ambassador of [[Florence, Italy|Florence]] to make peace with the [[Papal States]], but was unsuccessful. She also tried to convince [[Pope Gregory XI]] to return to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Warren C. Hollister, and Judith M. Bennett. ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'', 9th edition, Boston: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc., 2002. p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; She impressed the [[Pope]] so much that he returned his administration to Rome in January 1377. Following Gregory's death and during the [[Western Schism]] of 1378 she was an adherent of [[Pope Urban VI]], who summoned her to Rome, and stayed at [[Pope Urban VI]]'s court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy. She lived in Rome until her death in 1380. The problems of the Western Schism would trouble her until the end of her life.

St Catherine's letters are considered one of the great works of early Tuscan literature. More than 300 have survived. In her letters to the Pope, she often referred to him affectionately as ''Papa'' (&quot;Pope&quot; in Italian). Other correspondents include her various confessors, among them [[Raymond of Capua]], the kings of France and Hungary, the infamous mercenary [[John Hawkwood]], the Queen of Naples, members of the Visconti family of Milan, and numerous religious figures. Roughly one third of her letters are to women. 

Her other major work is ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence,'' a dialogue between a soul who &quot;rises up&quot; to God and God himself, and recorded between 1377 and 1378 by members of her circle. Often assumed to be illiterate, Catherine is acknowledged by Raymond in his life of her as capable of reading both Latin and Italian, and another [[hagiographer]], Tommaso Caffarini, claimed that she could write in her own hand, though the majority of her written work was dictated.

==Death==
[[File:San Domenico Siena Apr 2008 (13).JPG|thumb|left|The Chapel of Saint Catherine with parts of her [[relic]]s in the Basilica of San Domenico in Siena]]
St Catherine died in Rome, the spring of 1380, at the age of thirty-three. Jesus is also commonly thought to have died at the same age, and Catherine's idol [[Mary Magdalen]] is said to have fasted for thirty-three years.

Over the years Catherine had eaten less and less, claiming that she found no nourishment in earthly food. Instead she received the Holy Communion virtually on a daily basis. This extreme fasting appeared unhealthy in the eyes of the clergy and her own sisterhood, and her confessor, Raymond of Capua, ordered her to eat properly. But Catherine claimed that she was unable to, describing her inability to eat as an ''infermita'', illness. She would throw up what she swallowed, and suffered severe stomach pains, which she bore with patience as another penance. 

She was buried in the cemetery of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] which lies near the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. After miracles were reported to take place at her grave, Raymond moved her inside the [[Basilica]] of Santa Maria sopra Minerva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Catherine+of+Siena&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=19919&amp; |title=Catherine of Siena |publisher=findagrave.com |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she lies to this day. Her head however, was parted from her body and inserted in a gilt bust from [[bronze]]. This bust was later taken to Siena, and carried through that city in a procession to the Dominican church. Behind the bust walked Lapa, Catherine's mother, who lived until she was 89 years old. By then she had seen the end of the wealth and the happiness of her family, and followed most of her children and several of her grandchildren to the grave. She helped Raymond of Capua write his biography of her daughter, and said, &quot;I think God has laid my soul athwart in my body, so it can't get out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Finn |last=Skårderud |title=Holy anorexia Catherine of Siena |publisher=Tidsskrift for norsk psykologforening |page= 414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of Siena wished to have St. Catherine's body. A story is told of a miracle whereby they were partially successful: Knowing that they could not smuggle her whole body out of Rome, they decided to take only her head which they placed in a bag. When stopped by the Roman guards, they prayed to St Catherine to help them, confident that she would rather have her body (or at least part thereof) in Siena. When they opened the bag to show the guards, it appeared no longer to hold her head but to be full of rose petals. Once they got back to Siena they reopened the bag and her head was visible once more. Due to this story, St Catherine is often seen holding a [[rose]]. The incorruptible head and thumb were entombed in the Basilica of [[San Domenico, Siena|San Domenico]], where they remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=19918 |title=Catherine of Siena |publisher=findagrave.com |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius II]] [[canonized]] St Catherine in the year 1461. Her [[feast day]], at the time, was not included in the [[Roman Calendar]]. When it was added in 1597, it was put on the day of her death, April 29, as now, but because of a conflict with the feast of Saint [[Peter of Verona]], which was also on April 29, it was moved in 1628 to the new date of April 30.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Calendarium Romanum&quot;'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1969 revision of the [[Roman Catholic calendar of saints]], it was decided to leave the celebration of the feast of St Peter of Verona to local calendars, because he was not as well known worldwide, and Saint Catherine's feast was restored to its traditional date of April 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calendarium Romanum |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |year=1969 |page= 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some continued to use one or other of the calendars in force in the 1628–1969 period.

On May 5, 1940 [[Pope Pius XII]] named her a joint [[Patron Saint]] of [[Italy]] along with [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] gave her the title of Doctor of the Church in 1970 along with [[Saint Teresa of Ávila]] making them the first women to receive this honour. In 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]] made her one of Europe's patron saints. She is also the patroness of the historically Catholic American sorority, [[Theta Phi Alpha]].

Catherine is alleged to have suffered from [[anorexia mirabilis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is1/reda.html |title=Anorexia and the Holiness of Saint Catherine of Siena |publisher=albany.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless she remains a greatly respected figure for her spiritual writings, and political boldness to &quot;speak truth to power&quot;&amp;mdash; it being exceptional for a woman, in her time period, to have had such influence in politics and on world history.

Sir '''Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet''', [[Knight Bachelor|Kt]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (14 November 1797 – 22 February 1875) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[lawyer]] and the foremost [[geologist]] of his day. He is best known as the author of ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', which popularised [[James Hutton]]'s concepts of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] – the idea that the earth was shaped by slow-moving forces still in operation today. Lyell was a close and influential friend of [[Charles Darwin]].

==Biography==
Lyell was born in [[Scotland]] about 15 miles north of [[Dundee]] in Kinnordy, near [[Kirriemuir]] in [[Forfarshire]] (now in [[Angus]]). He was the eldest of ten children. Lyell's father, also named Charles, was a lawyer and [[botanist]] of minor repute: it was he who first exposed his son to the study of nature. 
[[Image:Scotland (Location) Named (HR).png|thumb|The main geographical &lt;br&gt;divisions of Scotland]]

The house/place of his birth is located in the north-west of the [[Central Lowlands]] in the valley of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], one of the great features of [[Geology of Scotland|Scottish geology]]. Round the house, in the [[rift valley]], is farmland, but within a short distance to the north-west, on the other side of the fault, are the [[Grampian Mountains]] in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Google maps]], including terrain and satellite.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles would have seen this striking view from his house as a child. He was also fortunate that his family's second home was in a completely different geological and ecological area: he spent much of his childhood at [[Bartley Lodge]] in the [[New Forest]], [[England]]. Both these places undoubtedly kindled his interest in the natural world. 

Lyell entered [[Exeter College, Oxford]] in 1816, and attended [[William Buckland]]'s lectures. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] second class in classics, December 1819, and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] 1821.&lt;ref name = &quot;czscax&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, Leonard G. &quot;Charles Lyell&quot; ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography.'' Ed. Charles Coulston Gillispie. Vol. VIII. Pennsylvania, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; 
After graduation he took up law as a profession, entering [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1820. He completed a circuit through rural England, where he could observe geological phenomena. In 1821 he attended [[Robert Jameson]]'s lectures in Edinburgh, and visited [[Gideon Mantell]] at [[Lewes]], in [[Sussex]]. In 1823 he was elected joint secretary of the [[Geological Society]]. As his eyesight began to deteriorate, he turned to geology as a full-time profession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt; His first paper, &quot;On a recent formation of freshwater limestone in Forfarshire&quot;, was presented in 1822.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt; By 1827, he had abandoned law and embarked on a geological career that would result in fame and the general acceptance of uniformitarianism, a working out of the idea proposed by [[James Hutton]] a few decades earlier.

[[image:Lyell 1840.jpg|left|thumb|Charles Lyell at the [[British Association]] meeting in Glasgow 1840. Painting by Alexander Craig.]]
In 1832, Lyell married Mary Horner of Bonn, daughter of Leonard Horner (1785–1864), also associated with the [[Geological Society of London]]. The new couple spent their honeymoon in Switzerland and Italy on a geological tour of the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macomber&quot;&gt;Macomber, Richard W. &quot;Lyell, Sir Charles, Baronet.&quot; ''The New Encyclopedia Britannica'', Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1840s, Lyell traveled to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and wrote two popular travel-and-geology books: ''Travels in North America'' (1845) and ''A Second Visit to the United States'' (1849). After the [[Great Chicago Fire]], Lyell was one of the first to donate books to help found the [[Chicago Public Library]]. In 1866, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Lyell's wife died in 1873, and two years later Lyell himself died as he was revising the twelfth edition of ''Principles''. He is buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macomber&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Charles Lyell - Westminster Abbey | url = http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/charles-lyell | accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell was knighted ([[Knight Bachelor|Kt]]), and later made a baronet ([[Baronet|Bt]]), which is an hereditary honour. He was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1858 and the [[Wollaston Medal]] of the [[Geological Society]] in 1866. The crater [[Lyell (lunar crater)|Lyell]] on the [[Moon]] and a [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] were named in his honour. In addition, [[Mount Lyell]] in western Tasmania, Australia, located in a profitable mining area, bears Lyell’s name. The ancient jawless fish ''[[Cephalaspis|Cephalaspis lyelli]]'', which dwelt in the Scottish lakes, was named by [[Louis Agassiz]] in honour of Lyell.

==Career and major writings==
Lyell had private means, and earned further income as an author. He came from a prosperous family, worked briefly as a lawyer in the 1820s, and held the post of Professor of Geology at [[King's College London]] in the 1830s. From 1830 onward his books provided both income and fame. Each of his three major books was a work continually in progress. All three went through multiple editions during his lifetime, although many of his friends (such as Darwin) thought the first edition of the ''Principles'' was the best written.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin F. 1887. ''Life and letters of Charles Darwin'', vol II p90. London. Darwin F and Seward A.C. 1903. ''More letters of Charles Darwin'', vol II p232. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell used each edition to incorporate additional material, rearrange existing material, and revisit old conclusions in light of new evidence.

[[File:Charles Lyell00.jpg|thumb|Charles Lyell]]

''[[Principles of Geology]]'', Lyell's first book, was also his most famous, most influential, and most important. First published in three volumes in 1830–33, it established Lyell's credentials as an important geological theorist and propounded the doctrine of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/_0/history_12. Accessed 27 Nov. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a work of synthesis, backed by his own personal observations on his travels.

The central argument in ''Principles'' was that ''the present is the key to the past'' - a concept of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] which [[David Hume]] had stated as &quot;all inferences from experience suppose&amp;nbsp;... that the future will resemble the past&quot;, and [[James Hutton]] had described when he wrote in 1788 that &quot;from what has actually been, we have data for concluding with regard to that which is to happen thereafter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KEY TO THE PAST&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34786.htm |title=The Present is the Key to the Past is the Key to the Future |author=Elizabeth Lincoln Mathieson |date=May 13, 2002 |work= |publisher=The Geological Society of America |quote= |accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geological remains from the distant past can, and should, be explained by reference to geological processes now in operation and thus directly observable. Lyell's interpretation of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a powerful influence on the young [[Charles Darwin]]. Lyell asked [[Robert FitzRoy]], captain of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], to search for erratic boulders on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|survey voyage of the ''Beagle'']], and just before it set out FitzRoy gave Darwin Volume 1 of the first edition of Lyell's ''Principles''. When the ''Beagle'' made its first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]], Darwin found rock formations which seen &quot;through Lyell's eyes&quot; gave him a revolutionary insight into the geological history of the island, an insight he applied throughout his travels. 

While in [[South America]] Darwin received Volume 2 which considered the ideas of [[Lamarck]] in some detail. Lyell rejected Lamarck's idea of organic [[evolution]], proposing instead &quot;Centres of Creation&quot; to explain diversity and territory of species. However, as discussed [[Charles Lyell#Evolution|below]], many of his letters show he was fairly open to the idea of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Judd gives a number of examples: Judd J.W. 1910. ''The coming of evolution''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In geology Darwin was very much Lyell's disciple, and brought back observations and his own original theorising, including ideas about the formation of [[atoll]]s, which supported Lyell's uniformitarianism. On the return of the ''Beagle'' (October 1836) Lyell invited Darwin to dinner and from then on they were close friends. Although Darwin discussed evolutionary ideas with him from 1842, Lyell continued to reject evolution in each of the first nine editions of the ''Principles''. He encouraged Darwin to publish, and following the 1859 publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', Lyell finally offered a tepid endorsement of evolution in the tenth edition of ''Principles''.

[[File:Lyell Principles frontispiece.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece from ''Principles of Geology'']]

''[[Elements of Geology]]'' began as the fourth volume of the third edition of ''[[Principles of Geology|Principles]]'': Lyell intended the book to act as a suitable field guide for students of geology.&lt;ref name = &quot;czscax&quot;&gt;Bailey, Edward 1962. ''Charles Lyell''. Nelson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic, factual description of geological formations of different ages contained in ''Principles'' grew so unwieldy, however, that Lyell split it off as the ''Elements'' in 1838. The book went through six editions, eventually growing to two volumes and ceasing to be the inexpensive, portable handbook that Lyell had originally envisioned. Late in his career, therefore, Lyell produced a condensed version titled ''Student's Elements of Geology'' that fulfilled the original purpose.

''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' brought together Lyell's views on three key themes from the geology of the [[Quaternary Period]] of Earth history: glaciers, evolution, and the age of the human race. First published in 1863, it went through three editions that year, with a fourth and final edition appearing in 1873. The book was widely regarded as a disappointment because of Lyell's equivocal treatment of [[evolution]]. Lyell, a devout Christian, had great difficulty reconciling his beliefs with [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bynum W.F 1984&quot;&gt;Bynum W.F. 1984. Charles Lyell's ''Antiquity of Man'' and its critics. ''J. Hist Biol'' '''17''' 153–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific contributions==
Lyell's geological interests ranged from [[volcano]]es and geological dynamics through [[stratigraphy]], [[paleontology]], and [[glaciology]] to topics that would now be classified as [[archaeology|prehistoric archaeology]] and [[paleoanthropology]]. He is best known, however, for his role in popularising the doctrine of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].

===Uniformitarianism===
From 1830 to 1833 his multi-volume ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' was published. The work's subtitle was &quot;An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation&quot;, and this explains Lyell's impact on science. He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt; He was, along with the earlier [[John Playfair]], the major advocate of [[James Hutton]]'s idea of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. This was in contrast to [[catastrophism]], a geologic idea of abrupt changes, which had been adapted in England to support belief in [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]]. Lyell saw himself as &quot;the spiritual saviour of geology, freeing the science from the old dispensation of Moses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Porter|first=Roy S.| title=Charles Lyell and the Principles of the History of Geology|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|month=July|year=1976|vol=32|page=91|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two terms, ''uniformitarianism'' and ''catastrophism'', were both coined by [[William Whewell]];&lt;ref&gt;Whewell, William 1837. ''History of the Inductive Sciences'', vol IV of the Historical and Philosophical Works of William Whewell. Chapter VIII The two antagonistic doctrines of geology. [reprint of 3rd edition of 1857, publ. Cass 1967].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1866 R. Grove suggested the simpler term ''continuity'' for Lyells's view, but the old terms persisted. In various revised editions (12 in all, through 1872), ''Principles of Geology'' was the most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century, and did much to put geology on a modern footing. For his efforts he was knighted in 1848, then made a baronet in 1864.

===Geological Surveys===
Lyell noted the “economic advantages” that geological surveys could provide, citing their felicity in mineral-rich countries and provinces. Modern surveys, like the [[U.S. Geological Survey]], map and exhibit the natural resources within the country. So, in endorsing surveys, as well as advancing the study of geology, Lyell helped to forward the business of modern extractive industries, such as the coal and oil industry.

===Volcanoes and geological dynamics===
[[File:Vesuvius from plane.jpg|thumb|An aerial photo of Vesuvius]]
Before the work of Lyell, phenomena such as earthquakes were understood by the destruction that they wrought. One of the contributions that Lyell made in ''Principles'' was to explain the cause of earthquakes.&lt;ref name = &quot;byaztm&quot;&gt;Adams, Frank D. ''The Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences''. Dover Publications, Inc., 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell, in contrast focused on recent earthquakes (150 yrs), evidenced by surface irregularities such as faults, fissures, stratigraphic displacements and depressions.&lt;ref name = &quot;byaztm&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lyell's work on volcanoes focused largely on [[Vesuvius]] and [[Etna]], both of which he had earlier studied. His conclusions supported gradual building of volcanoes, so-called &quot;backed up-building&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;czscax&quot; /&gt; as opposed to the upheaval argument supported by other geologists.

===Stratigraphy===
Lyell's most important specific work was in the field of [[stratigraphy]]. From May 1828, until February 1829, he traveled with [[Roderick Impey Murchison]] (1792–1871) to the south of [[France]] (Auvergne volcanic district) and to [[Italy]].&lt;ref name = &quot;czscax&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macomber&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, Robert A. ''Scientist of Empire.'' Cambridge, UK. Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In these areas he concluded that the recent strata (rock layers) could be categorized according to the number and proportion of marine shells encased within. Based on this he proposed dividing the [[Tertiary]] period into three parts, which he named the [[Pliocene]], [[Miocene]], and [[Eocene]].

===Glaciers===
[[File:glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Lateral moraine on a glacier joining the Gorner Glacier, Zermatt, Switzerland.]]
In ''Principles of Geology'' (first edition, vol. 3, Ch. 2, 1833)&lt;ref name=&quot;Macomber&quot; /&gt; Lyell proposed that [[iceberg]]s could be the means of transport for [[Glacial erratic|erratics]]. During periods of global warming, ice breaks off the poles and floats across submerged continents, carrying debris with it, he conjectured. When the iceberg melts, it rains down sediments upon the land. Because this theory could account for the presence of diluvium, the word ''drift'' became the preferred term for the loose, unsorted material, today called ''till''. Furthermore, Lyell believed that the accumulation of fine angular particles covering much of the world (today called [[loess]]) was a deposit settled from mountain flood water. Today some of Lyell's mechanisms for geologic processes have been disproven, though many have stood the test of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt; His observational methods and general analytical framework remain in use today as foundational principles in geology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;

===Evolution===
Lyell first received a copy of one of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s books from [[Gideon Mantell|Mantell]] in 1827, when he was on circuit. He thanked Mantell in a letter which includes this enthusiastic passage:
:&quot;I devoured Lamark... his theories delighted me... I am glad that he has been courageous enough and logical enough to admit that his argument, if pushed as far as it must go, if worth anything, would prove that men may have come from the [[Orangutan|Ourang-Outang]]. But after all, what changes species may really undergo!... That the Earth is quite as old as he supposes, has long been my creed...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Lyell K. 1881. ''The life and letters of Sir Charles Lyell''. 2 vols, London. vol 1 p168&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Darwin.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Charles Darwin]]

In the second volume of the first edition of ''Principles'' Lyell explicitly rejected the ''mechanism'' of Lamark on the [[transmutation of species]], and was doubtful whether species were mutable.&lt;ref&gt;Lyell C. 1830-33. ''The principles of geology''. Murray, London. vol 2, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, privately, in letters, he was more open to the possibility of [[evolution]]:
:&quot;If I had stated... the possibility of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in contradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host of prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these mysterious subjects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lyell to [[William Whewell]], March 7, 1837. In Lyell K. 1881. ''The life and letters of Sir Charles Lyell''. 2 vols, London. vol 2 p5&lt;/ref&gt;

This letter makes it clear that his equivocation on evolution was, at least at first, a deliberate tactic. As a result of his letters and, no doubt, personal conversations, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] and [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] were convinced that, at the time he wrote ''Principles'', he believed new species had arisen by natural methods. Both [[William Whewell|Whewell]] and [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] wrote worried letters to him about this.&lt;ref&gt;see Judd J.W. 1910. ''The coming of evolution''. Cambridge. Chapter 8, p83–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] became a close personal friend, and Lyell was one of the first scientists to support ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', though he did not subscribe to all its contents. Lyell was also a friend of Darwin's closest colleagues, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], but unlike them he struggled to square his religious beliefs with evolution. This inner struggle has been much commented on. He had particular difficulty in believing in [[natural selection]] as the main motive force in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler P.J. 2003. ''Evolution: the history of an idea''. 3rd ed, California. 129–134, 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E. 1982. ''The growth of biological thought''. Harvard. (esp pp375–381 &amp; 404–408).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew M. 1973. Lyell and evolution: an account of Lyell's response to the prospect of an evolutionary ancestry for man. ''Brit J Hist Sci'' '''6''', p261–303.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A.R. Wallace in 1862.]]

Lyell and Hooker were instrumental in arranging the peaceful co-publication of the theory of natural selection by Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1858: each had arrived at the theory independently. Lyell's data on [[stratigraphy]] were important because Darwin thought that populations of an organism changed slowly, requiring &quot;geologic time&quot;. 

Although Lyell did not publicly accept evolution (descent with modification) at the time of writing the ''Principles'',&lt;ref&gt;Lyell C. 1830-33. ''The principles of geology''. Murray, London. vol 2, p20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; after the Darwin-Wallace papers and the ''Origin'' Lyell wrote in his notebook: 
:May 3, 1860: &quot;Mr. Darwin has written a work which will constitute an era in geology &amp; natural history to show that... the descendants of common parents may become in the course of ages so unlike each other as to be entitled to rank as a distinct species, from each other or from some of their progenitors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Leonard G. (ed) 1970. ''Sir Charles Lyell's scientific journals on the species question''. Yale University Press. p407&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyell's acceptance of natural selection, Darwin's proposed mechanism for evolution, was equivocal, and came in the tenth edition of ''Principles''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond A. 1982. ''Archetypes and Ancestors: palaeontology in Victorian London'' Blond &amp; Briggs, London. page 179: &quot;Even Charles Lyell agreed... that 'natural selection was a force quite subordinate to that variety-making or creative power to which all the wonders of the organic world must be referred.' &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Antiquity of Man]]'' (published in early February 1863, just before Huxley's ''Man's place in nature'') drew these comments from Darwin to Huxley:
:&quot;I am fearfully disappointed at Lyell's excessive caution&quot; and &quot;The book is a mere 'digest' &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhardt F. and Smith S. 1982–present. ''The correspondence of Charles Darwin.'' Cambridge, vol 11, p181 &amp; 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
Quite strong remarks: no doubt Darwin resented Lyell's repeated suggestion that he owed a lot to [[Lamarck]], whom he (Darwin) had always specifically rejected. Darwin's daughter Henrietta (Etty) wrote to her father: &quot;Is it fair that Lyell always calls your theory a modification of Lamarck's?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Burkhardt F. and Smith S. 1982–present. ''The correspondence of Charles Darwin.'' Cambridge, vol 11, p223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cape, ISBN 1-84413-314-1 Browne, E. Janet 2002. ''Charles Darwin: the power of place. Volume 2 of a biography''. Cape, London. page 219&lt;/ref&gt;

In other respects ''Antiquity'' was a success. It sold well, and it &quot;shattered the tacit agreement that mankind should be the sole preserve of [[theologian]]s and [[historian]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, E. Janet 2002. ''Charles Darwin: the power of place. Volume 2 of a biography''. Cape, London. p218&lt;/ref&gt; But when Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged, Darwin wrote &quot;Oh!&quot; in the margin of his copy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bynum W.F 1984&quot; /&gt;

'''Chelsea Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|s|iː}}) are an English [[Association football|football]] club based in [[West (London sub region)|West London]]. Founded in 1905, they play in the [[English Premier League|Premier League]] and have spent most of their history in the top tier of English football. Chelsea have been [[List of English football champions|English champions]] four times, [[FA Cup]] winners six times and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] winners four times. They have also been successful in Europe, winning the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chelseafc.com/xxchelsea180706/index.html#/page/TrophyCabinet | title=Trophy Cabinet | work=chelseafc.com| accessdate=25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club had their first major success in [[1954-55 in English football|1955]], when they won the league championship. Chelsea won several cup competitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but after that did not win another major title until 1997. The past decade has been the most successful period in Chelsea’s history, capped by winning Premier League titles in [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2005]], [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2006]] and [[2009–10 Premier League|2010]], the latter as part of their first league and FA Cup &quot;[[Double (association football)|Double]]&quot;.

Despite their name, the club are not based in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], but in neighbouring [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Fulham]]. The club's home is the 41,841 capacity [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] football stadium in [[Fulham]],&lt;ref name=&quot;capacity&quot;/&gt; where they have played since their establishment. Since 2003 they have been owned by Russian billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;takeover&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date=2 July 2003 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3036838.stm | title=Russian businessman buys Chelsea | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=11 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea's regular [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks, the combination used since the 1960s. The club crest has been changed several times in attempts to modernise or re-brand; the current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion holding a staff, is a modified version of one first adopted in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;new crest&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date=12 November 2004 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4008257.stm | title=Chelsea centenary crest unveiled | publisher=BBC Sport| accessdate=2 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club has sustained the fifth highest average all-time attendance in English football.&lt;ref name=&quot;attendance&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nufc.com/2010-11html/attendance-all-time.html | title=All Time League Attendance Records | accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their average home gate for the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]] was 41,435, the sixth highest in the Premier League.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonykempster.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tonykempster.co.uk/prematt.htm?comp=1 | title=Attendances 2009/10 | author=Kempster, Tony | accessdate=22 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chelsea Team 1905.jpg|thumb|250 px|The [[History of Chelsea F.C.|first Chelsea team]] in September 1905]]
Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),&lt;ref name=&quot;teamhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0,,10268~1800325,00.html|title=Team History|publisher=Chelsea FC|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on [[Fulham Road]], and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. The club's early years saw little success; the closest they came to winning a major trophy was reaching the [[1915 FA Cup Final]], where they lost to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Chelsea gained a reputation for signing big-name players&lt;ref name=&quot;glanville&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date=10 January 2004 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article992039.ece | title=Little sign of change for Chelsea and their impossible dreams | work=Times Online| accessdate=15 March 2009 | author=[[Brian Glanville]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for being entertainers, but made little impact on the English game in the inter-war years.

Former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and England centre-forward [[Ted Drake]] became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's [[Chelsea pensioner]] crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success — the League championship — in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]], but after objections from [[The Football League]] and the [[The Football Association|FA]] Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=27 April 2005 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,762-1586242,00.html | title=The great Chelsea surrender | work=Times Online | accessdate=29 December 2006 |author=[[Brian Glanville]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, and endured several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill, Rick | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography – The Definitive Story of the First 100 Years| publisher=Headline Book Publishing Ltd| year=2006| isbn=978-075531466-9 | page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Chelsea won the [[1970 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 1970]], beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] 2–1 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]].

The late 1970s through to the 1980s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious [[hooliganism|hooligan]] element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=143–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by [[Ken Bates]] for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, but in 1983 manager [[John Neal (footballer)|John Neal]] put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.

After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the [[1994 FA Cup Final]]. It was not until the appointment of former [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] [[Ruud Gullit]] as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top-class international players to the side, as the club [[1997 FA Cup Final|won the FA Cup in 1997]] and established themselves as one of England's top sides again. Gullit was replaced by [[Gianluca Vialli]], who led the team to victory in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]] and the [[1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|Cup Winners' Cup Final]] in 1998, the [[2000 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 2000]] and the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals in 2000. Vialli was sacked in favour of another Italian, [[Claudio Ranieri]], who guided Chelsea to the [[2002 FA Cup Final]] and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.

In June 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for £140 million, completing what was then the biggest-ever sale of an English football club.&lt;ref name=&quot;takeover&quot;/&gt; Over £100 million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies, so he was replaced by Portuguese coach [[José Mourinho]]. Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War ([[FA Premier League 2004–05|2004–05]] and [[FA Premier League 2005–06|2005–06]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/03/12/SOCCER_Chelsea.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer | title=Terry Eyes Back-to-Back Titles | publisher=Sporting Life | accessdate=22 January 2007 | author=Matt Barlow|date=12 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to winning an FA Cup ([[2007 FA Cup Final|2007]]) and two League Cups ([[2005 Football League Cup Final|2005]] and [[2007 Football League Cup Final|2007]]).

[[File:Chelsea-ilkmac.jpg|right|frame|Chelsea ''vs.'' [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at Stamford Bridge on 23 September 1905; Chelsea won 1–0.]]

Chelsea have only ever had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877. For the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletics Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother [[Joseph Mears|Joseph]], who had previously acquired additional land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 m²) site.&lt;ref name = &quot;stadium&quot;/&gt;

Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; They offered to lease the stadium to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], but were turned down. As a consequence, the owners decided to form their own football club to occupy their new ground. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge. Since there was already a football club named Fulham in the borough, the founders decided to adopt the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea for the new club, having also considered names such as ''Kensington FC'', ''Stamford Bridge FC'' and ''London FC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000.&lt;ref name = &quot;stadium&quot;/&gt; The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the &quot;Shed End&quot;, the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;&gt;{{cite web |

[[File:West Stand Champions.jpg|thumb|265px|left|View from the West Stand, Stamford Bridge during a Champions League game]]
During the late 1960s and early 70s, the club's owners embarked on a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a 50,000 all-seater stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt;
Work began on the East Stand in the early 1970s but the project was beset with problems and the cost almost brought the club to its knees, culminating in the [[Fee simple|freehold]] being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt; The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.

When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the [[Ken Bates]] era many additional features were added to the complex including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the &quot;Chelsea Village&quot; brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of ''&quot;Chelsea Village&quot;'' or ''&quot;The Village&quot;''.

[[File:Stamford-Bridge,WestStand entrance, day.jpg|thumb|255px|The Stamford Bridge West Stand – Entrance.]]
The Stamford Bridge [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], the [[Association football pitch|pitch]], the turnstiles and Chelsea's [[naming rights]] are now owned by [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chelsea's [[Cobham Training Centre|training ground]] is located in [[Cobham, Surrey]]. Chelsea moved to Cobham in 2004. Their previous training ground in [[Harlington, London|Harlington]] was taken over by [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Veysey, Wayne (24 May 2005), [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-18829718-qpr-take-over-chelsea-training-ground.do QPR take over Chelsea training ground], ''Evening Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; The new training facilities in Cobham were completed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/07/05/chelsea_ground_feature.shtml Chelsea's New Training Ground For The Future] BBC London, 5 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The club plans to increase the capacity of Stamford Bridge to over 50,000. Owing to its location in a built-up part of London on a main road and next to two railway lines, fans can only enter the stadium through the [[Fulham Road]] entrances, which places severe constraints on expansion due to [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Chelsea have been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge to sites including the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]], [[Battersea Power Station]] and the [[Chelsea Barracks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Crest==
Since the club's foundation, Chelsea have had four main crests, though all underwent minor variations. In 1905, Chelsea adopted as their first crest the image of a [[Chelsea pensioner]], which obviously contributed to the &quot;pensioner&quot; nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. As part of [[Ted Drake]]'s modernisation of the club from 1952 onwards, he insisted that the pensioner badge be removed from the match day programme in order to change the club's image and that a new crest be adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;crests&quot;&gt;{{cite web |

 title=Club Badges |
 work=chelseafc.com|accessdate = 21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a stop-gap, a temporary emblem comprising simply the initials C.F.C. was adopted for one year.

In 1953, Chelsea's crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a [[staff (stick)|staff]], which was to endure for the next three decades. This crest was based on elements in the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs. This was the first club badge to appear on shirts, since the policy of putting the crest on the shirts was only adopted in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;crests&quot;/&gt;

In 1986, with [[Ken Bates]] now owner of the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and to capitalise on new marketing opportunities.&lt;ref name=&quot;crests&quot;/&gt; The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, yellow and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. It lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours. With new ownership, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the club's traditional badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2004. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marks a return to the older design of the blue heraldic lion holding a staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;new crest&quot;/&gt; As with previous crests, this one has appeared in various colours, including white and gold.

Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they initially adopted a lighter shade than the current version, and unlike today wore white shorts and dark blue socks. The lighter blue was taken from the racing colours of then club president, [[Earl Cadogan]]. The light blue shirts were short-lived, however, and replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glanvill, Rick | title=Chelsea Football Club: The Official History in Pictures| year=2006| isbn=0-7553-1467-0}} p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Chelsea manager [[Tommy Docherty]] changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mears, Brian | title=Chelsea: Football Under the Blue Flag| publisher=Mainstream Sport| year=2002| isbn=1-84018-658-5 | page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.

Chelsea's traditional away colours are all yellow or all white with blue trim, but, as with most teams, they have had some more unusual ones. The first away strip consisted of black and white stripes and for one game in the 1960s the team wore blue and black stripes, inspired by [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]]'s kit, again at Docherty's behest.&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;Inter Milan&quot; kit was worn for an FA Cup semi-final against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], on 23 April 1966. Reference: Mears (2002), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Other memorable away kits include a mint green strip in the 1980s, a red and white checked one in the early 90s and a graphite and tangerine edition in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;All kits are discussed on the club's official website {{cite web

Chelsea's kit is currently manufactured by [[Adidas]], which is contracted to supply the club's kit from 2006 to 2011. Previously, the kit was manufactured by [[Umbro]] (1968–81), [[Le Coq Sportif]] (1981–86), The Chelsea Collection (1986–87) and Umbro again (1987–2006). Chelsea's first shirt sponsor was [[Gulf Air]], agreed midway through the 1983–84 season. Following that, the club were sponsored by Grange Farms, [[Peter Foster|Bai Lin Tea]] and Italian company Simod before a long-term deal was signed with computer manufacturer [[Commodore International]] in 1989; [[Amiga]], an off-shoot of Commodore, also appeared on the shirts. Chelsea were subsequently sponsored by [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer (1995–97), Autoglass (1997–2001) and [[Emirates Airline]] (2001–05). Chelsea's current shirt sponsor is [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

The '''CANada [[Deuterium]] [[Uranium]] reactor''' is a Canadian-invented, [[pressurized heavy water reactor]]. The acronym refers to its deuterium-oxide ([[heavy water]]) [[neutron moderator|moderator]] and its use of (originally, [[natural uranium|natural]]) [[uranium]] fuel. CANDU reactors were first developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by a partnership between [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL), the [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]] (now [[Ontario Power Generation]]), Canadian [[General Electric]] (now GE Canada), and other companies.
All current power reactors in [[Canada]] are of the CANDU type. The reactor is also marketed abroad. In December 2009, the Canadian Federal Government announced that they would be seeking private investors for a partial sell-off of its CANDU division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = CBC |url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/12/17/candu-reactor.html | title = CANDU reactor division to be sold | date = 2009-12-17 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CANDU reactor is similar to most [[light water reactor]]s: [[nuclear fission|Fission]] reactions in the reactor core heat pressurized heavy water in a ''primary cooling loop''. A [[heat exchanger]], also known as a [[steam generator]], transfers the heat to a light-water ''secondary cooling loop'', which powers a steam [[turbine]] with an [[electrical generator]] attached to it. The exhaust steam from the turbines is then condensed and returned as feedwater to the steam generator, often using cooling water from a nearby source, such as a lake, river, or ocean. Newer CANDU plants, such as the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]] near [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], use a diffuser to spread the warm condensor outlet water over a larger volume and limit the effects on the environment. A [[cooling tower]] can be used, but it reduces efficiency.

In an [[LWR]] (light water reactor), the entire reactor core is a single large pressure vessel containing the light water, which acts as moderator and coolant, and the fuel arranged in a series of long bundles running the length of the core. At the time of its design, Canada lacked the heavy industry to cast and machine the [[pressure vessel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basic CANDU Design&quot;&gt;[http://www.unene.ca/un802-2005/ben/BasicCANDUDesign.pdf Basic CANDU Design], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In CANDU the pressure (and the fuel bundles) is contained in much smaller (10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter), easier to fabricate tubes. Each bundle is a cylinder assembled from alloy tubes containing ceramic pellets of fuel. In older designs the assembly had 28 or 37 half-meter-long fuel tubes with 12 such assemblies lying end to end in a pressure tube. The newer [[CANFLEX]] bundle has 43 tubes, with two pellet sizes (so the power rating can be increased without melting the hottest pellets). It is about 10&amp;nbsp;cm (four inches) in diameter, 0.5&amp;nbsp;m (20&amp;nbsp;inches) long and weighs about 20&amp;nbsp;kg (44&amp;nbsp;lb) and replaces the 37-tube bundle. To allow the [[neutron]]s to flow freely between the bundles, the tubes and bundles are made of neutron-transparent [[zircaloy]] ([[zirconium]] + 2.5% wt [[niobium]]).

The zircaloy tubes are surrounded by a much larger low-pressure tank known as a [[calandria]], which contains the majority of the moderator. To keep the hot coolant from boiling the moderator, a so-called calandria tube surrounds each pressure tube, with insulating [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas in between. Also slowing down neutrons releases energy, so a cooling system dissipates the heat. The moderator is actually a large [[heat sink]] that acts as an additional [[nuclear safety|safety]] feature. If a fuel assembly overheated and deformed, the pressure tube would buckle and touch the calandria tube, [[heat transfer|releasing heat]] to the cool moderator, preventing the fuel rods from [[nuclear meltdown|melting down]] and breaching the fuel channel. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter fuel pellet fission reaction, though not stopping heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. This would initially be at about 7% of full reactor power, which requires significant cooling. The decay heat reduces as the half life of the fission products is relatively short. 

Normally the rate of fission is controlled by light-water compartments called liquid zone controllers, that absorb excess neutrons and by adjuster rods which can be raised or lowered in the core to control the neutron flux. There are two independent, fast-acting safety shutdown systems: Shutoff rods that drop under gravity into the core vertically, absorbing neutrons, and a secondary system injecting high-pressure [[gadolinium nitrate]] neutron absorber solution into the calandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#candu_control | title = Canadian Nuclear FAQ | work = The Canadian Nuclear FAQ by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock | accessdate=  2005-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor can be easily built to handle increased seismic stresses, if it's built in an earthquake-prone area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasmirt.org/SMiRT15/K13-1 Seismic Design and Analysis of CANDU Nuclear Power Plants], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasmirt.org/SMiRT17/k01-4.pdf |title=Seismic Design Features of The ACR Nuclear Power Plant |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CANDU's fuel channels in a low-pressure calandria design makes it easier to refuel: a pressure-vessel reactor must be shut down, the pressure dropped, the lid removed, and a sizeable fraction of the fuel, e.g. one-third, replaced all at once. In CANDU individual channels can be refuelled without taking the reactor off-line, improving the [[capacity factor]]. One fueling machine inserts new fuel into one end of the channel while the other receives discharged fuel from the opposite end.

{{see|nuclear reactor physics|nuclear fission|heavy water}}

The main advantage of [[heavy water]] [[moderator]] over light water is reduced absorption of the neutrons that sustain the chain reaction, allowing a lower concentration of active atoms (to the point of using unenriched natural uranium fuel). Natural uranium is a mix of [[isotope]]s, mostly [[uranium-238]] and  0.72% (by weight) of fissile [[uranium-235]]. A nuclear reactor aims to sustain a steady rate of fission reactions over time, a state known as &quot;[[critical mass|criticality]]&quot;: Neutrons released in fission cause an equal number of fission reactions  in other [[fissile|fissile atoms]].  These neutrons are fairly energetic and aren't easily captured; they must be slowed down (&quot;moderated&quot;) as much as possible, ideally to the same energy as the atoms themselves (&quot;[[thermal neutrons]]&quot;). During the process it helps to separate the neutrons and uranium, since &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U has a large affinity for intermediate energy neutrons (&quot;resonance&quot; absorption), but can only be easily fissioned by the few energetic neutrons above ~1.5-2 [[MeV]]. This is a fundamental reason for designing reactors with discrete solid fuel separated by moderator, rather than a mixture of the two. Light water makes an excellent moderator - the [[hydrogen|light hydrogen]] atoms are very close in mass to a neutron and can absorb a lot of energy in a single collision (like a collision of two billiard balls). However, light hydrogen is also fairly effective at absorbing neutrons, and there will be too few left over to react with the small amount of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U in natural uranium, preventing criticality. [[Deuterium]] (&quot;heavy hydrogen&quot;) already has the extra neutron that light hydrogen would absorb, reducing the capture rate.

Deuterium is twice the mass of light hydrogen or a neutron; the mismatch means more collisions are needed to slow the neutrons, and a larger distance between the fuel rods. This increases the size of the reactor (it would mean a very large pressure vessel and was the final straw in favor of a calandria design)&lt;ref name=&quot;Basic CANDU Design&quot;/&gt; and the leakage of neutrons. The lower &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U density in natural uranium also generally implies that less of the fuel will be consumed before the fission rate drops too low to sustain criticality (due primarily to the relative depletion of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U compared with the build-up of parasitic [[fission product]]s). However, in CANDU most of the moderator is at lower temperatures than in other designs, reducing the spread of speeds and the overall speed of the moderator particles. This means most of the neutrons are at a lower energy and more likely to cause fission, so CANDU not only &quot;burns&quot; natural uranium, but does it more effectively as well. Overall CANDU reactors use 30–40% less mined uranium than light-water reactors per unit of electricity produced (including savings on uranium enrichment).

Another solution, used in [[light water reactor]]s, is fuel [[enriched uranium|enriched]] to between 2% and 5% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (the depleted fraction is called [[depleted uranium]]). However enrichment facilities are expensive to build and operate. They're also a [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] concern as they can be used to enrich the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U much further, up to [[weapons-grade]] material (90% or more &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U). Although this can be dealt with if the fuel is supplied and reprocessed by an [[International Atomic Energy Agency|internationally approved]] supplier.
Canada lacked access to enrichment facilities at the time, while America [[zippe-type centrifuge#centrifuge uranium enrichment|classified work on the cheaper gas centrifuge process]]. The CANDU was therefore designed to use natural uranium, like the first Canadian reactor [[ZEEP]]. 

A further unique feature of heavy-water moderation is the greater stability of the [[chain reaction]]. This is due to the relatively low binding energy of the deuterium nucleus (2.2 MeV), leading to some [[n,2n|energetic neutrons]] and especially [[Photodisintegration|gamma rays]] breaking the nuclei apart and producing extra neutrons. Both gammas produced directly by fission and by the decay of [[Nuclear fission products|fission fragments]] have enough energy, and the half-lives of the fission fragments range from seconds to hours or even years. As all neutrons are taken into account when performing any action, the presence of photoneutrons delays the [[Nuclear chain reaction#Timescales of nuclear chain reactions|response of the reactor]] and gives the operators extra time in case of an emergency. Since [[gamma ray]]s travel for meters through water, an increased rate of chain reaction in one part of the reactor will produce a response from the rest of the reactor, allowing various negative feedbacks to stabilize the reaction.

==Fuel cycles==
[[File:CANDU fuel cycles.jpg|thumb|right|400px|'''Range of possible CANDU fuel cycles:'''  CANDU reactors can accept a variety of fuel types, including the used fuel from light-water reactors]]

A heavy water design can sustain a chain reaction with a lower concentration of fissile atoms than light water reactors, allowing it to use some alternative fuels. E.g., &quot;recovered uranium&quot; (RU) from used LWR fuel can be used. CANDU was designed for natural uranium with only 0.7% U-235, so RU with 0.9% U-235 is a rich fuel. This extracts a further 30-40% energy from the uranium. The DUPIC (''Direct Use of spent PWR fuel In CANDU'') process under development can recycle it even without reprocessing. The fuel is sintered in air (oxidized), then in hydrogen (reduced) to break it into a powder, which is then formed into CANDU fuel pellets.
CANDU can also [[thorium fuel cycle|breed fuel]] from the more abundant [[thorium]]. This is being [[thorium fuel cycle|investigated]] by India to take advantage of its natural thorium reserves.

Even [[MOX fuel#Overview|better than LWRs]], CANDU can burn [[mixed oxide fuel|a mix]] of uranium and plutonium, the plutonium either from dismantled [[nuclear weapon]]s or reprocessed reactor fuel. The mix of isotopes in reprocessed plutonium is not attractive for weapons, but can be used as fuel (instead of being simply nuclear waste), while burning weapons plutonium eliminates a proliferation hazard. 
If the aim is explicitly to burn plutonium and/or other [[actinide]]s from spent fuel, then special inert-matrix fuels are proposed to do this more efficiently than MOX. Since they contain no uranium, they do not breed any extra plutonium while burning it.

==Chronology==
The first CANDU-type reactor was [[Nuclear Power Demonstration]] (NPD), in Rolphton, Ontario. It was intended as a proof-of-concept and rated for only 22 [[MWe]], a very low power for a commercial power reactor.  NPD produced the first nuclear-generated electricity in Canada, and ran successfully from 1962 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Canadian Nuclear Society |url = http://www.cns-snc.ca/event/npd/npd_main_eng.htm | title = NPD Historical Plaque | date = 2007-07-07}} {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-75-104-896/science_technology/candu/clip3] {{Dead link|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second CANDU was the [[Douglas Point]] reactor, a more powerful version rated at roughly 200 [[MWe]] and located near [[Kincardine, Ontario|Kincardine]], Ontario.  It went into service in 1968, and ran until 1984. Uniquely among CANDU stations, Douglas Point had an oil-filled window with a view of the east reactor face, even when the reactor was operating.  The Douglas Point type was exported to [[India]], and was the basis for India's fleet of domestically designed and built &quot;CANDU-derivatives&quot;. Douglas Point was originally planned to be a two-unit station, but the second unit was cancelled because of the success of the larger 515 MWe units at [[Pickering Nuclear Generating Station|Pickering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/DouglasPoint.html | author = Canadian Nuclear Society | title = The Douglas Point Story|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080517095721/http%3A//www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/DouglasPoint.html |archivedate = May 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/AECL-2400/AECL2400-1.html | author = Canadian Nuclear Society | title = Douglas Point Nuclear Power Station|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080319113419/http%3A//www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/AECL-2400/AECL2400-1.html |archivedate = March 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Centrale nucléaire Gentilly.jpg|thumb|left|The Gentilly-1 nuclear generating station (right), in [[Bécancour, Quebec]], was closed in the late 1970s. The Gentilly-2 plant (left), a CANDU-6 reactor, is operational since 1983. It is owned and operated by [[Hydro-Québec]].]]
In parallel with the classic CANDU design, experimental variants were being developed.  [[WR-1]], located at the [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]]'s [[Whiteshell Laboratories]] in [[Pinawa, Manitoba]], used vertical pressure tubes and organic [[Petroleum|oil]] as the primary coolant.  The oil used has a higher boiling point than water, allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor.  WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.  [[Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station|Gentilly-1]], near [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec]], was also an experimental version of CANDU, using a boiling light-water coolant and vertical pressure tubes, but was not considered successful and closed after seven years of fitful operation.

The successes at NPD and Douglas Point led to the decision to construct the first multi-unit station in Pickering, Ontario.  Pickering A, consisting of Units 1 to 4, went into service in 1971.  Pickering B with units 5 to 8 came online in 1983, giving a full-station capacity of 4,120 MWe.  The station is very close to the city of [[Toronto]], in order to reduce [[electric power transmission|transmission]] costs.

Pickering A was placed into voluntary lay-up in 1997, as a part of [[Ontario Hydro]]'s Nuclear Improvement plan.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Hydro was split up into five successor companies in 1999 and the electricity generating division of Ontario Hydro was named [[Ontario Power Generation]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Units 1 and 4 have since returned to service, although with significant cost overruns on Unit 4. (Unit 1 was essentially on-time and on-budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.opg.com/pdf/pickbfaqs.pdf | title = Pickering B Refurbishment Project Questions and Answers | work = Pickering B Refurbishment Project Questions and Answers by Ontario Power Generation | accessdate=  2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 2005, the successor [[Ontario Power Generation]] announced that Units 2 and 3 would not be refurbished, contrary to expectations. Their condition - especially the steam generators - was much poorer than Units 1 and 4, making refurbishment uneconomical. They were put in long term storage mode, defuelled and drained, in 2010.

The second multi-unit, [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]], was constructed in stages between 1970 and 1987. It is the largest nuclear facility in North America, and second largest in the world (after [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki-Kariwa]] in Japan), with eight [[nuclear reactor|reactors]] at around 800 MWe each, in total 6,232&amp;nbsp;MW (net) and 7,276&amp;nbsp;MW (gross). Current output with six of the eight reactors on line is 4,640&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/Page.asp?PageID=122&amp;ContentID=5363&amp;SiteNodeID=305&amp;BL_ExpandID= |title=The Need for More Transmission in Bruce Region |accessdate=2008-04-18 |publisher=Ontario Power Authority}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restart of the remaining two units is planned by 2012.

==Economics==
The neutron economy of heavy water moderation and precise control of on-line refueling allow CANDU to use a great range of fuels other than enriched uranium, e.g. natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, [[thorium]], [[plutonium]], and used LWR fuel. Given the expense of enrichment, this can make fuel much cheaper. There is however an initial investment into the tonnes of 99.75% pure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e|title=Canadian Nuclear FAQ|work=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock|accessdate=March 5, 2005}} [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e A. CANDU Nuclear Power Technology A.3 What is &quot;heavy water&quot;?] ''&quot;reactor-grade&quot; heavy water, nominally 99.75 wt% deuterium content.''&lt;/ref&gt; heavy water to fill the core and heat transfer system.

Since heavy water is less efficient at slowing neutrons, CANDU needs a larger moderator to fuel ratio and a larger core for the same power output. Although a calandria-based core is cheaper to build, its size increases cost for standard features like the [[containment building]]. The next generation [[Advanced CANDU Reactor]] (ACR) mitigates these disadvantages by having light water coolant and using a more compact core with less moderator. Generally nuclear plant construction and operations are ~65% of overall lifetime cost; for CANDU costs are dominated by construction even more. Fueling CANDU is cheaper than other reactors, costing only ~10% of the total, so the overall price per kWh electricity is comparable.

When first introduced, CANDUs offered much better [[capacity factor]] (ratio of power generated to what would be generated by running at full power, 100% of the time) than LWRs of a similar generation. The light-water designs spent, on average, about half the time being refueled or maintained. However, since the 1980s dramatic improvements in LWR outage management have narrowed the gap, with several units achieving capacity factors ~90% and higher, with an overall fleet performance of 89.5% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nei.org/documents/U.S.%20Nuclear%20Industry%20is%20Achieving%20Record%20Levels%20of%20Performance.pdf US Fleet Performance] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest-generation CANDU 6 reactors have a 88-90% CF, but overall performance is dominated by the older Canadian units with CFs on the order of 80%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cns-snc.ca/branches/Toronto/energy/wind_vs_nuclear.doc CANDU Lifetime Performance to November 30, 2001]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some CANDU plants suffered from cost overruns during construction, mainly from external factors. For instance, a number of imposed construction delays led to roughly a doubling of the cost of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, Ontario. Technical problems and redesigns added about another billion to the resulting $14.4 billion price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canducanada.ca/eng/darlington.html Team CANDU, Debunking Darlington] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magma.ca/~jalrober/CANcosts.htm &quot;Can CANDU estimates be trusted?&quot;] by J.A.L. Robertson (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, more recently two CANDU 6 reactors at Qinshan in China were completed on-schedule and on-budget, an achievement attributed to tight control over scope and schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canteach.candu.org/library/20031701.pdf Qinshan CANDU Project Construction Experiences]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear nonproliferation ==
In terms of safeguards against nuclear weapons [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]], CANDUs meet a similar level of international certification as other reactors. There is a common misconception that plutonium for India's first nuclear detonation, [[Operation Smiling Buddha]] in 1974, was produced in a CANDU design. In fact, it was produced in the unsafeguarded Canada-supplied [[CIRUS]] reactor whose design is based on the [[NRX]], a Canadian research reactor. In addition to its two CANDU reactors, India has some unsafeguarded [[pressurised heavy water reactor]]s (PHWRs) based on the CANDU design, and two safeguarded light-water reactors supplied by the US. Plutonium has been extracted from the spent fuel from all of these reactors;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The design is believed to be derived from the CIRUS reactor, with the Dhruva being scaled-up for more efficient plutonium production. It is this reactor which is thought to have produced the plutonium for India's more recent (1998) [[Operation Shakti]] nuclear tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although heavy water is relatively immune to neutron capture, a small amount of the deuterium turns into [[tritium]] in this way. Tritium+deuterium mix undergoes [[nuclear fusion]] more easily than any other substance. Tritium can be used in both the &quot;fusion boost&quot; of a [[boosted fission weapon]] and the main fusion process of an [[H-bomb]]. However, in an H-bomb, it's usually created ''in situ'' by neutron irradiation of [[Isotopes of lithium#Lithium-6|lithium-6]].

Tritium is extracted from some CANDU plants in Canada, mainly to improve safety in case of heavy-water leakage. The gas is stockpiled and used in a variety of commercial products, notably [[Self-powered lighting|&quot;powerless&quot; lighting systems]] and medical devices. In 1985 what was then Ontario Hydro sparked controversy in Ontario due to its plans to sell tritium to the U.S.  The plan, by law, involved sales to non-military applications only, but some speculated that the exports could have freed American tritium for the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Future demands appear to outstrip production, in particular the demands of future generations of experimental [[fusion reactor]]s like [[ITER]]. Currently between 1.5 and 2.1&amp;nbsp;kg of tritium are recovered yearly at the Darlington separation facility, of which a minor fraction is sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.lanl.gov/willms/Presentations/Tritium_Supply_Considerations.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}  {{Wayback|url=http://public.lanl.gov/willms/Presentations/Tritium_Supply_Considerations.pdf|date =20041224152735}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 [[Operation Shakti]] test series in India included one bomb of about 45 kT yield that India has publicly claimed was a hydrogen bomb. An offhand comment in the [[BARC]] publication ''Heavy Water&amp;nbsp;— Properties, Production and Analysis'' appears to suggest that the tritium was extracted from the heavy water in the CANDU and PHWR reactors in commercial operation. ''Janes Intelligence Review'' quotes the Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission as admitting to the tritium extraction plant, but refusing to comment on its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ccnr.org/india_tritium.html | author =  Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility | title = Tritium from Power Plants gives India an H-bomb capability | date = 1996-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However India is also capable of creating tritium more efficiently by irradiation of lithium-6 in reactors.

[[File:Pickering-nuclear-generating-station-001.jpg|right|thumb|700px|[[Pickering Nuclear Generating Station]], a CANDU design]]

==Active CANDU reactors==
Today there are 29 CANDU reactors in use around the world, and  13 &quot;CANDU-derivatives&quot; in India, developed from the CANDU design after India detonated a nuclear bomb in 1974 and Canada stopped nuclear dealings with India. The breakdown is:
* [[Canada]]: 17 (+3 refurbishing, +5 decommissioned)
* [[South Korea]]: 4
* [[China]]: 2
* [[India]]: 2 (+13 CANDU-derivatives in use, +3 CANDU-derivatives under construction)
* [[Argentina]]: 1
* [[Romania]]: 2 (+3 under construction, currently dormant)
* [[Pakistan]]: 1

==New plants==
Interest continues in new CANDU construction around the world, and CANDU is competing in open bids alongside LWR technology.

Two new CANDU reactors have been proposed in [[Ontario]], Canada, a province that currently generates over 50% of its electricity from CANDU reactors, with Canadian government help with financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0743618220080807?sp=true|title=Canada nuclear firms seek Ottawa financing|date=August 7, 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2008-08-10 | first=David | last=Ljunggren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest has also been expressed in [[Western Canada]], where CANDU reactors are being considered as heat and electricity sources for the energy-intensive [[tar sands|oil sands]] extraction process, which currently uses [[natural gas]]. [[Energy Alberta Corporation]] announced August 27, 2007 that they had applied for a licence to build a new nuclear plant at Lac Cardinal (30&amp;nbsp;km west of the town of [[Peace River, Alberta]]), two [[AECL]] ACR-1000 reactors going online in 2017 producing 2.2 [[gigawatt]] (electric).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertaindex.com/content/view/213/1/ Lac Cardinal (Alberta Index)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2007/08/28/alberta-nuclear.html Lac Cardinal (CBC) 2007-08-28]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehilltimes.ca/pdf/2007/060407_ht.pdf ''The Hill Times'' page 26, 2007-06-04]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romania]] is in discussions for the completion of its nuclear plant at [[Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant|Cernavodă]] (two reactors built in 1996 and 2007 and three more unfinished). The project was interrupted at the close of the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime.

[[Turkey]] has repeatedly shown interest in the CANDU reactor, but currently plans to build reactors of a different type.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey's nuclear future&quot;&gt;[http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/8488525 Turkey's nuclear future]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been anti-nuclear protests in the past, e.g. in April 2006 plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Ince peninsula caused a large anti-nuclear demonstration in the Turkish city of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]].&lt;ref&gt;From http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?47326-Thousands-protest-Turkey-s-plans-to-build-nuclear-power-plant (retrieved 2010-11-08, 0410 UTC).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From http://energynewsletterturkey.blogspot.com/2006_04_01_archive.html (retrieved 2010-11-08, 0410 UTC).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opposition, Turkey aims to have five nuclear power plants by 2030.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey's nuclear future&quot;/&gt;

===Enhanced CANDU 6===
The Enhanced CANDU 6 is an evolutionary upgrade of the CANDU 6 design with a gross output of 740 MWe per unit. The reactors are designed with a lifetime of over fifty years, with a mid-life program to replace some of the key components e.g. the fuel channels. The projected average annual [[capacity factor]] is more than ninety percent. Improvements to construction techniques (including modular, open-top assembly) decrease construction costs.

Enhancements include an ultrasonic flow meter (UFM) to improve the accuracy of feedwater flow measurements, improvements in turbine design and changes in the condenser vacuum system for operation at lower condenser pressures. Other features continue to be developed. The main improvements over CANDU 6 are:

* increased plant margins, both [[operating margin|operational profit]] and safety
* faster project completion
* enhanced environmental protection
* improved severe accident response
* improved fire protection system
* improved plant security
* modern computers and control systems, advanced control room design
* improved operability and maintainability
* optimized maintenance outages
* advanced MACSTOR facility for spent fuel storage
* operation at 50%-100% of full power, following electricity demand

===Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR-1000)===
{{Main|Advanced CANDU Reactor}}
ACR-1000 is the next-generation (officially, &quot;Generation III+&quot;) CANDU technology which makes some significant modifications to the existing CANDU design. It is expected that capital cost will be up to 40% lower than current CANDU 6 plants. Its main advantages are:

* longer lifetime (60 years)
* longer operating cycles between maintenance outages (3 years)
* 90% design capacity factor
* pre-stressed concrete containment (1.8&amp;nbsp;m thick) with steel liner
* further additions to CANDU's inherent passive safety
* compact fuel-channel design, generating over 50% more power with similar core diameter, average channel power increased from ~6 MW to ~7 MW
* improved efficiency through higher-temperature and pressure steam turbines (13 MPa primary pressure and 7 MPa outlet pressure, vs. around 10 MPa and 5 MPa in current designs)
* light-water coolant, with negative [[void coefficient|void reactivity]] and no tritium production in coolant
* [[enriched uranium#slightly enriched uranium|slightly enriched uranium]] fuel (1-2%), extending fuel life so that only a third as much used fuel is produced
* heavy water use reduced to only a third for the same power output, reducing cost
* flatter neutron flux shape, allowing 14% lower heat production in the hottest fuel elements

In both EC6 and ACR-1000 the defining features of CANDU are all maintained:

* modular, horizontal fuel channel core
* heavy water moderation
* simple, cheap fuel bundle
* separate, cool, low-pressure moderator with back-up heat sink capability
* two independent, fast-acting shutdown systems
* on-power refuelling, allowing easier long-term neutron flux shaping and dealing with damaged fuel bundles

In 2007 AECL submitted the ACR-1000 design to the British Generic Design Assessment process to evaluate reactors for a new British nuclear power station program. However in 2008 AECL withdrew the design, stating it &quot;is focusing its marketing and licensing resources for the advanced Candu reactor on the immediate needs of the Canadian domestic marketplace.&quot;&lt;ref name=cbc-20080404&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/04/04/aecl-britain.html|title=AECL bows out of British reactor development to focus on Canadian projects|date=April 4, 2008|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tritium emissions==
[[Tritium]] is a radioactive form of [[hydrogen]] (H-3), with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. It is found in small amounts in nature (about 4&amp;nbsp;kg globally), created by [[cosmic ray]] interactions in the upper atmosphere. Tritium is considered a weak [[radionuclide]] because of its low-energy radioactive emissions ([[beta particle]] energy 0 -19 keV).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/ReviewofGreenpeacereport_Final.pdf reviewed by Dr. Richard Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; The beta particles do not travel very far in air and do not penetrate skin, so the main hazard is intake into the body (inhalation, ingestion, or absorption).

Tritium is generated in the fuel of all reactors; however, CANDU reactors generate tritium also in their coolant and moderator, due to [[neutron capture]] in heavy hydrogen.  Some of this tritium escapes into containment and is generally recovered; however a small percentage (about 1%) escapes containment and is considered a routine radioactive emission (also higher than from an LWR of comparable size). Operating a CANDU plant therefore includes monitoring tritium in the surrounding environment (and publishing the results).

In some CANDU reactors the tritium is periodically extracted.  Typical emissions from CANDU plants in Canada are less than 1% of the national regulatory limit, which is based on [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opg.com/safety/nsafe/nuclear/faq.asp |title=Ontario Power Generation: Safety |publisher=Opg.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, the maximum permitted drinking water concentration for tritium in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/water-eau/drink-potab/guide/index-eng.php |title=Canadian Drinking Water Guidelines |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7000 Bq/L, corresponds to 1/10 of the ICRP's dose limit for members of the public).  Tritium emissions from other CANDU plants are similarly low.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.djs.si/proc/port2001/pdf/508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nirs.org/radiation/tritium/tritium06122007gphazardreport.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Tritiumstudyfinal-11-06-07.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there is significant public controversy about radioactive emissions from nuclear power plants, and for CANDU plants one of the main concerns is tritium.   In 2007 [[Greenpeace]] published a [http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/canada/en/documents-and-links/publications/tritium-hazard-report-pollu.pdf critique of tritium emissions] from Canadian nuclear power plants by Dr. Ian Fairlie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccatoxicwaste.org/rad2.htm |title=Dr Ian Fairlie |publisher=www.ccatoxicwaste.org |accessdate=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This report was [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/ReviewofGreenpeacereport_Final.pdf criticized by Dr. Richard Osborne].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cna.ca/english/pdf/Studies/BioDr-Richard_Osborne.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cuitláhuac''' (c. 1476 &amp;ndash; 1520)&lt;ref&gt;For year of birth, see entry for [http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/1.hist/CU.html#CUITLAHUAC &quot;CUITLAHUAC&quot;], ''Dictionnaire de la langue nahuatl classique'' (Wimmer 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''Cuitláhuac''' (in Spanish orthography; in {{lang-nah|cuitlāhuac}},&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; honorific form '''Cuitlahuatzin''') was the 10th ''[[tlatoani]]'' (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlan]] for 80 days during the year [[Aztec calendar|Two Flint]] (1520).&lt;ref name=&quot;cha&quot;&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 56–57, 164–165, 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuitláhuac was the eleventh son of the ruler [[Axayacatl]] and a younger brother of [[Moctezuma II]], the previous ruler of Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother's father, also called [[Cuitlahuatzin I|Cuitlahuac]], had been ruler of [[Itztapalapan]],&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and the younger Cuitláhuac also ruled there initially.&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuitláhuac was made ''tlatoani'' of Tenochtitlan during the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]]; After Pedro de Alvarado had ordered [[the massacre in the Main Temple]], the Aztecs were very upset and started to fight and put a siege to the Spaniards. [[Hernán Cortés]] ordered Moctezuma to ask his people to stop fighting. Moctezuma told him that they would not listen to him and suggested Cortés free Cuitláhuac so that he could convince them to dispose of their arms and not fight anymore. Cortés then freed Cuitláhuac and once Cuitláhuac was free he led his people against the conquistadors. He succeeded and the Spaniards were driven out of Tenochtitlan on June 30, 1520. Cuitláhuac was ritually married to Moctezuma's eldest daughter, a ten or eleven year old girl who later was called [[Isabel Moctezuma]].&lt;ref&gt;Chipman, Donald E. (2005). Moctezuma's Children: Aztec Royalty Under Spanish Rule, 1520–1700. Austin: University of Texas Press, pp. 40-41 ISBN 0-292-70628-6. OCLC 5713428&lt;/ref&gt;

After having ruled for just 80 days, Cuitláhuac died of [[smallpox]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cha&quot;/&gt; that had been introduced to the [[New World]] by the [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]. His elder brother [[Matlatzincatzin]], who had been ''[[cihuacoatl (position)|cihuacoatl]]'' (&quot;president&quot;), resigned upon Cuitláhuac's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;chb&quot;&gt;Probably from Chimalpahin (1997); broken reference.&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as Cuitláhuac died, [[Cuauhtémoc]] was made the next ''tlatoani''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cha&quot;/&gt;

The modern [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[municipio (Mexico)|municipality]] of [[Cuitláhuac, Veracruz]] and the [[Mexico City Metro]] station [[Metro Cuitláhuac]] are named in honor of Cuitláhuac. The [[asteroid]] [[2275 Cuitláhuac]] is also named after this ruler.

There is an Avenue in Mexico City Called Cuitláhuac (Eje 3 Norte) that runs from Avenue Insurgentes to Avenue Mexico-Tacuba and that is part of an inner ring; also many streets in other towns and villages in Mexico are so called.

'''Cuauhtémoc''' (also known as '''Cuauhtemotzin''', '''Guatimozin''' or '''Guatemoc'''; c. 1495&lt;ref name=mexconnect&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuck|first=Jim|title=Cuauhtemoc: winner in defeat (1495–1525)|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/260-cuauhtemoc-winner-in-defeat-1495%E2%80%931525|work=MexConnect|publisher=Conexión México S.A de C.V., and MexConnect.Com LLC|accessdate=23 April 2011|date=09 Oct 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – 28 February 1525) was the [[Aztec]] ruler (''[[tlatoani]]'') of [[Tenochtitlan]] from 1520 to 1521.  The name Cuāuhtemōc (Nahuatl pronunciation: [kʷaːʍˈtemoːk]) means &quot;One That Has Descended Like an Eagle&quot;, commonly rendered in English as &quot;Stooping Eagle&quot; as in the moment when an eagle folds its wings and plummets down to strike its prey, so this is a name that implies aggressiveness and determination.

Cuauhtémoc took power in 1520 as successor of [[Cuitláhuac]] and was a nephew of the former emperor [[Moctezuma II]], and his young wife, who would later be known as [[Isabel Moctezuma]], was one of Moctezuma's daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;mexconnect&quot; /&gt;  He ascended to the throne when he was 25 years of age,&lt;ref name=&quot;mexconnect&quot; /&gt; as his city was being besieged by the [[Spain|Spanish]] and devastated by an epidemic of [[smallpox]] brought to the New World by Spanish Invaders. Probably after the [[The Massacre in the Main Temple, Tenochtitlán|killings in the main temple]], there were few Aztec captains available to take the position.

==Attempt to escape and capture==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2006}}

On August 13, 1521, Cuauhtémoc went to call for reinforcements from the countryside to aid the falling Tenochtitlán, after eighty days of continuous  urban warfare against the Spanish. Of all the Nahuas, only Tlatelolcas remained loyal, and the surviving Tenochcas looked for refuge in [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] where even women took part in the battle.  Cuauhtémoc was captured while fleeing [[Tenochtitlán]] by crossing [[Lake Texcoco]] in disguise with his wife, family, and friends. He surrendered to [[Hernán Cortés]] along with the surviving ''[[pipiltin]]'' (nobles), and offered him his knife and asked to be killed.

At first, Cortés treated his foe chivalrously. &quot;A Spaniard knows how to respect valor even in an enemy,&quot; he declared.  However, he allowed [[Aldrete]], the royal treasurer, to have Cuauhtemoc tortured to make him reveal the whereabouts of hidden treasure. Cuauhtémoc, insisting that there was no hidden treasure, stood up under the ordeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;mexconnect&quot; /&gt;

==Torture==
[[File:Cuahtemoc.jpg|thumb|300px|right|&quot;The Torture of Cuauhtémoc&quot;, a 19th century painting by [[Leandro Izaguirre]].]]

Cuauhtémoc was tortured by having his feet put to a fire, along with [[Tetlepanquetzal]], the ''tlatoani'' of [[Tlacopán]], and the ''Cihuacóatl'' (counselor) [[Diego Velázquez Tlacotzin|Tlacotzin]], but even so they refused to divulge information about the treasures the Spanish coveted. It is said that during the torture, Tetlepanquetzal asked him to reveal the location of the treasures in order to stop the pain given to them, and Cuauhtémoc is quoted to say &quot;Do you think I am in a bath for pleasure?&quot; This would be popularized in the 19th century as &quot;Do you think I am in a bed of roses?&quot; The date and details of this episode are unknown.  In the end, a shamed Cortés delivered Cuauhtémoc from Aldrete's hands.

Eventually Cortés recovered some gold from a noble's house, but most of the tales about &quot;Aztec gold&quot; were a myth. Since for the Aztecs, gold had no intrinsic value{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}, they did not have big solid pieces of gold, instead they preferred wood covered with gold. After those pieces were melted, they only gave a fraction of the gold that Cortés and his men expected.

==Execution==
[[File:CuauhtemocLastMsgDF.JPG|thumb|Mosaic of what is considered to be Cuauhtemoc's last address as tlatoani in Nahuatl and Spanish]]
In 1525, Cortés took Cuauhtémoc and several other indigenous nobles on his expedition to [[Honduras]], fearing that Cuauhtémoc could have led an insurrection in his absence.&lt;ref name = &quot;otbjad&quot;&gt;Restall (2004, p.148).&lt;/ref&gt; While the expedition was stopped in the [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]] capital of [[Itzamkanac]], known as [[Acalan]] in [[Nahuatl]], Cortés had Cuauhtémoc [[execution|executed]] for allegedly conspiring to kill him and the other Spaniards.

[[File:Statue of Cuautemoc.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Cuauhtémoc on [[Paseo de la Reforma|Avenida Reforma]] in [[Mexico City]]. The inscription at the bottom of the statue translates as &quot;In memory of Cuauhtémoc (spelled Quautemoc) and his warriors who battled heroically in defense of their country.&quot;]]
There are a number of discrepancies in the various accounts of the event. According to Cortés himself, on 27 February 1525 it was revealed to him by a citizen of [[Tenochtitlan]] named Mexicalcingo that Cuauhtémoc, [[Coanacoch]] (the ruler of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]) and [[Tetlepanquetzal]] (the ruler of [[Tlacopan]]) were plotting his death. Cortés interrogated them until each confessed, and then had Cuauhtémoc, Tetlepanquetzal, and another lord named [[Tlacatlec]] hanged. Cortés wrote that the other lords would be too frightened to plot against him again, as they believed he had uncovered the plan through magic powers. Cortés's account is supported by the historian [[Francisco López de Gómara]].&lt;ref&gt;Restall (2004, pp.149–150).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], a [[conquistador]] serving under Cortés who recorded his experiences in his book ''[[The Conquest of New Spain]]'', the supposed plot was revealed by two men, named Tapia and Juan Velásquez. Díaz portrays the executions as unjust and based on no evidence, and admits to having liked Cuauhtémoc personally. He also records Cuauhtémoc giving the following speech to Cortés, through his [[interpreting|interpreter]] [[Malinche]]:
{{quote|Oh Malinche [i.e., Cortés]! Now I understand your false promises and the kind of death you have had in store for me. For you are killing me unjustly. May God demand justice from you, as it was taken from me when I entrusted myself to you in my city of Mexico!}}
Díaz wrote that afterwards, Cortés suffered from [[insomnia]] due to [[guilt]], and badly injured himself while wandering at night.&lt;ref&gt;Restall (2004, pp.150,152).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl]], a [[Mestizo]] historian and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote an account of the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref name = &quot;otbjad&quot;/&gt; According to Ixtlilxóchitl the three lords were joking cheerfully with each other, due to a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy to tell him what they are talking about. The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch and Tetlepanquetzal were all hanged, as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve—Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;Restall (2004, p.152).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Aztec}}
[[File:Monumento de Cuauhtemoc.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Monument to Cuauhtémoc in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]]]]
[[Tlacotzin]], Cuauhtémoc's ''[[cihuacoatl (position)|cihuacoatl]]'', was appointed his successor as ''tlatoani''. He died the next year before returning to Tenochtitlan.

The modern-day town of [[Ixcateopan]] in the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Guerrero]] is home to an [[ossuary]] purportedly containing Cuauhtémoc's remains.

Many places in Mexico are named in honour of Cuauhtémoc. These include [[Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua|Ciudad Cuauhtémoc]] in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and the [[Cuauhtémoc, D.F.|Cuauhtémoc]] borough of the [[Mexican Federal District]]. There is also a [[Metro Cuauhtémoc|Cuauhtémoc station]] on the [[Mexico City metro]] and the Monterrey [[Metrorrey]]. Cuauhtémoc is also one of the few non-Spanish [[given name]]s for Mexican boys that is perennially popular.  In the Aztec campaign of the [[Personal computer game|PC game]] ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors]]'', the player plays as Cuauhtémoc, despite the name ''[[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]]'' for the campaign itself, and Cuauhtémoc narrates the openings and closings to each scenario. In the next installment to the series, ''[[Age of Empires 3: The War Chiefs]]'', Cuauhtémoc was the leader of Aztecs.

In the 1996 [[Rage Against The Machine]] single ''[[People of the Sun]]'', lyricist [[Zack De La Rocha]] rhymes &quot;When the fifth sun sets get back reclaimed, The spirit of Cuauhtémoc alive an untamed&quot;.

Cuauhtémoc, in the name Guatemoc, is portrayed sympathetically in the adventure novel ''[[Montezuma's Daughter]]'', by [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]]. First appearing in Chapter XIV, he becomes friends with the protagonist after they save each other's lives. His coronation, torture, and death are described in the novel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], the concept of a '''cross section'''  is used to express the likelihood of interaction between particles.  

When particles in a beam are thrown against a foil made of a certain substance, the ''cross section'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a hypothetical [[area]] measure around the target particles of the substance (usually its atoms) that represents a surface. If a particle of the beam crosses this surface, there will be some kind of interaction.

The term is derived from the purely [[classical mechanics|classical]] picture of (a large number of) [[Point particle|point-like]] projectiles directed to an area that includes a solid target. Assuming that an interaction will occur (with 100% probability) if the projectile hits the solid, and not at all (0% probability) if it misses, the total interaction probability for the single projectile will be the ratio of the area of the section of the solid (the ''cross section'', represented by &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) to the total targeted area. 

This basic concept is then extended to the cases where the interaction probability in the targeted area assumes intermediate values - because the target itself is not homogeneous, or because the interaction is mediated by a non-uniform field. A particular case is [[scattering]].

==Scattering==
{{main|Scattering cross-section}}

The '''scattering cross-section''', ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;, is a hypothetical area which describes the likelihood of light (or other radiation) being [[scattering|scattered]] by a particle.  In general, the scattering cross-section is different from the [[cross sectional area|geometrical cross-section]] of a particle, and it depends upon the [[wavelength]] of light and the [[permittivity]], shape and size of the particle.  The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is determined by the product of the scattering cross-section and the number of particles present.  In terms of area, the ''total cross-section'' (σ) is the sum of the cross-sections due to [[absorption cross section|absorption]], [[scattering]] and [[luminescence]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sigma_A + \sigma_S + \sigma_L.\ &lt;/math&gt;

The total cross-section is related to the [[absorbance]] of the light intensity through [[Beer-Lambert|Beer-Lambert's law]], which says absorbance is proportional to concentration: &lt;math&gt;A_\lambda  = C l \sigma&lt;/math&gt;, where ''C'' is the concentration as a number density, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the absorbance at a given [[wavelength]], ''λ'', and ''l'' is the [[path length]]. The extinction or [[absorbance]] of the radiation is the [[logarithm]] ([[Decadic logarithm|decadic]] or, more usually, [[Natural logarithm|natural]]) of the reciprocal of the [[transmittance]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2. Spectrophotometry|isbn=8121926335|first=P.K.|last=Bajpai|title=Biological Instrumentation and Biology|url=http://books.google.com/?id=THq-cOPO8RQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22extinction+coefficient%22+transmittance+length+concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_\lambda = - \log \mathcal{T}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

{{Main|nuclear cross section}}
In [[nuclear physics]], it is convenient to express the probability of a particular event by a cross section. Statistically, the centers of the atoms in a thin foil can be considered as points evenly distributed over a plane. The center of an atomic projectile striking this plane has geometrically a definite probability of passing within a certain distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of one of these points. In fact, if there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; atomic centers in an area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the plane, this probability is &lt;math&gt;(n \pi r^2)/A&lt;/math&gt;, which is simply the ratio of the aggregate area of circles of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; drawn around the points to the whole area. If we think of the atoms as impenetrable steel discs and the impinging particle as a bullet of negligible diameter, this ratio is the probability that the bullet will strike a steel disc, i.e., that the atomic projectile will be stopped by the foil. If it is the fraction of impinging atoms getting through the foil which is measured, the result can still be expressed in terms of the equivalent stopping cross section of the atoms. This notion can be extended to any interaction between the impinging particle and the atoms in the target. For example, the probability that an [[alpha particle]] striking a [[beryllium]] target will produce a neutron can be expressed as the equivalent cross section of beryllium for this type of reaction.

[[Image:Cell membrane detailed diagram 4.svg|thumb|400px|Illustration of a [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cell membrane]]

The '''cell membrane''' is a [[biological membrane]] that separates the [[cytoplasm|interior]] of all cells from the [[extracellular space|outside environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/CellMembranes.html Kimball's Biology Pages], Cell Membranes&lt;/ref&gt; The cell membrane is [[semipermeable membrane|selectively-permeable]] to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells.&lt;ref name=MBOC&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, ''et al.'' |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |isbn=0-8153-3218-1 |year=2002 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.1864 |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the [[phospholipid bilayer]] with embedded [[protein]]s. Cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as [[cell adhesion]], [[ion conductivity]] and [[cell signaling]] and serve as the attachment surface for the extracellular [[glycocalyx]] and [[cell wall]] and intracellular [[cytoskeleton]].

==Function==
The cell membrane surrounds the [[protoplasm]] of a cell and, in animal cells, physically separates the [[intracellular]] components from the [[extracellular]] environment. [[Fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[plant]]s also have the [[cell wall]] which provides a mechanical support for the cell and precludes passage of the [[macromolecule|larger molecules]]. The cell membrane also plays a role in anchoring the cytoskeleton to provide shape to the cell, and in attaching to the [[extracellular matrix]] and other cells to help group cells together to form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].

The barrier is [[Semipermeable membrane|differentially permeable]] and able to regulate what enters and exits the cell, thus facilitating the [[membrane transport protein|transport]] of materials needed for survival. The movement of substances across the membrane can be either ''passive'', occurring without the input of cellular energy, or active, requiring the cell to expend energy in moving it. The membrane also maintains the [[cell potential]].The cell membrane works as a selective filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside the cell, it is important in maintaining a homeostatic environment in the cell to keep us healthy and alive

== Prokaryotes ==
{{Main|Prokaryote}} 
It is composed almost entirely of protein and lipid

[[Gram-negative bacteria]] have [[plasma membrane]] and [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] separated by the [[periplasmic space]]. Other prokaryotic species have only [[plasma membrane]]. Prokaryotic cells are also surrounded by a [[cell wall]].

==Structure==
===Fluid mosaic model===
According to the fluid mosaic model of [[S. J. Singer]] and [[Garth Nicolson]] 1972, the biological membranes can be considered as a two-dimensional liquid where all lipid and protein molecules diffuse more or less easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singer SJ, Nicolson GL |title=The fluid mosaic model of the structure of cell membranes |journal=Science |volume=175 |issue=23 |pages=720–31 |year=1972 |month=Feb |pmid=4333397 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/175/4023/720 |doi=10.1126/science.175.4023.720}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture may be valid in the space scale of 10&amp;nbsp;nm. However, the plasma membranes contain different structures or domains that can be classified as: (a) protein-protein complexes; (b) [[lipid raft]]s, and (c) pickets and fences formed by the actin-based [[cytoskeleton]].

===Lipid bilayer===
[[Image:Fluid Mosaic.svg|thumb|200px|right|Diagram of the arrangement of amphipathic lipid molecules to form a [[lipid bilayer]]. The yellow [[Chemical polarity|polar]] head groups separate the grey hydrophobic tails from the aqueous cytosolic and extracellular environments.]]

Lipid bilayers go through a self assembly process in the formation of membranes. The cell membrane consists primarily of a thin layer of [[amphipathic]] [[phospholipids]] which spontaneously arrange so that the hydrophobic &quot;tail&quot; regions are shielded from the surrounding polar fluid, causing the more hydrophilic &quot;head&quot; regions to associate with the cytosolic and extracellular faces of the resulting bilayer. This forms a continuous, spherical [[lipid bilayer]]. Forces such as Van der Waal, electrostatic, hyrdogen bonds, and noncovalent interactions, are all forces that contribute to the formation of the lipid bilayer. Overall, hydrophobic interactions are the major driving force in the formation of lipid bilayers. 

Lipid bilayers have very low permeability for ions and most polar molecules.The arrangement of hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails of the lipid bilayer prevent polar solutes (e.g. amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and ions) from diffusing across the membrane, but generally allows for the passive diffusion of hydrophobic molecules. This affords the cell the ability to control the movement of these substances via [[transmembrane protein]] complexes such as pores and gates.

[[Flippase]]s and [[Scramblase]]s concentrate [[phosphatidyl serine]], which carries a negative charge, on the inner membrane. Along with [[sialic acid|NANA]], this creates an extra barrier to charged [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] moving through the membrane.

Membranes serve diverse functions in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells. One important role is to regulate the movement of materials into and out of cells. The phospholipid bilayer structure (fluid mosaic model) with specific membrane proteins accounts for the selective permeability of the membrane and passive and active transport mechanisms. In addition, membranes in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes facilitate the synthesis of ATP through chemiosmosis.

===Membrane polarity===
{{See also|Epithelial polarity}}
&lt;!-- Apical_Membrane redirects here --&gt;&lt;!-- Basolateral_Membrane redirects here --&gt;&lt;!-- Basolateral redirects here --&gt;
[[Image:Alpha Intercalated Cell Cartoon.svg|thumb|300px|Alpha intercalated cell]]
The '''apical membrane''' of a polarized cell is the surface of the [[plasma membrane]] that faces the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This is particularly evident in [[epithelial cell|epithelial]] and [[endothelial cell]]s, but also describes other polarized cells, such as [[neuron]]s.

The '''basolateral membrane''' of a polarized cell is the surface of the plasma membrane that forms its basal and lateral surfaces. It faces towards the [[interstitium]], and away from the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].

&quot;Basolateral membrane&quot; is a compound phrase referring to the terms ''basal (base) membrane'' and ''lateral (side) membrane'', which, especially in epithelial cells, are identical in composition and activity. Proteins (such as ion channels and [[Ion pump (biology)|pumps]]) are free to move from the basal to the lateral surface of the cell or ''vice versa'' in accordance with the [[fluid mosaic model]].

[[Tight junction]]s that join epithelial cells near their apical surface prevent the migration of proteins from the basolateral membrane to the apical membrane. The basal and lateral surfaces thus remain roughly equivalent to one another, yet distinct from the apical surface.

===Integral membrane proteins===
The cell membrane contains many [[integral membrane protein]]s, which pepper the entire surface. These structures, which can be visualized by [[electron microscopy]] or [[fluorescence microscopy]], can be found on the inside of the membrane, the outside, or [[Transmembrane protein|membrane spanning]]. These may include [[integrins]], [[cadherins]], [[desmosome]]s, [[clathrin|clathrin-coated pits]], [[caveolae]]s, and different structures involved in [[cell adhesion]]. Integral proteins are the most abundant type of protein to span the lipid bilayer. They interact widely with hydrocarbon chains of membrane lipids and can be released by agents that compete for the same nonpolar interactions.

== Peripheral membrane proteins ==
Peripheral proteins are proteins that are bounded to the membrane by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with the hydrophilic phospholipid heads. Many of these proteins can be found bounded to the surfaces of integral proteins on either the cytoplasimic side of the cell or the extracellular side of the membrane. Some are anchored to the bilayer through covalent bond with a fatty acid.

===Membrane skeleton===
The cytoskeleton is found underlying the cell membrane in the cytoplasm and provides a scaffolding for membrane proteins to anchor to, as well as forming organelles that extend from the cell. Indeed, cytoskeletal elements interact extensively and intimately with the cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doherty GJ and McMahon HT |title=Mediation, Modulation and Consequences of Membrane-Cytoskeleton Interactions |journal=Annual Review of Biophysics |volume=37 |pages=65–95 |year=2008 |pmid=18573073 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125912 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anchoring proteins restricts them to a particular cell surface &amp;mdash; for example, the ''apical surface'' of epithelial cells that line the [[vertebrate]] [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] &amp;mdash; and limits how far they may diffuse within the bilayer. The cytoskeleton is able to form appendage-like organelles, such as [[cilia]], which are [[microtubule]]-based extensions covered by the cell membrane, and [[filopodia]], which are [[actin]]-based extensions. These extensions are ensheathed in membrane and project from the surface of the cell in order to sense the external environment and/or make contact with the substrate or other cells. The apical surfaces of epithelial cells are dense with actin-based finger-like projections known as [[microvilli]], which increase cell surface area and thereby increase the absorption rate of nutrients. Localized decoupling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane results in formation of a [[bleb (cell biology)|bleb]].

==Composition==
Cell membranes contain a variety of biological molecules, notably lipids and proteins. Material is incorporated into the membrane, or deleted from it, by a variety of mechanisms:

* Fusion of intracellular [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s with the membrane ([[exocytosis]]) not only excretes the contents of the vesicle but also incorporates the vesicle membrane's components into the cell membrane. The membrane may form blebs around extracellular material that pinch off to become vesicles ([[endocytosis]]).
* If a membrane is continuous with a tubular structure made of membrane material, then material from the tube can be drawn into the membrane continuously.
* Although the concentration of membrane components in the aqueous phase is low (stable membrane components have low solubility in water), there is an exchange of molecules between the lipid and aqueous phases.

===Lipids===
[[Image:Membrane lipids.png|thumb|right|310px|Examples of the major membrane phospholipids and glycolipids: [[phosphatidylcholine]] (PtdCho), [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] (PtdEtn), [[phosphatidylinositol]] (PtdIns), [[phosphatidylserine]] (PtdSer).]]
The cell membrane consists of three classes of amphipathic lipids: [[phospholipid]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, and [[cholesterol]]s. The amount of each depends upon the type of cell, but in the majority of cases phospholipids are the most abundant.&lt;ref name=Lodish&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cell Biology |author=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky LS, ''et al.'' |edition=4th |year=2004 |isbn=0716731363 |publisher=Scientific American Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[red blood cell|RBC]] studies, 30% of the plasma membrane is lipid. 

The fatty chains in phospholipids and glycolipids usually contain an even number of carbon atoms, typically between 16 and 20. The 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids are the most common. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, with the configuration of the double bonds nearly always ''cis''. The length and the degree of unsaturation of fatty acid chains have a profound effect on membrane fluidity&lt;ref name=flashbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/macampbell/111/memb-swf/membranes.swf |title=Membrane Structure|accessdate =2007-01-11 |publisher=Davidson College |year=2002 |author=Jesse Gray, Shana Groeschler, Tony Le, Zara Gonzalez |format=SWF}}&lt;/ref&gt; as unsaturated lipids create a kink, preventing the fatty acids from packing together as tightly, thus decreasing the [[melting temperature]] (increasing the fluidity) of the membrane. The ability of some organisms to regulate [[Membrane fluidity|the fluidity of their cell membranes]] by altering lipid composition is called [[homeoviscous adaptation]].

The entire membrane is held together via [[non-covalent]] interaction of hydrophobic tails, however the structure is quite fluid and not fixed rigidly in place. Under [[physiological condition]]s phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane are in the [[Liquid crystal|liquid crystalline state]]. It means the lipid molecules are free to diffuse and exhibit rapid lateral diffusion along the layer in which they are present. However, the exchange of phospholipid molecules between intracellular and extracellular leaflets of the bilayer is a very slow process. [[Lipid rafts]] and caveolae are examples of [[cholesterol]]-enriched microdomains in the cell membrane.

In animal cells cholesterol is normally found dispersed in varying degrees throughout cell membranes, in the irregular spaces between the hydrophobic tails of the membrane lipids, where it confers a stiffening and strengthening effect on the membrane.&lt;ref name=MBOC/&gt;
&lt;br clear = &quot;all&quot; /&gt;

=== Phospholipids forming lipid vesicles ===
Lipid vesicles or liposomes are circular pockets that are enclosed by a lipid bilayer. These structures are used in laboratories to study the effects of chemicals in cells by delivering these chemicals directly to the cell, as well as getting more insight into cell membrane permeability. Lipid vesicles and liposomes are formed by first suspending a lipid in an aqueous solution then agitating the mixture through sonication, resulting in a uniformly circular vesicle. By measuring the rate of efflux from that of the insideof the vesicle to the ambient solution, allows researcher to better understand membrane permeability. Vesicles can be formed with molecules and ions inside the vesicle by forming the vesicle with the desired molecule or ion present in the solution. Proteins can also be embedded into the membrane through solubilizing the desired proteins in the presence of detergents and attaching them to the phospholipids in which the liposome is formed. These provide researchers with a tool to examine various membrane protein functions.

===Carbohydrates===
Plasma membranes also contain [[carbohydrates]], predominantly [[glycoprotein]]s, but with some glycolipids ([[cerebroside]]s and [[ganglioside]]s). For the most part, no [[glycosylation]] occurs on membranes within the cell; rather generally glycosylation occurs on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane.

The [[glycocalyx]] is an important feature in all cells, especially [[epithelium|epithelia]] with microvilli. Recent data suggest the glycocalyx participates in cell adhesion, [[lymphocyte homing]], and many others. 

The [[wiktionary:Penultimate|penultimate]] sugar is [[galactose]] and the terminal sugar is [[sialic acid]], as the sugar backbone is modified in the [[golgi apparatus]]. Sialic acid carries a negative charge, providing an external barrier to charged particles.

===Proteins===
Proteins within the membrane are key to the functioning of the overall membrane. These proteins mainly transport chemicals and information across the membrane. Every membrane has a varying degree of protein content. Proteins can be in the form of peripheral or integral.

|}

The cell membrane plays host to a large amount of protein that is responsible for its various activities. The amount of protein differs between species and according to function, however the typical amount in a cell membrane is 50%.&lt;ref name=flashbio/&gt; These proteins are undoubtedly important to a cell: Approximately a third of the [[gene]]s in [[yeast]] code specifically for them, and this number is even higher in multicellular organisms.&lt;ref name=Lodish/&gt; 

The cell membrane, being exposed to the outside environment, is an important site of cell-cell communication. As such, a large variety of protein receptors and identification proteins, such as [[antigen]]s, are present on the surface of the membrane. Functions of membrane proteins can also include cell-cell contact, surface recognition, cytoskeleton contact, signaling, enzymatic activity, or transporting substances across the membrane.

Most membrane proteins must be inserted in some way into the membrane. For this to occur, an N-terminus &quot;signal sequence&quot; of amino acids directs proteins to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], which inserts the proteins into a lipid bilayer. Once inserted, the proteins are then transported to their final destination in vesicles, where the vesicle fuses with the target membrane.

==Variation==
The cell membrane has different lipid and protein compositions in distinct [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|types of cells]] and may have therefore specific names for certain cell types:

* [[Sarcolemma]] in [[myocytes]]
* Oolemma in [[oocytes]]
* Historically, the plasma membrane was also referred to as the plasmalemma.

==Permeability== &lt;!--Membrane permeability redirects here--&gt;
The permeability of a membrane is the ease of molecules to pass through it. Permeability depends mainly on the [[electric charge]] of the molecule and to a lesser extent the [[molar mass]] of the molecule. Electrically neutral and small molecules pass the membrane easier than charged, large ones.

The inability of charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane results in [[pH parturition]] of substances throughout the [[fluid compartment]]s of the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christian mythology''' is the body of traditional [[narrative]]s associated with [[Christianity]] from a [[mythography|mythographical]] perspective. These traditional narratives include, but are not limited to, the stories contained in the [[Bible#Christian Bible|Christian Bible]]. In contrast with fiction, the term &quot;mythology&quot; here refers to the narrative structure and history of these stories.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan. Introduction. ''Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth''. Ed. Alan Dundes. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, G.S. &quot;On Defining Myths&quot;. ''Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth''. Ed. Alan Dundes. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 53-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, Christianity has divided into many [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s. Not all of these denominations hold the same set of sacred traditional narratives. For example, the [[books of the Bible]] accepted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]] include a number of texts and stories (such as those narrated in the [[Book of Judith]] and [[Book of Tobit]]) that many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations do not accept as [[canonical]].

==Definition of &quot;mythology&quot;==
In its broadest academic sense, the word simply means a traditional story. However, many scholars restrict the term &quot;myth&quot; to sacred stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~mmagouli/defmyth.htm#SACRED What is a Myth?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Folklorists]] often go further, defining myths as &quot;tales believed as true, usually sacred, set in the distant past or other worlds or parts of the world, and with extra-human, inhuman, or heroic characters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~mmagouli/defmyth.htm#DEFINING%20MYTH Defining myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greek language|classical Greek]], ''muthos'', from which the English word &quot;myth&quot; derives, meant &quot;story, narrative.&quot; By the time of Christ, ''muthos'' had started to take on the connotations of &quot;fable, fiction,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Myth and Reality (1968), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; and early Christian writers often avoided calling a story from canonical scripture a &quot;[[myth]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] warned [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] to have nothing to do with &quot;godless and silly myths&quot; (''bebēthous kai graōdeis muthous)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:7}} (τοὺς δὲ βεβήλους καὶ γραώδεις μύθους παραιτοῦ).&lt;/ref&gt; This negative meaning of &quot;myth&quot; passed into popular usage.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', pp. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern Christian scholars and writers have attempted to rehabilitate the term &quot;myth&quot; outside academia, describing stories in canonical scripture (especially the Christ story) as &quot;true myth&quot;; examples include [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Andrew Greeley]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis used the expression &quot;true myth&quot; to describe the story of Jesus Christ: &quot;The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God's myth where the others are men's myths&quot; (C. S. Lewis, in Brown). Andrew Greeley stated: &quot;Many Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith&quot; (Greeley, ''Myths of Religion'', in Bierlein 1994, pp. 304-5).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In non-canonical tradition===
[[File:Saint brendan german manuscript.jpg|thumb|280px|Saint Brendan's voyage, from a German manuscript]]
Christian tradition contains many stories that do not come from [[Biblical canon|canonical Christian texts]] yet still illustrate [[Christianity|Christian]] themes. These non-canonical Christian myths include legends, folktales, and elaborations on canonical Christian mythology.

Christian tradition has produced a rich body of legends that were never incorporated into the official scriptures. Legends were a staple of medieval literature.&lt;ref&gt;Guerber, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[hagiography|hagiographies]] such as the stories of [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Valentine]]. A case in point is the historical and canonized [[Brendan|Brendan of Clonfort]], a 6th century Irish churchman and founder of abbeys. Round his authentic figure was woven a tissue that is arguably [[legend]]ary rather than historical: the ''Navigatio'' or &quot;Journey of Brendan&quot;. The legend discusses mythic events in the sense of supernatural encounters. In this narrative, Brendan and his shipmates encounter sea monsters, a [[paradise|paradisal island]] and a floating ice islands and a rock island inhabited by a holy hermit: literal-minded devotés still seek to identify &quot;Brendan's islands&quot; in actual geography.  This voyage was recreated by [[Tim Severin]], suggesting that [[whale]]s, [[iceberg]]s and [[Rockall]] were encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Severin |first=Timothy|authorlink=Tim Severin |title=The Brendan Voyage |year=1982|month=April|publisher=McGraw-Hill |id= ISBN 0070563357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folktales form a major part of non-canonical Christian tradition. Folklorists define folktales (in contrast to &quot;true&quot; myths) as stories that are considered purely fictitious by their tellers and that often lack a specific setting in space or time.&lt;ref name = &quot;moo&quot;&gt;Segal, p. 5; Zong In-Sob, p. xxi; Welker&lt;/ref&gt; Christian-themed folktales have circulated widely among peasant populations. One widespread folktale genre is that of the Penitent Sinner (classified as Type 756A, B, C, in the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson index of tale types]]); another popular group of folktales describe a clever mortal who outwits the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Not all scholars accept the folkloristic convention of applying the terms &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;folktale&quot; to different categories of traditional narrative.&lt;ref name = &quot;tsrltb&quot;&gt;Segal, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian tradition produced many popular stories elaborating on canonical scripture. According to an English folk belief, certain herbs gained their current healing power from having been used to heal [[Christ]]'s wounds on [[Mount Calvary]]. In this case, a non-canonical story has a connection to a non-narrative form of [[folklore]] — namely, [[folk medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthurian legend]] contains many elaborations upon canonical mythology. For example, [[Sir Balin]] discovers the [[Lance of Longinus]], which had pierced the side of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' 2:16&lt;/ref&gt; According to a tradition widely attested in early Christian writings, [[Adam]]'s skull lay buried at Calvary; when Christ was crucified, his blood fell over Adam's skull, symbolizing humanity's redemption from Adam's sin.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 375; Wilson, pp. 159-66&lt;/ref&gt;

==In-depth discussion of representative examples==
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2010|talk=y}}
Academic studies of mythology often define mythology as deeply valued stories that explain a society's existence and world order: those narratives of a society's creation, the society's origins and foundations, their god(s), their original heroes, mankind's connection to the &quot;divine&quot;, and their narratives of [[eschatology]] (what happens in the &quot;after-life&quot;).  This is a very general outline of some of the basic sacred stories with those themes.

===Cosmogonic myths===
The Christian texts use the same [[creation myth]] as [[Jewish mythology]] as written in the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis, the world was created out of a darkness and water in seven days. (Unlike a Jew, a Christian might include the miracle of Jesus' birth as a sort of second cosmogonic event)&lt;ref&gt;According to Mircea Eliade, &quot;for the Christian, time begins anew with the birth of Christ, for the Incarnation establishes a new situation of man in the cosmos&quot; (''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 111).&lt;/ref&gt; Canonical Christian scripture incorporates the two Hebrew cosmogonic myths found in Genesis 1-2:2 and Genesis 2:

====Genesis 1-2:3====
In the first text on the creation (Genesis 1-2:3), the Creator is called ''[[Elohim]]'' (translated &quot;God&quot;). He creates the universe over a six-day period, creating a new feature each day: first he creates day and night; then he creates the firmament to separate the &quot;waters above&quot; from the &quot;waters below&quot;; then he separates the dry land from the water; then he creates plants on the land; then he places the sun, moon, and stars in the sky; then he creates swimming and flying animals; then he creates land animals; and finally he creates [[Adam and Eve|man and woman]] together, &quot;in his own image&quot;. On the seventh day, God rests, providing the rationale for the custom of resting on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genesis 2:4-3:24====
The second creation myth in Genesis differs from the first in a number of important elements. Here the Creator is called ''Yahweh elohim'' (commonly translated &quot;Lord God&quot;, although Yahweh is in fact the personal name of the God of Israel and does not mean Lord).

This myth begins with the words, &quot;When the L&lt;SMALL&gt;ORD&lt;/SMALL&gt; God made the earth and the heavens, and no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth ...&quot; (Genesis 2:4-5 NASB). It then proceeds to describe the Lord creating a man called Adam out of dust. The Lord creates the [[Garden of Eden]] as a home for Adam, and tells Adam not to eat the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] in the center of the Garden (next to the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]]).

The Lord also creates animals, and shows them to man, who names them. The Lord sees that there is no suitable companion for the man among the beasts, and He subsequently puts Adam to sleep and takes out one of Adam's ribs, creating from it a woman whom Adam names Eve.

A [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] tempts Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and she succumbs, offering the fruit to Adam as well. As a punishment, the Lord banishes the couple from the Garden and &quot;placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden the cherubim with a fiery revolving sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 3:24&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord says he must banish humans from the Garden because they have become like him, knowing good and evil (because of eating the [[forbidden fruit]]), and now only immortality (which they could get by eating from the Tree of Life) stands between them and godhood:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever&quot; (Genesis 3:22).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The actual text of Genesis does not identify the tempting serpent with [[Satan]]. However, Christian tradition equates the two. This tradition has made its way into non-canonical Christian &quot;myths&quot; such as John Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.

===Founding myths===
Christian mythology of their society's [[Founding myth|founding]] would start with Jesus and his many teachings, and include the stories of Christian disciples starting the Christian Church and congregations in the 1st century. This might be considered the stories in the four canonical gospels and the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. The heroes of the first Christian society would start with Jesus and those chosen by Jesus, the twelve apostles including Peter, John, James, as well as [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)]].

===Narrative of Christ and the atonement===
The theological concept of Jesus being born to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for &quot;[[original sin]]&quot; is central to the Christian narrative. According to Christian theology, by Adam disobeying God in the Garden of Eden, humanity acquired an ingrained flaw that keeps humans in a state of moral imperfection, generally called &quot;original sin&quot;. According to [[Paul of Tarsus]], Adam's sin brought sin and death to all humanity: &quot;Through one man, sin entered the world, and through sin, death&quot; (Romans 5:12). 

According to the Orthodox Christian view, Jesus saved humanity from final death and damnation by dying for them. Most Christians believe that Christ's [[sacrifice]] supernaturally reversed death's power over humanity, proved when he was [[resurrection|resurrected]], and abolished the power of sin on humanity. According to Paul, &quot;if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many&quot; (Romans 5:15). For many Christians, atonement doctrine leads naturally into the eschatological narratives of Christian people rising from the dead and living again, or immediately entering heaven to join Jesus.

What follows is a brief survey of the myth of humanity's [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] through Christ's death and resurrection.

Note that, by some academic definitions, a traditional story about a historical human character like Jesus would be a &quot;legend&quot;, not a &quot;myth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;For some examples of this distinction between &quot;legend&quot; and &quot;myth&quot;, see Mays and (for the classic distinction drawn by professional folklorists) Coffin.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atonement in canonical scripture====
Paul's theological writings lay out the basic framework of the atonement doctrine in the New Testament. However, Paul's letters contain relatively little mythology (narrative). The majority of narratives in the New Testament are in the Gospels and the Book of Revelation.

Although the Gospel stories do not lay out the atonement doctrine as fully as does Paul, they do have the story of the Last Supper, crucifixion, death and resurrection. Atonement is also suggested in the parables of Jesus in his final days. According to Matthew's gospel, at the [[Last Supper]], Jesus calls his blood &quot;the blood of the new covenant, which will be poured out for the forgiveness of many&quot; (Matthew 26:28). John's gospel is especially rich in atonement parables and promises: Jesus speaks of himself as &quot;the living bread that came down from heaven&quot;; &quot;and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world&quot; (John 6:51); &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&quot; (John 12:24).

====Atonement in non-canonical literature====
The sacrifice and atonement narrative appears explicitly in many non-canonical writings as well. For instance, in Book 3 of Milton's ''Paradise Lost'', the [[Son of god#Jesus as divine|Son of God]] offers to become a man and die, thereby paying mankind's debt to [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]].

The [[Harrowing of Hell]] is a non-canonical myth extrapolated from the atonement doctrine. According to this story, Christ descended into the land of the dead after his crucifixion, rescuing the righteous souls that had been cut off from heaven due to the taint of original sin. The story of the harrowing was popular during the Middle Ages. An Old English poem called &quot;The Harrowing of Hell&quot; describes Christ breaking into Hell and rescuing the Old Testament patriarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 136-38&lt;/ref&gt; (The Harrowing is not the only explanation that Christians have put forth for the fate of the righteous who died before Christ accomplished the atonement)&lt;ref&gt;For example, according to Russell, p. 205, the medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] theologian [[Abelard]] believed &quot;that the just pagans had all been illuminated and saved by the Word during their lives&quot;. Russell also suggests another possible explanation that the scholastic theologians did not consider: &quot;Christ died for all human beings wherever they are in space or time. His sacrifice was built into the plan of salvation for all eternity, and it affects those who come after the incarnation no more than those who came before&quot; (pp. 205-6).&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern literature, atonement continues to be theme. In the first of C. S. Lewis's ''Narnia'' novels, ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', a boy named Edmund is condemned to death by a [[White Witch]], and the magical lion-king [[Aslan]] offers to die in Edmund's place, thereby saving him. Aslan's life is sacrificed on an altar, but returns to life again. Aslan's self-sacrifice for Edmund is often interpreted as an allegory for the story of Christ's sacrifice for humanity; although Lewis denied that the novel is a mere allegory.&lt;ref name = &quot;plugay&quot;&gt;A letter to a child fan named Patricia, printed in ''The Essential C. S. Lewis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The End: eschatological myths===
[[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatological]] myths include stories of the afterlife: the narratives of Jesus Christ [[resurrection|rising from the dead]] and now acting as a [[wiktionary:savior|saviour]] of all generations of Christians, and stories of heaven and hell. Eschatological myths would also include the prophesies of [[apocalypse|end of the world]] and a new millennium in the [[Book of Revelation]], and the story that Jesus will return to earth some day.

The major features of Christian eschatological mythology include afterlife beliefs, the Second Coming, the resurrection of the dead, and the [[last judgment|final judgment]].

====Immediate afterlife (heaven and hell)====
[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|220px|thumb|right|''Jesus as the Good Shepherd,'' painting on ceiling of S. Callisto catacomb, early Christian art, mid 3rd century A.D.. Example of earliest Christian art showing a pastoral scene in the afterlife.]]

Most Christian denominations hold some belief in an immediate afterlife when people die. Christian scripture gives a few descriptions of an immediate afterlife and a heaven and hell; however, for the most part, both New and Old Testaments focus much more on the myth of a final bodily resurrection than any beliefs about a purely spiritual afterlife away from the body.

Much of the Old Testament does not express a belief in a personal afterlife of reward or punishment:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;All the dead go down to Sheol, and there they lie in sleep together–whether good or evil, rich or poor, slave or free (Job 3:11-19). It is described as a region &quot;dark and deep,&quot; &quot;the Pit,&quot; and &quot;the land of forgetfulness,&quot; cut off from both God and human life above (Pss. 6:5; 88:3-12). Though in some texts Yahweh's power can reach down to Sheol (Ps. 139:8), the dominant idea is that the dead are abandoned forever. This idea of Sheol is negative in contrast to the world of life and light above, but there is no idea of judgment or of reward and punishment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tabor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Old Testament writings, particularly the works of the Hebrew prophets, describe a final resurrection of the dead, often accompanied by spiritual rewards and punishments:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Many who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake. Some shall live forever; others shall be in everlasting contempt. But the wise shall shine brightly like the splendor of the firmament, and those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars forever&quot; (Daniel 12:2).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, even here, the emphasis is not on an immediate afterlife in heaven or hell, but rather on a future bodily resurrection.

The New Testament also devotes little attention to an immediate afterlife. Its primary focus is the resurrection of the dead. Some New Testament passages seem to mention the (non-resurrected) dead experiencing some sort of afterlife (for example, the parable of [[Lazarus and Dives]]); yet the New Testament includes only a few myths about heaven and hell. Specifically, heaven is a place of peaceful residence, where Jesus goes to &quot;prepare a home&quot; or room for his disciples (John 14:2).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you&quot; - Jesus. John 14:2 NASB 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on scriptural imagery (John 10:7, John 10:11-14), many Christian narratives of heaven include a nice green pasture land and a meeting with a benevolent God. Some of the earliest Christian art depicts heaven as a green pasture where people are sheep led by Jesus as &quot;the good shepherd&quot; as in interpretation of heaven.

As the [[doctrines]] of heaven and hell and (Catholic) [[purgatory]] developed, non-canonical Christian literature began to develop an elaborate mythology about these locations. Dante's three-part ''Divine Comedy'' is a prime example of such afterlife mythology, describing Hell (in ''Inferno''), Purgatory (in ''Purgatorio''), and Heaven (in ''Paradiso''). Myths of hell differ quite widely according to the denomination.

====Second Coming====
[[File:Wandering jew.jpg|thumb|130px|right|''The Wandering Jew '' by [[Gustave Doré]].]]
The [[Second Coming]] of Christ holds a central place in Christian mythology. The Second Coming is the return of Christ to earth during the period of transformation preceding the end of this world and the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. According to Matthew's gospel, when Jesus is on trial before the Roman and Jewish authorities, he claims, &quot;In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 26:64&lt;/ref&gt;
The legend of the ''[[Wandering Jew]]'' concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion and was then cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming.

====Resurrection and final judgment====
Christian mythology incorporates the Old Testament's prophecies of a future resurrection of the dead. Like the Hebrew prophet Daniel (e.g., Daniel 12:2), the Christian Book of Revelation (among other New Testament scriptures) describes the resurrection: &quot;The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 20:13&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous and/or faithful enjoy bliss in the earthly Kingdom of Heaven, but the evil and/or non-Christian are &quot;cast into the lake of fire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 20:15&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Kingdom of Heaven on earth====
Christian eschatological myths feature a total world renovation after the final judgment. According to the Book of Revelation, God &quot;will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain, for the old order has passed away&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 21:4&lt;/ref&gt; According to Old and New Testament passages, a time of perfect peace and happiness is coming: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. One nation will not raise the sword against another; nor will they train for war again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 2:4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Certain scriptural passages even suggest that God will abolish the current natural laws in favor of immortality and total peace:
*&quot;Then the wolf will be a guest of the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the kid. The calf and the young lion will browse together, with a little child to guide them. [...] There will be no harm or ruin on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with knowledge of the Lord as water fills the sea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 11:6, 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;On this mountain, [God] will destroy the veil that veils all peoples, the web that is woven over all nations: he will destroy Death forever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 25:7-8&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;The trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 15:52&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;Night will be no more, nor will they need light from lamp or sun, for the Lord God shall give them light, and they shall reign forever and ever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 22:5&lt;/ref&gt;

====Millennialism and amillennialism====
When Christianity was a new and persecuted religion, many Christians believed the end times were imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars debate whether Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher;&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; however, his early followers, &quot;the group of Jews who accepted him as messiah in the years immediately after his death, understood him in primarily apocalyptic terms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Prevalent in the early church and especially during periods of persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 67; McGinn, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; this Christian belief in an imminent end is called &quot;[[millennialism]]&quot;. (It takes its name from the thousand-year (&quot;millennial&quot;) reign of Christ that, according to the Book of Revelation, will precede the final world renovation; similar beliefs in a coming paradise are found in other religions, and these phenomena are often also called &quot;millennialism&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;millennialism&quot;; Eliade, p. 67-72&lt;/ref&gt;

Millennialism comforted Christians during times of persecution, for it predicted an imminent deliverance from suffering.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;millennialism&quot;; Eliade, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of millennialism, human action has little significance: millennialism is comforting precisely because it predicts that happiness is coming no matter what humans do: &quot;The seeming triumph of Evil made up the apocalyptic syndrome which was to precede Christ's return and the millennium.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as time went on, millennialism lost its appeal.&lt;ref&gt;According to Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 67: &quot;After becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire, Christianity condemned millennialism as heretical, although illustrious Fathers had professed it in the past. [...] The ''eschaton'' was no longer the imminent event that it had been during the persecutions.&quot; According to ReligiousTolerance.org, the specific variant of millennialism condemned was &quot;Historical Premillennialism&quot;, which many Christians believed in during the first three centuries C.E.; the Roman Church's official anti-millennial stance is called &quot;Amillennialism&quot;, and was largely established by [[Augustine of Hippo]] (Robinson). Even some of the Church Fathers who accepted historical premillennialism doubted the imminence of the End, as Christ's coming seemed less and less likely to be immediate. According to McGinn, p. 62: &quot;Like both Irenaeus and Hippolytus, Tertullian thought (at least for most of his career) that the end was not near.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Christ had not returned immediately, as earlier Christians had predicted. Moreover, many Christians no longer needed the comfort that millennialism provided, for they were no longer persecuted: &quot;With the triumph of the Church, the Kingdom of Heaven was already present on earth, and in a certain sense the old world had already been destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;bfvqcq&quot;&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; (Millennialism has revived during periods of historical stress,&lt;ref name = &quot;bfvqcq&quot;/&gt; and is currently popular among Evangelical Christians)&lt;ref name = &quot;vaqsrr&quot;&gt;Robinson&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman Church's condemnation of millennialism, Eliade sees &quot;the first manifestation of the doctrine of [human] progress&quot; in Christianity.&lt;ref name = &quot;bfvqcq&quot;/&gt; According to the amillennial view, Christ will indeed come again, ushering in a perfect Kingdom of Heaven on earth, but &quot;the Kingdom of God is [already] present in the world today through the presence of the heavenly reign of Christ, the Bible, the Holy Spirit and Christianity&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;vaqsrr&quot;/&gt; Amillennialists do not feel &quot;the eschatological tension&quot; that persecution inspires; therefore, they interpret their eschatological myths either figuratively or as descriptions of far-off events rather than imminent ones.&lt;ref&gt;According to ReligiousTolerance.org, Amillennialists interpret the myth of Christ's [[Second Coming]] literally, although they do not expect Christ to come soon, and they often interpret the [[Antichrist]] figuratively.Robinson&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after taking the amillennial position, the Church not only waited for God to renovate the world (as millennialists had) but also believed itself to be improving the world through human action.&lt;ref name = &quot;bfvqcq&quot;/&gt;

==Time in Christian mythology==
===Linear, historical time===
The religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] argues that &quot;Judaeo-Christianity makes an innovation of the first importance&quot; in mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; In many other religions, all important events happened at the beginning of time: after those initial events, everything was fixed. In contrast, &quot;in Judaeism, and above all in Christianity, divinity had manifested itself in History&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The myths and legends in the Bible are not limited to a far-off primordial age: instead, they form a long series of events stretching &quot;out of the far past into an eternal future&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;micqcz&quot;&gt;Irwin, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Near Eastern specialist [[William A. Irwin]], the Hebrew historians who authored the writings in the Old Testament saw history as &quot;a comprehensive reality&quot; raised &quot;to the highest importance&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;micqcz&quot;/&gt;

In contrast, the myths of many traditional cultures present a cyclic or static view of time. In these cultures, all the &quot;[important] history is limited to a few events that took place in the mythical times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, these cultures place events into two categories, the mythical age and the present, between which there is no continuity. Everything in the present is seen as a direct result of the mythical age:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Just as modern man considers himself to be constituted by [all of] History, the man of the archaic societies declares that he is the result of [only] a certain number of mythical events.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because of this view, Eliade argues, members of many traditional societies see their lives as a constant repetition of mythical events, an &quot;[[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]&quot; to the mythical age: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In ''imitating'' the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eliade, Christianity shares in this cyclic sense of time to an extent. &quot;By the very fact that it is a religion&quot;, he argues, Christianity retains at least one &quot;mythical aspect&quot; — the repetition of mythical events through ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 168-69&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade gives a typical church service as an example:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Just as a church constitutes a break in plane in the profane space of a modern city, [so] the service celebrated inside [the church] marks a break in profane temporal duration. It is no longer today's historical time that is present—the time that is experienced, for example, in the adjacent streets—but the time in which the historical existence of Jesus Christ occurred, the time sanctified by his preaching, by his passion, death, and resurrection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the world-shaping mythical events that Christians celebrate are not limited to a primordial age. This doesn't mean that ''all'' historical events are significant,&lt;ref&gt;''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; but significant events are interspersed throughout the length of history, and they are not simply repetitions of each other: &quot;The fall of Jerusalem does not repeat the fall of Samaria: the ruin of Jerusalem presents a new historic [[theophany]], another 'wrath' of Jahveh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christianity, &quot;time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the Eternal Return; it has become linear and irreversible Time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian mythology and &quot;progress&quot;===
A number of scholars believe that the Bible's sense of linear time promoted the notion of &quot;progress&quot;. According to this view, if primordial events haven't permanently determined the world's condition, mankind can be &quot;saved&quot; and [[progress (history)|progress]] is possible. According to Irwin, from the perspective of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (Old Testament), &quot;history is a tale of progress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity inherited the Hebrew sense of history through the Old Testament. Thus, although most Christians believe that human nature is inherently &quot;fallen&quot; (see [[original sin]]) and cannot become perfected without divine grace, they do believe that the world can and will change for the better, either through human and divine action or through divine action alone.

==Comparative mythology==
[[Comparative mythology]] is the study of similarities and connections between the myths of different cultures. For instance, the Judeo-Christian story of Noah and the flood has similarities to flood stories told worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;The ancient Mesopotamians had a myth in which the gods sent a flood to punish mortals (''The Epic of Gilgamesh'', p. 108-13). The [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]] [[mytheme]] also appears, for instance, in [[Hindu mythology]], in the story of [[Matsya]] the fish (Translation of the Hindu scripture ''Matsya'' 1:11-35 in ''Classical Hindu Mythology'', p. 71-74).&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Jewish mythology#The mythological flood|Jewish mythology]] for greater detail.) This section contains a brief survey of some major parallels between Christian mythology and other mythologies. For the sake of brevity, myths that Christianity shares with Judaism (e.g., Old Testament stories) are not covered here. For comparative mythology related to Judeo-Christian myths, see [[Jewish mythology#Comparative mythology|Jewish mythology]].

===Christ and the &quot;Dying Gods&quot;===
Many myths feature a [[life-death-rebirth deity|god who dies and is resurrected]], or who descends to hell and comes back—the mytheme is called the ''[[descent to the underworld]]''. Such tales are very common in the Near East: &quot;It is simply a fact—deal with it how you will—that the mythology [...] of the dead and resurrected god has been known for millenniums to the neolithic and post-neolithic Levant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Phrygia]]n god [[Attis]] castrates himself and dies, but Zeus either resurrects or eternally preserves the body, and in some versions the resurrected Attis ascends to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;For the fullest account of the myth, see the passage on [[Arnobius]]'s version in Tortchinov.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar myths exist in other parts of the world: a myth from [[Seram Island|Ceram]] features a miraculously-conceived girl named [[Hainuwele]] who is unjustly killed but is resurrected in the form of tubers, which the Ceramese see as Hainuwele's flesh and eat as their staple food.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 103-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Christians believed that Satan had inspired pseudo-Christian myths ''before'' Christianity had even appeared, to mislead pagans into disbelieving in Christ when he arrived:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They admitted, indeed, that in point of time Christ was the junior deity, but they triumphantly demonstrated his real seniority by falling back on the subtlety of Satan, who on so important an occasion had surpassed himself by inverting the usual order of nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Justin Martyr]], one of the early church Fathers, makes essentially this argument in his ''First Apology''.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, ''First Apology'', chapter 54: &quot;Having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come [...] [the demons] put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were said with regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things which were said by the poets.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent writer C. S. Lewis regarded the pagan &quot;dying gods&quot; as premonitions in the human mind of the Christ story that was to come.&lt;ref&gt;Brown&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Benedict XVI expressed a similar opinion in his 2006 homily for [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Lord mentioned [wheat's] deepest mystery on Palm Sunday, when some Greeks asked to see him. In his answer to this question is the phrase: 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit' (Jn 12: 24). [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mediterranean culture, in the centuries before Christ, had a profound intuition of this mystery. Based on the experience of this death and rising they created myths of divinity which, dying and rising, gave new life. To them, the cycle of nature seemed like a divine promise in the midst of the darkness of suffering and death that we are faced with.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In these myths, the soul of the human person, in a certain way, reached out toward that God made man, who, humiliated unto death on a cross, in this way opened the door of life to all of us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ratzinger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There have been some modern attempts to discredit the notion of a general &quot;dying god&quot; category of which Christ is a member.&lt;ref&gt;See Gittins.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cross as ''axis mundi''===
According to some scholars, the Cross functions in traditional Christianity as a mythological &quot;''[[axis mundi]]''&quot;. The ''axis mundi'', or cosmic axis, appears in many mythologies. It is the highest spot on earth, the place where heaven and earth meet. Often a sacred tree, mountain, or building acts as the ''axis mundi''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', pp. 3, 375&lt;/ref&gt; Fittingly, a tradition within Christianity identifies [[Mount Calvary]], the place of Christ's crucifixion, as the highest point on earth and the burial-place of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the first man.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Christian [[iconography]] symbolically identifies the Cross with the [[Tree of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that the Christian story of the Cross influenced the [[Norse mythology|Norse myth]] of the cosmic tree [[Yggdrasil]],&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; on which the god [[Odin]] suspended himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Hávamál'' 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connections with Zoroastrianism===
Some scholars believe that many elements of Christian mythology, particularly its linear portrayal of time, originated with the [[Persian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 190-92&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Boyce, an authority on Zoroastrianism, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Zoroaster was thus the first to teach the doctrines of an individual judgment, Heaven and Hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general Last Judgment, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body. These doctrines were to become familiar articles of faith to much of mankind, through borrowings by Judaism, Christianity and Islam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mircea Eliade believes the Hebrews had a sense of linear time before Zoroastrianism influenced them. However, he argues,
&quot;a number of other [Jewish] religious ideas were discovered, revalorized, of systematized in Iran&quot;. These ideas include a dualism between good and evil, belief in a future savior and resurrection, and &quot;an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other connections===
In [[Buddhist mythology]], the demon [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] tries to distract the historical Buddha, [[Siddhartha Gautama]], before he can reach enlightenment. [[Huston Smith]], a professor of philosophy and a writer on comparative religion, notes the similarity between Mara's temptation of the Buddha before his ministry and Satan's temptation of Christ before his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Book of Revelation, the author sees a vision of a pregnant woman in the sky being pursued by a huge red dragon. The dragon tries to devour her child when she gives birth, but the child is &quot;caught up to God and his throne&quot;. This appears to be an allegory for the triumph of Christianity: the child presumably represents Christ; the woman may represent God's people of the Old and New Testaments (who produced Christ); and the Dragon symbolizes Satan, who opposes Christ.&lt;ref&gt;footnote on Revelation 12:1-6 in ''The New American Bible'', St Joseph Edition&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catholic scholars, the images used in this allegory may have been inspired by pagan mythology:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;footnote on Revelation 12:1-6 in ''The New American Bible'', St Joseph Edition. The footnote does not specify which pagan myths it means.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In literary classics==
	 
Some novels and narrative poems centered on Christian themes have come to be regarded as literary classics. In a broad sense, these may also fall within the category of Christian mythology. These classics include ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' by [[John Bunyan]] and ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante]].

===In &quot;Mythopoeia&quot;===
	 
Some works of the Christian authors [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] have been described as both Christian and &quot;mythic&quot; or &quot;[[Mythopoeic literature|mythopoeic]]&quot; (&quot;myth-making&quot;) literature.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mythopoeic Society&quot;. Mythopoeic Society. 22 May 2008 &lt;http://www.mythsoc.org/index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien described his own fiction writing as an effort to create &quot;myth and fairy-story&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, letter to Milton.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien actually coined the term &quot;[[mythopoeia]]&quot; for modern literature that features a mythical tone and/or mythological themes. ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is Tolkien's most famous example of mythopoeia.
	 
Tolkien and Lewis regarded their writing as essentially Christian. Tolkien emphatically denied that his fantasy novels, the ''Lord of the Rings'' series, were in any sense &quot;allegory&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, letter to Milton&lt;/ref&gt; but he admitted that they were &quot;a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, quoted in Pearce&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, many of Lewis's works borrowed extensively from Christian narratives: one of the clearest examples is the ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', which has been interpreted as an allegory for certain Biblical stories, namely one of the central stories is of a great [[king]] who is sacrificed to save his people and is resurrected after three days. In the case of the ''Narnia'' series, Lewis denied that he was simply representing the Christian story in symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;plugay&quot;/&gt; These works of Christian &quot;mythopoeia&quot; may, along with other Christian literary classics, be classed as &quot;Christian mythology&quot; in a very broad sense.

===In popular culture===
Christmas stories have become prevalent in Western literature and culture, see [[Secular Christmas stories]], [[Christmas in the media]] and [[Christmas in literature]].

==History ==
===From Roman Empire to Europe===

After Christian theology was accepted by the Roman Empire, promoted by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in the 5th century, Christian mythology began to predominate the Roman Empire. Later the theology was carried north by [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Franks|Frankish]] people, and Christian themes began to weave into the framework of European [[mythology|mythologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade 1963:162-181&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Christian [[Continental Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Celtic mythology]] that were native to the tribes of Northern Europe were denounced and submerged, while saint myths, Mary stories, [[Crusade]] myths, and other Christian myths took their place. However, pre-Christian myths never went entirely away, they mingled with the (Roman Catholic) Christian framework to form new stories, like myths of the [[mythological kings]] and [[saints]] and [[miracle]]s, for example (Eliade 1963:162-181). Stories such as that of [[Beowulf]] and Icelandic, Norse, and Germanic sagas were reinterpreted somewhat, and given Christian meanings. The legend of [[King Arthur]] and the quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is a striking example.&lt;ref&gt;Treharne 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The thrust of incorporation took on one of two directions. When Christianity was on the advance, pagan myths were Christianized; when it was in retreat, Bible stories and Christian saints lost their mythological importance to the culture.

===Since Enlightenment===
Since the end of the 18th century, the biblical stories have lost some of their mythological basis to western society, owing to the scepticism of the [[enlightenment age|Enlightenment]], 19th-century [[freethinkers|freethinking]], and 20th century [[modernism]]. Most westerners no longer found Christianity to be their primary imaginative and mythological framework by which they understand the world. However other scholars believe mythology is in our psyche, and that mythical influences of Christianity are in many of our ideals, for example the Judeo-Christian idea of an after-life and heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade 1963:184&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[Virtual Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X]]'' by [[Tom Beaudoin]] explores the premise that Christian mythology is present in the mythologies of pop-culture, such as Madonna's ''[[Like a Prayer]]'' or Soundgarden's ''[[Black Hole Sun]].'' Modern myths are strong in comic book stories (as stories of [[culture hero]]es) and detective novels as myths of good versus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade 1963:185&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain groups within Western society still retain a strong element of Christian mythology in their understanding of life. It is also true that Christian myths often inform law and the ideals within different Western societies, but the idea of a [[Christendom]] that permeates all aspects of life is no longer applicable.

===Influence on Western progressivism===
Christian mythology, which presents a linear, progressive view of history, has deeply influenced the West's emphasis on progress. Even supposedly secular or political movements such as Marxism and Nazism &quot;announce the end of this world and the beginning of an age of plenty and bliss&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Mircea Eliade believes movements such as Marxism would have been impossible without the conceptual framework Christian mythology provided: &quot;Marx turns to his own account the Judaeo-Christian eschatological hope of an ''absolute goal of History''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[Joseph Campbell]] sees Marx's theory of history as a &quot;parody&quot; of Judeo-Christian mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 200-1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, the Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian myth of the final triumph of good over evil appears repeatedly in Western intellectual, political, and spiritual movements:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In the end, which is inevitable, the dark and evil power [...] is to be destroyed forever in a crisis of world renovation to which all history tends—and to the realization of which every individual is categorically summoned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Robert Ellwood, a professor of religion, agrees. According to him, &quot;Western modernism&quot;, with its belief in &quot;emancipation through progress&quot;, is &quot;to no small degree the secularization of Judaism and Christianity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|business corporations}}
A '''corporation''' is a legal entity that is created under the laws of a [[State (polity)|state]] designed to establish the entity as a [[separate legal entity]] having its own privileges and liabilities distinct from those of its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corporation Definition of a &quot;corporation&quot; from Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different forms of corporations, most of which are used to conduct [[business]]. Early corporations were established by charter (i.e. by an ''ad hoc'' act passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration.

An important (but not universal) contemporary feature of a corporation is [[limited liability]]. If a corporation fails, shareholders normally only stand to lose their investment and employees will lose their jobs, but neither will be further liable for debts that remain owing to the corporation's creditors.

Despite not being natural persons, corporations are recognized by the law to have rights and responsibilities like natural persons (&quot;people&quot;). Corporations can exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Art.8, especially Art.(4)&lt;/ref&gt; and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) discusses the controversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are conceptually immortal but they can &quot;die&quot; when they are &quot;dissolved&quot; either by statutory operation, order of court, or voluntary action on the part of shareholders. [[Insolvency]] may result in a form of corporate 'death', when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Business Corporations Act (B.C.) [SBC 2002] CHAPTER 57, Part 10&lt;/ref&gt; but it most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offenses, such as [[fraud]] and [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although corporate law varies in different jurisdictions, there are four core characteristics of the business corporation:&lt;ref&gt;RC Clark, ''Corporate Law'' (Aspen 1986) 2; See also, Hansmann et al., ''The Anatomy of Corporate Law'' (2004) Ch.1, p.2; C. A. Cooke, Corporation, Trust and Company: A Legal History, (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of corporations|List of oldest companies}}
[[File:Stora Kopparberg 1288.jpg|thumb|1/8 share of the [[Stora Kopparberg]] mine, dated June 16, 1288.]]
The word &quot;corporation&quot; derives from ''corpus'', the [[Latin]] word for body, or a &quot;body of people.&quot; Entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights were found in ancient Rome, and the [[Maurya Empire]] in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;Vikramaditya S. Khanna (2005). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id= ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] [[University of Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, churches became incorporated, as did local governments, such as the [[Pope]] and the [[City of London Corporation]]. The point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member, existing in perpetuity. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the [[Stora Kopparberg]] mining community in [[Falun]], [[Sweden]], obtained a [[charter]] from King [[Magnus II of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] in 1347. Many European nations chartered corporations to lead colonial ventures, such as the [[Dutch East India Company]] or the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and these corporations came to play a large part in the history of [[corporate colonialism]].
[[File:Corporate mapping.jpg|thumb|Corporate mapping]]
During the time of colonial expansion in the 17th century, the true progenitors of the modern corporation emerged as the &quot;chartered company&quot;. Acting under a charter sanctioned by the Dutch government, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) defeated [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces and established itself in the [[Moluccan Islands]] in order to profit from the [[Europe]]an demand for [[spices]]. Investors in the VOC were issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership, and were able to trade their shares on the original [[Amsterdam]] stock exchange. Shareholders are also explicitly granted [[limited liability]] in the company's royal charter.&lt;ref&gt;Om Prakash, ''European Commercial Enterprise in Pre-Colonial India'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century, Stewart Kyd, the author of the first treatise on [[corporate law]] in English, defined a corporation as,

{{quote|a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a special denomination, having [[perpetual succession]] under an artificial form, and vested, by policy of the law, with the capacity of acting, in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and granting property, of contracting obligations, and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred upon it, either at the time of its creation, or at any subsequent period of its existence.|&lt;ref&gt;A Treatise on the Law of Corporations, Stewart Kyd (1793-1794)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mercantilism===
{{See also|Mercantilism|South Sea Bubble}}
[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond.jpg|thumb|A [[bond (finance)|bond]] issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]], dating from 1623, for the amount of 2,400 florins]]
Labeled by both contemporaries and historians as &quot;the grandest society of merchants in the universe&quot;,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} the [[British East India Company]] would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation, as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitive.&lt;ref&gt;John Keay, ''The Honorable Company: A History of the English East India Company'' (MacMillan, New York 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1600, the [[English monarchy]] granted the company a 15-year monopoly on trade to and from the [[East Indies]] and [[Africa]]. By 1611, shareholders in the East India Company were earning an almost 150% [[return on investment|return on their investment]]. Subsequent stock offerings demonstrated just how lucrative the Company had become. Its first stock offering in 1613-1616 raised ₤418,000, and its first offering in 1617-1622 raised ₤1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' at 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], government chartering began to fall out of vogue in the mid-19th century. Corporate law at the time was focused on protection of the public interest, and not on the interests of corporate shareholders. Corporate charters were closely regulated by the states. Forming a corporation usually required an act of legislature. Investors generally had to be given an equal say in corporate governance, and corporations were required to comply with the purposes expressed in their charters. Many private firms in the 19th century avoided the corporate model for these reasons ([[Andrew Carnegie]] formed his steel operation as a [[limited partnership]], and [[John D. Rockefeller]] set up [[Standard Oil]] as a [[Trust (19th century)|trust]]). Eventually, state governments began to realize the greater corporate registration revenues available by providing more permissive corporate laws. [[New Jersey]] was the first state to adopt an &quot;enabling&quot; corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ftzqaBv7X_sC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=%22new+jersey%22+%22first+state%22+%22business+corporation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=n5Af0liBo5&amp;sig=A2RRh_zOyS7W3CCMK4ZyG6Scmwk The Law of Business Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delaware]] followed, and soon became known as the most corporation-friendly state in the country after New Jersey raised taxes on the corporations, driving them out. New Jersey reduced these taxes after this mistake was realized, but by then it was too late; even today, most major public corporations in the United States are set up under Delaware law.

By the beginning of the 19th century, government policy on both sides of the Atlantic began to change, reflecting the growing popularity of the proposition that corporations were riding the economic wave of the future. In 1819, the U.S. Supreme Court granted corporations a plethora of rights they had not previously recognized or enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'', 17 U.S. 518 (1819).&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate charters were deemed &quot;inviolable&quot;, and not subject to arbitrary amendment or abolition by state governments.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Corporation as a whole was labeled an &quot;artificial person,&quot; possessing both individuality and immortality.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, British legislation was similarly freeing the corporation from historical restrictions. In 1844 the [[British Parliament]] passed the Joint Stock Companies Act, which allowed companies to incorporate without a royal charter or an Act of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Sean M. O'Connor, ''Be Careful What You Wish For: How Accountants and Congress Created the Problem of Auditor Independence'', 45 B.C.L. Rev. 741, 749 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[limited liability]], the key provision of modern corporate law, passed into English law: in response to increasing pressure from newly emerging capital interests, Parliament passed the Limited Liability Act of 1855, which established the principle that any corporation could enjoy limited legal liability on both contract and tort claims simply by registering as a &quot;limited&quot; company with the appropriate government agency.&lt;ref&gt;Limited Liability Act, 18 &amp; 19 Vict., ch. 133 (1855)(Eng.), cited in Paul G. Mahoney, ''Contract or Concession? An Essay on the History of Corporate Law'', 34 Ga. L. Rev. 873, 892 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

This prompted the English periodical ''[[The Economist]]'' to write in 1855 that &quot;never, perhaps, was a change so vehemently and generally demanded, of which the importance was so much overrated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Graeme G. Acheson &amp; John D. Turner, ''The Impact of Limited Liability on Ownership and Control: Irish Banking, 1877-1914'', School of Management and Economics, Queen's University of Belfast, available at [http://www.ehs.org/uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; The glaring inaccuracy of the second part of this judgment was recognized by the same magazine more than 75 years later, when it claimed that, &quot;[t]he economic historian of the future . . . may be inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited liability, as applied to trading corporations, a place of honour with [[Watt]] and [[Stephenson]], and other pioneers of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Economist'', December 18, 1926, at 1053, as quoted in Mahoney, ''supra'', at 875.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern corporations===
By the end of the 19th century the [[Sherman Act]], New Jersey allowing [[holding companies]], and [[mergers]] resulted in larger corporations with dispersed shareholders. (See [[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]] &lt;ref&gt;For a comparison of the differences between the &quot;Classic Corporation&quot; (before 1860) and the &quot;Modern Corporation&quot; (after 1900), see Ted Nace, ''Gangs of America: The Rise of Corporate Power and the Disabling of Democracy'' 71 (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc., San Francisco 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' decision began to influence policymaking and the modern corporate era had begun.

The 20th century saw a proliferation of enabling law across the world, which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I. Starting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward [[privatization]], the selling of publicly owned services and enterprises to corporations. [[Deregulation]] (reducing the regulation of corporate activity) often accompanied privatization as part of a [[laissez-faire]] policy. Another major postwar shift was toward the development of [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base. Japanese firms developed a horizontal conglomeration model, the [[keiretsu]], which was later duplicated in other countries as well.&lt;ref&gt;Apple&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate law==
{{Main|Corporate law}}
{{BusinessLaw}}
The existence of a corporation requires a special legal framework and body of law that specifically grants the corporation legal personality, and typically views a corporation as a ''fictional person'', a ''legal person'', or a ''moral person'' (as opposed to a natural person). Corporate statutes typically empower corporations to own property, sign binding contracts, and pay taxes in a capacity separate from that of its shareholders (who are sometimes referred to as &quot;members&quot;). According to [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Haldane]], 

{{quote|...a corporation is an abstraction. It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own; its active and directing will must consequently be sought in the person of somebody who is really the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation.|&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd]]'' [1915] AC 705&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The legal personality has two economic implications. First it grants creditors (as opposed to shareholders or employees) priority over the corporate assets upon liquidation. Second, corporate assets cannot be withdrawn by its shareholders, nor can the assets of the firm be taken by personal creditors of its shareholders. The second feature requires special legislation and a special legal framework, as it cannot be reproduced via standard contract law.&lt;ref&gt;Hansmann et al., ''The Anatomy of Corporate Law'', pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The regulations most favorable to [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] include:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Regulation
!Description
|-
|Limited liability
|Unlike a [[partnership]] or [[sole proprietorship]], shareholders of a modern business corporation have &quot;limited&quot; [[legal liability|liability]] for the corporation's debts and obligations.&lt;ref&gt;A leading case in common law is ''[[Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' [1897] AC 22.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their losses cannot exceed the amount which they contributed to the corporation as dues or payment for [[shares]]. This enables corporations to &quot;socialize their costs&quot; for the primary benefit of shareholders; to socialize a cost is to spread it to society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hock |first=Dee |title=One from many |page=140 |quote=... they have become a superb instrument for the capitalization of gain and the socialization of cost. |year=2005 |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers |isbn=1576753323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic rationale for this is that it allows anonymous trading in the shares of the corporation, by eliminating the corporation's creditors as a stakeholder in such a transaction. Without limited liability, a creditor would probably not allow any share to be sold to a buyer at least as creditworthy as the seller. Limited liability further allows corporations to raise large amounts of finance for their enterprises by combining funds from many owners of stock. Limited liability reduces the amount that a shareholder can lose in a company. This increases the attraction to potential shareholders, and thus increases both the number of willing shareholders and the amount they are likely to invest. However, some jurisdictions also permit another type of corporation, in which shareholders' liability is unlimited, for example the [[unlimited liability corporation]] in two provinces of Canada, and the [[unlimited company]] in the United Kingdom.
|-
|Perpetual lifetime
|Another advantage is that the [[assets]] and structure of the corporation may continue beyond the lifetimes of its shareholders and bondholders. This allows stability and the accumulation of capital, which is thus available for investment in larger and longer-lasting projects than if the corporate assets were subject to [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]] and [[liquidation|distribution]]. This was also important in [[medieval]] times, when land donated to the Church (a corporation) would not generate the feudal fees that a lord could claim upon a landholder's death. In this regard, see [[Statute of Mortmain]]. (However a corporation can be dissolved by a government authority, putting an end to its existence as a legal entity. But this usually only happens if the company breaks the law, for example, fails to meet annual filing requirements, or in certain circumstances if the company requests dissolution.)
|}

===Ownership and control===
Persons and other legal entities composed of persons (such as [[Trust company|trusts]] and other corporations) can have the right to vote or receive dividends once declared by the [[board of directors]]. In the case of for-profit corporations, these voters hold [[share (finance)|shares]] of stock and are thus called [[shareholders]] or [[stockholders]]. When no stockholders exist, a corporation may exist as a [[non-stock corporation]] (in the United Kingdom, a &quot;company limited by guarantee&quot;) and instead of having stockholders, the corporation has members who have the right to vote on its operations. Voting members are not the only members of a &quot;Corporation&quot;. The members of a non-stock corporation are identified in the Articles of Incorporation (UK equivalent: ''Articles of Association'') and the titles of the member classes may include &quot;Trustee,&quot; &quot;Active,&quot; &quot;Associate,&quot; and/or &quot;Honorary.&quot; However, each of these listed in the Articles of Incorporation are members of the Corporation. The Articles of Incorporation may define the &quot;Corporation&quot; by another name, such as &quot;The ABC Club, Inc.&quot; and, in which case, the &quot;Corporation&quot; and &quot;The ABC Club, Inc.&quot; or just &quot;The Club&quot; are considered synonymous and interchangeable as they may appear elsewhere in the Articles of Incorporation or the [[By-Laws]]. If the non-stock corporation is not operated for profit, it is called a [[not-for-profit corporation]]. In either category, the corporation comprises a collective of individuals with a distinct legal status and with special privileges not provided to ordinary unincorporated businesses, to [[voluntary association]]s, or to groups of individuals.

There are two broad classes of corporate governance forms in the world. In most of the world, control of the corporation is determined by a [[board of directors]] which is elected by the shareholders. In some jurisdictions, such as Germany, the control of the corporation is divided into two tiers with a [[supervisory board]] which elects a [[managing board]]. Germany is also unique in having a system known as [[co-determination]] in which half of the supervisory board consists of representatives of the employees. The [[CEO]], president, treasurer, and other titled officers are usually chosen by the board to manage the affairs of the corporation.

In addition to the limited influence of shareholders, corporations can be controlled (in part) by creditors such as banks. In return for lending money to the corporation, creditors can demand a controlling interest analogous to that of a member, including one or more seats on the board of directors. In some jurisdictions, such as Germany and Japan, it is standard for banks to own shares in corporations whereas in other jurisdictions such as the United States, under the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] of 1933, and the United Kingdom, under the [[Bank of England]], banks are prohibited from owning shares in external corporations. However, since 1999 in the U. S., commercial banks have been allowed to enter into investment banking through separate subsidiaries thanks to the Financial Services Modernization Act or [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]]. Since 1997, banks in the U. K. are supervised by the Financial Services Authority; its rules are non-restrictive allowing both foreign and domestic capital to operate all financial institutions, including insurance, commercial and financial banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grosse |first=Robert E. |title=The future of global financial services |pages=57–62 |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=1405117005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the Board's decision to dissolve a for-profit corporation, shareholders receive the leftovers, following creditors and others with interests in the corporation. However shareholders receive the benefit of limited liability, so they are liable only for the amount they contributed.

===Formation===
Historically, corporations were created by a [[charter]] granted by government. Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government. Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address, as well as a [[registered agent]] (a person or company designated to receive legal service of process). It may also be required to designate an [[Agent (law)|agent]] or other legal representative of the corporation.

Generally, a corporation files [[articles of incorporation]] with the government, laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors. Once the articles are approved, the corporation's directors meet to create [[bylaws]] that govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures and officer positions.

The law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities, as well as its finances. If a corporation operates outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments as a [[foreign corporation]], and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to [[employment]], [[crime]]s, [[contract]]s, [[civil action]]s, and the like.

===Naming===
Corporations generally have a distinct name. Historically, some corporations were named after their membership: for instance, &quot;The President and Fellows of Harvard College.&quot; Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership. In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example,, &quot;12345678 Ontario Limited&quot;), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.

In most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, &quot;Incorporated&quot; or &quot;Inc.&quot; in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, &quot;Limited&quot; or &quot;Ltd.&quot;). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions they are mandatory, and in others they are not.&lt;ref&gt;The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] is an example of a jurisdiction that does not require corporations to indicate corporate status in their names, except for close corporations.  The drafters of the 1977 revision of the California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status, but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that would have had to change their names, and the lack of any evidence that anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status was not immediately apparent from their names.  However, the 1977 drafters were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close corporations.  See Harold Marsh, Jr., R. Roy Finkle, Larry W. Sonsini, and Ann Yvonne Walker, ''Marsh's California Corporation Law'', 4th ed., vol. 1 (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2004), 5-15 — 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Their use puts everybody on [[constructive notice]] that they are dealing with an entity whose [[legal liability|liability]] is limited, and does not reach back to the persons who own the entity: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it. 

Some jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word &quot;'''company'''&quot; alone to denote corporate status, since the word &quot;[[company]]&quot; may refer to a [[partnership]] or some other form of collective ownership (in the to United States it can be used by a [[sole proprietorship]] but this is not generally the case elsewhere).

===Financial disclosure===
In many jurisdictions, corporations whose shareholders benefit from limited liability are required to publish annual [[financial statements]] and other data, so that creditors who do business with the corporation are able to assess the creditworthiness of the corporation and cannot enforce claims against shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RulK-zdA-HwC Hicks, A. and Goo, S.H. (2008) ''Cases and Materials on Company Law'' Oxford University Press] Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Shareholders therefore sacrifice some loss of privacy in return for limited liability. This requirement generally applies in Europe, but not in [[Anglo-American]] jurisdictions, except for publicly traded corporations, where financial disclosure is required for investor protection.

===Unresolved issues===
The nature of the corporation continues to evolve in response to new situations as existing corporations promote new ideas and structures, the courts respond, and governments issue new regulations. A question of long standing is that of diffused responsibility. For example, if a corporation is found liable for a death, how should culpability and punishment for it be allocated among shareholders, directors, management and staff, and the corporation itself? See [[corporate liability]], and specifically, [[corporate manslaughter]].

The law differs among jurisdictions, and is in a state of flux. Some argue that shareholders should be ultimately responsible in such circumstances, forcing them to consider issues other than profit when investing, but a corporation may have millions of small shareholders who know nothing about its business activities. Moreover, traders &amp;mdash; especially [[hedge fund]]s &amp;mdash; may turn over shares in corporations many times a day.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Ontario's Environmental Protection Act.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of corporate repeat offenders (see H. Glasbeak, &quot;Wealth by Stealth: Corporate Crime, Corporate Law, and the Perversion of Democracy&quot;, ISBN 978-1896357416, Between the Lines Press: Toronto 2002) raises the question of the so-called &quot;death penalty for corporations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=1810 CorpWatch : The Death Penalty for Corporations Comes of Age]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2009}}
:''For a list of types of corporation and other business types by country, see [[Types of business entity]].''

Most corporations are registered with the local jurisdiction as either a stock corporation or a non-stock corporation. Stock corporations sell stock to generate capital. A stock corporation is generally a for-profit corporation. A [[non-stock corporation]] does not have stockholders, but may have members who have voting rights in the corporation.

Some jurisdictions ([[Washington, D.C.]], for example) separate corporations into for-profit and non-profit, as opposed to dividing into stock and non-stock.

Several states also allow a variation of the corporation for use by professionals (i.e., those individuals typically considered as professionals who require a license from the state to conduct business). In some states, such as [http://www.sos.state.ga.us/corporations Georgia], these corporations are known as &quot;professional corporations&quot;.

===For-profit and non-profit===
{{Main|non-profit organization}}

In modern economic systems, conventions of [[corporate governance]] commonly appear in a wide variety of business and [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] activities. Though the laws governing these creatures of [[statute]] often differ, the courts often interpret provisions of the law that apply to profit-making enterprises in the same manner (or in a similar manner) when applying principles to non-profit organizations &amp;mdash; as the underlying structures of these two types of entity often resemble each other.

===Closely held corporations and publicly traded corporations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
{{splitsection|closely held corporation|date=October 2010}}
{{splitsection|publicly traded corporation|date=October 2010}}
The institution most often referenced by the word &quot;corporation&quot; is a '''publicly traded''' corporation, the shares of which are traded on a public stock exchange (for example,, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] or [[Nasdaq]] in the United States) where shares of stock of corporations are bought and sold by and to the general public. Most of the largest businesses in the world are publicly traded corporations. However, the majority of corporations are said to be '''closely held''', '''privately held''' or '''close corporations''', meaning that no ready market exists for the trading of shares. Many such corporations are owned and managed by a small group of businesspeople or companies, although the size of such a corporation can be as vast as the largest public corporations.

Closely held corporations do have some advantages over publicly traded corporations. A small, closely held company can often make company-changing decisions much more rapidly than a publicly traded company. A publicly traded company is also at the mercy of the market, having capital flow in and out based not only on what the company is doing but the market and even what the competitors are doing. Publicly traded companies also have advantages over their closely held counterparts. Publicly traded companies often have more [[working capital]] and can delegate debt throughout all shareholders. This means that people invested in a publicly traded company will each take a much smaller hit to their own capital as opposed to those involved with a closely held corporation. Publicly traded companies though suffer from this exact advantage. A closely held corporation can often voluntarily take a hit to profit with little to no repercussions (as long as it is not a sustained loss). A publicly traded company though often comes under extreme scrutiny if profit and growth are not evident to stock holders, thus stock holders may sell, further damaging the company. Often this blow is enough to make a small public company fail.

Often communities benefit from a closely held company more so than from a public company. A closely held company is far more likely to stay in a single place that has treated them well, even if going through hard times. The shareholders can incur some of the damage the company may receive from a bad year or slow period in the company profits. Closely held companies often have a better relationship with workers. In larger, publicly traded companies, often when a year has gone badly the first area to feel the effects are the work force with lay offs or worker hours, wages or benefits being cut. Again, in a closely held business the shareholders can incur this profit damage rather than passing it to the workers. 

The affairs of publicly traded and [[closely held corporation]]s are similar in many respects. The main difference in most countries is that publicly traded corporations have the burden of complying with additional securities laws, which (especially in the U.S.) may require additional periodic disclosure (with more stringent requirements), stricter corporate governance standards, and additional procedural obligations in connection with major corporate transactions (for example, mergers) or events (for example, elections of directors).

A closely held corporation may be a [[subsidiary]] of another corporation (its [[parent company]]), which may itself be either a closely held or a public corporation. In some jurisdictions, the subsidiary of a listed public corporation is also defined as a public corporation (for example,, [[Australia]]).

===Mutual benefit corporations===&lt;!-- [[Mutual benefit corporation]] links to here --&gt;
A mutual benefit nonprofit corporation is a corporation formed in the United States solely for the benefit of its members. An example of a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation is a golf club. Individuals pay to join the club, memberships may be bought and sold, and any property owned by the club is distributed to its members if the club dissolves. The club can decide, in its corporate bylaws, how many members to have, and who can be a member. Generally, while it is a nonprofit corporation, a mutual benefit corporation is not a charity. Because it is not a charity, a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation cannot obtain 501(c)(3) status. If there is a dispute as to how a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation is being operated, it is up to the members to resolve the dispute since the corporation exists to solely serve the needs of its membership and not the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.state.vt.us/tutor/dobiz/forms/definitions/mutben.htm Official website of the Secretary of State, for the (United States) state of Vermont]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations globally==
{{Main|Multinational corporation}}
Following on the success of the corporate model at a national level, many corporations have become transnational or [[multinational corporation]]s: growing beyond national boundaries to attain sometimes remarkable positions of power and influence in the process of [[globalization|globalizing]].

The typical &quot;transnational&quot; or &quot;multinational&quot; may fit into a web of overlapping shareholders and directorships, with multiple branches and lines in different regions, many such sub-groupings comprising corporations in their own right. Growth by expansion may favor national or regional branches; growth by [[Takeover|acquisition]] or [[merger]] can result in a plethora of groupings scattered around and/or spanning the globe, with structures and names which do not always make clear the structures of shareholder ownership and interaction.

In the spread of corporations across multiple continents, the importance of [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]] has grown as a unifying factor and a counterweight to local national sensibilities and cultural awareness.

===Australia===
{{Main|Corporations Act 2001}}
In [[Australia]] corporations are registered and regulated by the Commonwealth Government through the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]]. Corporations law has been largely codified in the [[Corporations Act 2001]].

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]] there are many different types of corporations (&quot;sociedades&quot;), but the two most common ones commercially speaking are: (i) &quot;sociedade limitada&quot;, identified by &quot;Ltda.&quot; after the company's name, equivalent to the British limited company, and (ii) &quot;sociedade anônima&quot; or &quot;companhia&quot;, identified by &quot;SA&quot; or &quot;Companhia&quot; in the company's name, equivalent to the British public limited company. The &quot;Ltda.&quot; is mainly governed by the new Civil Code, enacted in 2002, and the &quot;SA&quot; by the Law 6.404 dated 15 December 1976.

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian corporation}}
In [[Canada]] both the federal government and the [[province]]s have corporate statutes, and thus a corporation may have a provincial or a federal charter. Many older corporations in Canada stem from [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] passed before the introduction of general corporation law. The oldest corporation in Canada is the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]; though its business has always been based in Canada, its [[Royal Charter]] was issued in England by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1670, and became a Canadian charter by amendment in 1970 when it moved its corporate headquarters from London to Canada. Federally recognized corporations are regulated by the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]].

===German-speaking countries===
{{Main|Aktiengesellschaft}}
[[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] recognize two forms of corporation: the [[Aktiengesellschaft]] (AG), analogous to public corporations in the English-speaking world, and the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]] (GmbH), similar to (and an inspiration for) the modern [[limited liability company]].

===Italy===
The [[Italian Republic]] recognizes three types of company with limited liability: &quot;S.r.l&quot;, or &quot;Società a responsabilità limitata&quot; (a private [[limited company]]), &quot;S.p.A&quot; or &quot;Società per Azioni&quot; (a joint-stock company, similar to a [[Public Limited Company]] in the United Kingdom), and &quot;S.a.p.a&quot; (&quot;Società in Accomandita per Azioni&quot;). The latter is a hybrid form that involves two categories of shareholders, some with and some without limited liability, and is rarely used in practice.

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], both the state and local public entities under the [[Local Autonomy Law]] ([[prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] and [[municipalities of Japan|municipalities]]) are considered to be {{Nihongo|corporations|法人|hōjin}}. Non-profit corporations may be established under the [[Civil Code]].

The term {{Nihongo|&quot;company&quot;|会社|kaisha}} is used to refer to business corporations. The predominant form is the ''[[kabushiki kaisha]]'' (株式会社), used by public corporations as well as smaller enterprises. ''[[Mochibun kaisha]]'' (持分会社), a form for smaller enterprises, are becoming increasingly common. Between 2002 and 2008, the {{Nihongo|[[intermediary corporation]]|中間法人|chūkan hōjin}} existed to bridge the gap between for-profit companies and non-governmental and non-profit organizations.

===Spain===
In [[Spain]] there are two types of companies: with limited liability called &quot;S.L&quot;, or &quot;Sociedad Limitada&quot; (a private [[limited company]]) and &quot;S.A.&quot; or &quot;Sociedad Anónima&quot; (similar to a [[Public Limited Company]]).

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|UK company law}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], 'corporation' most commonly refers to a [[body corporate]] formed by [[Royal Charter]] or by statute, of which few now remain. The [[BBC]] is the oldest and best known corporation within the UK that is still in existence. Others, such as the [[British Steel Corporation]], were [[privatized]] in the 1980s. 

In the private sector, corporations are referred to as companies, and are regulated by the [[Companies Act 2006]] (or the [[Northern Ireland]] equivalent). The most common type of company is the private [[limited company]] (&quot;Limited&quot; or &quot;Ltd.&quot;). Private limited companies can either be limited by shares or by guarantee. Other corporate forms include the [[public limited company]] (&quot;PLC&quot;) and the private [[unlimited company]], and companies limited by guarantee.

A special type of corporation is a [[corporation sole]], which is an office held by an individual natural person (the incumbent), but which has a continuing legal entity separate from that person: an example is a [[Church of England]] bishopric

===United States===
{{See also|Delaware corporation}}
Several types of conventional corporations exist in the [[United States]]. Generically, any business entity that is recognized as distinct from the people who own it (i.e., is not a sole proprietorship or a partnership) is a corporation. This generic label includes entities that are known by such legal labels as ‘association’, ‘organization’ and ‘limited liability company’, as well as corporations proper. 

Only a company that has been formally incorporated according to the laws of a particular state is called ‘corporation’. A corporation was defined in the Dartmouth College case of 1819, in which Chief Justice Marshall of the United States Supreme Court stated that &quot; A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of the law&quot;. A corporation is a legal entity, distinct and separate from the individuals who create and operate it. As legal entity the corporation can acquire, own, and dispose of property in its own name like buildings, land and equipment. It can also incur liabilities and enter into contracts like franchising and leasing. American corporations can be either profit-making companies or non-profit entities. Tax-exempt non-profit corporations are often called “501(c)3 corporation”, after the section of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] that addresses the tax exemption for many of them.

Corporations are created by filing the requisite documents with a particular state government. The process is called “incorporation,” referring to the abstract concept of clothing the entity with a &quot;veil&quot; of artificial personhood (embodying, or “corporating” it, ‘corpus’ being the Latin word for ‘body’). Only certain corporations, including banks, are chartered. Others simply file their articles of incorporation with the state government as part of a registration process.

The [[government of the United States|federal government]] can only create corporate entities pursuant to relevant powers in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. For example, Congress has constitutional power to provide postal services, so it has power to operate the [[United States Postal Service]].

Once incorporated, the corporation has artificial personhood everywhere it may operate, until such time as the corporation may be dissolved. A corporation that operates in one state while being incorporated in another is a “foreign corporation.” This label also applies to corporations incorporated outside of the United States. Foreign corporations must usually register with the secretary of state’s office in each state to lawfully conduct business in that state.

A corporation is legally a citizen of the state (or other jurisdiction) in which it is incorporated (except when circumstances direct the corporation be classified as a citizen of the state in which it has its head office, or the state in which it does the majority of its business). Corporate business law differs from state to state, and many prospective corporations choose to incorporate in a state whose laws are most favorable to its business interests. Many large corporations are incorporated in [[Delaware corporation|Delaware]], for example, without being physically located there because that state has very favorable corporate tax and disclosure laws.

Companies set up for [[privacy]] or asset protection often incorporate in [[Nevada]], which does not require disclosure of share ownership. Many states, particularly smaller ones, have modeled their corporate statutes after the [[Model Business Corporation Act]], one of many model sets of law prepared and published by the [[American Bar Association]].

As [[juristic persons]], corporations have certain rights that attach to natural persons. The vast majority of them attach to corporations under state law, especially the law of the state in which the company is incorporated – since the corporations very existence is predicated on the laws of that state. A few rights also attach by federal constitutional and statutory law, but they are few and far between compared to the rights of natural persons. For example, a corporation has the personal right to bring a lawsuit (as well as the capacity to be sued) and, like a natural person, a corporation can be libeled. 

But a corporation has no constitutional right to freely exercise its religion because religious exercise is something that only &quot;natural&quot; persons can do. That is, only human beings, not business entities, have the necessary faculties of belief and spirituality that enable them to possess and exercise religious beliefs.

[[Harvard College]] (a component of [[Harvard University]]), formally the [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]] (also known as the Harvard Corporation), is the oldest corporation in the western hemisphere. Founded in 1636, the second of Harvard’s two governing boards was incorporated by the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court of Massachusetts]] in 1650. Significantly, Massachusetts itself was a corporate colony at that time – owned and operated by the Massachusetts Bay Company (until it lost its charter in 1684) - so Harvard College is a corporation created by a corporation.

Many nations have modeled their own corporate laws on American business law. Corporate law in [[Saudi Arabia]], for example, follows the model of New York State corporate law. In addition to typical corporations in the United States, the federal government, in 1971 passed the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA), which authorized the creation of 12 regional native corporations for [[Alaska Natives]] and over 200 village corporations that were entitled to a settlement of land and cash. In addition to the 12 regional corporations, the legislation permitted a 13th regional corporation without a land settlement for those Alaska Natives living out of the [[State of Alaska]] at the time of passage of ANCSA.

==Corporate taxation==
{{Main|Corporate tax}}
In many countries corporate profits are taxed at a corporate tax rate, and dividends paid to shareholders are taxed at a separate rate. Such a system is sometimes referred to as &quot;[[double taxation]]&quot;, because any profits distributed to shareholders will eventually be taxed twice. One solution to this (as in the case of the Australian and UK tax systems) is for the recipient of the dividend to be entitled to a tax credit which addresses the fact that the profits represented by the dividend have already been taxed. The company profit being passed on is therefore effectively only taxed at the rate of tax paid by the eventual recipient of the dividend. In other systems, dividends are taxed at a lower rate than other income (for example, in the US) or shareholders are taxed directly on the corporation's profits and dividends are not taxed (for example, [[S corporation]]s in the US).

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Criticisms of corporations}}

As [[Adam Smith]] pointed out in the [[Wealth of Nations]], when ownership is separated from management (i.e. the actual production process required to obtain the capital), the latter will inevitably begin to neglect the interests of the former, creating dysfunction within the company.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith,
''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' 741 (Clarendon, Oxford 1776).&lt;/ref&gt; Some maintain that recent events in [[corporate America]] may serve to reinforce Smith's warnings about the dangers of legally protected [[collectivist]] hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;The fall of the Enron corporation stemmed largely from the company's attempt to create new energy trading markets, and its strategy of trading paper wealth in order to maintain the appearance of profitability.  For a thorough analysis of Enron's missteps and ultimate destruction, see Kurt Eichenwald, ''Conspiracy of Fools'' (Broadway Books, New York 20050.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other business entities==
{{Main|Types of business entity}}
Almost every recognized type of organization carries out some economic activities (for example, the [[family business|family]]). Other organizations that may carry out activities that are generally considered to be ''business'' exist under the laws of various countries. These include:
*[[Consumers' cooperative]]
*[[Holding company]]
*[[Limited company]] (Ltd.)
*[[Limited liability company]] (LLC)
*[[Limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP)
*[[Limited liability partnership]] (LLP)
*[[Limited partnership]] (LP)
*[[L3C|Low-profit limited liability company]] (L3C)
*[[Not-for-profit corporation]]
*[[Partnership]]
*[[Sole proprietorship]]

The '''Fairchild Channel F''' is a game console released by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in August 1976 at the retail price of $169.95. It has the distinction of being the first programmable [[ROM cartridge]]-based [[video game console]]. It was launched as the '''Video Entertainment System''', or '''VES''', but when [[Atari]] released their [[Atari 2600|VCS]] the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine.

==The console==
The Channel F electronics were designed by [[Jerry Lawson (engineer)|Jerry Lawson]] using the [[Fairchild F8]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], the first public outing of this processor. Jerry worked with Nick Talesfore who was responsible for the Industrial Design of the hand controllers, console and video game cartridges as the manager of Industrial Design; and, Ron Smith who was responsible for the mechanical engineering of the video cartridges and the 8 degrees of freedom hand controllers. All worked for Fairchild Semiconductor headed by Wilf Corigan a division of Fairchild Camera &amp; Instrument. Notably, [[Robert Noyce]] worked on the F8 design team before he left Fairchild to start his own company, [[Intel]]. The F8 is very complex compared to the typical integrated circuits of the day, and had more inputs and outputs than other contemporary chips. Because chip packaging was not available with enough pins, the F8 is instead fabricated as a pair of chips that had to be used together to form a complete CPU.

[[Image:Fairchild Channel F test picture.png|250px|thumb|right| The palette of the Channel F]] The graphics are quite basic by modern standards. The Channel F was only able to use one plane of graphics and one of four background colors per line, only three plot colors to choose from (red, green and blue) that turned into white if the background was set to black. A resolution of 128 × 64 with approximately 102 × 58 pixels visible and help from only 64 bytes of system RAM, half the amount of the [[Atari 2600]].&lt;ref&gt;http://classicdev.org/images/thumb/3/31/FVE100_schematic_sheet_1of3.gif/1280px-FVE100_schematic_sheet_1of3.gif&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://classicdev.org/images/thumb/5/55/FVE100_schematic_sheet_2of3.png/1280px-FVE100_schematic_sheet_2of3.png&lt;/ref&gt; The F8 processor at the heart of the console was able to produce enough AI to allow for player versus computer matches, a first in console history. All previous machines required a human opponent.

One unique feature to this console is the 'hold' button, which allows the player to freeze the game, change the time or change the speed of the game during the course of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=890 |title=Old-Computers.com |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original unit, sound is played through an internal speaker, rather than the TV set. However, the System II passes sound to the television through the RF switch.

The controllers are a joystick without a base; the main body is a large hand grip with a triangular &quot;cap&quot; on top, the top being the portion that actually moved for eight-way directional control. It can be used as both a joystick and paddle (twist), and not only pushed down to operate as a fire button but also pulled up. The model 1 unit contains a small compartment for storing the controllers when moving it. The System II featured detachable controllers. [[Zircon (company)|Zircon]] later offered a special control which featured an action button on the front of the joystick. It was marketed by Zircon as &quot;Channel F Jet-Stick&quot; in a letter sent out to registered owners before Christmas 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://fndcollectables.com/CHANNEL_F_INFO/U_S_/Adds___Offers/LETTERS/x82fr1f.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; They also released it as an Atari-compatible controller called &quot;Video Command&quot; it was also first released without the extra fire button, before that only the downwards plunge motion was connected and acted as the fire button, the pull-up and twist actions weren't used.

==Games==
There are 26 cartridges, termed 'Videocarts', that were officially released during the ownership of Fairchild and Zircon, the first 21 of which were released by Fairchild. Several of these cartridges are capable of playing more than one game and were typically priced at $19.95. The Videocarts are yellow and approximately the size and overall texture of an [[8 track cartridge]]. They usually feature colorful label artwork reminiscent of the artist [[Peter Max]]. The earlier artwork was created by nationally known artist Tom Kamifuji and art directed by Nick Talesfore.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The console contains two built-in games, Tennis and Hockey, which were both advanced [[Pong]] clones. The reflecting bar could be changed to diagonals by twisting the controller, and could move forward and backward.

A sales brochure from 1978 lists 'Keyboard Videocarts' for sale. The three shown were K-1 Casino Poker, K-2 Space Odyssey, and K-3 Pro-Football. These are to use the Keyboard accessory which is a 16 button keypad. All further brochures, released after Zircon took over Fairchild, never listed this accessory nor anything called a Keyboard Videocart.

There is one additional cartridge released numbered Videocart-51 and simply titled 'Demo 1'. This Videocart is shown in a single sales brochure released shortly after Zircon acquired the company. It was never listed for sale after this single brochure which was used for winter of 1979.

[[Ken Uston]] reviewed 32 games in his book ''[[Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games]]'' in 1982, and rated some of the Channel F's titles highly; of these, ''Alien Invasion'' and ''Video Whizball'' were considered by Uston to be &quot;the finest adult cartridges currently available for the Fairchild Channel F System.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Uston, Ken. ''Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games'' (Signet, 1982) p.605&lt;/ref&gt; The games on the whole, however, rated last on his survey of over 200 games for the Atari, Intellivision, Astrocade and Odyssey consoles, and contemporary games were rated &quot;Average&quot; with future Channel F games rated &quot;below average&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Uston, Ken. ''Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games'' (Signet, 1982) p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Uston rated almost one half of the Channel F games as &quot;high in interest&quot; and called that &quot;an impressive proportion&quot; and further noted that &quot;Some of the Channel F cartridges are timeless; no matter what technological developments occur, they will continue to be of interest.&quot; His overall conclusion was that the games &quot;serve a limited, but useful, purpose&quot; and that the &quot;strength of the Channel F offering is in its excellent educational line for children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Uston, Ken. ''Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games'' (Signet, 1982) p.603 and p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market impact==
The biggest effect of the Channel F in the market was to spur [[Atari]] into releasing and improving their next-generation console which was then in development. Then codenamed &quot;Stella,&quot; the machine was also going to use cartridges, and after seeing the Channel F they realized they needed to release it before the market was flooded with cartridge based-machines. With cash flow dwindling as sales of their existing Pong-based systems dried up, they were forced to sell to [[Warner Communications]] to gain the capital they needed. When the [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] gaming system (whose name was coined as a takeoff of the VES) was released a year later, it had considerably better graphics and sound.

==The Channel F System II==
[[Image:Fairchild channel-f system 2.jpg|250px|thumb|right| The Channel F System II]]

Some time in 1979, Zircon International bought the rights to the Channel F and released the re-designed console as the '''Channel F System II''' to compete with the Atari's VCS. This re-designed System II was done by Nick Talesfore at Fairchild. He was the same industrial designer who designed the original game console. Only six new games were released after the debut of the second system before its death, several of which were developed at Fairchild before they sold it off.

The major changes were in design, with the controllers removable from the base unit instead of being wired directly into it, the storage compartment was moved to the rear of the unit, and the sound was now mixed into the TV signal so the unit no longer needed a speaker. This version also featured a simpler and more modern-looking case design. However, by this time the market was in the midst of the first video game crash, and Fairchild eventually threw in the towel and left the market.

A number of licensed versions were released in Europe, including the '''Luxor Video Entertainment System''' in Sweden, '''Adman Grandstand''' in the UK, and the '''Saba Videoplay''', '''Nordmende Teleplay''' and '''ITT Tele-Match Processor''', from Germany and also '''Dumont Videoplay''' and '''Barco Challenger''' from the Barco/Dumont company in Italy and Belgium.

=== Homebrew ===
Like many other classic consoles, the Channel F lives on through [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]]. For example, a 2009 version of [[Pac-Man]] was developed and distributed for the Channel F.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consolecity.com/games/action-game_info/game_id-29406.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collation''' is the assembly of written information into a standard order. One common type of collation is called '''alphabetisation''', though collation is not limited to ordering letters of the [[alphabet]]. Collating lists of words or names into alphabetical order is the basis of most office [[File system|filing systems]], [[library catalog]]s and [[reference book]]s.

Collation differs from ''classification'' in that classification is concerned with arranging information into logical categories, while collation is concerned with the ordering of those categories.

Advantages of sorted lists include:
*one can easily find the first ''n'' elements (e.g. the 5 smallest countries) and the last ''n'' elements (e.g. the 3 largest countries)
*one can easily find the elements in a given range (e.g. countries with an area between .. and .. square km)
*one can easily search for an element, and conclude whether it is in the list, e.g. with the [[binary search algorithm]] or [[interpolation search]] either automatically, or, roughly and perhaps unconsciously, manually.

A collation algorithm, e.g. the &quot;[[Unicode collation algorithm]]&quot;, differs from a ''[[sorting algorithm]]'': the first is a process to ''define'' the order, which corresponds to the process of just comparing two values, while a sorting algorithm is a procedure to put a list of items in this order.

Collation defines a {{ml|Strict weak ordering|Total_preorders|total preorder}} on the set of possible items, typically by defining a [[total order]] on a {{ml|sorting|Sorting_information_or_data|sortkey}}. Note however that in the case of e.g. numerical sorting of strings representing numbers, the strings are only partially preordered, because e.g. 2e3 and 2000 have the same ranking, and 2 and 2.0 also. The numbers represented by the strings are totally ordered.

==History==
The idea that letters have an order is clear in the Bible, especially [[Psalm 119]].
The first effective use among scholars may have been in ancient Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Lloyd. ''Contributions to the History of Alphabetization in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' Brussels, 1967. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1st century BC [[Varro]] wrote some alphabetic lists of authors and titles.&lt;ref name=O'Hara&gt;{{cite article |title=Messapus, Cycnus, and the Alphabetical Order of Vergil's Catalogue of Italian Heroes |last=O'Hara |first=James |year=1989 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1088539}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2nd century AD [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] wrote an encyclopedic work with entries alphabetized by the  book of goats.&lt;ref name=remacle&gt;{{cite book |url=http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/Festus/m.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 3rd century [[Harpocration]] wrote a Homeric lexicon alphabetized by all letters.&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;{{cite book |title=Interpreting a classic: Demosthenes and his ancient commentators |last=Gibson |first=Craig |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 10th century the author of the [[Suda]] used alphabetic order with phonetic variations.
In the 14th century the author of the [[Fons memorabilium universi]] used a classification, but used alphabetical order within some of the books.&lt;ref name=Yeo&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedic visions: scientific dictionaries and enlightenment culture |last=Yeo |first=Richard |year=2001 |isbn=0521651913 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8bJYm1N8bqgC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=fons+memorabilium+universi+alphabetic+order&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=meiAsHne1U&amp;sig=xSmG-RHoy1aTiyvEN5GPCd_TJPE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M14aTZW1DciDngev593NDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1604 Robert Cawdrey had to explain in [[Table Alphabeticall| Table Alphabeticall: the first monolingual English dictionary]] &quot;Nowe if the word, which thou art desirous to finde, begin with (a) then looke in the beginning of this Table, but if with (v) looke towards the end.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cawdrey&gt;{{ cite book |url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/ret/cawdrey/cawdrey0.html#reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although as late as 1803 [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] condemned encyclopedias with &quot;an arrangement determined by the accident of initial letters&quot;,&lt;ref name=Coleridge&gt;{{cite book |title=Coleridge's Letters, No.507 |url=http://inamidst.com/coleridge/letters/letter507}}&lt;/ref&gt; many lists are today based on this principle.

==Systems==
===Numerical sorting, sorting of single characters===
One collation system is '''numerical sorting'''. For example, the list of numbers ''4 · 17 · 3 · -5'' collates to ''-5 · 3 · 4 · 17''.

While this might appear to work only for numbers, [[computer]]s can use this method for any textual information since computers internally use [[character set]]s which assign a numeric ''code point'' to each letter or [[glyph]].
For example, a computer using [[ASCII]] code (or any of its [[superset]]s such as [[Unicode]]) and numerical sorting would collate the list of characters ''a · b · C · d · $'' to ''$ · C · a · b · d''.

The numerical values that ASCII uses are ''$'' = 36, ''a'' = 97, ''b'' = 98, ''C'' = 67, and ''d'' = 100, resulting in what is called &quot;{{ml|ASCII|Order|ASCIIbetical order}}&quot;.

This style of collation is commonly used, often with the refinement of converting uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values, since most people do not expect capitalised words to jump the head of the list.

===Alphabetical order===
{{Main|Collating sequence}}
A collation system for multiple-character words is '''alphabetical order''', based on the conventional order of letters in an [[alphabet]] (most of which have a single conventional order).

Each ''n''th letter is compared with the ''n''th letter of other words in the list, starting at the first letter of each word and advancing to the second, third, fourth, and so on, until the order is established.

The order of the [[Latin alphabet]] is

&lt;center&gt;{{quotation|'''A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z'''&lt;/center&gt;}}

The principle behind extending alphabetical order to words ([[lexicographical order]]) is that all words in a list beginning with the same letter should be grouped together; within a grouping starting with a single letter, all words beginning with the same two letters shall be grouped together; and so on, maximizing the number of common initial letters between adjacent words. The ordering principle is applied at the point where the letters differ.  For instance, in the sequence:

:Astro'''l'''abe
:Astro'''n'''omy
:Astro'''p'''hysics

The order of the words is given according to the first letter of the words that is different from the others (shown in bold). Since '''n''' follows '''l''' in the alphabet, but precedes '''p''', ''Astronomy'' comes after ''Astrolabe'', but before ''Astrophysics''.

There has historically been some variation in the application of these rules.  For instance, the prefixes ''Mc'' and ''M''' in Irish and Scottish surnames were taken to be abbreviations for ''Mac'', and alphabetized as if they were spelled out as ''Mac'' in full.  Thus one might find in a catalog the sequence:

:McKinley
:Mackintosh

with ''McKinley'' preceding ''Mackintosh'', as if it had been spelled &quot;MacKinley&quot;. Since the advent of computer-sorted lists, this type of alphabetization is less frequently encountered, though it is still used in British phone books. A variation in alphabetical principles applies to names consisting of two words.  In some cases, names with identical first words are all alphabetized together under the first word, e.g., grouping together all names beginning with ''San'', all those beginning with ''Santa'', and those beginning with ''Santo'':

:San
:San Cristobal
:San Juan
:San Teodoro
:San Tomas
:Santa Barbara
:Santa Clara
:Santa Cruz
:Santo Domingo

But in another system, the names are alphabetized as if they had no spaces, e.g. as follows:

:San
:San Cristobal
:San Juan
:Santa Barbara
:Santa Clara
:Santa Cruz
:San Teodoro
:Santo Domingo
:San Tomas

The difference between computer-style numerical sorting and true alphabetical sorting becomes obvious in languages using an extended [[Latin alphabet]]. For example, the 29-letter alphabet of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] treats ''ñ'' as a basic letter following ''n'', and formerly treated ''ch'' and ''ll'' as basic letters following ''c'' and ''l'', respectively. ''Ch'' and ''ll'' are still considered letters, but are now alphabetized as two-letter combinations. (The new alphabetization rule was issued by the [[Royal Spanish Academy]] in 1994.) On the other hand, the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''rr'' follows ''rqu'' as expected, both with and without the 1994 alphabetization rule. A numeric sort may order ''ñ'' incorrectly following ''z'' and treat ''ch'' as ''c + h'', also incorrect when using pre-1994 alphabetization.

Similar differences between computer numeric sorting and alphabetic sorting occur in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''aa'' is ordered at the end of the alphabet when it is pronounced like ''[[å]]'', and at the start of the alphabet when it is pronounced like ''a''), [[German language|German]] (''ß'' is ordered as ''s + s''; ''ä, ö, ü'' are ordered as '
