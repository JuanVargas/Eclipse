[[File:Centroamerica politico.png|thumb|left|Nations of Central America and capitals.]]{{main|Central American Integration System}}
Central America is currently undergoing a process of political, economic and cultural transformation that started in 1907 with the creation of the [[Central American Court of Justice]]. 

In 1951 the integration process continued with the signature of the San Salvador Treaty, which created the ODECA, the Organization of Central American States. However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.

In 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the SICA, ''Sistema para la Integración Centroamericana'' or System for the Central American Integration. The SICA provided a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. The SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the [[Dominican Republic]], a state that is traditionally considered part of the [[Caribbean]].

On December 6, 2008 SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations. No timeline for implementation was discussed.

Central America already has several supranational institutions such as the [[Central American Parliament]], the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] and the [[Central American Common Market]].

Central America emerged as a distinct political entity upon the independence of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] from Spain in 1821. This federation contained most of the states now considered part of Central America, however it did not include what is now Belize and Panama.

Belize was contested between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], a dispute that continued after the independence of [[Guatemala]], who considered Belize to be a [[Departments of Guatemala|Guatemalan department]]. It was declared a British colony and given the name [[British Honduras]] in 1871, gaining independence as Belize in 1981.

Panama, situated in the very south of Central America on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], has for much of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was a part of the Spanish [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], and then, following independence, became part of [[Gran Colombia]]. Only after independence from [[Colombia]] in 1903 did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.

&lt;!-- Poverty is an issue in Central America; Nicaragua is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and Honduras is the second poorest in Central America second. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1850.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ho.html&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

{{Cleanup|date=June 2010}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''continuous function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] for which, intuitively, small changes in the input result in small changes in the output. Otherwise, a function is said to be &quot;discontinuous.&quot; A continuous function with a continuous [[inverse function]] is called &quot;[[bicontinuous]].&quot; 

Continuity of functions is one of the core concepts of [[topology]], which is treated in full generality below. The introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are [[real number]]s. In addition, this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two [[metric space]]s. In [[order theory]], especially in [[domain theory]], one considers a notion of continuity known as [[Scott continuity]]. Other forms of continuity do exist but they are not discussed in this article.

As an example, consider the function ''h''(''t''), which describes the [[height]] of a growing flower at time ''t''. This function is continuous.  In fact, a dictum of [[classical physics]] states that ''in nature everything is continuous''.  By contrast, if ''M''(''t'') denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time ''t'', then the function jumps whenever money is deposited or withdrawn, so the function ''M''(''t'') is discontinuous. (However, if one assumes a discrete set as the domain of function ''M'', for instance the set of points of time at 4:00 PM on business days, then ''M'' becomes continuous function, as every function whose domain is a discrete subset of reals is.)

== Real-valued continuous functions ==
===Historical infinitesimal definition===
[[Cauchy]] defined continuity of a function in the following intuitive terms: an [[infinitesimal]] change in the independent variable corresponds to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable (see ''Cours d'analyse'', page 34).

===Definition in terms of limits===
Suppose we have a function that maps [[real number]]s to real numbers and whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], like the functions ''h'' and ''M'' above.  Such a function can be represented by a [[graph of a function|graph]] in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]]; the function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken [[curve]] with no &quot;holes&quot; or &quot;jumps&quot;.

In general, we say that the function ''f'' is continuous at some [[point (geometry)|point]] ''c'' of its domain if, and only if, the following holds:
* The [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''f''(''x'') as ''x'' approaches ''c'' through domain of ''f''  does exist and is equal to ''f''(''c''); in mathematical notation, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c}{f(x)} = f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.  If the point ''c'' in the domain of ''f'' is not a [[limit point]] of the domain, then this condition is [[vacuous truth|vacuously true]], since ''x'' cannot approach ''c'' through values not equal ''c''.  Thus, for example, every function whose domain is the set of all integers is continuous.

We call a function '''continuous''' if and only if it is continuous at every point of its domain.  More generally, we say that a function is continuous on some [[subset]] of its domain if it is continuous at every point of that subset.

The notation ''C''(Ω) or ''C''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is sometimes used to denote the set of all continuous functions with domain Ω. Similarly, ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is used to denote the set of [[differentiable function]]s whose [[derivative]] is continuous, ''C''²(Ω) for the twice-differentiable functions whose [[second derivative]] is continuous, and so on (see [[differentiability class]]). In the field of computer graphics, these three levels are sometimes called ''g0'' (continuity of position), ''g1'' (continuity of tangency), and ''g2'' (continuity of curvature). The notation ''C''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'', α)&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) occurs in the definition of a more subtle concept, that of [[Hölder continuity]].

=== Weierstrass definition (epsilon-delta) of continuous functions===
Without resorting to limits, one can define continuity of real functions as follows.

Again consider a function ''ƒ'' that maps a set of [[real numbers]] to another set of real numbers, and suppose ''c'' is an element of the domain of ''ƒ''. The function ''ƒ'' is said to be continuous at the point ''c'' if the following holds: For any number ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, however small, there exists some number ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain of ''ƒ'' with ''c''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''δ'', the value of ''ƒ''(''x'') satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; f(c) - \varepsilon &lt; f(x) &lt; f(c) + \varepsilon.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively written: Given subsets ''I'', ''D'' of '''R''', continuity of ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''I''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'' at ''c''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I'' means that for every&amp;nbsp;''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there exists a ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I'',:

:&lt;math&gt;| x - c | &lt; \delta \Rightarrow | f(x) - f(c) | &lt; \varepsilon. \, &lt;/math&gt;

A form of this [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|epsilon-delta definition]] of continuity was first given by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in 1817.  Preliminary forms of a related definition of the limit  were given by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;grabiner&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and [[uniform continuity]] were first given by [[Karl Weierstrass]].

More intuitively, we can say that if we want to get all the ''ƒ''(''x'') values to stay in some small [[topological neighbourhood|neighborhood]] around ''ƒ''(''c''), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the ''x'' values around ''c'', and we can do that no matter how small the ''ƒ''(''x'') neighborhood is; ''ƒ'' is then continuous at&amp;nbsp;''c''.

In modern terms, this is generalized by the definition of continuity of a function with respect to a [[basis (topology)|basis for the topology]], here the [[metric topology]].

=== Definition using oscillation ===
[[File:Rapid Oscillation.svg|thumb|The failure of a function to be continuous at a point is quantified by its [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]].]]
Continuity can also be defined in terms of [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]]: a function ƒ is continuous at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the oscillation is zero;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, Theorem 3.5.2, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; in symbols, &lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; A benefit of this definition is that it ''quantifies'' discontinuity: the oscillation gives how ''much'' the function is discontinuous at a point.

This definition is useful in [[descriptive set theory]] to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than ''ε'' (hence a [[G-delta set|G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]]) – and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the [[Lebesgue integrability condition]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, 3.5 &quot;A More Advanced Look at the Existence of the Proper Riemann Integral&quot;, pp. 171–177&lt;/ref&gt;

The oscillation is equivalent to the ''ε''-''δ'' definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit ([[lim sup]], [[lim inf]]) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; there is no ''δ'' that satisfies the ''ε''-''δ'' definition, then the oscillation is at least ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and conversely if for every ''ε'' there is a desired ''δ,'' the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.

===Definition using the hyperreals===
[[Non-standard analysis]] is a way of making [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]-[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]-style [[infinitesimals]] mathematically rigorous. The real line is augmented by the addition of infinite and infinitesimal numbers to form the [[hyperreal numbers]].  In nonstandard analysis, continuity can be defined as follows.

:A function ''&amp;fnof;'' from the reals to the reals is continuous if its natural extension to the hyperreals has the property that for real ''x'' and infinitesimal ''dx'', {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''(''x''+''dx'') &amp;minus; ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}} is infinitesimal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, an infinitesimal increment of the independent variable corresponds to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable, giving a modern expression to [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]'s definition of continuity.

=== Examples ===
* All [[polynomial|polynomial function]]s are continuous.
* If a function has a domain that is not an interval, the notion of a continuous function as one whose graph you can draw without taking your pencil off the paper is not quite correct.  Consider the functions ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'' and ''g''(''x'') = (sin&amp;nbsp;''x'')/''x''.  Neither function is defined at ''x'' = 0, so each has domain '''R''' \ {0} of [[real numbers]] except 0, and each function is continuous.  The question of continuity at ''x'' = 0 does not arise, since ''x'' = 0 is neither in the domain of ''f'' nor in the domain of ''g''.  The function ''f'' cannot be extended to a continuous function whose domain is '''R''', since no matter what value is assigned at 0, the resulting function will not be continuous.  On the other hand, since the limit of ''g'' at 0 is 1, ''g'' can be extended continuously to '''R''' by defining its value at 0 as 1.
* The [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[square root]] function, [[trigonometric function]]s and [[absolute value]] function are continuous. [[Rational functions]], however, are not necessarily continuous on all of '''R'''.
* An example of a rational continuous function is ''f''(''x'')={{frac|1|x-2}}. The question of continuity at ''x''= 2 does not arise, since  ''x'' = 2 is not in the domain of ''f''. 
* An example of a discontinuous function is the function ''f'' defined by ''f''(''x'') = 1 if ''x'' &gt; 0, ''f''(''x'') = 0 if ''x'' ≤ 0. Pick for instance ε = {{frac|1|2}}. There is no δ-neighborhood around ''x'' = 0 that will force all the ''f''(''x'') values to be within ε of ''f''(0). Intuitively we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden jump in function values.
* Another example of a discontinuous function is the [[sign function|signum]] or sign function.
* The function
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
  \sin(\frac{1}{x^2})\mbox{ if }x \ne 0\\
  0\mbox{ if }x = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is continuous everywhere apart from x = 0
* A more complicated example of a discontinuous function is [[Thomae's function]].
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{q}\mbox{ if }x=\frac{p}{q}\mbox{ is a rational number}\\
  0\mbox{ if }x\mbox{ is irrational}. 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:The function is actually continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers
* [[Dirichlet's function]]
::&lt;math&gt;D(x)=\begin{cases}
  0\mbox{ if }x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}\\
  1\mbox{ if }x \in \mathbb{Q}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is nowhere continuous.
* [[Weierstrass_function|Weierstrass's function]] is continuous everywhere but [[Differentiable_function|differentiable]] nowhere
* The function
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
  x \times \sin(\frac{1}{x^2})\mbox{ if }x \ne 0\\
  0\mbox{ if }x = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is continuous everywhere, and differentiable everywhere apart from x = 0
* For completeness, the above function can be made differentiable everywhere by a small modification to
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
  x^2 \times \sin(\frac{1}{x^2})\mbox{ if }x \ne 0\\
  0\mbox{ if }x = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Properties ===
If two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous, then ''f'' + ''g'', ''fg'', and ''f''/''g'' are continuous. (Note. The only possible points ''x'' of discontinuity of ''f''/''g'' are the solutions of the equation ''g''(''x'') = 0; but then any such ''x'' does not belong to the domain of the function ''f''/''g''. Hence ''f''/''g'' is continuous on its entire domain, or - in other words - is continuous.)

The [[Function composition|composition]] ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g'' of two continuous functions is continuous.

If a function is [[differentiable]] at some point ''c'' of its domain, then it is also continuous at ''c''. The converse is not true: a function that is continuous at ''c'' need not be differentiable there. Consider for instance the [[absolute value]] function at ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

====Intermediate value theorem====
The [[intermediate value theorem]] is an [[existence theorem]], based on the real number property of [[Real number#Completeness|completeness]], and states:

: If the real-valued function ''f'' is continuous on the [[interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] and ''k'' is some number between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), then there is some number ''c'' in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] such that ''f''(''c'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''.

For example, if a child grows from 1&amp;nbsp;m to 1.5&amp;nbsp;m between the ages of two and six years, then, at some time between two and six years of age, the child's height must have been 1.25&amp;nbsp;m.

As a consequence, if ''f'' is continuous on [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] and ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') differ in [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]], then, at some point ''c'' in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], ''f''(''c'') must equal [[0 (number)|zero]].

====Extreme value theorem====
The [[extreme value theorem]] states that if a function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',''b''] (or any closed and bounded set) and is continuous there, then the function attains its maximum, i.e. there exists ''c''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[''a'',''b''] with ''f''(''c'') ≥ ''f''(''x'') for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[''a'',''b'']. The same is true of the minimum of ''f''. These statements are not, in general, true if the function is defined on an open interval (''a'',''b'') (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above.

===Directional continuity===
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;Image:Right-continuous.svg|A right continuous function
Image:Left-continuous.svg|A left continuous function&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A function may happen to be continuous in only one direction, either from the &quot;left&quot; or from the &quot;right&quot;. A '''right-continuous''' function is a function continuous at all points when approached from the right.  Technically, the formal definition is similar to the definition above for a continuous function but modified as follows:

The function ''ƒ'' is said to be right-continuous at the point ''c'' if the following holds: For any number ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; 0 however small, there exists some number ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; 0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain with {{nowrap|''c'' &amp;lt; ''x'' &amp;lt; ''c'' + ''&amp;delta;''}}, the value of ''ƒ''(''x'') will satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; |f(x) - f(c)| &lt; \varepsilon.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that ''x'' must be larger than ''c'', that is on the right of ''c''.  If ''x'' were also allowed to take values less than&amp;nbsp;''c'', this would be the definition of continuity.  This restriction makes it possible for the function to have a discontinuity at&amp;nbsp;''c'', but still be right continuous at&amp;nbsp;''c'', as pictured.

Likewise a '''left-continuous''' function is a function continuous at all points when approached from the left, that is, {{nowrap|''c'' &amp;minus; ''&amp;delta;'' &amp;lt; ''x'' &amp;lt; ''c''}}.

A function is continuous if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous.

== Continuous functions between metric spaces ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[F-space]] --&gt;
Now consider a function ''f'' from one [[metric space]] (''X'', d&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) to another metric space (''Y'', d&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;). Then ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' in ''X'' if for any positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ such that all ''x'' in ''X'' satisfying d&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''c'') &lt; δ will also satisfy d&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''c'')) &lt; ε.

This can also be formulated in terms of [[sequence]]s and [[limit of a sequence|limits]]: the function ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' if for every sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' with limit lim ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'', we have lim ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''c''). ''Continuous functions transform limits into limits.''

This latter condition can be weakened as follows: ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' if and only if for every convergent sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' with limit ''c'', the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is a [[Cauchy sequence]], and ''c'' is in the domain of ''f''. ''Continuous functions transform convergent sequences into Cauchy sequences.''

The set of points at which a function between metric spaces is continuous is a [[Gδ set|G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]] – this follows from the ε-δ definition of continuity.

== Continuous functions between topological spaces&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Preference (economics)]]--&gt; ==
[[Image:continuity topology.svg|300px|right|frame|Continuity of a function at a point]]
The above definitions of continuous functions can be generalized to functions from one [[topological space]] to another in a natural way; a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', where ''X'' and ''Y'' are topological spaces, is continuous [[if and only if]] for every [[open set]] ''V'' ⊆ ''Y'', the inverse image
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V) = \{x \in X \; | \; f(x) \in V \}&lt;/math&gt;
is open.

However, this definition is often difficult to use directly. Instead, suppose we have a function ''f'' from ''X'' to ''Y'', where ''X'', ''Y'' are topological spaces. We say ''f'' is '''continuous at ''x''''' for some ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' if for any [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''V'' of ''f''(''x''), there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that ''f''(''U'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''V''.
Although this definition appears complex, the intuition is that no matter how &quot;small&quot; ''V'' becomes, we can always find a ''U'' containing ''x'' that will map inside it. If ''f'' is continuous at every ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'', then we simply say ''f'' is continuous.

In a [[metric space]], it is equivalent to consider the [[neighbourhood system]] of [[open ball]]s centered at ''x'' and ''f''(''x'') instead of all neighborhoods. This leads to the standard ε-δ definition of a continuous function from real analysis, which says roughly that a function is continuous if all points close to ''x'' map to points close to ''f''(''x''). This only really makes sense in a metric space, however, which has a notion of distance.

Note, however, that if the target space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], it is still true that ''f'' is continuous at ''a'' if and only if the limit of ''f'' as ''x'' approaches ''a'' is ''f(a)''.  At an isolated point, every function is continuous.

=== Definitions ===
Several [[Characterizations of the category of topological spaces|equivalent definitions for a topological structure]] exist and thus there are several equivalent ways to define a continuous function.

==== Open and closed set definition ====
The most common notion of continuity in topology defines continuous functions as those functions for which the [[preimage]]s (or [[inverse image]]s) of [[open set]]s are open. Similar to the open set formulation is the '''closed set formulation''', which says that preimages (or inverse images) of [[closed set]]s are closed.

==== Neighborhood definition ====
Definitions based on preimages are often difficult to use directly. Instead, suppose we have a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}, where ''X'' and ''Y'' are topological spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;topological_function_in_depth&quot;&gt;''f'' is a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} between two [[topological space]]s  (''X'',''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (''Y'',''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''). That is, the function ''f'' is defined on the elements of the set ''X'', not on the elements of the topology ''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''.  However continuity of the function does depend on the topologies used.&lt;/ref&gt;  We say ''f'' is '''continuous at ''x''''' for some ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' if for any [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''V'' of ''f''(''x''), there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that ''f''(''U'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''V''.
Although this definition appears complicated, the intuition is that no matter how &quot;small&quot; ''V'' becomes, we can always find a ''U'' containing ''x'' that will map inside it. If ''f'' is continuous at every ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'', then we simply say ''f'' is continuous.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:continuity topology.svg|300px|Continuity of a function at a point]]&lt;/center&gt;

In a [[metric space]], it is equivalent to consider the [[neighbourhood system]] of [[open ball]]s centered at ''x'' and ''f''(''x'') instead of all neighborhoods. This leads to the standard δ-ε definition of a continuous function from real analysis, which says roughly that a function is continuous if all points close to ''x'' map to points close to ''f''(''x''). This only really makes sense in a metric space, however, which has a notion of distance.

Note, however, that if the target space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], it is still true that ''f'' is continuous at ''a'' if and only if the limit of ''f'' as ''x'' approaches ''a'' is ''f(a)''.  At an isolated point, every function is continuous.

==== Sequences and nets ====
{{anchor|Heine definition of continuity}}
In several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently  specified in terms of [[limit points]].  In many instances, this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the [[limit of a sequence]], but for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a [[directed set]], known as [[net (mathematics)|nets]].  A function is continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences.  In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.

In detail, a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is '''sequentially continuous''' if whenever a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' converges to a limit ''x'', the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) converges to ''f''(''x'').  Thus sequentially continuous functions &quot;preserve sequential limits&quot;.  Every continuous function is sequentially continuous.  If ''X'' is a [[first-countable space]] and [[Axiom of countable choice|countable choice]] holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous.  In particular, if ''X'' is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent.  For non first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called [[sequential space]]s.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces.  Continuous functions preserve limits of nets, and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions.

==== Closure operator definition ====
Given two topological spaces (''X'',cl) and (''X''&amp;nbsp;' ,cl&amp;nbsp;') where cl and cl&amp;nbsp;' are two [[closure operator]]s then a function
:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,\mathrm{cl}) \to (X' ,\mathrm{cl}')&lt;/math&gt;
is '''continuous''' if for all subsets ''A'' of ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathrm{cl}(A)) \subseteq \mathrm{cl}'(f(A)).&lt;/math&gt;

One might therefore suspect that given two topological spaces (''X'',int) and (''X''&amp;nbsp;' ,int&amp;nbsp;') where int and int&amp;nbsp;' are two [[interior operator]]s then a function
:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,\mathrm{int}) \to (X' ,\mathrm{int}')&lt;/math&gt;
is '''continuous''' if for all subsets ''A'' of ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathrm{int}(A)) \subseteq \mathrm{int}'(f(A))&lt;/math&gt;
or perhaps if
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathrm{int}(A)) \supseteq \mathrm{int}'(f(A));&lt;/math&gt;
however, neither of these conditions is either necessary or sufficient for continuity.

Instead, we must resort to inverse images: given two topological spaces (''X'',int) and (''X''&amp;nbsp;' ,int&amp;nbsp;') where int and int&amp;nbsp;' are two interior operators then a function
:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,\mathrm{int}) \to (X' ,\mathrm{int}')&lt;/math&gt;
is '''continuous''' if for all subsets ''A'' of ''X'' '
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\mathrm{int}'(A)) \subseteq \mathrm{int}(f^{-1}(A)).&lt;/math&gt;
We can also write that given two topological spaces (''X'',cl) and (''X''&amp;nbsp;' ,cl&amp;nbsp;') where cl and cl&amp;nbsp;' are two closure operators then a function
:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,\mathrm{cl}) \to (X' ,\mathrm{cl}')&lt;/math&gt;
is '''continuous''' if for all subsets ''A'' of ''X'' '
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\mathrm{cl}'(A)) \supseteq \mathrm{cl}(f^{-1}(A)).&lt;/math&gt;

==== Closeness relation definition ====
Given two topological spaces (''X'',δ) and (''X''' ,δ') where δ and δ' are two [[closeness relation]]s then a function
:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,\delta) \to (X' ,\delta')&lt;/math&gt;
is '''continuous''' if for all points ''x'' and of ''X'' and all subsets ''A'' of ''X'',
:&lt;math&gt;x \delta A \Rightarrow f(x)\delta'f(A).&lt;/math&gt;
This is another way of writing the closure operator definition.

=== Useful properties of continuous maps ===
Some facts about continuous maps between topological spaces:
* If ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' and ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Z'' are continuous, then so is the composition ''g'' ∘ ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Z''.
* If ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is continuous and
** ''X'' is [[Compact space|compact]], then ''f''(''X'') is compact.
** ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]], then ''f''(''X'') is connected.
** ''X'' is [[path-connected]], then ''f''(''X'') is path-connected.
** ''X'' is [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]], then ''f''(''X'') is Lindelöf.
** ''X'' is [[separable space|separable]], then ''f''(''X'') is separable.
*The [[identity function|identity map]] id&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; : (''X'', τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''X'', τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is continuous if and only if τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see also [[comparison of topologies]]).

=== Other notes ===
If a set is given the [[discrete topology]], all functions with that space as a domain are continuous. If the domain set is given the [[indiscrete topology]] and the range set is at least [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]], then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose range is indiscrete is continuous.

Given a set ''X'', a [[partial ordering]] can be defined on the possible [[topology|topologies]] on ''X''. A continuous function between two topological spaces stays continuous if we [[stronger topology|strengthen]] the topology of the [[Domain of a function|domain space]] or [[weaker topology|weaken]] the topology of the [[codomain space]]. Thus we can consider the continuity of a given function a [[topological property]], depending only on the topologies of its domain and codomain spaces.

For a function ''f'' from a topological space ''X'' to a set ''S'', one defines the [[final topology]] on ''S'' by letting the open sets of ''S'' be those subsets ''A'' of ''S'' for which ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'') is open in ''X''. If ''S'' has an existing topology, ''f'' is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is [[Comparison of topologies|coarser]] than the final topology on ''S''.  Thus the final topology can be characterized as the finest topology on ''S'' that makes ''f'' continuous.  If ''f'' is [[surjective]], this topology is canonically identified with the [[quotient topology]] under the [[equivalence relation]] defined by ''f''.  This construction can be generalized to an arbitrary family of functions ''X'' → ''S''.

Dually, for a function ''f'' from a set ''S'' to a topological space, one defines the [[initial topology]] on ''S'' by letting the open sets of ''S'' be those subsets ''A'' of ''S'' for which ''f''(''A'') is open in ''X''.  If ''S'' has an existing topology, ''f'' is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on ''S''.  Thus the initial topology can be characterized as the coarsest topology on ''S'' that makes ''f'' continuous.  If ''f'' is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the [[subspace topology]] of ''S'', viewed as a subset of ''X''.  This construction can be generalized to an arbitrary family of functions ''S'' → ''X''.

Symmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an [[open map]], for which ''images'' of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map ''f'' has an inverse, that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map ''g'' has an inverse, that inverse is open.

If a function is a [[bijection]], then it has an [[inverse function]]. The inverse of a continuous bijection is open, but need not be continuous. If it is, this special function is called a [[homeomorphism]].
If a continuous bijection has as its domain a [[compact space]] and its codomain is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then it is automatically a homeomorphism.

== Continuous functions between partially ordered sets ==
In [[order theory]], continuity of a function between [[Partially ordered sets|posets]] is [[Scott continuity]]. Let ''X'' be a [[complete lattice]], then a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' is continuous if, for each subset ''Y'' of ''X'', we have [[supremum|sup]]&amp;nbsp;''f''(''Y'') = ''f''(sup&amp;nbsp;''Y'').

== Continuous binary relation ==
A binary [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] ''R'' on ''A'' is continuous if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') whenever there are sequences (''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and (''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'', which converge to ''a'' and ''b'' respectively, for which ''R''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) for all ''k''.  Clearly, if one treats ''R'' as a [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] in two variables, this definition of continuous is identical to that for continuous functions.

== Continuity space ==

A '''continuity space'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.48.851&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Quantales and continuity spaces], RC Flagg - Algebra Universalis, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All topologies come from generalized metrics, R Kopperman - American Mathematical Monthly, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; is a generalization of metric spaces and posets, which uses the concept of [[quantale]]s, and that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and [[Domain theory|domain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Continuity spaces: Reconciling domains and metric spaces, B Flagg, R Kopperman - Theoretical Computer Science, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[vector calculus]], the '''curl''' (or '''rotor''') is a [[vector operator]] that describes the infinitesimal [[rotation]] of a 3-dimensional [[vector field]]. At every point in the field, the curl is represented by a [[vector (geometry)|vector]].  The attributes of this vector (length and direction) characterize the rotation at that point.

The direction of the curl is the axis of rotation, as determined by the [[right-hand rule]], and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation.  If the vector field represents the [[flow velocity]] of a moving [[fluid]], then the curl is the '''[[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] density''' of the fluid.  A vector field whose curl is zero is called [[irrotational]].
The curl is a form of [[derivative|differentiation]] for vector fields.  The corresponding form of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] is [[Stokes' theorem]], which relates the [[surface integral]] of the curl of a vector field to the [[line integral]] of the vector field around the boundary curve.

The alternative terminology ''rotor'' or ''rotational'' and alternative notations rot '''F''' and ∇&amp;times;'''F''' are often used (the former especially in many European countries, the latter using the [[del]] operator and the [[cross product]]) for ''curl'' and curl '''F'''.

Unlike the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]], curl does not generalize as simply to other dimensions; some [[#Generalizations|generalizations]] are possible, but only in three dimensions is the geometrically defined curl of a vector field again a vector field. This is a similar phenomenon as in the 3 dimensional [[cross product]], and the connection is reflected in the notation ∇&amp;times; for the curl.

The name &quot;curl&quot; was first suggested by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/MathematicalClassificationofPhysicalQuantities_Maxwell.pdf Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, March 9th, 1871]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{For|the equation in Cartesian coordinates|Curl (mathematics)#Usage}}

&lt;!---DEL CROSS F IS NOT A DEFINITION, IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE NOTATION.  IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING SO YOU CAN'T BASE A DEFINITION ON IT-----&gt;The curl of a vector field '''F''', denoted curl '''F''' or ∇&amp;times;'''F''', at a point is defined in terms of its projection onto various lines through the point.  If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is any unit vector, the projection of the curl of '''F''' onto &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the limiting value of a closed [[line integral]] in a plane orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt; as the path used in the integral becomes infinitesimally close to the point, divided by the area enclosed. 

As such, the curl operator maps [[smooth function|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to C&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Image:Curlorient.svg|200px|right|thumb|Convention for vector orientation of the line integral]]

Implicitly, curl is defined by:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mathworld&quot;&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Curl |urlname=Curl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \lim_{A \to 0} \frac{\oint_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}}{|A|}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\oint_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is a line integral along the boundary of the area in question, and ''|A|'' is the magnitude of the area. If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{\nu}}&lt;/math&gt; is an outward pointing in-plane normal, whereas &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;  is the unit-vector perpendicular to the plane (see caption at right), then the orientation of C is chosen so that a vector &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{\omega}}&lt;/math&gt; tangent to C is [[orientation (mathematics)|positively oriented]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{\mathbf{\hat{n}},\mathbf{\hat{\nu}},\mathbf{\hat{\omega}}\}&lt;/math&gt; forms a positively oriented basis for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[right-hand rule]]).

The above formula means that the curl of a vector field is defined as the infinitesimal [[area-density]] of the ''circulation'' of that field. To this definition fit naturally (i) the [[Kelvin-Stokes theorem]], as a global formula corresponding to the definition, and (ii) the following &quot;easy to memorize&quot; definition of the curl in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, e.g. in cartesian coordinates, spherical, or cylindrical,  or even elliptical or parabolical coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;(\rm{curl\,}\,\mathbf F)\,_3=\frac{1}{a_1a_2}\cdot\left (\frac{\partial (a_2F_2)}{\partial u_1}-\frac{\partial (a_1F_1)}{\partial u_2}\right )\,&lt;/math&gt;

If (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] and (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the curvilinear coordinates, then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a_i = \sqrt{\sum \limits_{j = 1}^{3}\left (\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial u_i}\right )^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the coordinate vector corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u_i&lt;/math&gt;. The remaining two components of curl result from cyclic index-permutation: 3,1,2 → 1,2,3 → 2,3,1.

===Intuitive interpretation===

Suppose the vector field describes the velocity field of a fluid flow (maybe a large tank of water or gas) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the centre of the ball being fixed at a certain point).  If the ball has a rough surface it will be made to rotate by the fluid flowing past it.  The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the centre of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the value of the curl at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Josiah Willard |last1=Gibbs|authorlink1=Josiah Willard Gibbs|first2=Edwin Bidwell|last2=Wilson|authorlink2=Edwin Bidwell Wilson|title=Vector analysis|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R5IKAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|year=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
In practice, the above definition is rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] can be applied using some set of [[curvilinear coordinates]], for which simpler representations have been derived.

The notation ∇&amp;times;'''F''' has its origins in the similarities to the 3 dimensional [[cross product]], and it is useful as a [[mnemonic]] in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] if we take ∇ as a vector [[differential operator]] [[del]].  Such notation involving [[operator (physics)|operators]] is common in [[physics]] and [[algebra]]. If certain coordinate systems are used, for instance, polar-toroidal coordinates (common in plasma physics) using the notation ∇&amp;times;'''F''' will yield an incorrect result.

Expanded in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (see: [[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]] for [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] and [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinate]] representations), ∇&amp;times;'''F''' is, for '''F''' composed of [''F''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\  \\
{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}} &amp; {\frac{\partial}{\partial y}} &amp; {\frac{\partial}{\partial z}} \\
 \\  F_x &amp; F_y &amp; F_z \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' are the [[unit vector]]s for the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axes, respectively. This expands as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Arfken, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y}  - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf{i} + \left(\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x}\right) \mathbf{j} + \left(\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y}\right) \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Although expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection. 

In a general coordinate system, the curl is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;Mathworld&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} )^k = \epsilon^{k\ell m} \partial_\ell F_m&lt;/math&gt;

where ε denotes the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to [[raising and lowering indices|lower the index]] on '''F''', and the [[Einstein summation convention]] implies that repeated indices are summed over.  Equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} ) = \boldsymbol{e}_k\epsilon^{k\ell m} \partial_\ell F_m&lt;/math&gt;

where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinate vector fields.  Equivalently, using the [[exterior derivative]], the curl can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left[ \star \left( {\mathbf d} F^\flat \right) \right]^\sharp &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\flat &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sharp &lt;/math&gt; are the [[musical isomorphism]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\star &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hodge dual]]. This formula shows how to calculate the curl of F in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] three dimensional [[Riemannian metric|Riemannian]] manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.

==Examples==
===A simple vector field===
Take the [[vector field]], which depends on ''x'' and ''y'' linearly:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=y\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}-x\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its plot looks like this:

[[Image:Uniform curl.svg|center|250px]]

Simply by visual inspection, we can see that the field is rotating.  If we stick a [[paddle wheel]] anywhere, we see immediately its tendency to rotate clockwise. Using the [[right-hand rule]], we expect the curl to be into the page.  If we are to keep a [[Right-handed coordinate system#In three dimensions|right-handed]] coordinate system, into the page will be in the negative z direction. The lack of x and y directions is analogous to the cross product operation.

If we calculate the curl:

:&lt;math&gt;{\nabla} \times \mathbf{F}  =0\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}+0\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}+ \left[{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}}(-x) -{\frac{\partial}{\partial y}} y\right]\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}=-2\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which is indeed in the negative ''z'' direction, as expected.  In this case, the curl is actually a constant, irrespective of position.  The &quot;amount&quot; of rotation in the above vector field is the same at any point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'').  Plotting the curl of ''F'' is not very interesting:

[[Image:Curl of uniform curl.png|center|250px]]

===A more involved example===
Suppose we now consider a slightly more complicated vector field:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)=-x^2\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its plot:

[[Image:Nonuniform curl.svg|250px|center]]

We might not see any rotation initially, but if we closely look at the right, we see a larger field at, say, x=4 than at x=3.  Intuitively, if we placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger &quot;current&quot; on its right side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate clockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the negative z direction.  By contrast, if we look at a point on the left and placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger &quot;current&quot; on its left side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate counterclockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the positive z direction.  Let's check out our guess by doing the math:

:&lt;math&gt;{\nabla} \times \mathbf{F} =0\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}+0\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}+ {\frac{\partial}{\partial x}}(-x^2) \boldsymbol{\hat{z}}=-2x\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed the curl is in the positive z direction for negative x and in the negative z direction for positive x, as expected.  Since this curl is not the same at every point, its plot is a bit more interesting:

[[Image:Curl of nonuniform curl.png|center|250px|center]]

We note that the plot of this curl has no dependence on y or z (as it shouldn't) and is in the negative z direction for positive x and in the positive z direction for negative x.

===Identities ===
{{Main|Vector calculus identities}}
Consider the example '''∇ &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt;''' [ '''v''' &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; '''F'''  ]. Using Cartesian coordinates, it can be shown that
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left( \mathbf{v \times F} \right) = \left[ \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \cdot F } \right) + \mathbf{F \cdot \nabla} \right] \mathbf{v}- \left[ \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \cdot v } \right) + \mathbf{v \cdot \nabla} \right] \mathbf{F} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

In the case where the vector field '''v''' and '''∇''' are interchanged:

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v \  \times } \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \times F} \right) =\nabla_F \left( \mathbf{v \cdot F } \right) - \left( \mathbf{v \cdot \nabla } \right) \mathbf{ F} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which introduces the Feynman subscript notation '''∇'''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, which means the subscripted gradient operates  only on the factor '''F'''.

Another example is '''∇ &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt;''' [ '''∇''' &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; '''F'''  ]. Using Cartesian coordinates, it can be shown that:

::&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \left( \mathbf{\nabla \times F} \right) = \mathbf{\nabla} (\mathbf{\nabla \cdot F}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{F}  \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which can be construed as a special case of the previous example with the substitution '''v''' → '''∇'''.

The curl of the [[gradient]] of ''any'' [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\ \phi &lt;/math&gt; is always the [[zero vector]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times ( \nabla \phi )  = \vec{0}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar valued function and '''F''' is a vector field, then

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times ( \varphi \mathbf{F}) = \nabla \varphi \times \mathbf{F} + \varphi \nabla \times \mathbf{ F}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Descriptive examples===
* In a vector field describing the linear velocities of each part of a rotating disk, the curl has the same value at all points.
* Of the four [[Maxwell's equations]] two, [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] and [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]] can be compactly expressed using curl. Faraday's law states that the curl of an electric field is equal to the opposite of the time rate of change of the magnetic field, while Ampère's law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and rate of change of the electric field.

== Generalizations ==
The vector calculus operations of [[gradient|grad]], curl, and [[divergence|div]] are most easily generalized and understood in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In a nutshell, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying [[bivector]]s (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;so_3&lt;/math&gt; of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3&amp;times;3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and &lt;math&gt;so_3,&lt;/math&gt; these all being 3-dimensional spaces.

=== Differential forms ===
{{main|Differential form}}
In 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is simply a function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;; a differential 1-form is a linear combination of three functions &lt;math&gt;f_x\,dx + f_y\,dy + f_z\,dz;&lt;/math&gt; a differential 2-form is a linear combination of three functions &lt;math&gt;f_{xy}\,dx\wedge dy + f_{xz}\,dx\wedge dz + f_{yz}\,dy\wedge dz;&lt;/math&gt; and a differential 3-form is defined by a single function: &lt;math&gt;f_{xyz}\,dx\wedge dy\wedge dz.&lt;/math&gt; The [[exterior derivative]] of a ''k''-form is a &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;-form, and denoting the space of ''k''-forms by &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(\mathbf{R}^3)&lt;/math&gt; and the exterior derivative by ''d'' yields a sequence:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \overset{d}{\to} \Omega^0(\mathbf{R}^3) \overset{d}{\to} \Omega^1(\mathbf{R}^3) \overset{d}{\to} \Omega^2(\mathbf{R}^3)\overset{d}{\to} \Omega^3(\mathbf{R}^3)\overset{d}{\to} 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of sections of the [[exterior algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; [[vector bundle]] over R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, whose dimension is the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\binom{n}{k}};&lt;/math&gt; note that &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(\mathbf{R}^3) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k&lt;0.&lt;/math&gt; Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of [[Pascal's triangle]]:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to 1 \to 3 \to 3 \to 1 \to 0;&lt;/math&gt;
the 1-dimensional fibers correspond to functions, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below.  Note that modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.

Differential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], ''k''-forms can be identified with [[p-vector|''k''-vector]] fields (''k''-forms are ''k''-covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an ''oriented'' vector space with a [[nondegenerate form]] (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between ''k''-vectors and &lt;math&gt;(n-k)&lt;/math&gt;-vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange ''k''-forms, ''k''-vector fields, &lt;math&gt;(n-k)&lt;/math&gt;-forms, and &lt;math&gt;(n-k)&lt;/math&gt;-vector fields; this is known as [[Hodge duality]]. Concretely, on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; this is given by:
* 1-forms and 1-vector fields: the 1-form &lt;math&gt;f_x\,dx + f_y\,dy + f_z\,dz&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the vector field &lt;math&gt;(f_x, f_y, f_z).&lt;/math&gt;
* 1-forms and 2-forms: one replaces &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;dy \wedge dz&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., omit ''dx''), and likewise, taking care of orientation: &lt;math&gt;dy&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to &lt;math&gt;dz \wedge dx = -dx \wedge dz,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to &lt;math&gt;dx \wedge dy.&lt;/math&gt; Thus &lt;math&gt;f_x\,dx + f_y\,dy + f_z\,dz&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to &lt;math&gt;f_z\,dx\wedge dy + f_y\,dz\wedge dx + f_x\,dy\wedge dz.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with functions, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:
* grad takes a function (0-form) to a vector field (1-form);
* curl takes a vector field (1-form) to a vector field (2-form);
* div takes a vector field (2-form) to a function (3-form).
Grad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and ''n''-forms is always (fiberwise) 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar functions, while the spaces of 1-forms and &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-forms are always fiberwise ''n''-dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.

Curl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to 1 \to 4 \to 6 \to 4 \to 1 \to 0;&lt;/math&gt;
so the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a 2-vector field, which is fiberwise 6-dimensional and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (&lt;math&gt;4 \to 6 \to 4&lt;/math&gt;), as taking the differential twice yields zero (&lt;math&gt;d^2=0&lt;/math&gt;). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.

However, one can define a curl of a vector field as a 2-vector field in general, as described below.

=== Curl geometrically ===
2-vectors correspond to the exterior power &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2V;&lt;/math&gt; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;so(V)&lt;/math&gt; of infinitesimal rotations. This has &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\binom{n}{2}=\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{n=\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)},&lt;/math&gt; which is the most elegant and common case. is In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar - an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); note that this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;so_4.&lt;/math&gt;

Note also that the curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say ''x, y'') is simply a vertical vector field (in the ''z'' direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.

Considering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609260 Generalizing Cross Products and Maxwell's Equations to Universal Extra Dimensions], A.W.

== Early years (1777–1798) ==
[[Image:Statue-of-Gauss-in-Braunschweig.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Gauss at his birthplace, [[Braunschweig]]]]
Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on April 30, 1777 in [[Braunschweig]], in the duchy of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, now part of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]], as the son of poor working-class parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/gauss.html|title=Carl Friedrich Gauss|last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Wichita State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, his mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the [[Ascension of Jesus|Feast of the Ascension]], which itself occurs 40 days after [[Easter]]. Gauss would later solve this puzzle for his birthdate in the context of [[Computus|finding the date of Easter]], deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://american_almanac.tripod.com/gauss.htm|title=Gauss Birthday Problem|last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was christened and [[Confirmation|confirmed]] in a church near the school he attended as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Chambless |url=http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~schmblss/home/Letters/Gauss/1911-07-26b.htm |title=Author&amp;nbsp;— Date |publisher=Homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss was a [[child prodigy]]. There are many anecdotes pertaining to his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'', his [[magnum opus]], in 1798 at the age of 21, though it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.

Gauss's intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Braunschweig]],&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt; who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum (now [[TU Braunschweig|Technische Universität Braunschweig]]), which he attended from 1792 to 1795, and to the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] from 1795 to 1798.
While in university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems;{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} his breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he was able to show that any regular [[polygon]] with a number of sides which is a [[Fermat number|Fermat prime]] (and, consequently, those polygons with any number of sides which is the product of distinct Fermat primes and a [[exponentiation|power]] of 2) can be constructed by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]. This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of [[philology]] as a career.
Gauss was so pleased by this result that he requested that a regular [[heptadecagon]] be inscribed on his [[Headstone|tombstone]]. The [[stone masonry|stonemason]] declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, Theoni: Mathematical Snippets, Page 42. Pgw 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1796 was most productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the [[heptadecagon]] on March 30.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Friedrich Gauss §§365–366 in [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]. Leipzig, Germany, 1801. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]], 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; He invented [[modular arithmetic]], greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} He became the first to prove the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law on 8&amp;nbsp;April. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The [[prime number theorem]], conjectured on 31&amp;nbsp;May, gives a good understanding of how the [[prime number]]s are distributed among the integers.
Gauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three [[triangular number]]s on 10 July and then jotted down in his diary the famous words, &quot;[[Eureka (word)|Heureka]]!  num&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;.&quot; On October&amp;nbsp;1 he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in [[finite field]]s, which ultimately led to the [[Weil conjectures]] 150 years later.

== Middle years (1799–1830) ==

In his 1799 doctorate in absentia, ''A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree'', Gauss proved the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] over the [[complex number]]s has at least one [[root of a function|root]]. Mathematicians including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to implicit use of the [[Jordan curve theorem]]. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally  rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.

Gauss also made important contributions to [[number theory]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' ([[Latin]], Arithmetical Investigations), which, among things, introduced the symbol ≡ for congruence and used it in a clean presentation of [[modular arithmetic]], had the first two proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], developed the theories of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s, stated the [[class number problem]] for them, and showed that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (17-sided polygon) can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with straightedge and compass]].
[[Image:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|Title page of Gauss's ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'']]

In that same year, [[Italy|Italian]] astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. Piazzi had only been able to track Ceres for a couple of months, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit. 

Gauss, who was 23 at the time, heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] on 31 December in [[Gotha Observatory|Gotha]], and one day later by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] in [[Bremen]]. 

Gauss's method involved determining a [[conic section]] in space, given one focus (the sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by Kepler's Second Law). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Development of mathematics in the 19th century|last1=Klein|first1=Felix|last2=Hermann|first2=Robert |isbn=9780915692286|year=1979|publisher=Math Sci Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zach noted that &quot;without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again.&quot; Though Gauss had been up to that point supported by the stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical [[Göttingen Observatory|observatory in Göttingen]], a post he held for the remainder of his life.

The discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as ''Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum'' (theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It introduced the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]], and contained an influential treatment of the [[Least squares|method of least squares]], a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of [[Observational error|measurement error]]. Gauss was able to prove the method under the assumption of [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] errors (see [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]; see also [[List of topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gaussian]]). The method had been described earlier by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1795.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
[[Image:Bendixen - Carl Friedrich Gauß, 1828.jpg|thumb|Gauss' portrait published in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' 1828]]

In 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a [[surveying|geodesic survey]] of the state of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], linking up with previous [[Denmark|Danish]] surveys. To aid in the survey, Gauss invented the [[heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.

Gauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory. Research on these geometries led to, among other things, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend [[Farkas Bolyai|Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai]] with whom Gauss had sworn &quot;brotherhood and the banner of truth&quot; as a student had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry. Bolyai's son, [[János Bolyai]], discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: ''&quot;To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.&quot;'' [[Image:Normal distribution pdf.png|thumb|left|Four [[normal distribution|Gaussian distributions]] in [[statistics]]]]This unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with János Bolyai (who thought that Gauss was &quot;stealing&quot; his idea), but it is now generally taken at face value.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Letters by Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. [[G. Waldo Dunnington|Waldo Dunnington]], a biographer of Gauss, argues in ''Gauss, Titan of Science'' that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non-Euclidian geometry long before it was published by [[János Bolyai]], but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.

The survey of Hanover fueled Gauss's interest in [[Differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], a field of mathematics dealing with [[curve]]s and [[surface]]s. Among other things he came up with the notion of [[Gaussian curvature]]. This led in 1828 to an important theorem, the [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem'' in [[Latin]]), establishing an important property of the notion of [[curvature]]. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring [[angle]]s and [[distance]]s on the surface. That is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be [[embedding|embedded]] in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.

In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

== Later years and death (1831&amp;ndash;1855) ==
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss on his Deathbed, 1855.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daguerreotype]] of Gauss on his deathbed, 1855.]]
[[Image:Göttingen-Grave.of.Gauß.06.jpg|thumb|Grave of Gauss at [[Albanifriedhof]] in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]].]]
In 1831 Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]], leading to new knowledge in [[magnetism]] (including finding a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, length and time) and the discovery of [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] in electricity. It was during this time that he formulated his namesake [[Gauss's law|law]]. They constructed the first [[Electrical telegraph|electromechanical telegraph]] in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in Göttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic [[observatory]] to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the magnetischer Verein (''magnetic club'' in [[German language|German]]), which supported measurements of earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which has been in use well into the second half of the 20th century and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner ([[planetary core|core]] and [[Crust (geology)|crust]]) and outer ([[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]]) sources of Earth's magnetic field.

In 1840, Gauss published his influential ''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'',&lt;ref name=Bühler1&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0387106626|ref=harv|pages=144-145}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a [[paraxial approximation]] ([[Gaussian optics]]).&lt;ref name=Hecht&gt;{{Cite book|title=Optics|first=Eugene|last=Hecht|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1987|isbn=020111609X|ref=harv|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation that an optical system can be characterized by its [[Cardinal point (optics)|cardinal points]]&lt;ref name=Bass&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Optics| first1=Michael|last1=Bass|first2=Casimer|last2=DeCusatis| first3=Jay|last3=Enoch|first4=Vasudevan|last4=Lakshminarayanan|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2009|isbn=0071498893|ref=harv|page=17.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.&lt;ref name=Ostdiek&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inquiry Into Physics |first1=Vern J. |last1=Ostdiek|first2=Donald J.|last2=Bord|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=0495119431|ref=harv|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Gauss notably selected the topic for [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s now famous Habilitationvortrag, ''Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde Liegen''.&lt;ref name=Monastyrsky&gt;{{Cite book|title=Riemann, Topology, and Physics|first=Michael|last=Monastyrsky|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=1987|isbn=081763262X|ref=harv|pages=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the way home from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.&lt;ref name=Bühler2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0387106626|ref=harv|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss died in Göttingen, [[Kingdom of Hannover|Hannover]] (now part of [[Lower Saxony]], Germany) in 1855 and is interred in the cemetery [[Albanifriedhof]] there. Two individuals gave eulogies at his funeral, Gauss's son-in-law [[Heinrich Ewald]] and [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]], who was Gauss's close friend and biographer. His brain was preserved and was studied by [[Rudolf Wagner]] who found its mass to be 1,492&amp;nbsp;grams and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters&lt;ref&gt;This reference from 1891 ({{cite journal

Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century was suggested as the explanation of his genius.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt;

== Religion ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
According to Dunnington,  Gauss's religion was based upon the search for truth. He believed in &quot;the immortality of the spiritual individuality, in a personal permanence after death, in a last order of things, in an eternal, righteous, omniscient and omnipotent God.&quot; Gauss also upheld [[religious tolerance]], believing it wrong to disturb others who were at peace with their own beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt;

== Family ==
[[Image:Therese Gauss.jpg|right|thumb|Gauss' daughter Therese (1816—1864)]]
Gauss's personal life was overshadowed by the early death of his first wife, Johanna Osthoff, in 1809, soon followed by the death of one child, Louis. Gauss plunged into a [[Clinical depression|depression]] from which he never fully recovered. He married again, to Johanna's best friend named Friederica Wilhelmine Waldeck but commonly known as Minna. When his second wife died in 1831 after a long illness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Gauss.html |title=Gauss biography|publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of his daughters, Therese, took over the household and cared for Gauss until the end of his life. His mother lived in his house from 1817 until her death in 1839.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt;

Gauss had six children. With Johanna (1780–1809), his children were Joseph (1806–1873), Wilhelmina (1808–1846) and Louis (1809–1810). Of all of Gauss's children, Wilhelmina was said to have come closest to his talent, but she died young. With Minna Waldeck he also had three children: Eugene (1811–1896), Wilhelm (1813–1879) and Therese (1816–1864). Therese kept house for Gauss until his death, after which she married.

Gauss eventually had conflicts with his sons. He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for &quot;fear of sullying the family name&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Gauss wanted Eugene to become a [[lawyer]], but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, which Gauss refused to pay for. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States, where he was quite successful. Wilhelm also settled in [[Missouri]], starting as a [[farmer]] and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. It took many years for Eugene's success to counteract his reputation among Gauss's friends and colleagues. See also [[s:Robert Gauss to Felix Klein - September 3, 1912|the letter from Robert Gauss to Felix Klein]] on 3 September 1912.

== Personality ==
Gauss was an ardent [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] and a hard worker. He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto ''pauca sed matura'' (&quot;few, but ripe&quot;). His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them.  Mathematical historian [[Eric Temple Bell]] estimated that, had Gauss published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he did take in a few students, Gauss was known to dislike teaching. It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in [[Berlin]] in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Friedrich Bessel]]. Before she died, [[Sophie Germain]] was recommended by Gauss to receive her honorary degree.

Gauss usually declined to present the intuition behind his often very elegant proofs—he preferred them to appear &quot;out of thin air&quot; and erased all traces of how he discovered them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} This is justified, if unsatisfactorily, by Gauss in his &quot;[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]&quot;, where he states that all analysis (i.e., the paths one travelled to reach the solution of a problem) must be suppressed for sake of brevity.

Gauss supported [[monarchy]] and opposed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], whom he saw as an outgrowth of [[revolution]].

== Mythology ==

There are several stories of his early genius.  According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.

Another famous story has it that in [[primary school]] after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. Büttner, gave him a task : add a list of [[integer]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant [[Johann Christian Martin Bartels|Martin Bartels]].

Gauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;101, 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;99&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;101, 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;98&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;101, and so on, for a total sum of 50&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;101&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5050.
However, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see &lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/gausss-day-of-reckoning/2&lt;/ref&gt; for discussion of the original [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]] source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as [[Joseph Rotman]] in his book ''A first course in Abstract Algebra'', question whether it ever happened.

According to [[Isaac Asimov]], Gauss was once interrupted in the middle of a problem and told that his wife was dying. He is purported to have said, &quot;Tell her to wait a moment till I'm done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Commemorations ==

[[Image:Stamp Carl Friedrich Gauß.jpg|thumb|Gauss (about 26) on an East-German [[Postage stamp|stamp]] produced in 1977.  [[Heptadecagon]], [[compass and straightedge]] are shown next to him.]]

From 1989 until the end of 2001, his portrait and a normal distribution curve as well as some prominent buildings of [[Göttingen]] were featured on the German ten-mark banknote. The other side of the note features the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]] and a [[triangulation]] approach for [[Kingdom of Hannover|Hannover]]. Germany has issued three stamps honouring Gauss, as well. A righteous stamp (no. 725), was issued in 1955 on the hundredth anniversary of his death; two other stamps, no. 1246 and 1811, were issued in 1977, the 200th anniversary of his birth.

[[Daniel Kehlmann]]'s 2005 novel ''Die Vermessung der Welt'', translated into English as ''[[Measuring the World]]'' in 2006, explores Gauss's life and work through a lens of historical fiction, contrasting it with the German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].

In 2007, his [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] was introduced to the [[Walhalla temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmwfk.bayern.de/downloads/aviso/2004_1_aviso_48-49.pdf |title=Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst: Startseite |publisher=Stmwfk.bayern.de |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornish''' (''Kernewek'' or ''Kernowek'') is a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language and a recognised minority language of the [[United Kingdom]], spoken in [[Cornwall]]. The language continued to function as a community language in parts of [[Cornwall]] until the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cornish-language.org/english/faq.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and a process to revive the language was started in the early 20th century, continuing to this day.

The revival of Cornish began in 1904 when [[Henry Jenner]], a Celtic language enthusiast, published his book ''Handbook of the Cornish Language''. In his work he observed, &quot;There has never been a time when there has been no person in Cornwall without a knowledge of the Cornish language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diarmuid O Page 222&quot;&gt;''Rebuilding the Celtic languages'' By Diarmuid O'Néill (Page 222)&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner's work was based on Cornish as it was spoken in the 18th century, although his pupil [[Robert Morton Nance]] later steered the revival to the style of the 16th century, before the language became more heavily influenced by [[English language|English]]. This set the tone for the next few decades; as the revival gained pace, learners of the language disagreed on which style of Cornish to use, and a number of competing orthographies were in use by the end of the century.

Nevertheless, many Cornish language textbooks and works of [[Cornish literature|literature]] have been published over the decades, and an increasing number of people are studying the language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diarmuid O'Neill 240&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebuilding the Celtic Languages: Reversing Language Shift in the Celtic Countries |author=Diarmuid O'Neill |page=240 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6PFckH-GBKAC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=%22Predennek%22&amp;ei=wUZ6SfW0EJX8ygS3kO2oBg#PPA240,M1 |publisher=Y Lolfa |isbn=0862437237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments include Cornish [[Music of Cornwall|music]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38589 Cornish Language Partnership: Music]&lt;/ref&gt; [[independent film]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38588 Cornish Language Partnership: Film clips]&lt;/ref&gt; and children's books. A small number of children in Cornwall have been brought up to be [[bilingual]] native speakers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cor Ethnologue - Cornish]&lt;/ref&gt; and the language is taught in many schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/news/cornwall_news/4142186.Cornish_language___is_it_dead_/ This is the Westcountry - Cornish language - is it dead?]&lt;/ref&gt; Cornish gained official recognition under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2410383.stm BBC News - Cornish gains official recognition]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 a [[Standard Written Form]] was agreed in an attempt to unify the orthographies and move forward the revival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7074487.stm BBC News - Breakthrough for Cornish language]&lt;/ref&gt; The first Cornish language [[Day care|crèche]] opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article6988752.ece Have a good dy: Cornish language is taught in nursery - Times Online, 15 Jan 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Cornish is one of the [[Brythonic languages]], which constitute a branch of the [[Celtic languages]]. This branch also includes the [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Breton language|Breton]], the extinct [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], and perhaps the hypothetical [[Ivernic]] languages. The [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Irish language|Irish]], and [[Manx language|Manx]] languages are part of the separate [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] branch. Cornish shares about 80% basic vocabulary with Breton, 75% with Welsh, 35% with Irish, and 35% with [[Scottish Gaelic]].

==History==
[[File:Britonia6hcentury.png|thumb|right|upright|The [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] community around the 6th century. [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Cornish and [[Breton language|Breton]] are very closely related.]]

===Historical background===
Cornish evolved from the [[British language (Celtic)|British language]] spoken throughout Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]] during the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. Some scholars have proposed that the language split into [[Western Brythonic|Western]] and [[Southwestern Brythonic protolanguage|Southwestern]] dialects, perhaps after the [[Battle of Deorham]] in about 577. This Southwestern Brythonic dialect later evolved into Cornish as well as [[Breton language|Breton]], while Western Brythonic became the ancestor to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jackson, Kenneth|title=Language and History in Early Britain|location=Edinburgh| publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1953|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proto-Cornish language developed after the Southwest Britons of [[Somerset]], [[Dorset]], [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] became linguistically separated from the West Britons of later [[Wales]] after the [[Battle of Deorham]] in about 577. The area controlled by the Southwest Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of [[Wessex]] over the next few centuries; in 927 [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]] drove the south west Celts out of [[Exeter]] and in 936 he set the east bank of the [[River Tamar|Tamar]] as the boundary between [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Wessex]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] Cornwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt; &quot;''Exeter was cleansed of its defilement by wiping out that filthy race&quot;'' ([[William of Malmesbury]], writing around 1120).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[[Philip Payton|Payton, Philip]] ''Cornwall''. Fowey: Alexander Associates (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of him taking his campaigns into Cornwall. It seems probable that [[Huwal of the West Welsh|Hywel]], King of the Cornish, agreed to pay tribute to Athelstan and thus avoided more attacks and maintained a high degree of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5042 Cornwall Council timeline 927-936]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Cornish language continued to flourish well through the Middle Ages, reaching a peak of about 39,000 speakers in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Estimate by [[Ken George]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of Cornish speakers is thought to have declined thereafter.

The earliest written record of the Cornish language, dating from the 9th century AD, is a [[gloss]] in a Latin  manuscript of ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De Consolatione Philosophiae]]'' by [[Boethius]], which used the words ''ud rocashaas''.  The phrase means ''&quot;it (the mind) hated the gloomy places&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/060615.shtml Oxford scholars detect earliest record of Cornish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sims-Williams, P., 'A New Brittonic Gloss on Boethius: ud rocashaas', Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies 50 (Winter 2005), 77-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tudor Period to Restoration===
In the reign of Henry VIII we have an account given by [[Andrew Borde]] in his ''Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge'', written in 1542. He states, ''&quot;In Cornwall is two speches, the one is naughty Englysshe, and the other is Cornysshe speche.  And there be many men and women the which cannot speake one worde of Englysshe, but all Cornyshe.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Henry (1904) ''A Handbook of the Cornish Language chiefly in its latest stages with some account of its history and literature''. London: David Nutt&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Prayer Book rebellion]] of 1549, which was a reaction to Parliament passing the first [[Act of Uniformity 1549|Act of Uniformity]], people in many areas of Cornwall did not speak or understand English (the intention of the Act was to replace worship in Latin with worship in English, which was known, by the lawmakers, not to be universally spoken throughout England. Instead of simply banning Latin, however, the Act was framed so as to enforce English). In 1549, this imposition of a new language was sometimes a matter of life and death: over 4,000 people who protested against the imposition of an English Prayer book were massacred by the [[Edward VI of England|King's]] army. Their leaders were executed and the people suffered numerous reprisals.

[[File:Cornish Language Shift.svg|right|thumb|The Cornish language experienced a shift between 1300–1750, with the Cornish people gradually adopting English as their common language.]]
The rebels' document claimed they wanted a return to the old religious services and ended 'We the Cornishmen (whereof certain of us understand no English) utterly refuse this new English' (altered spelling). [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], Duke of [[Somerset]], replied to the Cornishmen, inquiring as to why they should be offended by services in English when they had them in Latin, which they also did not understand. Through many factors, including loss of life and the spread of English, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] proved a turning-point for the Cornish language. Indeed, some recent research{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} has suggested that estimates of the Cornish-speaking population prior to the rebellion may have been low, making the decline even more drastic.

By this time the language must already have been in decline from its earlier heyday, and the situation worsened over the course of the next century. [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] in his 1602 work ''The Survey of Cornwall'', notices the almost total extirpation of the Cornish language in his days. He says; ''The principal love and knowledge of this language liveth in [[John Kennall|Dr. Kennall]], the civilian, and with him lieth buried''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]]'s ''Survey of Cornwall'', 1602&lt;/ref&gt; [[Towednack]] is claimed to be the location of the last church in which services were conducted in the Cornish language (in 1678), though the same claim has been made for [[Ludgvan]] and for [[St Wynwallow's Church, Landewednack|Landewednack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/229761 SW7112 : St Wynwallow's Church, Landewednack], at geograph.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Carew also said ''Most of the inhabitants can speak no word of Cornish, but very few are ignorant of the English; and yet some so affect their own, as to a stranger they will not speak it; for if meeting them by chance, you inquire the way, or any such matter, your answer shall be, &quot;Meea navidna caw zasawzneck&quot;, &quot;I can speak no Saxonage&quot;.''
&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lhTOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=richard+carew+speak+no+english&amp;as_brr=3 Googlebooks ''Survey of Cornwall'' By Richard Carew (page 152)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th-19th centuries===
It will probably be impossible to establish who the definitive &quot;last native speaker&quot; of Cornish was owing to the lack of extensive research done at the time and the obvious impossibility of finding audio recordings dating from the era. There is also difficulty with what exactly is meant by &quot;last native speaker&quot;, as this has been interpreted in differing ways. Some scholars prefer to use terms such as &quot;last monoglot speaker&quot;, to refer to a person whose only language was Cornish, &quot;last native speaker&quot;, to refer to a person who may have been bilingual in both English and Cornish and furthermore, &quot;last person with traditional knowledge&quot;, that is to say someone who had an extensive knowledge of Cornish from traditional sources but had not studied the language per se.

The last known [[monoglottism|monoglot]] Cornish speaker is believed to have been [[Chesten Marchant]], who died in 1676 at [[Gwithian]]. It is not known when she was born. [[William Scawen]], writing in the 1680s, states that Marchant had a &quot;slight&quot; understanding of English and had been married twice.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, P. B. (1974) ''The Cornish Language''. London: Routledge; p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1742, [[Samuel Barrington|Captain Samuel Barrington]] of the [[Royal Navy]] made a voyage to [[Brittany]], taking with him a Cornish sailor of [[Mount's Bay]]. He was astonished that this sailor could make himself understood in [[Breton language|Breton]]. In 1768, Barrington's brother [[Daines Barrington]] searched for speakers of the Cornish language and at [[Mousehole]] found [[Dolly Pentreath]], a fish seller then aged about 82, who &quot;could speak Cornish very fluently&quot;. In 1775, he published an account of her in the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]]' journal ''Archaeologia'', entitled ''On the Expiration of the Cornish Language''. He reported that he had also found at Mousehole two other women, some ten or twelve years younger than Pentreath, who could not speak Cornish readily, but who understood it.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;[[Peter Berresford Ellis]], ''The Cornish language and its literature'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L709AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 115-116] online&lt;/ref&gt; Pentreath, who died in 1777, is popularly claimed to be the last [[first language|native speaker]] of Cornish. Notwithstanding her reported last words, &quot;Me ne vidn kewsel Sowsnek!&quot; (&quot;I will not speak English!&quot;), she spoke at least some English. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Peter Berresford Ellis]] poses the question of who was the last speaker of the language, and replies that &quot;We shall never know, for a language does not die suddenly, snuffed out with one last remaining speaker... it lingers on for many years after it has ceased as a form of communication, many people still retaining enough knowledge from their childhood to embark on conversations...&quot; He also notes that in 1777 John Nancarrow of [[Market Jew]], not yet forty, could speak the language, and that into the next century some Cornish people &quot;retained a knowledge of the entire [[Lord's Prayer]] and [[Creed]] in the language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Berresford Ellis, ''op. cit.'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L709AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 125] online&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Reverend John Bannister stated in 1871 that &quot;The close of the 18th century witnessed the final extinction, as spoken language, of the old Celtic vernacular of Cornwall&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Bannister, ''Cornish Place Names'' (1871)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some evidence that Cornish continued, albeit in limited usage by a handful of speakers, through the late 19th century. Matthias Wallis of [[St. Buryan]] certified in 1859 that his grandmother, Ann Wallis, who had died around 1844, had spoken Cornish well. He also stated that a Jane Barnicoate, who had died circa 1857, could speak Cornish too.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Kent, Tim Saunders, Looking at the Mermaid: A Reader in Cornish Literature 900-1900, Francis Boutle, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Gwyn Griffiths]] commented that &quot;there were Cornish immigrants who spoke the language in the leadmine villages of North [[Cardiganshire]], [[Mid-Wales]], in the 1850s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.francisboutle.co.uk/pages.php?cID=6&amp;pID=24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875 six speakers all in their sixties were discovered in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;Lach-Szyrma, W. S. (1875) &quot;The Numerals in Old Cornish&quot;. In: ''Academy'', London, 20 March 1875 (quoted in Ellis, P. B. (1974) ''The Cornish Language'', p. 127)&lt;/ref&gt; The farmer [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]], who died in 1891 at [[Boswednack]], [[Zennor]], may have been the last person with some traditional knowledge of Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L709AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=John+Davey+cornish+language+st+just&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mxT5wVCTBB&amp;sig=BfBS48h-eh1fAxca8MxRdBQzKLQ&amp;hl=en The Cornish Language and Its Literature: a History, by [[Peter Berresford Ellis]]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other traces survived. Fishermen in [[West Penwith]] were counting fish using a rhyme derived from Cornish into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguae-celticae.org/dateien/Independent_Study_on_Cornish_Language.pdf Independent Study on Cornish Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
===Revived language===
[[File:Kernow a'gas dynnergh 20050527.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Welcome to Cornwall&quot; sign in English and Cornish]]
[[File:Szyld kornwalijski w Penzance.jpg|thumb|right|Cornish can be seen in many places in [[Cornwall]]]]
In the 20th century a conscious effort was made to revive Cornish as a language for everyday use in speech and writing (see below for further details about the dialects of modern Cornish).

This revival can be traced to the work of Jenner, who in 1904 published his work ''A Handbook of the Cornish Language''. This formed the basis for the language revival and learning. In his work he observed, &quot;There has never been a time when there has been no person in Cornwall without a knowledge of the Cornish language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diarmuid O Page 222&quot;/&gt;

The number of Cornish speakers is growing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diarmuid O'Neill 240&quot;/&gt; Determining a figure for the number of Cornish speakers depends on how the ability to speak the language is defined. One figure for the mean amount of people who know a few basic words, such as knowing that &quot;Kernow&quot; means &quot;Cornwall&quot;, was 300,000; the same survey gave the figure of people able to have simple conversations at 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebuilding the Celtic Languages: Reversing Language Shift in the Celtic Countries |author=Diarmuid O'Neill |page=242 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6PFckH-GBKAC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=%22Predennek%22&amp;ei=wUZ6SfW0EJX8ygS3kO2oBg#PPA240,M1 |publisher=Y Lolfa |isbn=0862437237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornish Language Strategy project commissioned research to provide quantitative and qualitative evidence for the number of Cornish speakers: due to the success of the revival project it was estimated that 2,000 people were fluent (surveyed in spring 2008), an increase from the estimated 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently suggested in a study by Kenneth MacKinnon in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC BBC/British Council&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walesonline creche&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title='WalesOnline - News - Wales News - First Cornish-speaking creche is inspired by|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/01/16/first-cornish-speaking-creche-is-inspired-by-example-set-inwales-91466-25612689/|accessdate=2010-01-18|publisher=Welsh Media Ltd|date=2010-01-16|work=WalesOnline website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;http://www.gosw.gov.uk/497666/docs/254795/mode_of_use.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornish continues to survive in the place-names of Cornwall, as well as in [[Cornish surnames]], and knowledge of the language helps the understanding of these ancient meanings. Many Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats. There is now an increasing amount of Cornish literature, in which poetry is the most important genre, particularly in oral form or as song or as traditional Cornish chants historically performed in marketplaces during religious holidays and public festivals and gatherings. [[Cornwall Council]]'s ''(Cornish: Konsel Kernow)'' policy is to support the language. A motion passed in November 2009 approved the council's use of Cornish. The policy notes the &quot;place of the Cornish language as a unique cultural asset&quot;  and requires the council to promote Cornish in line with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. One effect of the policy is that worn out road signs are replaced by bilingual ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisiswesternmorningnews.co.uk/news/Councillors-divided-bilingual-road-sign-plan/article-1508167-detail/article.html |title=Council backs bilingual road signs |author=Mann, Petra |accessdate=15&amp;nbsp;December 2010  |date=12&amp;nbsp;November 2009 |publisher=[[Western Morning News]] |work=[[Western Morning News]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are regular periodicals solely in the language such as the monthly ''An Gannas'', ''An Gowsva'', and ''An Garrick''. [[BBC Radio Cornwall]] has a regular news broadcast in Cornish, and sometimes have other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts. Local newspapers such as the ''[[Western Morning News]]'' regularly have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as ''The Packet'', ''The West Briton'' and ''The Cornishman'' also support the movement. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
There is now also an online radio service in Cornish called [http://www.radyo.kernewegva.com Radyo an Gernewegva]. It publishes a half an hour podcast per week, based on a magazine format. It includes music in Cornish as well as interviews and features. 

The language has financial sponsorship from many sources, including the [[Millennium Commission]]. A number of language organisations exist in Cornwall including (in alphabetical order) [[Agan Tavas]] (Our Language), the Cornish sub-group of the [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages]], [[Gorseth Kernow]], [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]] (the Cornish Language Board), [[Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek]] (the Cornish Language Fellowship), and [http://cwic.cornwall.gov.uk/cwic-sql/cwic-new/details.asp?pl=MENHENIOT&amp;i=O12836&amp;a=O13 '''Teere ha Tavas (Land and Language)''']. One organisation, [[Dalleth]] (now defunct), promoted the language to pre-school children. There are many popular ceremonies, some ancient, some modern, which use the language or are entirely in the language. The language has been officially recognised as one of the ''historical regional and minority languages in Europe'' (''see'' European recognition ''below'').

[[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] ''Atlas of World Languages'' classifies Cornish as &quot;critically endangered&quot;. UNESCO has acknowledged that a previous classification of 'extinct', which came under fierce criticism from Cornish speakers, &quot;does not reflect the current situation for Cornish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-11935464 BBC News - Cornish language no longer extinct, says UN]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European recognition===
[[File:Truro Cathedral welcome cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Welcome sign at [[Truro Cathedral]] in several languages, including Cornish.]]
On 5 November 2002, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, Local Government and Regions Minister [[Nick Raynsford]] said:

{{quote|After careful consideration and with the help of the results of an independent academic study on the language commissioned by the government, we have decided to recognise Cornish as falling under Part II of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].

The government will be registering this decision with the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;br&gt;The purpose of the Charter is to protect and promote the historical regional or minority languages of Europe.

It recognises that some of these languages are in danger of extinction and that protection and encouragement of them contributes to Europe's cultural diversity and historical traditions.

This is a positive step in acknowledging the symbolic importance the language has for Cornish identity and heritage.

Cornish will join [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] as protected and promoted languages under the Charter, which commits the government to recognise and respect those languages.}}

Officials will be starting discussions with [[Cornwall Council]] and Cornish language organisations to ensure the views of Cornish speakers and people wanting to learn Cornish are taken into account in implementing the Charter. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Government funding for the Cornish language===
In June 2005, after much pressure from language groups and others such as the [[Gorseth Kernow]], the government allocated £80,000 per year for three years of direct central government funding to the Cornish language. There have been complaints however that in the same period [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] is being allocated £1,000,000 per year of direct government funding. This comes after the [[British government]] acknowledged in its 1st [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] compliance report that: &quot;There are no current demands from within the school system for Ulster-Scots to be taught as a language. There have been concerns that while the ECRML Level II Cornish language remains in the slow lane, the Ulster-Scots language is to be made a ECRML Level III language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/4092664.stm BBC News - June 2005 - Cash boost for Cornish language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://duchyofcornwall.eu/duchy05.php Suppression of Cornish identity and language]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources on Traditional Cornish===
[[File:Origo Mundi kynsa gwersow.jpg|thumb|right|The opening verses of ''Origo Mundi'', the first play of the [[Ordinalia]] (the ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of mediaeval Cornish literature), written by an unknown monk in the late 14th century]]
The [[Southwestern Brythonic]], or Southwestern Brittonic, language evolved into Cornish, shrinking from the whole southwest of England into the western tip of Cornwall with time. [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] divided this long period into several sub-periods having different linguistic innovations.

&quot;Primitive Cornish&quot; existed between about 600 and 800 AD but nothing survives from this time. The &quot;Old Cornish&quot; period was between 800 and 1200 AD, for which there is a Cornish-Latin dictionary (the Vocabularium Cornicum or Cottonian Vocabulary; MS. Cotton Vespasian A.xiv)&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Eugene van T. (ed.) (1964) The Old Cornish Vocabulary. Ann Arbor, Mich: Univ. M/films&lt;/ref&gt; and various 10th century glosses in Latin manuscripts such as the [[Bodmin manumissions]] giving the Cornish names of freed slaves.

''Prophetiae Merlini'' ([[Prophecy of Merlin]]) a manuscript dating from about 1133 written in [[Latin]] by [[John of Cornwall (theologian)|John of Cornwall]], contains some margin notes in the Cornish language. The original manuscript is unique and currently held in a [[codex]] at the [[Vatican Library]]. The manuscript attracted little attention from the scholarly world until 1876 when [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] undertook a brief analysis of the Cornish and Welsh vocabulary found in John's marginal commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0EG-17syB2AC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=cornish+manuscript+held+by+the+vatican#v=onepage&amp;q=cornish%20manuscript%20held%20by%20the%20vatican&amp;f=false ''Discovering local history'' By David Iredale, John Barrett (page 44)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Middle Cornish&quot; period  between 1200 and 1578 has  many sources of information, mostly religious texts. There are about 20,000 lines of text in total. Various plays were written by the canons of [[Glasney College]] intended to educate the Cornish people about the Bible and the Celtic saints.

The &quot;Late Cornish&quot; period from 1578 to about 1800 has fewer sources of information on the language.  In this period there was considerable input from the English language. In 1776 [[William Bodinar]], who had learnt Cornish from fishermen, wrote a letter in Cornish which was probably the last prose in the language. However, the last verse was the ''[[Cranken Rhyme]]'' written in the late 19th century by [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]] of Boswednack.

===William Bodinar's letter 1776===
[[File:Lether Bodinar.jpg|thumb|right|William Bodinar's letter, dated 3rd July 1776]]
This is an example of Cornish written by the hand of a native speaker [http://corpus.kernewek.cymru247.net/wb.txt]. The text is also interesting from a sociolinguistic point of view in that Bodinar speaks about the contemporary state of the Cornish language in 1776.

===Placename evidence===
Further information on traditional Cornish can be obtained from the place names ([[toponyms]]) of Cornwall that not only reflect meaning but also language change throughout the period in which Cornish was spoken in Cornwall.  The place names have been analysed into elements for which meanings have been inferred.

===Rise of Cornish studies===
[[William Scawen]] produced an epic manuscript on the declining Cornish language that continually evolved until he died in 1689, aged 89. He was the first person to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78. The only version that was ever published was a short first draft, but the final version, which he worked on until his death, is hundreds of pages long. At the same time a group of scholars, led by [[John Keigwin]] (nephew of William Scawen), of Mousehole, tried to preserve and further the Cornish language. They left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs. This group was contacted by the Welsh linguist [[Edward Lhuyd]] who came to Cornwall to study the language.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, P. B. (1974); pp. 82-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lhuyd, Edward (1707) ''Archæologia Britannica: giving some account additional to what has been hitherto publish'd, of the languages, histories and customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain, from collections and observations in travels through Wales, Cornwal, Bas-Bretagne, Ireland, and Scotland; Vol. I. Glossography''. Oxford: printed at the Theater for the author, and sold by Mr. Bateman, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, P. B. (1974); pp. 100-08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lhuyd, Edward (1702) [Elegy on the death of King William III, in Cornish verse] in: ''Pietas Universitatis Oxoniensis in obitum augustissimi Regis Gulielmi III; et gratulatio in exoptatissimam serenissimae Annæ Reginæ inaugurationem.'' Oxonii: e Theatro Sheldoniano&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Modern Cornish was the subject of a study published by Lhuyd in 1707, and differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar. Such differences included the wide use of certain modal affixes that, although out of use by Lhuyd's time, had a considerable effect on the word-order of medieval Cornish{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The medieval language also possessed two additional tenses for expressing past events and an extended set of possessive suffixes. Edward Lhuyd theorises{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that the language of this time was heavily inflected, possessing not just the [[genitive]], [[ablative]] and [[locative]] cases so common in Early Modern Cornish, but also [[dative]] and [[accusative]] cases, and even a [[vocative]] case, although historical references to this are rare.

[[John Whitaker (historian)|John Whitaker]] the Manchester-born rector of [[Ruan Lanihorne]], studied the decline of the Cornish language. In his 1804 work ''the Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall'' he concluded that: &quot;[T]he English Liturgy, was not desired by the Cornish, but forced upon them by the tyranny of England, at a time when the English language was yet unknown in Cornwall. This act of tyranny was at once gross barbarity to the Cornish people, and a death blow to the Cornish language.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jago, Fred W. P. (1882) ''The Ancient Language and the Dialect of Cornwall''. New York: AMS Press, 1983, (originally published 1882, Netherton and Worth, Truro), pp. 4 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Williams published the first comprehensive Cornish dictionary in 1865, the ''Lexicon Cornu-Britannicum''. As a result of the discovery of additional ancient Cornish manuscripts, 2000 new words were added to the vocabulary by [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] in ''A Cornish Glossary''. William C. Borlase published ''Proverbs and Rhymes in Cornish'' in 1866 while ''A Glossary of Cornish Place Names'' was produced by John Bannister in the same year. Dr [[Fred W. P. Jago|Frederick Jago]] published his ''English-Cornish Dictionary'' in 1882.

==Revival==
[[File:DSCN1082JennerPlaque.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque on Henry Jenner's home with bilingual inscription]]
During the 19th century the Cornish language was the subject of antiquarian interest and a number of lectures were given on the subject and pamphlets on it were published. In 1904 the [[Cornish Revival]] began with publication of [[Henry Jenner]]'s ''Handbook of the Cornish Language''. The publication included Cornish spelling as it was last used when Cornish was a community language in the 18th century. This orthography had never been standardised and so had many variants. In response to this a unified system of spelling was needed, and, in 1929 [[Robert Morton Nance]] standardised a form of Cornish with [[Unified Cornish]] based upon written [[Middle Cornish]] from the [[Medieval]] period. Nance was a purist who tended to prefer older ‘Celtic’ forms rather than the historically more recent forms deriving from Middle and Early Modern English. Nevertheless, Nance's system became the standard form for Cornish and remained so until the 1980s when people started to challenge Unified Cornish feeling that it too was flawed.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornishlanguage.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.cornishlanguage.co.uk/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken George]] studied the sounds of Cornish based on the early works of Lluyd and had sought to create a bridge between Unified and [[Late Cornish]]- as had been used by [[Henry Jenner]] but instead George devised a new system on realising the flaws in Unified Cornish. This was held to have the advantage of the written word accurately representing the spoken word based upon George’s own theories.George's system, or the phonemic system as it later became known was officially named [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] (Common Cornish) and after a one year discussion the [[Cornish Language Board]] agreed to adopt it in 1987. This decision caused division in the Cornish language community, especially since people had been using Nance's old system for years and were unfamiliar with the new one.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornishlanguage.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

These divisions continued when [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] was itself challenged in 1995 by [[Nicholas Williams]] in his book &quot;Cornish Today&quot; that listed 26 major flaws in [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] and devised yet another new form of Unified Cornish, namely, &quot;Unified Cornish Revised&quot;. A dictionary of Unified Cornish Revised appeared later, selling enough to merit a second edition, and to date this is considered the most comprehensive dictionary of the Cornish language. A reply to &quot;Cornish Today&quot; appeared soon after in the book &quot;Kernewek Kemmyn – Cornish for the Twenty First Century&quot; by Ken George and Paul Dunbar to which a reply appeared in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornishlanguage.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

In order to end this ceaseless in-fighting and polemics that many feel have hindered the Cornish language's revival, it was decided to aim for a Standard Written Form once and for all. The fourth and final Standard Written Form draft was generated on 30 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernowek.net/ Kernowek official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Another step forward came on 17 June 2009 when it was reported that for the unity and future of the Cornish language a decision was made by the bards of the [[Gorseth Kernow]] at their annual meeting under the leadership of [[Grand Bard]] [[Vanessa Beeman]]. By an overwhelming majority and after two decades of debate they adopted the Standard Written Form (SWF) for their ceremonies and correspondence. From the earliest days under Grand Bards [[Henry Jenner]] and Morton Nance the 'Unified Form' has been used for the Gorsedd ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/language-progress/article-1084119-detail/article.html &quot;This is Cornwall&quot; website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of Revived Cornish==
===Unified Cornish===
{{Main|Unified Cornish}}
The first successful attempt to [[Language revival|revive]] Cornish was largely the work of [[Henry Jenner]] and [[Robert Morton Nance]] in the early part of the twentieth century.  Jenner published his &quot;Handbook of the Cornish Language&quot; in 1904 while Nance published &quot;Cornish For All&quot; in 1929. [[A. S. D. Smith]] produced ''Lessons in Spoken Cornish'' in 1931.

The resulting system was called [[Unified Cornish]] or UC (''Kernewek Uny[e]s, KU'') and was based mainly on Middle Cornish (the language of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries &amp;mdash; a high point for Cornish literature), with a standardised spelling and an extended vocabulary based largely on [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. A dictionary of Unified Cornish was published by Nance in the 1930s. For many years, this was the &quot;modern Cornish&quot; language, and many people still use it today.

Shortcomings in Unified Cornish had to do in part with the stiff and archaizing literary style Nance had employed, and in part with a realisation that Nance's phonology lacked some distinctions which must have existed in traditional Cornish. In the 1970s, [[Tim Saunders]] raised a number of issues of communicative efficiency, but his initiative had no influence and later developments are entirely independent.

===Modern Cornish or Revived Late Cornish===
{{Main|Modern Cornish}}
In the early 1980s, [[Richard Gendall]], who had worked with Nance, published a new system based on the works of writers such as [[Nicholas Boson]] and [[John Boson (writer)|John Boson]], William Rowe, Thomas Tonkin and others, some of the last Cornish writers before the language's extinction. This system, called [[Modern Cornish]] (''Kernûak Nowedga'') by its proponents, differs from Unified Cornish in using the English-influenced orthographies of the 17th and 18th centuries, though there are also differences of vocabulary and grammar. It is sometimes called &quot;[[Revived Late Cornish]]&quot; or RLC as well. Writers of Late Cornish often wrote Cornish using the English orthographic equivalent of the nearest equivalent English sound.  For instance, the word for 'good' typically spelt ''dâ'' 'good' could also be written ''daa'', and the word for 'month' could be spelt ''mîz'' or ''meez''. The need for standard spelling when learning a language has led the [[Cussel an Tavas Kernuak|Cornish Language Council]] to adopt the Revived Late Cornish spelling standardised by Gendall and Neil Kennedy. This makes sparing use of accents (as did writers of Modern Cornish at the time).

===Kernewek Kemmyn or Common Cornish===
{{Main|Kernewek Kemmyn}}
In 1986 [[Ken George]] developed a revised orthography (and phonology) for Revived Cornish, which became known as [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] or KK (lit. ''Common Cornish''). It was subsequently adopted by [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek|the Cornish Language Board]] as their preferred system. It retained a Middle Cornish base but made the spelling more systematic by applying [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic orthographic theory]], and for the first time set out clear rules relating spelling to pronunciation. The revised system is claimed to have been taken up enthusiastically by the majority of Cornish speakers and learners, and advocates of this orthography claim that it was especially welcomed by teachers. Nevertheless, many Cornish speakers chose to continue using Unified Cornish. Despite later criticism by [[Nicholas Williams]] (see below), [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] has retained the support of many active Cornish speakers.

===Unified Cornish Revised===
In 1995 an alternative revision of Unified Cornish known as [[Unified Cornish Revised]] or UCR (''Kernowek Unys Amendys, KUA'') was proposed by Nicholas Williams. UCR built on traditional Unified Cornish, making the spellings regular while keeping as close as possible to the orthographic practices of the medieval scribes. The rationale behind UCR was that only attested Cornish can serve as a guide to its phonology, and that other attempts at regularisation had on the one hand introduced alien elements and on the other hand not known how to interpret the variations in extant material, which it turned to explain in accordance with the assumptions of nineteenth-century Middle European philology. In common with Kernewek Kemmyn, UCR made use of Tudor and Late Cornish prose materials unavailable to Nance. Williams published his ''English-Cornish Dictionary'' in this orthography in 2000; the second edition was published in 2006. Like the other orthographies, UCR also has its adherents and its detractors.

===Unification projects===
In practice these different written forms do not prevent Cornish-speakers from communicating with each other effectively. Cornish has been successfully revived as a viable language for communication. Nevertheless there is still much scope for improving the standard and accuracy of the spoken language. The language is spoken mainly with the older generations, but is currently being taught at some Cornish primary and secondary schools. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In response to the orthographic mayhem, the Cornish Language Partnership has initiated a period of review. In 2007 an independent Cornish Language Commission consisting of sociolinguists and linguists from outside of Cornwall was formed to review the four existing forms (UC, RLC, KK, and UCR) and consider whether any of those could be suitable to be a Single Written Form for Cornish, or whether a new fifth form should be adopted. Two groups made proposals of compromise orthographies.
* The ''UdnFormScrefys'' (''Single Written Form'') Group proposed an orthography called [[Kernowek Standard]] (KS) which is based on traditional orthographic forms and also has a clear relation between spelling and pronunciation, taking both Middle Cornish and Late Cornish dialects of Revived Cornish into account.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.kernowek.net Kernowek Standard website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publication of the Standard Written Form, KS evolved to become a set of proposed amendments to the SWF. For more information, see [[Kernowek Standard]].
* Two members of the CLP's Linguistic Working Group, Albert Bock and Benjamin Bruch, proposed another orthography called Kernowek Dasunys (KD) which endeavours to reconcile UC, KK, RLC, and UCR orthographies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dasunys.net/ Kernowek Dasunys website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Written Form===
{{Main|Standard Written Form}}
In May 2008 the Partnership agreed on a single written form to be known as [[Standard Written Form]] (SWF), to be used by [[Cornwall Council]] for education and public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/7074487.stm Breakthrough for Cornish language] BBC News, 19 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=37768&amp;p=0 An Outline of the Standard Written Form of Cornish] Maga Kernow&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornish Language Partnership has specified that ''Furv Skrifys Savonek'' (FSS) is the SWF translation for ''Standard Written Form''. Users of UCR and KS prefer the term ''Form Screfys Standard''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

On Friday, 9 May 2008, the Cornish Language Partnership met with the specification for the Standard Written Form as the main item on the agenda. All four Cornish language groups, Unified Cornish, Unified Cornish Revised, Common Cornish and Modern Cornish were represented at this meeting. Reactions were mixed from the various language groups, Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek, Cussel an Tavaz Kernûak, Kesva an Taves Kernewek and Agan Tavas, but the majority wanted resolution and acceptance. The Cornish Language Partnership said that it would 'create an opportunity to break down barriers and the agreement marked a significant stepping stone in the Cornish language.'. The vote to ratify the SWF was carried and on 19 May 2008 it was announced that the single written form had been agreed. Eric Brooke, chairman of the Cornish Language Partnership, said: ''&quot;This marks a significant stepping-stone in the development of the Cornish language. In time this step will allow the Cornish language to move forward to become part of the lives of all in Cornwall.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7074487.stm BBC News 19 May 2008 - Breakthrough for Cornish language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7408686.stm BBC News 19 May 2008 - Standard Cornish spelling agreed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=41352 Cornish Language Partnership - Standard Written Form Ratified]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonetics and phonology==
The pronunciation of Cornish is based on the records of the linguist [[Edward Lhuyd]] who visited Cornwall in 1700. The traditional texts are also used to extract the pronunciation, since many early texts are poems and many of the later texts were written phonetically due to the lack of both an orthographic standard and an education in Cornish. The traditional Cornish dialect and accent of English is also used for clues as to the pronunciation, and has been shown to match phonological characteristics of the traditional language.

==Grammar==
Cornish is a member of the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages, and shares many of the characteristics of the other Insular Celtic languages.  These include:

*''Initial [[consonant mutation]]''.  The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context.   As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared to three in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and two in [[Irish language|Irish]]), Manx and Gaelic.  These are known as ''soft'' (''b'' -&gt; ''v'', etc.), ''hard'' (''b'' -&gt; ''p''), ''aspirate'' (''b'' unchanged, ''t'' -&gt; ''th'') and ''mixed'' (''b'' -&gt; ''f'').
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Before unrounded vowels (i, y, e, a), l, and r + unrounded vowel.&lt;br&gt;
² Before rounded vowels (o, u), and r + rounded vowel.
&lt;/center&gt;
*''[[Inflected language|inflected]] (or [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]]) [[preposition]]s.''  A preposition combines with a personal pronoun to give a separate word form.  For example, ''gans'' (with, by) + ''my'' (me) -&gt; ''genef''; ''gans'' + ''ef'' (him) -&gt; ''ganso''.
*''No indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]].''  ''Cath'' means &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;a cat&quot; (there is, however a definite article: ''an gath'' means &quot;the cat&quot;).

===Pronouns===
====Personal pronouns (Late Cornish, SWF)====

{|class=wikitable
|-
! Person !! Singular                          !! Plural
|-
| First  || me                                || nei
|-
| Second || te, che                               || whei
|-
| Third  || ev, 'e (masc.),&lt;br/&gt; hei (fem.)   ||  anjei, jei
|}

==Dialects==
Traditional Cornish would have probably had regional varieties, but due to the nature of revival, modern varieties have more to do with differences of opinion.

There are, essentially, four orthographic 'dialects' of Revived Cornish, but in linguistic terms, Unified Cornish and Common Cornish reflect Middle Cornish grammar and pronunciation while Revived Late Cornish favours Late Cornish grammar and punctuation. UCR stands somewhere between but closer to the Middle Cornish end of the spectrum. The two new proposed compromise orthographies, Kernowak Standard and Kernowek Dasunys attempt to represent both dialects of Revived Cornish.

It is also possible that a variety of Cornish was spoken in [[Devon]] as late as the 14th century: Then President of [[the Devonshire Association]], Sir Henry Duke, said in 1922 that ''&quot;various writers have made (assertions) of the continuance of British occupancy and of the British tongue in South and West Devon to a time well within the reigns of the Plantagenets.  [[Tristram Risdon|Risdon]], for example, says that the Celtic tongue was spoken throughout the South Hams in Edward the First's time&quot;''.

Some people from Devon have begun to learn a language based on Joseph Biddulph's booklet, ''A handbook of Westcountry Brythonic'', which attempts to recreate the hypothetical southwestern Brythonic tongue which would have been spoken in the southwestern peninsula in around 700AD. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The [[Celtic Congress]] and [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.

There have been many films, some televised, made entirely, or significantly, in the language. Many businesses use Cornish names. The overnight medical service in Cornwall is now called ''Kernow Urgent Care''.

===Cultural events===
Cornwall has many cultural events associated with the language, including the international [[Celtic Media Festival]], hosted in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] in 1997, with the programme in Cornish, English and French. The [[Old Cornwall Society]] has promoted the use of the language for many years at annual events and meetings. Two examples of ceremonies that are performed in both the English and Cornish languages are [[Crying The Neck]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://newquay.oldcornwall.org.uk/articles/crying_the_neck.shtml Crying the Neck in Cornwall]&lt;/ref&gt; and the annual mid-summer bonfires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redrutholdcornwall.org/bonfire.htm Redruth Old Cornwall Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study and teaching===
Cornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level in the [[University of Wales]], though the only existing courses in the language at University level are as part of a course in Cornish Studies at the [[University of Exeter]], or as part of the distance-learning [[Welsh language|Welsh]] degree from the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]. In March 2008, [[Benjamin Bruch]] started teaching the language as part of the Celtic Studies curriculum at the [[University of Vienna]], Austria.

Cornwall's first Cornish language [[Day care|creche]] &quot;Skol dy'Sadorn Kernewek&quot; was established in 2010 at [[Cornwall College]], [[Camborne]]. The nursery teaches children aged between two and five years alongside their parents, to ensure the language is also spoken in the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walesonline creche&quot;/&gt;

===Government recognition===
The Cornish language has been recognised as a minority language by the UK government under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. This follows years of pressure by groups such as [[Mebyon Kernow]] and [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]].
{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Books in Cornish===
A first complete edition of the New Testament in Cornish, [[Nicholas Williams]]' translation of the ''Testament Noweth agan Arluth ha Savyour Jesu Cryst'', was published at Easter 2002 by Spyrys a Gernow (ISBN 0-9535975-4-7); it uses Unified Cornish Revised orthography. The translation was made from the Greek text, and incorporated John Tregear's existing translations with slight revisions.

In August 2004, Kesva an Taves Kernewek published another Cornish translation of the New Testament (ISBN 1-902917-33-2), translated by six Bards{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} of Gorseth Kernow under the leadership of Keith Syed; it uses Kernewek Kemmyn orthography. It was launched in a ceremony in [[Truro Cathedral]] attended by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

A few small publishers produce books in Cornish which are stocked in some local bookshops.

===On radio===
[[BBC Radio Cornwall]] gave over 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday mornings for a programme called ''Croder Croghen'' until the early 1990s. It was replaced with a five minute news bulletin called ''An Newothow'' (though it was regularly mis-spelled in the press as ''Ad Newothow''. The bulletin is presented every Sunday evening by [[Rod Lyon]]. [[Pirate FM]] ran short bulletins on Saturday lunchtimes from 1998 to 1999. [[Matthew Clarke (disambiguation)|Matthew Clarke]] presented the bulletin. In 2006, [[Matthew Clarke (disambiguation)|Matthew Clarke]] launched a web-streamed news bulletin called ''[[Nowothow an Seythun]]'' and, in 2008, ''[[Radyo an Gernewegva]]'' (RanG) was added.

===Musical works===
English composer [[Peter Warlock]], an enthusiast of the Celtic languages, wrote a Christmas carol in Cornish (setting words by Henry Jenner). Cornish musician [[Jory Bennett]] (born Redruth, 1963) has composed &quot;Six Songs of Cornwall&quot; for bass and piano, a Cornish song-cycle, settings of Cornish language poems by [[Nicholas Williams]] /trans. [[E. G. Retallack Hooper]] (f.p. [[Keele University]], 7 May 1986).  The Cornish electronic musician [[Richard D James]] has often used Cornish names for track titles, most notably on his ''[[Drukqs|DrukQs]]'' album. [[Gwenno Saunders]] is a multilingual Welsh-born musician and a Cornish speaker. [[Skwardya]] has produced four CD albums in Cornish in a modern pop/rock/blues/dance style.

'''Charybdis''' or '''Kharybdis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|b|d|ɨ|s}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''Χάρυβδις'') was a [[sea monster]], later rationalised as a whirlpool and considered a shipping hazard in the [[Strait of Messina]].

==The mythological background==
[[File:Strait of Messina.jpg|thumb|320px|The Strait of Messina, with Scylla (underlined in red) and Charybdis on the opposite shores]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Charybdis''' or '''Kharybdis''' was once a beautiful [[naiad]] and the daughter of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. She takes form as a huge bladder of a creature whose face was all mouth and whose arms and legs were flippers and who swallows huge amounts of water three times a day before belching them back out again, creating whirlpools. In some variations of the tale, Charybdis is just a large [[whirlpool]] rather than a sea monster. Charybdis was very loyal to her father in his endless feud with [[Zeus]]; it was she who rode the hungry tides after [[Poseidon]] had stirred up a storm, and led them onto the beaches, gobbling up whole villages, submerging fields, drowning forests, claiming them for the sea. She won so much land for her father's kingdom that [[Zeus]] became enraged and changed her into a monster. 

The myth has Charybdis lying on one side of a narrow channel of water. On the other side of the strait was [[Scylla]], another sea-monster. The two sides of the strait are within an arrow's range of each other, so close that sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis will pass too close to Scylla and vice versa. The idiom '[[between Scylla and Charybdis]]' has therefore come to mean being between two dangers, choosing either of which will bring harm. 

Traditionally, the location of Charybdis has been associated with the [[Strait of Messina]] off the [[coast]] of [[Sicily]] and opposite the rock on the Italian mainland identified with Scylla.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]]. ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=thuc.%204.24 4.24.5].&lt;/ref&gt; The vortex there is caused by the meeting of currents but is seldom dangerous.

==References in ancient literature==
===The Odyssey===
Throughout the [[Odyssey|poem]], Odysseus is hindered by the efforts of Poseidon and the sea monsters throughout the ocean. [[Odysseus]] faced both Charybdis and Scylla in [[Homer]]'s Odyssey while rowing through a narrow channel. He ordered his men to avoid Charybdis thus forcing them to pass near Scylla. This resulted in the deaths of six of his men. 

Later, stranded on a makeshift raft, Odysseus was swept back through the strait to face Scylla and Charybdis again. This time, Odysseus passed near Charybdis. His raft was sucked into Charybdis' maw, but Odysseus survived by clinging to a fig tree grown on the rock overhanging her lair. On the next outflow of water, his raft was expelled, and Odysseus was able to recover it and paddle away to safety.

===Jason and The Argonauts===
The [[Argonauts]] were able  to avoid both dangers because they were guided by [[Thetis]], one of the [[Nereids]]. 

===Aristotle's Meteorologica===
Aristotle tells a story of Aesop in conflict with a ferryman and relating to him a myth about Charybdis. She took one gulp of the sea and brought the mountains to view; after another islands appeared. The third will dry the sea altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Gert-Jan van Dijk, ''Ainoi, logoi, mythoi:
fables in archaic, classical, and Hellenistic Greek literature'', Brill NL 1997, pp.351-3; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QKQFJduPIdcC&amp;q=charybdis#v=snippet&amp;q=charybdis&amp;f=false available in Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ovid's Metamorphoses===
In Book VIII of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Scylla betrays her father and country in order to aid Minos, of whom she is enamoured; however Minos is disgusted by Scylla's treachery and sails away without her, provoking a damning diatribe insulting his parentage.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''hac quoque si prohibes et nos, ingrate, relinquis,''
''non genetrix Europa tibi est, sed inhospita Syrtis,''
''Armeniae tigres austroque agitata Charybdis.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(If you forbid me from here also and abandon me, you ungrateful one,
Europa is not mother to you, but the inhospitable Syrtis,
an Armenian tigress and Charybdis, whipped up by the south wind.)&lt;ref&gt;See Book 8.81-51 [http://etext.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/trans/Metamorph8.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Scylla of this story is to be differentiated from Scylla, the counter-part of Charybdis.

'''Carbon monoxide''' (CO), also called '''carbonous oxide''', is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas which is slightly lighter than air. It is highly toxic to humans and animals in higher quantities, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions.

Carbon monoxide consists of one [[carbon]] atom and one [[oxygen]] atom, connected by a triple bond which consists of two [[covalent bond]]s as well as one [[Dipolar bond|dative]] covalent bond. It is the simplest [[oxocarbon]]. In [[coordination complex]]es the carbon monoxide [[ligand]] is called [[carbonyl]].

Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of [[carbon]]-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), such as when operating a [[stove]] or an [[internal combustion engine]] in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/co/coh.htm Carbon Monoxide - Molecule of the Month], Dr Mike Thompson, Winchester College, UK&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal gas]], which was widely used before the 1960s for domestic lighting, cooking and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as [[blast furnace|iron smelting]], still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KQqLicqcTM8C&amp;pg=PA36|page=36|title=Crossing the Energy Divide: Moving from Fossil Fuel Dependence to a Clean-Energy Future|author=Robert U. Ayres, Edward H. Ayres|publisher=Wharton School Publishing|year=2009|isbn=0137015445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to photochemical reactions in the troposphere which generate about 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.176.4032.290|title=Carbon Monoxide Balance in Nature|year=1972|last1=Weinstock|first1=B.|last2=Niki|first2=H.|journal=Science|volume=176|pages=290|pmid=5019781|issue=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, and other forms of combustion.

In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide. Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/26/science/carbon-monoxide-gas-is-used-by-brain-cells-as-a-neurotransmitter.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times article. Accessed May 2, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]] and promoters of [[neovascular]] growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19486912|year=2009|last1=Li|first1=L|last2=Hsu|first2=A|last3=Moore|first3=PK|title=Actions and interactions of nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide in the cardiovascular system and in inflammation--a tale of three gases!|volume=123|issue=3|pages=386–400|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.005|journal=Pharmacology &amp; therapeutics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical trials of small amounts of carbon monoxide as a drug are on-going.

==History==
Carbon monoxide has been unknowingly used by humans since [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, for the [[iron metallurgy|smelting of iron]] and other metallic [[ore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pqt_DwrJcXIC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|title=Hot rolling of steel|author=William L. Roberts|publisher=CRC Press|year=1983|isbn=0824713451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gas was used for executions by the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in [[Classical Antiquity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumenthal&quot; /&gt; and was first described by the [[Spain|Spanish]] doctor [[Arnaldus de Villa Nova]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, the [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] de Lassone produced CO by heating [[zinc oxide]] with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was [[hydrogen]] as it burned with a blue flame. The gas was identified as a compound containing [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] by the Scottish chemist [[William Cumberland Cruikshank]] in the year 1800. Its toxic properties on dogs were thoroughly investigated by [[Claude Bernard]] around 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FvgNKPxb43IC&amp;pg=PA38|page=38|title=Molecules of death|author=Rosemary H. Waring, Glyn B. Steventon, Steve C. Mitchell|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|isbn=1860948146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], a gas mixture including carbon monoxide was used to keep [[motor vehicle]]s running in parts of the world where [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] was scarce. External (with few exceptions) charcoal or [[wood gas generator]]s were fitted, and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen, carbon monoxide and smaller amounts of other gasses produced by [[gasification]] was piped to a gas mixer. The gas mixture produced by this process is known as [[wood gas]]. Carbon monoxide was also reportedly used on a small scale during [[the Holocaust]] at some [[Extermination camps in the Holocaust|Nazi extermination camp]]s, most notably by [[gas van]]s in [[Chelmno extermination camp|Chelmno]], and in the [[Action T4]] &quot;[[euthanasia]]&quot; program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_04R6DoPxLoC&amp;pg=PT323|page=323|title=A history of modern Germany, 1800-2000|author=Martin Kitchen|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=1405100419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular properties==

Carbon monoxide has a [[molar mass]] of 28.0, which makes it slightly lighter than air, whose average molar mass is 28.8. According to the [[ideal gas law]], CO is therefore less dense than air. Neither gas is &quot;ideal&quot;, however, so the exact densities and other comparative values depend upon temperature and pressure.

The [[chemical bond|bond]] length between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is 112.8 [[picometre|pm]].&lt;ref name=gilliam&gt;{{Cite journal|author=O. R. Gilliam, C. M. Johnson and W. Gordy|title=Microwave Spectroscopy in the Region from Two to Three Millimeters|year=1950|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=78|issue=2|pages=140|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bond length is consistent with a triple bond, as in molecular [[nitrogen]]  (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which has a similar bond length and nearly the same [[molecular mass]]. Carbon-oxygen double bonds are significantly longer, 120.8 pm in [[formaldehyde]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9-39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boiling point (82 K) and melting point (68 K) are very similar to those of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (77 K and 63 K respectively). The bond dissociation energy of 1072 kJ/mol is stronger than that of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (942 kJ/mol) and represents the strongest chemical bond known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/bond_energies_lengths.html Common Bond Energies (D) and Bond Lengths (r)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ground state|ground]] [[electronic state]] of carbon monoxide is a [[singlet state]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpe.mpg.de/lab/CO/co.html Last accessed June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; since there are no unpaired electrons.

===Bonding and dipole moment===
Carbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 [[valence electron]]s in carbon monoxide. To satisfy the [[octet rule]] for the carbon, the two atoms form a [[triple bond]], with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one of the bonding orbitals is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or [[dipolar bond]]. This causes a [[Chemical polarity|polarization]] of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds, and a reverse polarization is produced by the greater [[electronegativity]] of oxygen, with a small negative charge on oxygen. In the free carbon monoxide, a net negative charge δ- remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small [[bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of 0.122 [[Debye|D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v94/i10/p6660_s1 | last1=Scuseria | first1=Gustavo E. | last2=Miller | first2=Michael D. | last3=Jensen | first3=Frank | last4=Geertsen | first4=Jan |title=The dipole moment of carbon monoxide|journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=94 |issue= 10 | pages=6660 |year=1991 |doi=10.1063/1.460293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen has more electron density, but also more positive charge. Because most electron density is located between the atoms, the molecule has a net positive charge on the oxygen end.
By contrast, the [[isoelectronic]] dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment.

If carbon monoxide acts as a [[Metal carbonyl|ligand]], the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end, depending on the structure of the [[coordination complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lupinetti | first1 = Anthony J. | last2 = Fau | first2 = Stefan | last3 = Frenking | first3 = Gernot | last4 = Strauss | first4 = Steven H. | title = Theoretical Analysis of the Bonding between CO and Positively Charged Atoms| journal =  J.

===Resonance structures and oxidation state===
[[File:Carbon Monoxide-2.svg|thumb|380px|[[Resonance (chemistry)|Resonance structures]] of carbon monoxide]]

Different (correct) [[Lewis structure]]s can be drawn for carbon monoxide. In the structure with three covalent bonds, the octet rule is satisfied, but the electropositive carbon has a negative [[formal charge]]. The structure with two covalent bonds would be consistent with the very low dipole moment of the molecule if the bonds were nonpolar. The structure with one covalent bond expresses the greater electronegativity of oxygen and the calculated net atomic charges. None of them do exactly meet the real electronic structure. Calculations with [[natural bond orbital]]s show that the structure with a [[triple bond]] is the most important Lewis structure (for the free molecule); this structure is the best approximation of the real distribution of electron density, with maximal occupation of [[bonding orbital]]s and [[lone pair]] orbitals.&lt;ref name=Stefan&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stefan | first1 = Thorsten | last2 = Janoschek | first2 = Rudolf | title = How relevant are S=O and P=O Double Bonds for the Description of the Acid Molecules H2SO3, H2SO4, and H3PO4, respectively? | journal= Journal of Molecular Modeling | volume =6 | issue=2 |month= February |year=2000 |pages=282–288 |doi=10.1007/PL00010730}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is in accordance with other theoretical and experimental studies which show that despite the greater electronegativity of oxygen the dipole moment points from the more negative carbon end to the more positive oxygen end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanco | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Alkorta | first2 = Ibon | last3 = Solimannejad | first3 = Mohammad | last4 = Elguero | first4 = Jose | title = Theoretical Study of the 1:1 Complexes between Carbon Monoxide and Hypohalous Acids | journal =  J.

The calculated polarization towards the oxygen atom is 71 % for the [[sigma bond|σ-bond]] and 77 % for both [[pi bond|π-bonds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stefan&quot; /&gt;
The [[oxidation state]] of carbon in carbon monoxide is +2 in each of these structures. It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen. Only the two non-bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon. In this count carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom.

===Toxicity {{Anchor|Toxicity}}===
&lt;!--Please keep this section short, there is no need to elaborate here. Details will be more useful in the [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] article.--&gt;
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}

[[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toxicology2002-omaye&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Omaye ST.| title=Metabolic modulation of carbon monoxide toxicity|journal=Toxicology|year=2002|pages=139–150|volume=180|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00387-6|pmid=12324190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, but highly toxic. It combines with [[hemoglobin]] to produce [[carboxyhemoglobin]], which is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues. Concentrations as low as 667 [[Parts per notation|ppm]] may cause up to 50% of the body's hemoglobin to convert to carboxyhemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=1592720|year=1992|last1=Tikuisis|first1=P|last2=Kane|first2=DM|last3=McLellan|first3=TM|last4=Buick|first4=F|last5=Fairburn|first5=SM|title=Rate of formation of carboxyhemoglobin in exercising humans exposed to carbon monoxide.|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1311–9|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A level of 50% carboxyhemoglobin may result in seizure, coma, and fatality. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] limits long-term workplace exposure levels above 50 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=OSHA CO guidlines|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/carbonmonoxide/recognition.html|publisher=OSHA|accessdate=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and a feeling of weakness.

===Normal human physiology===
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a [[signaling molecule]].

===Atmospheric presence===
[[Image:Mopitt first year carbon monoxide.jpg|thumb|240px|[[MOPITT]] 2000 global carbon monoxide.]]

Carbon monoxide is present in small amounts in the atmosphere, chiefly as a product of [[volcano|volcanic activity]] but also from natural and man-made fires (such as [[forest fires|forest]] and [[bushfire]]s, burning of [[crop residue]]s, and [[sugarcane]] fire-cleaning). The burning of [[fossil fuels]] also contributes to carbon monoxide production. Carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high [[pressure]]s in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kcllhZcy53cC&amp;pg=PA243|page=243|title=Metal-Carbon Bonds in Enzymes and Cofactors|author=Astrid Sigel, Roland K. O. Sigel|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2009|isbn=1847559158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is extremely difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.

Carbon monoxide has an indirect radiative forcing effect by elevating concentrations of [[methane]] and [[troposphere|tropospheric]] [[ozone]] through chemical reactions with other atmospheric constituents (e.g., the [[hydroxyl]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], OH&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) that would otherwise destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gnaNHeU4rgQC&amp;pg=PA106|page=106|title=Global climate change linkages: acid rain, air quality, and stratospheric ozone|author=James Carrick White ''et al.''|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=0444015159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]]. Carbon monoxide concentrations are both short-lived in the atmosphere and spatially variable.

===Urban pollution===
Carbon monoxide is a major atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc.), but also from improper burning of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).

====Role in ground level Ozone levels====
{{Main|Tropospheric Ozone}}
Carbon monoxide is part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form [[Photochemical smog]]. Along with [[aldehydes]], it reacts photochemically to produce [[peroxy]] radicals. Peroxy radicals subsequently oxidize [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO) to [[nitrogen dioxide]](NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;NA&quot; /&gt; Although this creation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical step leading to low level [[ozone]] formation, it also increases this ozone in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QkErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|page=23|title=Ozone and other photochemical oxidants|publisher=National Academies|year=1977|isbn=0309025311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Simplified, the net effect of the ozone cycle is:
::CO + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Indoor pollution===
In closed environments the concentration of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels. On average, 170 people in the United States die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non-automotive consumer products.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpsc&quot;&gt;U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission, [http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/466.html Carbon Monoxide Questions and Answers], accessed 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Florida Department of Health, &quot;every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the U.S. require emergency medical care for non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning&quot; &lt;ref&gt;(http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html)&lt;/ref&gt; These products include malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters and [[gas heater|gas]] and [[kerosene heater|kerosene]] room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable generators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported 15,769 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in 39 deaths in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/NPDSPoisonData/AnnualReports/tabid/125/Default.aspx American Association of Poison Control Centers 2007 Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the CPSC reported 94 generator-related carbon monoxide poisoning deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpsc&quot; /&gt; Forty-seven of these deaths were known to have occurred during power outages due to severe weather, including [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cpsc&quot; /&gt; Still others die from carbon monoxide produced by non-consumer products, such as cars left running in attached garages. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimates that several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms every year to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, [http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showCarbonMonoxideLanding.action Carbon Monoxide Poisoning], accessed 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon monoxide is also a minor constituent of [[tobacco]] smoke.

==Production==
Many methods have been developed for carbon monoxide's production.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. &quot;Inorganic Chemistry&quot; Academic Press: San Diego, 200. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial production===
A major industrial source of CO is [[producer gas]], a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. The initially produced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon to give CO is described as the [[Boudouard reaction|Boudouard equilibrium]]. Above 800 °C, CO is the predominant product:

:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → 2 CO (ΔH = −221 kJ/mol)

Another source is &quot;[[water gas]]&quot;, a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of [[steam]] and carbon:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + C → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO (ΔH = +131 kJ/mol)

Other similar &quot;[[syngas|synthesis gas]]es&quot; can be obtained from [[natural gas]] and other fuels.

Carbon monoxide is also is a byproduct of the reduction of metal [[oxide ore]]s with carbon, shown in a simplified form as follows:

:MO + C → M + CO

Since CO is a gas, the reduction process can be driven by heating, exploiting the positive (favorable) [[entropy]] of reaction. The [[Ellingham diagram]] shows that CO formation is favored over CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in high temperatures.

===Laboratory preparation===
Carbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[formic acid]], for example with [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;koch&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name
=&quot;coleman&quot; /&gt; Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered [[zinc]] metal and [[calcium carbonate]], which releases CO and leaves behind [[zinc oxide]] and [[calcium oxide]]:

:Zn + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → ZnO + CaO + CO

==Coordination chemistry==
{{Main|metal carbonyl}}

[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-HOMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO]] of CO is a σ [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]
[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-LUMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|LUMO]] of CO is a π*[[antibonding]] [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]

Most metals form [[coordination complex]]es containing covalently attached carbon monoxide. Only metals in lower oxidation states will complex  with carbon monoxide [[ligands]]. This is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate back donation from the metal d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital, to the π*[[molecular orbital]] from CO. The lone pair on the carbon atom in CO, also donates electron density to the d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; on the metal to form a [[sigma bond]]. In [[nickel carbonyl]], Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and [[nickel]] metal at room temperature. For this reason, nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide (corrosion). [[Nickel carbonyl]] decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces, and this method is used for the industrial purification of [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Mond L, Langer K, Quincke F| title= Action of carbon monoxide on nickel| journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|year=1890| pages=749–753|doi = 10.1039/CT8905700749| volume= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls, the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal; the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal. In these situations, carbon monoxide is called the '''carbonyl''' [[ligand]]. One of the most important metal carbonyls is [[iron pentacarbonyl]], Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:

[[Image:IronPentacarbonylStructure.png|150px|Structure of iron pentacarbonyl.]]
[[Image:Iron-pentacarbonyl-3D-balls.png|120px|Iron pentacarbonyl.]]

Many metal-CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents, not from CO. For instance, [[iridium(III) chloride|iridium trichloride]] and [[triphenylphosphine]] react in boiling [[2-Methoxyethanol|2-methoxyethanol]] or [[dimethylformamide|DMF]]) to afford [[Vaska's complex|IrCl(CO)(PPh&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;]].

==Organic and main group chemistry==
In the presence of strong acids and water, carbon monoxide reacts with [[alkenes]] to form [[carboxylic acids]] in a process known as the Koch-Haaf reaction.&lt;ref name = koch&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Koch, H.; Haaf, W.|title=1-Adamantanecarboxylic Acid|year=1973|collvol=5|collvolpages=20|prep=cv5p0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gattermann-Koch reaction]], [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|arenes]] are converted to [[benzaldehyde]] derivatives in the presence of [[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]].&lt;ref name = coleman&gt;{{OrgSynth|title=''p''-Tolualdehyde|author=G. H. Coleman, David Craig|collvol=2|collvolpages=583|year=1943|prep=cv2p0583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organolithium compounds (e.g. [[butyl lithium]]) react with carbon monoxide, but these reactions have little scientific use.

Although CO reacts with [[carbocation]]s and [[carbanion]]s, it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;Chatani, N.; Murai, S. &quot;Carbon Monoxide&quot; in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{doi|10.1002/047084289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With main group reagents, CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions. [[Chlorination]] of CO is the industrial route to the important compound [[phosgene]]. With [[borane]] CO forms an adduct, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BCO, which is [[isoelectronic]] with the [[acylium]] cation [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. CO reacts with [[sodium]] to give products resulting from C-C coupling such as [[acetylenediol|sodium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|Na|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}. It reacts with molten [[potassium]] to give a mixture of an organometallic compound, [[acetylenediol|potassium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|K|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}, [[benzenehexol|potassium benzenehexolate]] 6{{chem|K|+}} {{chem|C|6|O|6|6-}},&lt;ref name=&quot;wbuechIV&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Büchner | first1 = W. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = E. | title = Zur Kenntnis der sogenannten «Alkalicarbonyle» IV[1] Über die Reaktion von geschmolzenem Kalium mit Kohlenmonoxid | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume =47 |issue =6 |pages =1415–1423 | year = 1964 |doi=10.1002/hlca.19640470604}}

The compounds [[cyclohexanehexone]] or triquinoyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cyclopentanepentone]] or leuconic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts, can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide.

At pressures of over 5 [[pascal (unit)|gigapascals]], carbon monoxide [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] into carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a solid polymer of carbon and oxygen, in 3:2 atomic ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150659a007|title=New phases and chemical reactions in solid carbon monoxide under pressure|year=1984|last1=Katz|first1=Allen I.|last2=Schiferl|first2=David|last3=Mills|first3=Robert L.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=88|pages=3176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/cm0524446|title=Pressure-Induced Polymerization of Carbon Monoxide: Disproportionation and Synthesis of an Energetic Lactonic Polymer|year=2006|last1=Evans|first1=W.

==Uses==
===Chemical industry===
Carbon monoxide is an [[industrial gas]] that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Elschenbroich, C.;Salzer, A. ”Organometallics : A Concise Introduction” (2nd Ed) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2006. ISBN 3-527-28165-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Large quantities of [[aldehydes]] are produced by the [[hydroformylation]] reaction of [[alkene]]s, carbon monoxide, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hydroformylation is coupled to the [[Shell Higher Olefin Process]] to give precursors to [[detergent]]s. [[Methanol]] is produced by the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide. In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C-C bond formation, as in the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This technology allows [[coal]] or biomass to be converted to diesel.

In the [[Monsanto process]], carbon monoxide and [[methanol]] react in the presence of a homogeneous [[rhodium]] [[catalyst]] and [[hydroiodic acid]] to give [[acetic acid]]. This process is responsible for most of the industrial production of [[acetic acid]].

An industrial scale use for pure carbon monoxide is purifying [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].

===Meat coloring===
Carbon monoxide is used in [[modified atmosphere]] packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with [[myoglobin]] to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright cherry red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment, [[metmyoglobin]]. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meatsci1999_SORHEIM&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sorheim, S, Nissena, H, Nesbakken, T|title=The storage life of beef and pork packaged in an atmosphere with low carbon monoxide and high carbon dioxide|journal=Journal of Meat Science|year=1999|pages=157–164|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0309-1740(98)00163-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.

The technology was first given &quot;[[generally recognized as safe]]&quot; (GRAS) status by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2002 for use as a secondary packaging system, and does not require labeling.

===Medicine===
In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; as well as one of three gasses which naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]] and encouragers of [[neovascular]] growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from ''wet'' [[macular degeneration]], a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.

There is a theory that in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] which is activated by carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt;

Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties could potentially be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|agency=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{No footnotes|date=August 2010}}
A '''conjecture''' is a [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]] that is [[Formal proof|unproven]] but is believed to be true and has not been disproven. [[Karl Popper]] pioneered the use of the term &quot;conjecture&quot; in [[scientific philosophy]]. Conjecture is contrasted by [[hypothesis]] (hence ''[[theory]], [[axiom]], [[principle]]''), which is a testable statement based on accepted grounds. In [[mathematics]], a conjecture is an unproven [[proposition]] or [[theorem]] that appears correct.

==Famous conjectures==
One famous conjecture was [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The conjecture taunted mathematicians for over three centuries before [[Andrew Wiles]], a [[Princeton University]] research mathematician finally proved it in 1995, and now it may properly be called a theorem.

Other famous conjectures include:

* The [[abc conjecture]]
* [[P versus NP problem|'''P''' ≠ '''NP''']]
* The [[Collatz conjecture]]
* [[Beal's conjecture]]
* The [[Poincaré theorem]]  (proven by [[Grigori Perelman]])
* The [[Goldbach's conjecture]]
The [[Langlands program]] is a far-reaching web of these ideas  of '[[unifying conjecture]]s' that link different subfields of mathematics, e.g. [[number theory]] and the [[representation theory]] of [[Lie group]]s; some of these conjectures have since been proved.

==Counterexamples==

Formal mathematics is based on ''provable'' truth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single [[counterexample]] would immediately bring down the conjecture. Conjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as ''false conjectures'' (cf. [[Pólya conjecture]]).

Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended a given search farther than previously done.  For instance, the [[Collatz conjecture]], which concerns whether or not certain [[sequence]]s of [[integer]]s terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (over a million millions).  In practice, however, it is extremely rare for this type of work to yield a counterexample and such efforts are generally regarded{{By whom|date=June 2010}} as mere displays of [[computational science|computing power]], rather than meaningful contributions to formal mathematics.

==Use of conjectures in conditional proofs==

Sometimes a conjecture is called a ''hypothesis'' when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is a conjecture from [[number theory]] that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of [[prime number]]s. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true (it is said that [[Atle Selberg]] was once a sceptic, and [[J. E. Littlewood]] always was). In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called ''[[conditional proof]]s'': the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.

These &quot;proofs&quot;, however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.

==Undecidable conjectures==

Not every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The [[continuum hypothesis]], which tries to ascertain the relative [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of certain [[infinite set]]s, was eventually shown to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] (or independent) from the generally accepted set of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel axiom|axioms of set theory]]. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new [[axiom]] in a consistent manner (much as we can take [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] as either true or false).

In this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that ''doesn't'' require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in [[Euclidean geometry]] be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. no parallel postulate.) The one major exception to this in practice is the [[axiom of choice]]—unless studying this axiom in particular, the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice.

'''Claudius''' ([[Latin]]: Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Claudius' name would be inscribed as &lt;small&gt;TIBERIVS CLAVDIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October 54), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 41 to 54. A member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], he was the son of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor]]. He was born at [[Lugdunum]] in [[Gaul]] and was the first emperor to be born outside [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]]. Afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his [[consul]]ship with his nephew [[Caligula]] in 37. Claudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of [[Tiberius]]' and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]] after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last adult male of his family. 

Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the empire. During his reign the empire conquered [[Roman Thrace|Thrace]], [[Noricum]], [[Pamphylia]], [[Lycia]] and [[Judaea Province|Judaea]], and began the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]]. He took a personal interest in law, presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. However, he was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many [[Roman Senator|senators]]. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. After his death in 54, his grand-nephew and adopted son [[Nero]] succeeded him as emperor.

==Family and early life==
{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}
Claudius was born on 1 August 10 BC in [[Lugdunum]] to [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]] on the day of the dedication of the altar to [[Augustus]] at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]]. He had two older siblings named [[Germanicus]] and [[Livilla]]. Antonia may have had two other children who died young. His maternal grandparents were [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], [[Augustus]]' sister, therefore the great-great grandnephew of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Livia]], Augustus' third wife, and [[Tiberius Nero|Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. During his reign, Claudius revived the rumor that his father Drusus was actually the illegitimate son of Augustus, to give the false appearance that Augustus was Claudius' paternal grandfather.

In 9 BC, Drusus unexpectedly died on campaign in Germania, possibly from illness. Claudius was then left to be raised by his mother, who never remarried. When Claudius' disability became evident, the relationship with his family turned sour. Antonia referred to him as a monster, and used him as a standard for stupidity. She seems to have passed her son off on his grandmother Livia for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Dio ''Hist.'' LX 2&lt;/ref&gt; Livia was little kinder, and often sent him short, angry letters of reproof. He was put under the care of a &quot;former mule-driver&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 2. Suet ''Claud.'' 4 indicates the reasons for choosing this tutor, as outlined in Leon (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; to keep him disciplined, under the logic that his condition was due to laziness and a lack of will-power. However, by the time he reached his teenage years his symptoms apparently waned and his family took some notice of his scholarly interests. In 7, [[Livy]] was hired to tutor him in history, with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus. He spent a lot of his time with the latter and the philosopher [[Athenodoros Cananites|Athenodorus]]. Augustus, according to a letter, was surprised at the clarity of Claudius' oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Expectations about his future began to increase.

Ironically, it was his work as a budding [[historian]] that destroyed his early career. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, Claudius began work on a history of the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]] that was either too truthful or too critical of Octavian.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have proved to them that Claudius was not fit for public office. He could not be trusted to toe the existing party line. When he returned to the narrative later in life, Claudius skipped over the wars of the second triumvirate altogether. But the damage was done, and his family pushed him to the background. When the [[Triumphal arch|Arch]] of [[Pavia]] was erected to honor the imperial clan in 8, Claudius' name (now Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus after his elevation to [[paterfamilias]] of Claudii Nerones on the adoption of his brother) was inscribed on the edge—past the deceased princes, [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and Germanicus' children. There is some speculation that the inscription was added by Claudius himself decades later, and that he originally did not appear at all.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A Roman Emperor AD41 detail.jpg|thumb|Gratus proclaims Claudius emperor. Detail from ''A Roman Emperor 41AD'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]. Oil on canvas, c. 1871.]]
When Augustus died in 14, Claudius — then 23 — appealed to his uncle [[Tiberius]] to allow him to begin the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. Tiberius, the new emperor, responded by granting Claudius consular ornaments. Claudius requested office once more and was snubbed. Since the new emperor was not any more generous than the old, Claudius gave up hope of public office and retired to a scholarly, private life.

Despite the disdain of the imperial family, it seems that from very early on the general public respected Claudius. At Augustus' death, the ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'', or knights, chose Claudius to head their delegation. When his house burned down, the Senate demanded it be rebuilt at public expense. They also requested that Claudius be allowed to debate in the senate. Tiberius turned down both motions, but the sentiment remained. During the period immediately after the death of Tiberius' son, [[Julius Caesar Drusus|Drusus]], Claudius was pushed by some quarters as a potential heir. This again suggests the political nature of his exclusion from public life. However, as this was also the period during which the power and terror of the Praetorian [[Sejanus]] was at its peak, Claudius chose to downplay this possibility.

After the death of Tiberius the new emperor [[Caligula]] (the son of Claudius' brother [[Germanicus]]) recognized Claudius to be of some use. He appointed Claudius his co-consul in 37 in order to emphasize the memory of Caligula's deceased father Germanicus. Despite this, Caligula relentlessly tormented his uncle: playing practical jokes, charging him enormous sums of money, humiliating him before the Senate, and the like. According to [[Cassius Dio]] Claudius became very sickly and thin by the end of Caligula's reign, most likely due to stress.&lt;ref&gt;Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2. Suhr (1955) suggests that this must refer to before Claudius came to power.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible surviving portrait of Claudius from this period may support this.

===Assassination of Caligula===
On 24 January, 41, Caligula was assassinated in a broad-based [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] involving the Praetorian commander [[Cassius Chaerea]] and several [[Roman Senate|Senators]]. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the [[assassination]], although it has been argued that he knew about the plot — particularly since he left the scene of the crime shortly before his nephew was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Major (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the deaths of [[Milonia Caesonia|Caligula's wife]] and [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|daughter]], it became apparent that Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the imperial family. In the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the [[Germany|German]] guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including many of his friends. He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named Gratus found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him [[princeps]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Antiquitates Iudiacae'' XIX. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#1 LX 1.3]&lt;/ref&gt; A section of the guard may have planned in advance to seek out Claudius, perhaps with his approval. They reassured him that they were not one of the battalions looking for revenge. He was spirited away to the Praetorian camp and put under their protection.

[[File:Herold of Chalcis coin showing Herod of Chalcis with brother Agrippa of Judaea crowning Roman Emperor Claudius I.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Herod of Chalcis]], showing Herod of Chalcis with brother [[Herod Agrippa I|Agrippa of Judaea]] crowning Roman Emperor Claudius I. [[British Museum]].]]
The Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government, but this eventually devolved into an argument over which of them would be the new [[Princeps]]. When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval, but he refused, sensing the danger that would come with complying. Some historians, particularly [[Josephus]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the [[Iudaea Province|Judean]] King [[Herod Agrippa]]. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Bellum Iudiacum'' II, 204–233.&lt;/ref&gt; — so it is not known how large a hand he had in things. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.

[[Image:Claudiuspax.jpg|thumb|Claudius issued this [[denarius]] type to emphasize his [[clemency]] after Caligula's assassination. The depiction of the goddess [[Pax-Nemesis]], representing subdued vengeance, would be used on the coins of many later emperors.]]

==As emperor==
Claudius took several steps to legitimize his rule against potential usurpers, most of them emphasizing his place within the Julio-Claudian family. He adopted the name &quot;Caesar&quot; as a [[cognomen]] — the name still carried great weight with the populace. In order to do so, he dropped the cognomen &quot;Nero&quot; which he had adopted as paterfamilias of the Claudii Nerones when his brother Germanicus was adopted out. While he had never been adopted by Augustus or his successors, he was the grandson of Octavia, and so felt he had the right. He also adopted the name &quot;Augustus&quot; as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific &quot;Germanicus&quot; in order to display the connection with his heroic brother. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia in order to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term &quot;filius Drusi&quot; (son of Drusus) in his titles, in order to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.

Because he was proclaimed emperor on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate — the first emperor thus proclaimed — Claudius' repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]). Moreover, he was the first Emperor who resorted to [[bribery]] as a means to secure army loyalty. Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their [[will (law)|wills]], and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, however, issuing coins with tributes to the praetorians in the early part of his reign.

===Expansion of the empire===
Under Claudius, the empire underwent its first major expansion since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of [[Thrace]], [[Noricum]], [[Pamphylia]], [[Lycia]], and [[Judea]] were [[annexation|annexed]] under various circumstances during his term. The annexation of [[Mauretania]], begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, and the official division of the former client kingdom into two imperial provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny 5.1–5.2, Cassius Dio, 60.8, 60.9&lt;/ref&gt; The most far-reaching conquest was the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britannia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, Chap. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 43, Claudius sent [[Aulus Plautius]] with four [[Roman legion|legions]] to Britain (''Britannia'') after an appeal from an ousted tribal ally. Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its material wealth — particularly mines and [[slavery|slaves]]. It was also a haven for [[Gaul|Gallic]] rebels and the like, and so could not be left alone much longer. Claudius himself travelled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements and elephants. The latter must have made an impression on the [[British people|Britons]] when they were used in the capture of [[Camulodunum]]. He left after 16 days, but remained in the provinces for some time. The Senate granted him a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for his efforts, as only members of the imperial family were allowed such honours. Claudius later lifted this restriction for some of his conquering generals. He was granted the honorific &quot;Britannicus&quot; but only accepted it on behalf of his son, never using the title himself. When the British general [[Caractacus]] was captured in 50, Claudius granted him [[clemency]]. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.

Claudius conducted a [[census]] in 48 that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens,&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, Chap. 7, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]]. These colonies were often made out of existing communities, especially those with elites who could rally the populace to the Roman cause. Several colonies were placed in new provinces or on the border of the empire in order to secure Roman holdings as quickly as possible.

===Judicial and legislative affairs===
[[Image:Claudius sestertius spes.jpg|thumb|Roman [[sestertius]] struck under Claudius. The reverse depicts [[Spes]] Augusta (Hope). Coins of this type were first issued to commemorate the birth of Claudius' son [[Britannicus]] in 41.]]
Claudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 15. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system. He extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 in order to ensure a more experienced jury pool.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of [[Rhodes]] from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted [[Troy]] from taxes. Early in his reign, the [[Greeks]] and [[Jews]] of [[Alexandria]] sent him two embassies at once after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous &quot;Letter to the Alexandrians&quot;, which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but also forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to [[Josephus]], he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the Jews in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX, 287.&lt;/ref&gt; An investigator of Claudius' discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the modern city of [[Trento]] were not in fact citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor issued a declaration that they would be considered to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be impersonating equestrians were sold back into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius' reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. Two famous medical examples are one promoting [[Taxus baccata|Yew]] juice as a cure for snakebite,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 16&lt;/ref&gt; and another promoting public flatulence for good health.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 32&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the [[Tiber Island|temple of Aesculapius]] to die, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take the risk were liable to be charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#25 Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 51 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works===
Claudius embarked on many public works throughout his reign, both in the capital and in the provinces. He built two [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], the [[Aqua Claudia]], begun by [[Caligula]], and the [[Anio Novus]]. These entered the city in 52 and met at the famous [[Porta Maggiore]]. He also restored a third, the [[Aqua Virgo]].
[[Image:Porta Maggiore 030106.JPG|left|thumb|The Porta Maggiore in Rome]]

He paid special attention to transportation. Throughout [[Italy]] and the provinces he built roads and canals. Among these was a large canal leading from the [[Rhine]] to the sea, as well as a road from Italy to Germany — both begun by his father, Drusus. Closer to Rome, he built a navigable canal on the [[Tiber]], leading to [[Portus]], his new port just north of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]. This port was constructed in a semicircle with two [[Mole (architecture)|moles]] and a lighthouse at its mouth. The construction also had the effect of reducing flooding in Rome.

The port at Ostia was part of Claudius' solution to the constant grain shortages that occurred in winter, after the Roman shipping season. The other part of his solution was to insure the ships of grain merchants who were willing to risk traveling to Egypt in the off-season. He also granted their sailors special privileges, including citizenship and exemption from the [[Lex Papia Poppaea|Lex Papia-Poppaea]], a law that regulated marriage. In addition, he repealed the taxes that [[Caligula]] had instituted on food, and further reduced taxes on communities suffering [[drought]] or [[famine]].

The last part of Claudius' plan was to increase the amount of arable land in Italy. This was to be achieved by draining the [[Fucine lake]], which would have the added benefit of making the nearby river navigable year-round.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus ''Ann.'' XII 57&lt;/ref&gt; A tunnel was dug through the lake bed, but the plan was a failure. The tunnel was crooked and not large enough to carry the water, which caused it to back up when opened. The resultant flood washed out a large gladiatorial exhibition held to commemorate the opening, causing Claudius to run for his life along with the other spectators. The draining of the lake was revisited many times in history, including by emperors [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. It was finally achieved by the Prince [[Torlonia]] in the 19th century, producing over {{convert|160000|acre|km2}} of new arable land.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 9, pp. 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the Claudian tunnel to three times its original size.

===Claudius and the Senate===
Because of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the emperor sat among the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as Holder of the Power of [[Tribune]] (The emperor could not officially serve as a Tribune of the Plebes as he was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]], but it was a power taken by previous rulers). He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including [[Imperator]]) at the beginning of his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also put the imperial provinces of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] back under Senate control.

Claudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:

{{quote|If you accept these proposals, Conscript Fathers, say so at once and simply, in accordance with your convictions. If you do not accept them, find alternatives, but do so here and now; or if you wish to take time for consideration, take it, provided you do not forget that you must be ready to pronounce your opinion whenever you may be summoned to meet. It ill befits the dignity of the Senate that the consul designate should repeat the phrases of the consuls word for word as his opinion, and that every one else should merely say 'I approve', and that then, after leaving, the assembly should announce 'We debated'.&lt;ref&gt;English translation of Berlin papyrus by W.D. Hogarth, in Momigliano (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Claudius EXSC PP OBCIVES.jpg|thumb|Roman [[sestertius]] issued during Claudius' reign. The reverse reads &quot;EX SC PP OB CIVES SERVATOS&quot;, meaning &quot;Senatus Consulto&quot; (approved by the Senate), &quot;Pater Patriae&quot; (to the father of his country), &quot;Ob Cives Servatos&quot; (For having saved the citizens).]]

In 47 he assumed the office of ''[[Censor (ancient Rome)|Censor]]'' with [[Lucius Vitellius]], which had been allowed to lapse for some time. He struck the names of many senators and equites who no longer met qualifications, but showed respect by allowing them to resign in advance. At the same time, he sought to admit eligible men from the provinces. The [[Lyon Tablet]] preserves his speech on the admittance of Gallic senators, in which he addresses the Senate with reverence but also with criticism for their disdain of these men. He also increased the number of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]]s by adding new families to the dwindling number of noble lines. Here he followed the precedent of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and [[Julius Caesar]].

Nevertheless, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius was forced to reduce the Senate's power for efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an imperial [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to imperial appointees and freedmen. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the emperor.

Several [[coup]] attempts were made during Claudius' reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. [[Appius Silanus]] was executed early in Claudius' reign under questionable circumstances. Shortly after, a large rebellion was undertaken by the Senator Vinicianus and [[Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus|Scribonianus]], the governor of [[Dalmatia]] and gained quite a few senatorial supporters. It ultimately failed because of the reluctance of Scribonianus' troops, and the [[suicide]] of the main conspirators. Many other senators tried different conspiracies and were condemned. Claudius' son-in-law [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Claudia Antonia's first husband)|Pompeius Magnus]] was executed for his part in a conspiracy with his father Crassus Frugi. Another plot involved the consulars Lusiius Saturninus, Cornelius Lupus, and Pompeius Pedo. In 46, [[Asinius Gallus]], the grandson of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], and [[Statilius Corvinus]] were exiled for a plot hatched with several of Claudius' own freedmen. [[Valerius Asiaticus]] was executed without public trial for unknown reasons. The ancient sources say the charge was [[adultery]], and that Claudius was tricked into issuing the punishment. However, Claudius singles out Asiaticus for special damnation in his speech on the Gauls, which dates over a year later, suggesting that the charge must have been much more serious. Asiaticus had been a claimant to the throne in the chaos following Caligula's death and a co-consul with the Statilius Corvinus mentioned above. Most of these conspiracies took place before Claudius' term as [[Censor (ancient Rome)|Censor]], and may have induced him to review the Senatorial rolls. The conspiracy of [[Gaius Silius]] in the year after his Censorship, 48, is detailed in the section discussing Claudius' third wife, [[Messalina]]. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius' reign.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, the necessary responses to these conspiracies could not have helped Senate-emperor relations.

===The Secretariat and centralization of powers===
Claudius was hardly the first emperor to use [[Freedman|freedmen]] to help with the day-to-day running of the empire. He was, however, forced to increase their role as the powers of the [[Princeps]] became more centralized and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.

The secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedman. [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] was the secretary of correspondence. [[Pallas (freedman)|Pallas]] became the secretary of the treasury. [[Gaius Julius Callistus|Callistus]] became secretary of justice. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under [[Polybius (freedman)|Polybius]] until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for the emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius' stead before the conquest of Britain. Since these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being placed in the hands of former slaves. If freedmen had total control of money, letters, and law, it seemed it would not be hard for them to manipulate the emperor. This is exactly the accusation put forth by the ancient sources. However, these same sources admit that the freedmen were loyal to Claudius.&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 65. Seneca ''Ad Polybium.''&lt;/ref&gt; He was similarly appreciative of them and gave them due credit for policies where he had used their advice. However, if they showed treasonous inclinations, the emperor did punish them with just force, as in the case of Polybius and Pallas' brother, [[Antonius Felix|Felix]]. There is no evidence that the character of Claudius' policies and edicts changed with the rise and fall of the various freedmen, suggesting that he was firmly in control throughout.

Regardless of the extent of their political power, the freedmen did manage to amass wealth through their positions. [[Pliny the Elder]] notes that several of them were richer than [[Crassus]], the richest man of the [[Republicanism|Republican]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Natural History'' 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious reforms===
Claudius, as the author of a treatise on Augustus' religious reforms, felt himself in a good position to institute some of his own. He had strong opinions about the proper form for state religion. He refused the request of Alexandrian Greeks to dedicate a temple to his divinity, saying that only gods may choose new gods. He restored lost days to festivals and got rid of many extraneous celebrations added by Caligula. He reinstituted old observances and archaic language. Claudius was concerned with the spread of eastern mysteries within the city and searched for more Roman replacements. He emphasized the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] which had been practiced by so many during the Republic. He expelled foreign astrologers, and at the same time rehabilitated the old Roman soothsayers (known as [[haruspices]]) as a replacement. He was especially hard on [[Druidism]], because of its incompatibility with the Roman state religion and its [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] activities. It is also reported that at one time he expelled the Jews from Rome, probably because the appearance of Christianity had caused unrest within the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;There is some debate about what actually happened. It is reported by Suetonius and in Acts (18:2), Cassius Dio minimizes the event and Josephus—who was reporting on Jewish events—does not mention it at all. Some scholars hold that it didn't happen, while others have only a few missionaries expelled for the short term.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius opposed proselytizing in any religion, even in those regions where he allowed natives to worship freely. The results of all these efforts were recognized even by Seneca, who has an ancient Latin god defend Claudius in his satire.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca ''Apocolo.'' 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public games and entertainments===
According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Claud. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius also presided over many new and original events. Soon after coming into power, Claudius instituted games to be held in honor of his father on the latter's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Claud. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Annual games were also held in honor of his accession, and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;&gt;Suet. Claud. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius performed the [[Secular games]], marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Augustus had performed the same games less than a century prior. Augustus' excuse was that the interval for the games was 110 years, not 100, but his date actually did not qualify under either reasoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt; Claudius also presented naval battles to mark the attempted draining of the Fucine lake, as well as many other public games and shows.

At Ostia, in front of a crowd of spectators, Claudius fought a [[killer whale]] which was trapped in the harbor. The event was witnessed by [[Pliny the Elder]]:

{{quote|A killer whale was actually seen in the harbor of Ostia, locked in combat with the emperor Claudius. She had come when he was completing the construction of the harbor, drawn there by the wreck of a ship bringing leather hides from Gaul, and feeding there over a number of days, had made a furrow in the shallows: the waves had raised up such a mound of sand that she couldn't turn around at all, and while she was pursuing her banquet as the waves moved it shorewards, her back stuck up out of the water like the overturned keel of a boat. The emperor ordered that a large array of nets be stretched across the mouths of the harbor, and setting out in person with the [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian]] cohorts gave a show to the Roman people, soldiers showering lances from attacking ships, one of which I saw swamped by the beast's waterspout and sunk. — &quot;''Historia Naturalis''&quot; IX.14–15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostia-antica.org/~atexts/plinsen.htm Translation of] Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Claudius also restored and adorned many of the venues around Rome. The old wooden barriers of the Circus Maximus were replaced with ones made of gold-ornamented marble.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt; A new section of the Circus was designated for seating the senators, who previously had sat among the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt; Claudius rebuilt Pompey's Theater after it had been destroyed by fire, throwing special fights at the rededication which he observed from a special platform in the orchestra box.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suet&quot;/&gt;

==Death, deification and reputation==
[[File:Gold coin of Claudius 50 51 excavated in South India.jpg|thumb|Gold coin of Claudius (50-51) excavated in [[South India]], an example of [[Indo-Roman trade]] during the period.]]
The consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison — possibly contained in mushrooms or on a feather — and died in the early hours of 13 October 54. Accounts vary greatly. Some claim Claudius was in Rome&lt;ref name=Suet44&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 44&lt;/ref&gt; while others claim he was in [[Sinuessa]].&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 66&lt;/ref&gt; Some implicate either [[Halotus]], his taster, [[Gaius Stertinius Xenophon|Xenophon]], his doctor, or the infamous poisoner [[Locusta]] as the administrator of the fatal substance.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of his death: Suet. ''Claud.'' 43, 44. Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 64, 66–67. Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XX 148, 151. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 34. Pliny ''Natural History'' II 92, XI 189, XXII 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Some say he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at dinner, and some have him recovering only to be poisoned again.&lt;ref name=Suet44/&gt; Nearly all implicate his final wife, [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], as the instigator. Agrippina and Claudius had become more combative in the months leading up to his death. This carried on to the point where Claudius openly lamented his bad wives, and began to comment on Britannicus' approaching manhood with an eye towards restoring his status within the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 43&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.

In modern times, some authors have cast doubt on whether Claudius was murdered or merely succumbed to illness or old age.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) pp. 92–93 says that tradition makes every emperor the victim of foul play, so we can't know if Claudius was truly murdered. Levick (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77. raises the possibility that Claudius was killed by the stress of fighting with Agrippina over the succession, but concludes that the timing makes murder the most likely cause.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars claim the universality of the accusations in ancient texts lends credence to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1990); also as opposed to the murder of Augustus, which is only found in Tacitus and Dio where he quotes Tacitus. Suetonius, an inveterate gossip, doesn't mention it at all.&lt;/ref&gt; But history in those days could not be objectively collected or written, so sometimes amounted to committing whispered gossip to parchment, often years after the events, when the writer was no longer in danger of arrest. Claudius' ashes were interred in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] on 24 October, after a funeral in the manner of Augustus.

Claudius was deified by Nero and the Senate almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Nero'' 9&lt;/ref&gt; Those who regard this homage as cynical should note that, cynical or not, such a move would hardly have benefited those involved, had Claudius been &quot;hated&quot;, as some commentators, both modern and historic, characterize him. Many of Claudius' less solid supporters quickly became Nero's men. Claudius' will had been changed shortly before his death to either recommend Nero and Britannicus jointly or perhaps just Britannicus, who would have been considered an adult man according to Roman law only in a few months.

Agrippina had sent away [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] shortly before Claudius' death, and now murdered the freedman. The last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius' correspondence—most likely so it could not be used against him and others in an already hostile new regime. Thus Claudius' private words about his own policies and motives were lost to history. Just as Claudius had criticized his predecessors in official edicts (see below), Nero often criticized the deceased emperor and many of Claudius' laws and edicts were disregarded under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Nero'' 33&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion of Claudius, that he was indeed an old idiot, remained the official one for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all, and realigned with his birth family. Claudius' temple was left unfinished after only some of the foundation had been laid down. Eventually the site was overtaken by Nero's [[Golden House]].&lt;ref name = &quot;iiovah&quot;&gt;Levick (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavians' perspectives===
The [[Flavians]], who had risen to prominence under Claudius, took a different tack. They were in a position where they needed to shore up their legitimacy, but also justify the fall of the Julio-Claudians. They reached back to Claudius in contrast with Nero, to show that they were good associated with good. Commemorative coins were issued of Claudius and his son [[Britannicus]]—who had been a friend of the emperor [[Titus]] (Titus was born in 39, Britannicus was born in 41). When Nero's [[Golden House]] was burned, the [[Temple of Claudius]] was finally completed on Caelian Hill.&lt;ref name = &quot;iiovah&quot;/&gt; However, as the Flavians became established, they needed to emphasize their own credentials more, and their references to Claudius ceased. Instead, he was put down with the other emperors of the fallen dynasty.

===Historians' perspectives===
The main ancient historians [[Tacitus]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], and [[Cassius Dio]] all wrote after the last of the Flavians had gone. All three were senators or ''equites''. They took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the princeps, invariably viewing him as being in the wrong. This resulted in biases, both conscious and unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to rely on second-hand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of Augustus' letters which had been gathered earlier) and does not quote the emperor. Suetonius painted Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and attributing the objectively good works to his retinue.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus wrote a narrative for his fellow senators and fitted each of the emperors into a simple mold of his choosing.&lt;ref&gt;Vessey (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote Claudius as a passive pawn and an idiot—going so far as to hide his use of Claudius as a source and omit Claudius' character from his works.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1990). ''Ann.'' XI 14 is a good example.
The digression on the history of writing is certainly Claudius' own argument for his new letters, and fits in with his personality and extant writings. Tacitus makes no attribution.&lt;/ref&gt; Even his version of Claudius' Lyons tablet speech is edited to be devoid of the emperor's personality. Dio was less biased, but seems to have used Suetonius and Tacitus as sources. Thus the conception of Claudius as the weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was preserved for the ages.

As time passed, Claudius was mostly forgotten outside of the historians' accounts. His books were lost first, as their antiquarian subjects became unfashionable. In the 2nd century, [[Pertinax]], who shared his birthday, became emperor, overshadowing commemoration of Claudius.&lt;ref&gt;Levick. ''Claudius'' p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and personal life==
Claudius' love life was unusual for an upper-class Roman of his day. As [[Edward Gibbon]] mentions, of the first 15 emperors, &quot;Claudius was the only one whose taste in love was entirely correct&quot;—the implication being that he was the only one not to take [[Homosexuality|men]] or [[Pederasty|boys]] as lovers. Gibbon based this on Suetonius' factual statement that &quot;He had a great passion for women, but had no interest in men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius and the other ancient authors used this against Claudius. They accused him of being dominated by these same women and wives, of being [[wikt:uxorious|uxorious]], and of being a [[Womanizing|womanizer]].

===Plautia Urgulanilla===
Claudius married four times. His first marriage, to [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], occurred after two failed betrothals. The first was to his distant cousin [[Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)|Aemilia Lepida]], but was broken for political reasons. The second was to [[Livia Medullina]], which ended with Medullina's sudden death on the wedding day. Urgulanilla was the granddaughter of Livia's confidant [[Urgulania]]. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Unfortunately, Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, the daughter of [[Sejanus]]. Claudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius repudiated the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was one of his own freedmen.

===Aelia Paetina===
Soon after (possibly in 28), Claudius married [[Aelia Paetina]], a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, [[Claudia Antonia]]. He later divorced her after the marriage became a political liability, although Leon (1948) suggests it may have been due to emotional and mental abuse by Paetina.

===Valeria Messalina===
Some years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39, Claudius married [[Valeria Messalina]], who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter [[Claudia Octavia]]. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as [[Britannicus]], was born just after Claudius' accession. This marriage ended in tragedy. The ancient historians allege that Messalina was a [[nymphomaniac]] who was regularly unfaithful to Claudius — [[Tacitus]] states she went so far as to compete with a [[prostitute]] to see who could have the most sexual partners in a night&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XI 10. Also Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 31, and Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' X 172.&lt;/ref&gt; — and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth. In 48, Messalina married her lover [[Gaius Silius]] in a public ceremony while Claudius was at [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]. Sources disagree as to whether or not she divorced the emperor first, and whether the intention was to usurp the throne. Scramuzza, in his biography, suggests that Silius may have convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed, and the union was her only hope of retaining rank and protecting her children.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;90. Momigliano (1934) pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7. Levick (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Tacitus]] suggests that Claudius's ongoing term as Censor may have prevented him from noticing the affair before it reached such a critical point.&lt;ref&gt;Tac. ''Ann.'' XI. 25, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, the result was the execution of Silius, Messalina, and most of her circle.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.212. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0739420259.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius made the [[Praetorians]] promise to kill him if he ever married again. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Agrippina the Younger===
Despite this declaration, Claudius did marry once more. The ancient sources tell that his freedmen pushed three candidates: 
*[[Caligula]]'s third wife [[Lollia Paulina]]
*Claudius's divorced second wife [[Aelia Paetina]]
*Claudius's niece [[Agrippina the Younger]]

According to Suetonius, Agrippina won out through her feminine wiles.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The truth is likely more political. The attempted [[coup d'etat]] by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian but not the Julian family. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy. Agrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Emperor [[Nero]]) was one of the last males of the imperial family. Future coup attempts could rally around the pair, and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. It has been suggested in recent times that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) pp.&amp;nbsp;91–92. See also Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 6, 7; Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This feud dated back to Agrippina's [[Agrippina the Elder|mother's]] actions against Tiberius after the death of her husband [[Germanicus]] (Claudius's brother), actions which Tiberius had gladly punished. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina, and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son.

Nero was made joint heir with the underage [[Britannicus]], married to Octavia and heavily promoted. This was not as unusual as it seems to people acquainted with modern hereditary monarchies. [[Barbara Levick]] notes that Augustus had named his grandson [[Postumus Agrippa]] and his stepson [[Tiberius]] as joint heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1990) p.&amp;nbsp;70. See also Scramuzza (1940) p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius named [[Caligula]] joint heir with his grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]]. Adoption of adults or near adults was an old tradition in Rome when a suitable natural adult heir was unavailable. This was the case during Britannicus' minority. S.V. Oost suggests that Claudius had previously looked to adopt one of his sons-in-law to protect his own reign.&lt;ref&gt;Oost (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix]], married to his daughter [[Claudia Antonia]], was only descended from Octavia and Antony on one side — not close enough to the imperial family to prevent doubts (that did not stop others from making him the object of a coup attempt against Nero a few years later). Besides which, he was the half brother of [[Valeria Messalina]], and at this time those wounds were still fresh. [[Nero]] was more popular with the general public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.

==Claudius' affliction and personality==
The historian [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] describes the physical manifestations of Claudius' affliction in relatively good detail.&lt;ref name = &quot;boyjnt&quot;&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 30.&lt;/ref&gt; His knees were weak and gave way under him and his head shook. He stammered and his speech was confused. He slobbered and his nose ran when he was excited. The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Seneca the younger|Seneca]] states in his ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' that Claudius' voice belonged to no land animal, and that his hands were weak as well;&lt;ref&gt;Seneca ''Apocolo.'' 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; however, he showed no physical deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated he was a tall, well-built figure of ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]''.&lt;ref name = &quot;boyjnt&quot;/&gt; When angered or stressed, his symptoms became worse. Historians agree that this condition improved upon his accession to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his own life.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern diagnosis has changed several times in the past century. Prior to [[World War II]], [[infantile paralysis]] (or polio) was widely accepted as the cause. This is the diagnosis used in [[Robert Graves]]' [[Claudius (novel)|Claudius novels]], first published in the 1930s. Polio does not explain many of the described symptoms, however, and a more recent theory implicates [[cerebral palsy]] as the cause, as outlined by Ernestine Leon.&lt;ref&gt;Leon (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tourette syndrome]] is also a likely candidate for Claudius' symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Burden, George. [http://www.mentalhealth.com/mag1/p5m-tor1.html The Imperial Gene], ''The Medical Post'',  16 July 1996. Retrieved 24 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murad A. (2010). A neurological mystery from history: the case of Claudius Caesar. J Hist Neurosci. 19(3):221-7.{{DOI| 10.1080/09647040902872775}} PMID 20628951&lt;/ref&gt;
As a person, ancient historians described Claudius as generous and lowbrow, a man who sometimes lunched with the [[plebeians]].&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 5, 21, 40; Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 5, 12, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; They also paint him as bloodthirsty and cruel, overly fond of both [[gladiator]]ial combat and executions, and very quick to anger (though Claudius himself acknowledged the latter trait, and apologized publicly for his temper).&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 34, 38. Tacitus ''Ann.'' XII 20.&lt;/ref&gt; To them he was also overly trusting, and easily manipulated by his wives and freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 29. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time they portray him as paranoid and apathetic, dull and easily confused.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 35, 36, 37, 39, 40. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The extant works of Claudius present a different view, painting a picture of an intelligent, scholarly, well-read, and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice. Thus, Claudius becomes an enigma. Since the discovery of his &quot;[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/claualex.html Letter to the Alexandrians]&quot; in the last century, much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies.

==Scholarly works and their impact==
Claudius wrote copiously throughout his life. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]]&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano (1934) pp.&amp;nbsp;4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; states that during the reign of Tiberius — which covers the peak of Claudius' literary career — it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was to either write about the new empire or obscure antiquarian subjects. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both. Besides the history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] history and eight volumes on [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] history, as well as an [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] Dictionary and a book on dice playing. (Claudius is actually the last person known to have been able to read Etruscan.) Despite the general avoidance of the imperatorial era, he penned a defense of [[Cicero]] against the charges of Asinius Gallus. Modern historians have used this to determine both the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history. He proposed a reform of the [[Latin alphabet]] by the addition of [[Claudian letters|three new letters]], two of which served the function of the modern letters ''W'' and ''Y.'' He officially instituted the change during his censorship, but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. ''Claud.'' 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) heavily criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches,&lt;ref&gt;See Claudius' letter to the people of Trent (linked below), in which he refers to the &quot;obstinate retirement&quot; of Tiberius. See also Josephus ''Ant Iud.'' XIX, where an edict of Claudius refers to Caligula's &quot;madness and lack of understanding.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; it is not hard to imagine the nature of Suetonius' charge.

[[Image:Claudian letters.svg|left|thumb|The [[Claudian letters]]]]

Unfortunately, none of the actual works survive. They do live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius' autobiography once, and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus uses Claudius' own arguments for the orthographical innovations mentioned above, and may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Momigliano (1934) Chap.&amp;nbsp;1, note&amp;nbsp;20 (p.&amp;nbsp;83). Pliny credits him by name in Book VII 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. The detail of his speech borders on the pedantic, a common mark of all his extant works, and he goes into long digressions on related matters. This indicates a deep knowledge of a variety of historical subjects that he could not help but share. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by [[Julius Caesar]]. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.&lt;ref&gt;Levick (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; His censorship seems to have been based on those of his ancestors, particularly [[Appius Claudius Caecus]], and he used the office to put into place many policies based on those of Republican times. This is when many of his religious reforms took effect and his building efforts greatly increased during his tenure. In fact, his assumption of the office of Censor may have been motivated by a desire to see his academic labors bear fruit. For example, he believed (as most Romans) that his ancestor [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] had used the censorship to introduce [[R|the letter &quot;R&quot;]]&lt;ref&gt;Ryan (1993) refers to the historian [[Varro]]'s account of the introduction&lt;/ref&gt; and so used his own term to introduce his new letters.

==In literature and film==
The best known fictional representation of the Emperor Claudius were the books ''[[I, Claudius]]'' and ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (published in 1934 and 1935) by [[Robert Graves]], both written in the [[Grammatical person|first-person]] to give the reader the impression that they are Claudius' [[autobiography]]. Graves employed a fictive artifice to suggest that they were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius' writings. Claudius' extant letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, ''Claudius the God'') in order to add authenticity.

In 1937, director [[Josef von Sternberg]] attempted a film version of ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'', with [[Charles Laughton]] as Claudius. Unfortunately, the lead actress [[Merle Oberon]] suffered a near-fatal accident and the movie was never finished. The surviving reels were featured in the BBC documentary ''The Epic That Never Was'' (1965), revealing some of Laughton's most accomplished acting. The motion picture rights for a new film have been obtained by producer [[Scott Rudin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-synopsis/i-claudius.1/|title=I, Claudius (2009) - Synopsis|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves's two books were the basis for a [[I, Claudius (TV series)|British television adaptation]] produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. The series starred [[Derek Jacobi]] as Claudius and was broadcast in 1976 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. It was a substantial critical success, and won several [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. The series was later broadcast in the [[United States]] on ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' in 1977. The DVD release of the television series contains the ''The Epic that Never Was'' documentary.

Claudius has been portrayed in film on several other occasions, including in the 1979 motion picture ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'', the role being performed by [[Giancarlo Badessi]] in which the character was depicted as an idiot, in contrast to [[Robert Graves]]' portrait of Claudius as a cunning and deeply intelligent man who is perceived by others to be an idiot. [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] also portrayed him sympathetically in ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]''.

On television, the actor [[Freddie Jones]] portrayed Claudius in the 1968 British [[television]] series ''[[The Caesars (TV series)|The Caesars]]'' while the 1985 made-for-television [[miniseries]] ''A.D.'' features actor [[Richard Kiley]] as Claudius. There is also a reference to Claudius' suppression of one of the coups against him in the movie ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', though the incident is entirely fictional.

In literature, Claudius and his contemporaries appear in the historical novel ''The Roman'' by [[Mika Waltari]]. Canadian-born science fiction writer [[A. E. van Vogt]] reimagined Robert Graves' Claudius story in his two novels ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''Cantor set''', introduced by [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]] in 1883&lt;ref&gt;Georg Cantor (1883) &quot;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002247461 Über unendliche, lineare Punktmannigfaltigkeiten V]&quot; [On infinite, linear point-manifolds (sets)], ''Mathematische Annalen'', vol. 21, pages 545&amp;ndash;591.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.-O. Peitgen, H. Jürgens, and D. Saupe, ''Chaos and Fractals:  New Frontiers of Science 2nd ed.'' (N.Y., N.Y.:  Springer Verlag, 2004), page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; (but discovered in 1875 by [[Henry John Stephen Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Henry J.S. Smith (1875) “On the integration of discontinuous functions.” ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', Series 1, vol. 6, pages 140&amp;ndash;153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The “Cantor set” was also discovered by Paul du Bois-Reymond (1831&amp;ndash;1889).  See footnote on page 128 of:  Paul du Bois-Reymond (1880) “[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002245256 Der Beweis des Fundamentalsatzes der Integralrechnung],” ''Mathematische Annalen'', vol. 16, pages 115&amp;ndash;128.  The “Cantor set” was also discovered in 1881 by Vito Volterra (1860&amp;ndash;1940).  See:  Vito Volterra (1881) “Alcune osservazioni sulle funzioni punteggiate discontinue” [Some observations on point-wise discontinuous functions], ''Giornale di Matematiche'', vol. 19, pages 76&amp;ndash;86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Ferreirós, ''Labyrinth of Thought:  A History of Set Theory and Its Role in Modern Mathematics'' (Basel, Switzerland:  Birkhäuser Verlag, 1999), pages 162&amp;ndash;165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Stewart, ''Does God Play Dice?: The New Mathematics of Chaos''&lt;/ref&gt;), is a set of points lying on a single [[line segment]] that has a number of remarkable and deep properties.  Through consideration of it, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern [[general topology]]. Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the '''Cantor ternary set''', built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. Cantor himself only mentioned the ternary construction in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a [[perfect set]] that is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]].

==Construction of the ternary set==
The Cantor ternary set is created by repeatedly deleting the [[open interval|open]] middle thirds of a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third ({{frac|1|3}},&amp;nbsp;{{frac|2|3}}) from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,&amp;nbsp;1], leaving two line segments: [0,&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}] ∪ [{{frac|2|3}},&amp;nbsp;1].  Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: [0,&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|9}}] ∪ [{{frac|2|9}},&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}]  ∪ [{{frac|2|3}},&amp;nbsp;{{frac|7|9}}] ∪ [{{frac|8|9}},&amp;nbsp;1]. This process is continued [[ad infinitum]], where the ''n''th set is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{C_{n-1}}{3} \cup \left(\frac{2}{3}+\frac{C_{n-1}}{3}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Cantor ternary set contains all points in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] that are not deleted at any step in this infinite process.

The first six steps of this process are illustrated below.

[[Image:Cantor set in seven iterations.svg|729px|Cantor ternary set, in seven iterations]]

An explicit formula for the Cantor set is

: &lt;math&gt; C=[0,1] \setminus \bigcup_{m=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=0}^{3^{m-1}-1} \left(\frac{3k+1}{3^m},\frac{3k+2}{3^m}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The proof of the  formula above is done by the idea of self-similarity transformations and can be found in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Mohsen Soltanifar, ''On A sequence of cantor Fractals'', Rose Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal, Vol 7, No 1, paper 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohsen Soltanifar, ''A Different Description of A Family of Middle-a Cantor Sets'', American Journal of Undergraduate Research, Vol 5, No 2, pp 9&amp;ndash;12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

Since the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., [[Lebesgue measure|measure]]) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the [[geometric progression]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{9} + \frac{4}{27} + \frac{8}{81} + \cdots =  \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{3}}\right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So that the proportion left is  1 &amp;ndash; 1 = 0.

(Intuitively, one could imagine the [[geometric series]] as being [[Ternary numeral system|base-3]] decimals, so that 0.2222... repeating equals 1 just as in base 10 [[0.999...]] repeating equals 1.)

This calculation shows that the Cantor set cannot contain any [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of non-zero length. In fact, it may seem surprising that there should be anything left &amp;mdash; after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the &quot;middle third&quot; of each interval involved removing [[open set]]s (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) from the original interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] leaves behind the points &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an infinite number of points.

It may appear that ''only'' the endpoints are left, but that is not the case either. The number 1/4, for example is in the bottom third, so it is not removed at the first step, and is in the top third of the bottom third, and is in the bottom third of ''that'', and in the ''top'' third of ''that'', and so on ad infinitum&amp;mdash;alternating between top and bottom thirds. Since it is never in one of the middle thirds, it is never removed, and yet it is also not one of the endpoints of any middle third.  The number 3/10 is also in the Cantor set and is not an endpoint.

In the sense of [[cardinality]], ''most'' members of the Cantor set are not endpoints of deleted intervals.

== Properties ==

=== Cardinality ===
It can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were that were removed, and that therefore, the Cantor set is [[uncountable set|uncountable]]. To see this, we show that there is a function ''f'' from the Cantor set ''C'' to the closed interval [0,1] that is [[Surjective function|surjective]] (i.e. ''f'' maps from ''C'' onto [0,1]) so that the [[cardinality]] of ''C'' is no less than that of [0,1].  Since ''C'' is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]].

To construct this function, consider the points in the [0,&amp;nbsp;1] interval in terms of base 3 (or [[ternary numeral system|ternary]]) notation. 
Recall that some points admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, that can be written as 0.1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; but also as 0.022222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, that can be written as 0.2&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; but also as 0.12222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
(This alternative recurring representation of a number with a terminating numeral occurs in any  [[Numeral system#Positional systems in detail|positional system]].)
When we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; where xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is strictly between 00000...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 22222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.   So the numbers remaining after the first step consists of
* Numbers of the form 0.0xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.022222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 
* &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.122222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* Numbers of the form 0.2xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
This can be summarized by saying that those numbers that admit a ternary representation such that the first digit after the decimal point is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.

The second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.21xxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral whose first ''two'' digits are not 1.  Continuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step ''n'', it must have a ternary representation whose ''n''th digit is not 1.  For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.  It is worth emphasising that numbers like 1, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.21&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.2222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.022222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2022222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  So while a number in ''C'' may have either a terminating or a recurring ternary numeral, one of its representations will consist entirely of 0s and 2s. 

It has been conjectured that all [[algebraic number|algebraic]] irrational numbers are [[normal number|normal]].  Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or [[transcendental number|transcendental]].

The function from ''C'' to [0,1] is defined by taking the numeral that does consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a [[Binary_numeral_system#Representing_real_numbers|binary]] representation of a real number.  In a formula,

:&lt;math&gt;f \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k 3^{-k} \bigg) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{2} 2^{-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

For any number ''y'' in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number ''x'' in ''C'' by replacing all the 1s by 2s.  With this, ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' so that ''y'' is in the range of ''f''.  For instance if ''y'' = &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.100110011001...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we write ''x'' = 0.200220022002...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.  Consequently ''f'' is surjective; however, ''f'' is ''not'' [[injective function|injective]] &amp;mdash; interestingly enough, the values for which ''f''(''x'') coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the ''middle thirds'' removed.  For instance, &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2022222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2200000...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; so ''f''(&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.101111...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;).

So there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], and the Cantor set is [[countable|uncountable]] (see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is ¼, which can be written as 0.02020202020...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ternary notation.

The Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval. (Actually, the irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even [[Dense set|dense]] in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers, which are dense everywhere.)

=== Self-similarity ===

The Cantor set is the prototype of a [[fractal]]. It is [[self-similar]], because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, there are two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations, &lt;math&gt;f_L(x)=x/3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_R(x)=(2+x)/3&lt;/math&gt;, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to [[homeomorphism]]: &lt;math&gt;f_L(C)\cong f_R(C)\cong C.&lt;/math&gt;

Repeated [[iterated function|iteration]] of &lt;math&gt;f_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_R&lt;/math&gt; can be visualized as an infinite [[binary tree]]. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set &lt;math&gt;\{f_L,f_R\}&lt;/math&gt; together with [[function composition]] forms a [[monoid]], the [[dyadic monoid]].

The [[automorphism]]s of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the [[modular group]]. Thus, the Cantor set is a [[homogeneous space]] in the sense that for any two points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the Cantor set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;h:C\to C&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;. These homeomorphisms can be expressed explicitly, as [[Mobius transformation]]s.   &lt;!-- how about including that explicit expression here? --&gt;

The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the Cantor set is equal to ln(2)/ln(3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2).

=== Topological and analytical properties ===
As the above summation argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has [[Lebesgue measure]] 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[open set]]s, it itself is a [[closed set|closed]] subset of the reals, and therefore a [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Since it is also [[totally bounded]], the [[Heine–Borel theorem]] says that it must be [[compact space|compact]].

For any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s.  Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an [[accumulation point]] (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an [[interior point]]. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a [[perfect set]] in [[topology]], while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]] in the interval.

Every point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the Cantor set.

For any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ &amp;mdash; one will have 0 and the other 2.  By splitting the Cantor set into &quot;halves&quot; depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points.  In the [[relative topology]] on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a [[clopen set]].  Consequently the Cantor set is [[totally disconnected]].  As a compact totally disconnected [[Hausdorff space]], the Cantor set is an example of a [[Stone space]].

As a [[topological space]], the Cantor set is naturally [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the space &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;, where each copy carries the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. This is the space of all [[sequence]]s in two digits 
:&lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}=\{(x_n)\vert x_n\in \{0,1\} \mbox{ for } n\in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;, 

which can also be identified with the set of [[p-adic numbers|2-adic integers]]. The [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the open sets of the product topology are [[cylinder set]]s; the homeomorphism maps these to the [[subspace topology]] that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the [[Cantor space]] as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via [[Tychonoff's theorem]]. 

From the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the [[p-adic numbers|p-adic integers]], and, if one point is removed from it, to the [[p-adic numbers]]. 

The Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a [[metric space]] with respect to the [[absolute difference|ordinary distance metric]]; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the [[p-adic metric]] on &lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;: given two sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_n),(y_n)\in 2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the distance between them is &lt;math&gt;d((x_n),(y_n)) = 1/k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest index such that &lt;math&gt;x_k \ne y_k&lt;/math&gt;; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same [[topological space|topology]] on the Cantor set.

We have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally-disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally-disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See [[Cantor space]] for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

The Cantor set is sometimes regarded as &quot;universal&quot; in the [[Category theory|category]] of [[Compact space|compact]] [[metric space]]s, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not [[universal property|universal]] in the precise categorical sense. The &quot;universal&quot; property has important applications in [[functional analysis]], where it is sometimes known as the ''representation theorem for compact metric spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Willard, ''General Topology'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''q'' an integer, the topology on G='''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the [[Pontryagin dual|dual group]] &amp;Gamma; is also '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;, the topology of &amp;Gamma; is compact. One can see that &amp;Gamma; is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case ''q''=2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)

===Smith&amp;ndash;Volterra&amp;ndash;Cantor set===
{{main|Smith&amp;ndash;Volterra&amp;ndash;Cantor set}}

Instead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle.  In the case where the middle &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case &amp;mdash; the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s.

By removing progressively smaller percentages of the remaining pieces in every step, one can also construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure, while still being [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]]. See [[Smith&amp;ndash;Volterra&amp;ndash;Cantor set]] for an example.

=== Cantor dust ===&lt;!-- This is linked to by the redirect &quot;Cantor dust&quot;--&gt;
'''Cantor dust''' is a multi-dimensional version of the Cantor set. It can be formed by taking a finite [[Cartesian product]] of the Cantor set with itself, making it a [[Cantor space]]. Like the Cantor set, Cantor dust has [[Measure zero|zero measure]].{{fact|date=December 2010}}

A different 2D analogue of the Cantor set is the [[Sierpinski carpet]], where a square is divided up into nine smaller squares, and the middle one removed. The remaining squares are then further divided into nine each and the middle removed, and so on ad infinitum. The 3D analogue of this is the [[Menger sponge]].

==Historical remarks==
Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, and mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a [[perfect set]] that is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]]. The original paper provides several different constructions of the abstract concept. 

This set would have been considered abstract at the time when Cantor devised it. Cantor himself was led to it by practical concerns about the set of points where a [[Fourier series|trigonometric series]] might fail to converge. The discovery did much to set him on the course for developing an [[axiomatic set theory|abstract, general theory of infinite sets]].

[[Image:Aleph0.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Aleph Null]], the smallest infinite cardinal]]
In [[mathematics]], '''cardinal numbers''', or '''cardinals''' for short, are a generalization of the [[natural number]]s used to measure the '''[[cardinality]]''' (size) of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. The cardinality of a [[finite set]] is a natural number – the number of elements in the set. The ''[[transfinite]]'' cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets.

Cardinality is defined in terms of [[bijective function]]s. Two sets have the same cardinal number if and only if there is a bijection between them. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to [[Georg Cantor]] shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the set of [[real number]]s and the set of [[natural number]]s do not have the same cardinal number. It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set, something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.

There is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n, \ldots ; \aleph_0, \aleph_1, \aleph_2, \ldots, \aleph_{\alpha}, \ldots.\ &lt;/math&gt;
This sequence starts with the [[natural number]]s, including zero, (finite cardinals), which are followed by the [[aleph number]]s (infinite cardinals of [[well-ordering|well-ordered sets]]). The aleph numbers are indexed by [[ordinal number]]s.  Under the assumption of the [[axiom of choice]], this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal number.  If one [[axiom of choice#Independence|rejects]] that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.

Cardinality is studied for its own sake as part of [[set theory]]. It is also a tool used in branches of mathematics including [[combinatorics]], [[abstract algebra]], and [[mathematical analysis]].

==History==
The notion of cardinality, as now understood, was formulated by [[Georg Cantor]], the originator of [[set theory]], in 1874–1884. Cantor first established cardinality as an instrument to compare finite sets; e.g. the sets {1,2,3} and {2,3,4} are not ''equal'', but have the ''same cardinality'': three.

Cantor identified the fact that [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] is the way to tell that two sets have the same size, called &quot;cardinality&quot;, in the case of finite sets.  Using this one-to-one correspondence, he applied the concept to infinite sets; e.g. the set of natural numbers '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. He called these cardinal numbers [[transfinite cardinal numbers]], and defined all sets having a one-to-one correspondence with '''N''' to be [[Countable set|denumerable (countably infinite) sets]].

Naming this cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, [[Aleph number|aleph-null]], Cantor proved that any unbounded subset of '''N''' has the same cardinality as '''N''', even if this might appear at first glance to run contrary to intuition. He also proved that the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is denumerable (which implies that the set of all [[rational number]]s is denumerable), and later proved that the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is also denumerable.  Each algebraic number ''z'' may be encoded as a finite sequence of integers which are the coefficients in the polynomial equation of which it is the solution, i.e. the ordered n-tuple &lt;math&gt;(a_0, a_1, ..., a_n),\; a_i \in \mathbb{Z},&lt;/math&gt; together with a pair of rationals &lt;math&gt;(b_0, b_1)&lt;/math&gt; such that ''z'' is the unique root of the polynomial with coefficients &lt;math&gt;(a_0, a_1, ..., a_n)&lt;/math&gt; that lies in the interval &lt;math&gt;(b_0, b_1)&lt;/math&gt;.

In his 1874 paper, Cantor proved that there exist higher-order cardinal numbers by showing that the set of real numbers has cardinality greater than that of '''N'''. His [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|original presentation]] used a complex argument with [[nested intervals]], but in an 1891 paper he proved the same result using his ingenious but simple [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]. This new cardinal number, called the [[cardinality of the continuum]], was termed &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; by Cantor.

Cantor also developed a large portion of the general theory of cardinal numbers; he proved that there is a smallest transfinite cardinal number (&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, aleph-null) and that for every cardinal number, there is a next-larger cardinal
:&lt;math&gt;(\aleph_1, \aleph_2, \aleph_3, \cdots).\ &lt;/math&gt;

His [[continuum hypothesis]] is the proposition that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, but this has been found to be independent of the standard axioms of mathematical set theory; it can neither be proved nor disproved under the standard assumptions.

== Motivation ==
In informal use, a '''cardinal number''' is what is normally referred to as a ''[[counting number]]'', provided that 0 is included: 0, 1, 2, .... They may be identified with the [[natural numbers]] beginning with 0.
The counting numbers are exactly what can be defined formally as the [[finite set|finite]] cardinal numbers.  Infinite cardinals only occur in higher-level mathematics and logic.

More formally, a non-zero number can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence.  For finite sets and sequences it is easy to see that these two notions coincide, since for every number describing a position in a sequence we can construct a set which has exactly the right size, e.g. 3 describes the position of 'c' in the sequence &lt;'a','b','c','d',...&gt;, and we can construct the set {a,b,c} which has 3 elements.  However when dealing with [[infinite set]]s it is essential to distinguish between the two &amp;mdash; the two notions are in fact different for infinite sets. Considering the position aspect leads to [[ordinal numbers]], while the size aspect is generalized by the '''cardinal numbers''' described here.

The intuition behind the formal definition of cardinal is the construction of a notion of the relative size or &quot;bigness&quot; of a set without reference to the kind of members which it has.  For finite sets this is easy; one simply counts the number of elements a set has.  In order to compare the sizes of larger sets, it is necessary to appeal to more subtle notions.

A set ''Y'' is at least as big as, or greater than or equal to a set ''X'' if there is an [[injective function|injective]] (one-to-one) [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] from the elements of ''X'' to the elements of ''Y''. A one-to-one mapping identifies each element of the set ''X'' with a unique element of the set ''Y''. This is most easily understood by an example; suppose we have the sets ''X'' = {1,2,3} and ''Y'' = {a,b,c,d}, then using this notion of size we would observe that there is a mapping:
: 1 → a
: 2 → b
: 3 → c
which is one-to-one, and hence conclude that ''Y'' has cardinality greater than or equal to ''X''. Note the element d has no element mapping to it, but this is permitted as we only require a one-to-one mapping, and not necessarily a one-to-one and [[onto]] mapping. The advantage of this notion is that it can be extended to infinite sets.

We can then extend this to an equality-style relation.
Two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] ''X'' and ''Y'' are said to have the same '''cardinality''' if there exists a [[bijection]] between ''X'' and ''Y''.  By the [[Schroeder-Bernstein theorem]], this is equivalent to there being ''both'' a one-to-one mapping from ''X'' to ''Y'' ''and'' a one-to-one mapping from ''Y'' to ''X''.
We then write |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| = |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;|. The cardinal number of ''X'' itself is often defined as the least ordinal ''a'' with |&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;| = |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|.  This is called the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]]; for this definition to make sense, it must be proved that every set has the same cardinality as ''some'' ordinal; this statement is the [[well-ordering principle]]. It is however possible to discuss the relative cardinality of sets without explicitly assigning names to objects.

The classic example used is that of the infinite hotel paradox, also called [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]].  Suppose you are an innkeeper at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. The hotel is full, and then a new guest arrives.  It's possible to fit the extra guest in by asking the guest who was in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on, leaving room 1 vacant.  We can explicitly write a segment of this mapping:
: 1 ↔ 2
: 2 ↔ 3
: 3 ↔ 4
: ...
: n ↔ n+1
: ...
In this way we can see that the set {1,2,3,...} has the same cardinality as the set {2,3,4,...} since a bijection between the first and the second has been shown.  This motivates the definition of an infinite set being any set which has a proper subset of the same cardinality; in this case {2,3,4,...} is a proper subset of {1,2,3,...}.

When considering these large objects, we might also want to see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets.  It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example we can see that if some object &quot;one greater than infinity&quot; exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called [[Ordinal number|ordinals]], based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.

It can be proved that the cardinality of the [[real number]]s is greater than that of the natural numbers just described.  This can be visualized using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]];
classic questions of cardinality (for instance the [[continuum hypothesis]]) are concerned with discovering whether there is some cardinal between some pair of other infinite cardinals.  In more recent times mathematicians have been describing the properties of larger and larger cardinals.

Since cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics, a variety of names are in use.  Sameness of cardinality is sometimes referred to as '''equipotence''', '''equipollence''', or '''equinumerosity'''. It is thus said that two sets with the same cardinality are, respectively, '''equipotent''', '''equipollent''', or '''equinumerous'''.

== Formal definition ==
Formally, assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the cardinality of a set ''X'' is the least ordinal α such that there is a bijection between ''X'' and α.  This definition is known as the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]].  If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different.  The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set ''X'' (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and [[Principia Mathematica]]) is as the set of all sets which are equinumerous with ''X'':  this does not work in [[ZFC]] or other related systems of [[axiomatic set theory]] because this collection is [[too large to be a set]]{{why?|date=November 2010}}{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}, but it does work in [[type theory]] and in [[New Foundations]] and related systems.  However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with ''X'' that have the least [[rank (set theory)|rank]], then it will work (this is a trick due to [[Dana Scott]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deiser|first1=Oliver|title=On the Development of the Notion of a Cardinal Number|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|doi=10.1080/01445340903545904 |volume=31|issue=2|pages=123-143|month=May|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).

Formally, the order among cardinal numbers is defined as follows: |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| ≤ |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;| means that there exists an [[injective]] function from ''X'' to ''Y''. The [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]] states that if |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| ≤ |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;| and |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;| ≤ |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| then |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| = |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;|. The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that given two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', either |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| ≤ |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;| or |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;| ≤ |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|.

A set ''X'' is [[Dedekind-infinite]] if there exists a [[proper subset]] ''Y'' of ''X'' with |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| = |&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;|, and [[Dedekind-finite]] if such a subset doesn't exist.  The [[finite set|finite]] cardinals are just the [[natural numbers]], i.e., a set ''X'' is finite if and only if |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| = |&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;| = ''n'' for some natural number ''n''.  Any other set is [[infinite]].  Assuming the axiom of choice, it can be proved that the Dedekind notions correspond to the standard ones. It can also be proved that the cardinal &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph null]] or aleph-0, where aleph is the first letter in the [[Hebrew alphabet]], represented &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;) of the set of natural numbers is the smallest infinite cardinal, i.e. that any infinite set has a subset of cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0.&lt;/math&gt;  The next larger cardinal is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; and so on. For every [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] α there is a cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt; and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal numbers.

== Cardinal arithmetic ==

We can define [[arithmetic]] operations on cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural numbers.  It can be shown that for finite cardinals these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural numbers. Furthermore, these operations share many properties with ordinary arithmetic.

=== Successor cardinal ===
{{Details|Successor cardinal}}

If the axiom of choice holds, every cardinal κ has a successor κ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; κ, and there are no cardinals between κ and its successor.  For finite cardinals, the successor is simply κ+1.  For infinite cardinals, the successor cardinal differs from the [[successor ordinal]].

=== Cardinal addition ===

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]], addition is given by the [[union (set theory)|union]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.  If the two sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by disjoint sets of the same cardinality, e.g., replace ''X'' by ''X''&amp;times;{0} and ''Y'' by ''Y''&amp;times;{1}.
:&lt;math&gt;|X| + |Y| = | X \cup Y|.&lt;/math&gt;

Zero is an additive identity ''κ'' + 0 = 0 + ''κ'' = ''κ''.

Addition is [[associative]] (''κ'' + ''μ'') + ''ν'' = ''κ'' + (''μ'' + ''ν'').

Addition is [[commutative]] ''κ'' + ''μ'' = ''μ'' + ''κ''.

Addition is non-decreasing in both arguments:
:&lt;math&gt;(\kappa \le \mu) \rightarrow ((\kappa + \nu \le \mu + \nu) \mbox{ and } (\nu + \kappa \le \nu + \mu)).&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the axiom of choice, addition of infinite cardinal numbers is easy.  If either &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, then
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa + \mu = \max\{\kappa, \mu\}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Subtraction ====
Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal ''σ'' and a cardinal ''μ'', there exists a cardinal ''κ'' such that ''μ'' + ''κ'' = ''σ'' if and only if ''μ'' ≤ ''σ''. It will be unique (and equal to ''σ'') if and only if ''μ'' &lt; ''σ''.

=== Cardinal multiplication ===

The product of cardinals comes from the [[cartesian product]].
:&lt;math&gt;|X|\cdot|Y| = |X \times Y|&lt;/math&gt;

''κ''·0 = 0·''κ'' = 0.

''κ''·''μ'' = 0 &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (''κ'' = 0 or ''μ'' = 0).

One is a multiplicative identity ''κ''·1 = 1·''κ'' = ''κ''.

Multiplication is associative (''κ''·''μ'')·''ν'' = ''κ''·(''μ''·''ν'').

Multiplication is [[commutative]] ''κ''·''μ'' = ''μ''·''κ''.

Multiplication is non-decreasing in both arguments:
''κ'' ≤ ''μ'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (''κ''·''ν'' ≤ ''μ''·''ν'' and ''ν''·''κ'' ≤ ''ν''·''μ'').

Multiplication [[distributivity|distributes]] over addition:
''κ''·(''μ'' + ''ν'') = ''κ''·''μ'' + ''κ''·''ν'' and
(''μ'' + ''ν'')·''κ'' = ''μ''·''κ'' + ''ν''·''κ''.

Assuming the axiom of choice, multiplication of infinite cardinal numbers is also easy.  If either ''κ''  or ''μ'' is infinite and both are non-zero, then
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa\cdot\mu = \max\{\kappa, \mu\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Division ====
Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal ''π'' and a non-zero cardinal ''μ'', there there exists a cardinal ''κ'' such that ''μ'' · ''κ'' = ''π'' if and only if ''μ'' ≤ ''π''. It will be unique (and equal to ''π'') if and only if ''μ'' &lt; ''π''.

=== Cardinal exponentiation ===

Exponentiation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;|X|^{|Y|} = \left|X^Y\right|&lt;/math&gt;
where ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from ''Y'' to ''X''.

:''κ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1  (in particular 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1), see [[empty function]].
:If 1 ≤ ''μ'', then 0&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.
:1&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.
:''κ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''κ''.
:''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''μ'' + ''ν''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;·''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;.
:''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''·''ν''&lt;/sup&gt; = (''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;.
:(''κ''·''μ'')&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;·''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;.
Exponentiation is non-decreasing in both arguments:
:(1 ≤ ''ν'' and ''κ'' ≤ ''μ'') &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (''ν''&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''ν''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;) and
:(''κ'' ≤ ''μ'') &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;).

Note that 2&lt;sup&gt;|&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/sup&gt; is the cardinality of the [[power set]] of the set ''X'' and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that 2&lt;sup&gt;|&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| for any set ''X''. This proves that no largest cardinal exists (because for any cardinal ''κ'', we can always find a larger cardinal 2&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt;). In fact, the [[class (set theory)|class]] of cardinals is a [[proper class]].

All the remaining propositions in this section assume the axiom of choice:

:If ''κ'' and ''μ'' are both finite and greater than 1, and ''ν'' is infinite, then ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;.
:If ''κ'' is infinite and ''μ'' is finite and non-zero, then ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''κ''.

If 2 ≤ κ and 1 ≤ μ and at least one of them is infinite, then:
:Max (κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;) ≤ κ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ Max (2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;).

Using [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]], one can prove κ &lt; κ&lt;sup&gt;cf(κ)&lt;/sup&gt; and κ &lt; cf(2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;) for any infinite cardinal κ, where cf(κ) is the [[cofinality]] of κ.

====Roots====

Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; and a finite cardinal &lt;math&gt;{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; greater than 0, the cardinal &lt;math&gt;{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;{\nu}^{\mu}={\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; will be &lt;math&gt;{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Logarithms====
 
Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and a finite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; greater than 1, there may or may not be a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;{\mu}^{\lambda}={\kappa}&lt;/math&gt;. But, if such a cardinal exists, it is infinite and less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and any finite cardinality &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; greater than 1 will also satisfy &lt;math&gt;{\nu}^{\lambda}={\kappa}&lt;/math&gt;.

The logarithm of an infinite cardinal number κ is defined as the least cardinal number μ such that κ ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;. Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of cardinal invariants of topological spaces, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. McCoy and Ibula Ntantu, Topological Properties of Spaces of Continuous Functions, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1315, Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Cech, Topological Spaces, revised by Zdenek Frolík and Miroslav Katetov, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Vladimirov, Boolean Algebras in Analysis, Mathematics and Its Applications, Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The continuum hypothesis==
The [[continuum hypothesis]] (CH) states that there are no cardinals strictly between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}.&lt;/math&gt;
The latter cardinal number is also often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;; it is the [[cardinality of the continuum]] (the set of [[real number]]s). In this case &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1.&lt;/math&gt; The [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) states that for every infinite set ''X'', there are no cardinals strictly between |&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;| and 2&lt;sup&gt;|&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/sup&gt;.
The continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms together with the axiom of choice ([[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]).

In [[mathematics]], the '''cardinality''' of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] is a measure of the &quot;number of [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set&quot;. For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality &amp;ndash; one which compares sets directly using [[bijection]]s and [[injective function|injection]]s, and another which uses [[cardinal number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. &quot;Cardinal Number.&quot; From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CardinalNumber.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinality of a set ''A'' is usually denoted |&amp;thinsp;''A''&amp;thinsp;|, with a [[vertical bar]] on each side; this is the same notation as [[absolute value]] and the meaning depends on [[Ambiguity|context]]. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set ''A'' may be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{\overline{A}}\,&lt;/math&gt; or #&amp;thinsp;''A''.

==Comparing sets==
=== Case 1: |&amp;thinsp;''A''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;''B''&amp;thinsp;| ===
:Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' have the same cardinality if there exists a [[bijection]], that is, an [[injective function|injective]] and [[surjection|surjective]] [[function (mathematics)|function]], from ''A'' to ''B''.

:For example, the set ''E'' = {0, 2, 4, 6, ...} of [[non-negative]] [[even number]]s has the same cardinality as the set '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} of [[natural numbers]], since the function ''f''(''n'') = 2''n'' is a bijection from '''N''' to ''E''.

=== Case 2: |&amp;thinsp;''A''&amp;thinsp;| ≥ |&amp;thinsp;''B''&amp;thinsp;| ===
:''A'' has cardinality greater than or equal to the cardinality of ''B'' if there exists an injective function from ''B'' into ''A''.

=== Case 3: |&amp;thinsp;''A''&amp;thinsp;| &gt; |&amp;thinsp;''B''&amp;thinsp;| ===
:''A'' has cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of ''B'' if there is an injective function, but no bijective function, from ''B'' to ''A''.

:For example, the set '''R''' of all [[real number]]s has cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of the set '''N''' of all [[natural numbers]], because the inclusion map ''i'' : '''N''' → '''R''' is injective, but it can be shown that there does not exist a bijective function from '''N''' to '''R''' (see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).

==Cardinal numbers==
{{main|Cardinal number}}

Above, &quot;cardinality&quot; was defined functionally. That is, the &quot;cardinality&quot; of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.

The relation of having the same cardinality is called [[equinumerosity]], and this is an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all sets. The [[equivalence class]] of a set ''A'' under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as ''A''. There are two ways to define the &quot;cardinality of a set&quot;:

#The cardinality of a set ''A'' is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity.
#A representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment|initial ordinal in that class]]. This is usually taken as the definition of [[cardinal number]] in [[axiomatic set theory]].

The cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 &lt; \aleph_1 &lt; \aleph_2 &lt; \ldots . &lt;/math&gt;
For each [[ordinal number|ordinal]] α, {{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;α + 1&lt;/sub&gt; is the least cardinal number greater than {{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

The cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is denoted [[aleph number|aleph-null]] ({{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), while the cardinality of the [[real number]]s is denoted by '''c''', and is also referred to as the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. We can show that '''c''' = 2&lt;sup&gt;{{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The [[continuum hypothesis]] says that {{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;{{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. 2&lt;sup&gt;{{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is the smallest cardinal number bigger than {{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers. The continuum hypothesis still remains unresolved in an &quot;absolute&quot; sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R|last=[[Roger Penrose|Penrose]]|title=The Road to Reality: A Complete guide to the Laws of the Universe|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2005|ISBN=0-099-44068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cardinality#Cardinality of the continuum|See below]] for more details on the cardinality of the continuum.

== Finite, countable and uncountable sets ==
If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|law of trichotomy]] holds for cardinality. Thus we can make the following definitions:

*Any set ''X'' with cardinality less than that of the [[natural number]]s, or |&amp;thinsp;''X''&amp;thinsp;| &lt; |&amp;thinsp;'''N'''&amp;thinsp;|, is said to be a [[finite set]].
*Any set ''X'' that has the same cardinality as the set of the natural numbers, or |&amp;thinsp;''X''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;'''N'''&amp;thinsp;| = {{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is said to be a [[countable set|countably infinite]] set.
*Any set ''X'' with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers, or |&amp;thinsp;''X''&amp;thinsp;| &gt; |&amp;thinsp;'''N'''&amp;thinsp;|, for example |&amp;thinsp;'''R'''&amp;thinsp;| = '''c''' &gt; |&amp;thinsp;'''N'''&amp;thinsp;|, is said to be  [[uncountable set|uncountable]].

== Infinite sets ==
Our intuition gained from [[finite set]]s breaks down when dealing with [[infinite set]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others rejected the view of Galileo (which derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]].

The reason for this is that the various characterizations of what it means for set A to be larger than set B, or to be the same size as set B, which are all equivalent for finite sets, are no longer equivalent for infinite sets. Different characterizations can yield different results. For example, in the popular characterization of size chosen by Cantor, sometimes an infinite set A is larger (in that sense) than an infinite set B; while other characterizations{{Which?|date=April 2009}} may yield that an infinite set A is always the same size as an infinite set B.

For finite sets, counting is just forming a [[bijection]] (i.e., a one-to-one correspondence) between the set being counted and an initial segment of the positive integers. Thus there is no notion equivalent to ''counting'' for infinite sets. While counting gives a unique result when applied to a finite set, an infinite set may be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with many different [[ordinal numbers]] depending on how one chooses to &quot;count&quot; (order) it.

Additionally, different characterizations of size, when extended to infinite sets, will break different &quot;rules&quot; which held for finite sets. Which rules are broken varies from characterization to characterization. For example, Cantor's characterization, while preserving the rule that sometimes one set is larger than another, breaks the rule that deleting an element makes the set smaller. Another characterization may preserve the rule that deleting an element makes the set smaller, but break another rule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Furthermore, some characterization may not &quot;directly&quot; break a rule, but it may not &quot;directly&quot; uphold it either, in the sense that whichever is the case depends upon a controversial axiom such as the axiom of choice or the continuum hypothesis. Thus there are three possibilities. Each characterization will break some rules, uphold some others, and may be indecisive about some others.

If one extends to [[multiset]]s, further rules are broken (assuming Cantor's approach), which hold for finite multisets. If we have two multisets A and B, A not being larger than B and B not being larger than A does not necessarily imply A has the same size as B.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This rule holds for multisets that are finite. Needless to say, the law of trichotomy is explicitly broken in this case, as opposed to the situation with sets, where it is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

Dedekind simply defined an infinite set as one having the same size (in Cantor's sense) as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. This definition only works in the presence of some form of the axiom of choice, however, so will not be considered to work by some mathematicians.

Cantor introduced the above-mentioned cardinal numbers, and showed that (in Cantor's sense) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers ({{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Cardinality of the continuum ===
{{main|Cardinality of the continuum}}

One of Cantor's most important results was that the [[cardinality of the continuum]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;) is greater than that of the natural numbers ({{unicode|&amp;alefsym;}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;); that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than whole numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\aleph_0} &gt; {\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;
:(see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).

The [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_1 = \beth_1&lt;/math&gt;
:(see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]).
However, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[ZFC]] [[axiomatic set theory]], if ZFC is consistent.

Cardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist [[proper subset]]s and [[proper superset]]s of an infinite set ''S'' that have the same size as ''S'', although ''S'' contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of ''S'' contain elements that are not included in it.

The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent function]], which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (&amp;minus;½π, ½π) and '''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]).

The second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be easily used to obtain [[Space-filling curve#Proof that a square and its side contain the same number of points|such a proof]].

Cantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt; exist (see his [[Cantor's diagonal argument#General sets|generalized diagonal argument]] and [[Cantor's theorem|theorem]]). They include, for instance:

:* the set of all subsets of '''R''', i.e., the [[power set]] of '''R''', written ''P''('''R''') or 2&lt;sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sup&gt;
:* the set '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sup&gt; of all functions from '''R''' to '''R'''

Both have cardinality
:&lt;math&gt;2^\mathfrak {c} = \beth_2 &gt; \mathfrak c &lt;/math&gt;
:(see [[Beth number#Beth two|Beth two]]).

The [[Cardinality of the continuum#Cardinal equalities|cardinal equalities]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}^2 = \mathfrak{c},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak c,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c ^{\mathfrak c} = 2^{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; can be demonstrated using [[cardinal arithmetic]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}^2 = \left(2^{\aleph_0}\right)^2 = 2^{2\times{\aleph_0}} = 2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c^{\aleph_0} = \left(2^{\aleph_0}\right)^{\aleph_0} = 2^{{\aleph_0}\times{\aleph_0}} = 2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak c ^{\mathfrak c} = \left(2^{\aleph_0}\right)^{\mathfrak c} = 2^{\mathfrak c\times\aleph_0} = 2^{\mathfrak c}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples and properties==
* If ''X'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} and ''Y'' = {apples, oranges, peaches}, then |&amp;thinsp;''X''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;''Y''&amp;thinsp;| because {(''a'', apples), (''b'', oranges), (''c'', peaches)} is a bijection between the sets ''X'' and ''Y''. The cardinality of each of ''X'' and ''Y'' is 3.
* If |&amp;thinsp;''X''&amp;thinsp;| &amp;lt; |&amp;thinsp;''Y''&amp;thinsp;|, then there exists ''Z'' such that |&amp;thinsp;''X''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;''Z''&amp;thinsp;| and ''Z'' ⊆ ''Y''.

'''Cecil Blount DeMille''' (August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an [[United States|American]] [[film director]] and [[Academy Award]]-winning [[film producer]] in both silent and sound films.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', January 28, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; He was renowned for the flamboyance and showmanship of his movies. Among his best-known films are ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934), and ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

==Early life==
DeMille was born in [[Ashfield, Massachusetts]] while his parents were vacationing there and grew up in [[Washington, North Carolina]]. While he is known as DeMille (his nom d'oeuvre), his family name was Dutch and is usually spelled &quot;Demil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/autobiographyofc006995mbp/autobiographyofc006995mbp_djvu.txt ''Autobiography of Cecil B. DeMille''] (New York: [[Prentice Hall]], 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Henry Churchill DeMille (1853–1893), was a [[North Carolina]]-born dramatist and lay reader in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], who had earlier begun a career as a playwright, writing his first play at age 15. His mother was Beatrice DeMille ([[née]] Samuel), whose parents were both of German-Jewish heritage. She emigrated from England with her parents in 1871, when she was 18, where they settled in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. According to biographer Carol Easton, Beatrice grew up in a middle-class English household.&lt;ref name=Easton/&gt;

DeMille's parents met while they were both members of a local music and literary society in New York. She was attracted to Henry, a tall, redheaded student who shared her love of the theater. While he was &quot;slender and mild-mannered,&quot; she had dark good looks that &quot;must have seemed to him exotic,&quot; writes Easton. She was also intelligent, educated, forthright, and strong-willed, and they were mutually attracted to each other. They were also both born in 1853. She would later convert to Henry's faith when they married.&lt;ref name=Easton&gt;Easton, Carol. ''No Intermissions: The Life of Agnes de Mille'', Da Capo Press (1996) pp. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt; Henry worked as a playwright, administrator and faculty member during the early years of The [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], established in New York City in 1884. 

In 1893, at the age of 40, Henry contracted [[typhoid fever]] and died, leaving Beatrice with three children, a house, and no savings. Cecil was 11 at the time.  Until Henry's sudden death, they had both loved the theater, and she &quot;enthusiastically supported&quot; her husband's theatrical aspirations. Recognizing his love of the theater and his efforts to become a playwright and producer, she wrote at his funeral,

:&quot;May your sons be as fine and as noble and good and honest as you were. May they follow in your steps . . . &quot;&lt;ref name=Easton/&gt;

Within 8 weeks after the death, to provide an income for the family, Beatrice opened an acting workshop, the Henry C. De Mille School for Girls, in her home. She would later become one of the few successful women theater promoters on Broadway.&lt;ref name=Easton/&gt;

DeMille attended [[Widener University|Pennsylvania Military College]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] from the age of 15. He had an elder brother, [[William C. deMille|William]], and a sister Agnes, who died in childhood. Cecil DeMille's famous [[Agnes de Mille|niece]] was named for her. He is credited with providing its name, and both Cecil (Class of 1900) and William (Class of 1901) graduated from the Academy, which they attended on scholarship. The Academy honored Cecil with an Alumni Achievement Award.

==Broadway==
DeMille began his career as an actor on the Broadway stage in the theatrical company of [[Charles Frohman]] in 1900. His brother William was already establishing himself as a playwright and sometimes worked in collaboration with Cecil. DeMille co-starred with some of the men and women whom he would later direct in films (i.e. [[Charlotte Walker (actress)|Charlotte Walker]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Pedro de Cordoba]], among others). DeMille also served as producer and/or director for many [http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=4709 plays]. Some of these plays were later adapted into silent and sound films. Cecil and his brother occasionally worked with [[David Belasco]]. Belasco was legendary for the way he lit his stage scenes, as well as creating a lurid atmosphere. In 1911, Belasco premiered a play titled ''The Return of Peter Grimm''. DeMille claimed he wrote the play and that Belasco had [[plagiarized]] DeMille's work without compensation. DeMille later adopted many of Belasco's stage lighting and atmospheric techniques in such films as ''[[The Cheat]],'' a move some saw as revenge against Belasco.

==Motion pictures==
[[File:Cecil b de mille directing.png|thumb|Cecil B. DeMille directing]]
DeMille entered films in 1913. He directed dozens of [[silent film|silent]] films, including [[Paramount Pictures]]' first production, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914), which was co-directed by [[Oscar Apfel]], before coming into huge popularity during the late 1910s and early 1920s, when he reached the apex of his popularity with such films as ''[[Don't Change Your Husband]]'' (1919), ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923), and ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927).  A few of his silent films featured scenes in two-color [[Technicolor]].

Cecil B. DeMille had a keen eye for talent and was known for being an instrumental catalyst for the rising status of many a struggling or unknown actor. Actor [[Richard Dix]]'s best-remembered early role was in the silent version of DeMille's ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''. [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]] owed his 1930s movie fame in part to being personally selected by DeMille for the role as the leader of the youth gang in DeMille's poignant, now cult-favorite, ''[[This Day and Age (film)|This Day and Age]]'' (1933). To ensure that Cromwell's character used current slang, DeMille asked [[Horace Hahn]] to read the script and comment (at the time, Hahn was senior class president at Los Angeles High School).&lt;ref&gt;Birchard, Robert S. (2004), Cecil B. DeMille's Hollywood, Lexington, Kentucky: The University Press of Kentucky, p. 262-263, ISBN 0-8131-2324-0&lt;/ref&gt;

DeMille displayed a loyalty to certain supporting performers, casting them repeatedly in his pictures. They included [[Henry Wilcoxon]], [[Julia Faye]], [[Joseph Schildkraut]], [[Ian Keith]], [[Charles Bickford]], [[Theodore Roberts]], [[Akim Tamiroff]] and [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]]. He also cast leading actors such as [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Jetta Goudal]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Paulette Goddard]] and [[Charlton Heston]] in multiple pictures. He was not known as a particularly good director of actors, often hiring actors whom he relied on to develop their own characters and act accordingly.

DeMille had a reputation for tyrannical behavior on the set, and he despised actors who were unwilling to take physical risks. Such was the case with [[Victor Mature]] in ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', when Mature refused to wrestle the lion, though the lion was tame and toothless. (DeMille remarked that Mature was &quot;100% yellow&quot;). [[Paulette Goddard]]'s refusal to risk personal injury in a scene involving fire in ''[[Unconquered]]'' cost her DeMille's favor and probably a role in ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]''. DeMille was, however, adept at directing &quot;thousands of extras,&quot; and many of his pictures included spectacular set pieces, such as the parting of the [[Red Sea]] in both versions of ''The Ten Commandments'', the toppling of the [[Paganism|pagan]] temple in ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', train wrecks in [[The Road to Yesterday]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' and ''The Greatest Show on Earth'', and the destruction of a zeppelin in ''[[Madame Satan]]''.

DeMille was one of the first directors in Hollywood to become a celebrity in his own right. From 1936 to 1944, DeMille hosted and acted as pitchman for Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', a popular dramatic [[radio]] show of the time. [[Gloria Swanson]] immortalized DeMille with the oft-repeated line, &quot;All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up&quot; in [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]],'' wherein DeMille played himself. DeMille also appeared as himself in Paramount's 1947 all-star musical comedy ''[[Variety Girl]]'' and he narrated many of his later films, as well as appearing on screen in the introduction to ''The Ten Commandments''.

DeMille first used three-strip [[Technicolor]] in ''[[Northwest Mounted Police (film)|Northwest Mounted Police]]'' (1940). Following the favorable response to the vivid color photography, shot partly on location in the [[Canadian Rockies]], DeMille decided to always use Technicolor in his films.

While he continued to be prolific throughout the 1930s and 1940s, he is probably best known for his 1956 film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (which is very different from his 1923 film of the same title). Also representative of his penchant for the spectacular was the 1952 production of ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' which gave DeMille an [[Academy award|Oscar]] for best picture and a nomination for best director.

In 1949 or 1950, DeMille was recruited by [[Allen Dulles]] and [[Frank Wisner]] to serve on the board of the [[anti-communist]] [[National Committee for a Free Europe]], the public face of the organization that oversaw the [[Radio Free Europe]] service.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Tim: &quot;Legacy of Ashes,&quot; page 36. Doubleday, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Secretary of the Air Force [[Harold E. Talbott]] sought out DeMille for help in designing the cadet uniforms at the newly established [[United States Air Force Academy]]. DeMille's designs—most notably his design of the distinctive cadet parade uniform—won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are worn by cadets today.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Radford, &quot;A Digger, A Director and A Practical Joker,&quot; ''(Colorado Springs) Gazette'', USAF Academy 50th Anniversary Edition, Spring 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his life, DeMille began pre-production work on a film biography of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell]], the founder of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]] and had asked [[David Niven]] to star in the film, which was never made. Because of illness, he asked his [[son-in-law]], actor [[Anthony Quinn]], to direct a remake of his 1938 film ''[[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|The Buccaneer]]''; although DeMille served as executive producer, he was unhappy with Quinn's work and tried unsuccessfully to remedy the situation. Despite a  cast led by [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Yul Brynner]] and some impressive battle scenes, the film was considered a disappointment by many.

Though DeMille was respected by his peers, his individual films were often criticized by them. &quot;Directorially, I think his pictures were the most horrible things I've ever seen in my life,&quot; said director [[William Wellman]]. &quot;But he put on pictures that made a fortune. In that respect, he was better than any of us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, K.; The parade's gone by...; University of California Press, 1976; p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
[[File:DeMilleTomb.JPG|thumb|175px|right|DeMille's tomb at Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]
DeMille married [[Constance Adams DeMille|Constance Adams]] on August 16, 1902 and had one child, Cecilia. The couple adopted [[Katherine DeMille|Katherine Lester]] in the early 1920s; her father had been killed in [[World War I]] and her mother had died of [[tuberculosis]]. Katherine married [[Anthony Quinn]]. They also adopted two sons, John and [[Richard de Mille|Richard]], the latter of whom became a notable filmmaker, author, and psychologist.

During on-location filming in [[Egypt]] of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] sequence for 1956's ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]],'' the then-73-year-old DeMille climbed a 107-foot ladder to the top of the massive Per Rameses set and suffered a near-fatal [[heart attack]]. Aided by his daughter Cecilia, but against his doctor's orders, he was back directing the film within a week.

He died from [[heart failure]] in January 1959 and was entombed in [[Hollywood Memorial Cemetery]] (now known as [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]). At the time of his death, he was planning to direct a movie about space travel. He also wanted to make a movie on the Biblical book of Revelation. &lt;ref&gt;''Empire of Dreams'' by Scott Eyman, pages: 494-96, 500. Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
A majority of the DeMille motion picture library now resides with [[EMKA, Ltd.]] through the television division of [[NBC Universal]], due to Paramount Pictures' losing the rights to the DeMille films in 1958 to EMKA, so technically it is [[Universal Pictures]] that now oversees a vast part of DeMille's motion picture career as well as its related archival material.  ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', although pre-1950, has been retained by Paramount, as are all the DeMille/Paramount silent films produced before 1928, and all sound films produced after 1950—television distribution for those films is handled by [[Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media]].

The former film building at [[Chapman University]] in [[Orange, California]] is named in honor of DeMille. The [[Lawrence and Kristina Dodge College of Film and Media Arts]] now resides in Marion Knotts Studios.

The [[Golden Globe]]'s annual [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] recognizes lifetime achievement in the film industry.

There are two schools named after him, Cecil B. DeMille Middle school, in [[Long Beach, California]], and Cecil B. DeMille elementary school in [[Midway City, California]].

Al Stewart's single [[Last Days of the Century]] makes reference to him: &quot;You look like a still from Cecil B. DeMille&quot;.

In the film [[Blazing Saddles]], Gene Wilder's gunslinger character says of himself, &quot;I've killed more people than Cecil B. DeMille.&quot;

In the seventh episode of the six season of [[The Sopranos]], where [[Christopher Moltisanti]] is making an attempt to make a movie with [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Silvio Dante]] makes a funny remark by calling him &quot;Cecil B. Moltisanti&quot;.

{{Chinese Islamic cuisine}}

[[Image:5838-Linxia-City-Tuanjie-Lu-halal-bakery.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Halal Bakery in Tuanjie St, the main street of Linxia City.]]

'''Chinese Islamic cuisine''' ({{zh-full
 | {{zh-simp|清真菜}}
 | {{zh-trad|清真菜}}
 | {{zh-pinyin|qīngzhēncài}}
 | {{zh-wade|}}
}}) or ({{zh-full
 | {{zh-simp|回族菜}}
 | {{zh-trad|回族菜}}
 | {{zh-pinyin|huízúcài}}
 | {{zh-wade|}}
}}) is the cuisine of the [[Hui people|Hui]] (ethnic Chinese Muslims) and other Muslims living in the [[People's Republic of China]].

==History==
[[File:Muslim meat shop halal sign, Hankow China, 1935.jpg|thumb|right|A halal meat store sign in Hankou, ca. 1934-1935.]]
Due to the large [[Muslim]] population in western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to, or are run by, Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in [[China proper]]. It is heavily influenced by [[Beijing cuisine]], with nearly all cooking methods identical, and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home [[Beijing cuisine]], however seldom in east coast restaurants.

Traditionally, there is a distinction between northern and southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both utilizing [[mutton]] and lamb. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese, and shrimp are rare in comparison to southern China due to the arid climate of northern China.

A Chinese Islamic restaurant (清真菜館 mandarin: qīngzhēn càiguǎn) can be similar to a [[Mandarin cuisine|Mandarin restaurant]] with the exception that there is no [[pork]] on the menu and is primarily noodle/soup based. The Chinese word for [[halal]] is &quot;pure truth&quot; (清真, {{zh|p=qīngzhēn}}) food (菜, cài), so a Chinese Islamic restaurant is a &quot;qingzhen restaurant&quot; that serves &quot;qingzhen&quot; food. 

In most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]]), they primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as pictures of Islamic [[Carpet|rug]]s and Arabic writing.  

Another difference is that [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. ([[Chinese Islamic cuisine#Image gallery|Refer to image 1]].)

Many cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or western Chinese minorities), typically labeled &quot;qingzhen.&quot; Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim, and will allow access to these dining areas, or will allow access on special occasions such as the [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] feast following [[Ramadan]].

Several Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TbZuVatiFIUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dru+c+gladney&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TV4OTaLXHoO78gbP7vCXDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=los%20angeles%20restaurants&amp;f=false|title=Dislocating China: reflections on Muslims, minorities, and other subaltern subjects|author=Dru C.

Many Halal Chinese restaurants exist in [[New York City]], owned by [[Hui people|Hui]] brothers. However, they do not serve specialized Hui dishes, only Halal versions of ordinary Chinese food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where's the Pork? Not Here.|author=JANE H. LII|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/07/nyregion/where-s-the-pork-not-here.html?pagewanted=3|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 7, 1997|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some Halal Chinese food stalls and street vendors in Flushing, Queens that specialize in items such as bing, lamb chuanr, soft tofu, and side dishes typical of Halal eateries in China.

==Famous dishes==
===Lamian===
{{main|lamian}}
'''Lamian''' ([[Chinese Islamic cuisine#Image gallery|Refer to image 2]].) ({{zh|s=拉面|t=拉麵|p=lāmiàn}}) is a Chinese dish of hand-made noodles, usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup (湯麵 tāngmiàn), but sometimes stir-fried (炒麵 chǎomiàn) and served with a tomato-based sauce. Literally, 拉 (lā) means to pull or stretch, while 麵 (miàn) means noodle. The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce a single very long noodle.

===Chuanr===
{{main|Chuanr}}
'''Chuanr''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] :串儿, [[pinyin]]: chuànr (shortened from &quot;chuan er&quot;); ''&quot;kebab&quot;''), originating in the [[Xinjiang]] (新疆) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in [[Beijing]]. It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] (维吾尔) people and other [[Islam in China|Chinese Muslims]]. Yang rou chuan, or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.

===Beef noodle soup===
{{main|Beef noodle soup}}
'''Beef noodle soup''' ([[Chinese Islamic cuisine#Image gallery|Refer to image 3]].) is a [[noodle soup]] dish composed of stewed [[beef]], beef broth,  [[vegetable]]s and [[wheat noodle]]s. It exists in various forms throughout [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The most common [[Vietnam]]ese version is called [[Bo kho]], but which uses [[rice noodle]]s instead. It was created by the Hui people during the [[Tang Dynasty]] of [[China]].

In the West, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.

===Suan cai===
{{main|Suan cai}}
Suan cai or Chinese Sauerkraut is a traditional Chinese cuisine vegetable dish used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although ''suan cai'' is not exclusively Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially [[beef noodle soup]].

===Nang===
''Nang'' 馕 - A type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame - similar to South and Central Asia [[naan]].

'''Cantonese cuisine''' comes from [[Guangdong Province]] in southern [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hsiung&quot;&gt;Hsiung, Deh-Ta. Simonds, Nina. Lowe, Jason. [2005] (2005). The food of China: a journey for food lovers. Bay Books. ISBN 978-0681025844. p17.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the regional varieties of Chinese cuisine, Cantonese is one of the most well-known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hsiung&quot; /&gt;  Its prominence outside China is due to the great numbers of early emigrants from Guangdong.  In China, too, it enjoys great prestige among the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]], and Cantonese chefs are highly sought after throughout the country.

==Background==
{{Cuisine of China}}
Cantonese cuisine draws upon a great diversity of ingredients as Canton has long been a trading port, bringing it many imported foods and ingredients. Besides pork, beef, and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including organ meats, chicken feet, duck tongue, snakes, and snails. However, lamb and goat is rarely eaten, unlike in cuisines of Northern or Western China. Many cooking methods are used, [[steaming]] and [[Stir frying|stir-frying]] being the most favored due to their convenience and rapidity, and their ability to bring out the flavor of the freshest ingredients. Other techniques include shallow frying, double boiling, braising, and [[deep frying]].

For many traditional Cantonese cooks, the flavors of a finished dish should be well balanced, and never greasy. Also, spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavors of the primary ingredients, and these primary ingredients in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. Interestingly, there is no widespread use of fresh [[herb]]s in Cantonese cooking (and most other regional Chinese cuisines in fact), contrasting with the liberal usage seen in [[European cuisine|European]] and other [[Asian cuisine]]s such as [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] or [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]]. [[Garlic chives]] and [[coriander|coriander leaves]] are notable exceptions, although the latter tends to be mere garnish in most dishes.

== Foods ==
=== Sauces and condiments ===
[[Image:Baby kailan chinese.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Blanched [[kai-lan]] (芥蘭) with oyster sauce]]
In Cantonese cuisine a number of ingredients such as [[Spring onion]], [[sugar]], [[salt]], [[Soy_sauce#Chinese_soy_sauce|soy sauce]], [[Huangjiu|rice wine]], [[cornstarch]], [[vinegar]], [[scallion oil]], and [[sesame oil]] suffice to enhance flavor, though garlic is used heavily in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit [[unpleasant odor]]s. [[Ginger]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[five-spice powder]], powdered [[black pepper|white pepper]], [[star anise]] and a few other spices are used, but often sparingly.

===Dried and preserved ingredients===
Though Cantonese cooks pay much attention to the freshness of their primary cooking ingredients, Cantonese cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add a depth of flavour to a dish. This may be an influence from [[Hakka cuisine]], since the [[Hakka people|Hakkas]] were once a dominant group occupying [[History of Hong Kong under Imperial China|Imperial Hong Kong]] and other southern territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot;&gt;Barber, Nicola. [2004] (2004) Hong Kong. Gareth Stevens Publishing. ISBN 0836851986&lt;/ref&gt;

Some items gain very intense flavors during the [[Drying (food)|drying]]/[[Food preservation|preservation]]/[[oxidation]] process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to [[Hydrate|rehydrate]] before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served individually, and need to go with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.

===Traditional dishes===
A number of dishes have been part of Cantonese cuisine since the earliest territorial establishments of Guangdong province. While many of these are on the menus of typical [[Cantonese restaurant]]s, some are more commonly found in Chinese homes due to their simplicity. Home-made Cantonese dishes are usually served with plain [[white rice]].

===Deep fried dishes===
[[Image:Zhaliang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cha Leung, a common Cantonese breakfast]]
There are a small number of deep-fried dishes in Cantonese cuisine, and these can often be found as [[street food]]. They have been extensively documented throughout [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)|Colonial Hong Kong]] records in the 19th to 20th century. A few are synonymously associated with Cantonese breakfast and lunch.,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wordie&quot;&gt;Wordie, Jason. [2002] (2002) Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press. ISBN 962-2095631&lt;/ref&gt; though these are also expected to be part of other cuisines.

=== Slow-cooked soup ===
Another notable Cantonese speciality is slow-cooked soup, or lo foh tong (老火湯) in the Cantonese dialect (literally meaning ''old fire-cooked soup''). The soup is usually a clear [[broth]] prepared by simmering meat and other ingredients over a low heat for several hours. Chinese herbs or medicine are often used as ingredients. Slow-cooked soup is a regular dish in Cantonese families as most believe in its ability to heal and strengthens one's health.

Due to long preparation hours of slow-cooked soup, soup chain stores or delivery outlets became popular in Cantonese-dominated cities such as Hong Kong.

=== Seafood ===
Due to [[Guangdong]]'s location on the southern coast of [[China]], fresh live seafood is a specialty&lt;!-- Many cuisines have this exact same specialty.  Does this mean that it is prominent? --&gt; in Cantonese cuisine. Many authentic restaurants maintain live [[Aquarium|seafood tanks]]. From the Cantonese perspective, strong spices are added only to stale&lt;!-- Huh, Cantonese people eat stale seafood?  [[Stale]] only affects starch.  --&gt; seafood to cover the rotting&lt;!-- How does this rotting get absorbed by the seafood --&gt; odor. The freshest seafood is odorless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, it is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of [[soy sauce]], [[ginger]], and [[spring onion]] is added to steamed [[fish]]. Apparently, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. However, most restaurants would gladly get rid of their stale&lt;!-- How can seafood be stale. --&gt; seafood inventory by offering dishes loaded with garlic and spices. As a rule of thumb in Cantonese dining, the spiciness of a dish is usually inversely proportional to the freshness of the ingredients.

=== Noodle dishes ===
Noodles are either in soup broth or fried. Some noodle dishes are Cantonized. These are available as home-cooked meals, on [[dim sum]] side menus, or as street food at [[dai pai dong]], where they can be served with a variety of accompaniments such as [[fish ball]]s, [[beef ball]]s, or [[fish slice]]s.

===燒味 (Siu mei)===
{{main|Siu mei}}
[[Siu mei]] is essentially the Chinese [[rotisserie]] style of cooking. Unlike most other Cantonese dishes, Siu mei consists only of meat, with no vegetables. It creates a unique, deep [[barbecue]] flavor that is usually enhanced by a flavorful sauce; a different sauce is used for each meat.

[[Lou mei]] is the name given to dishes made from the [[offal|internal organs]], [[entrail]]s and left-over parts of animals. It is grouped under Siu laap (燒臘) as part of Cantonese cuisine. It is widely available in Southern Chinese regions.

===Siu laap===
Just about all the Cantonese-style cooked meat including [[siu mei]], [[lou mei]] and preserved meat can be mixed together under the generic name (燒臘, Siu laap). ''Siu laap'' also includes foods such as:

===Little pan rice===
Little pan rice ([[wikt:煲|煲]][[wikt:仔|仔]][[wikt:飯|飯]], bou1 zai2 faan6) are dishes that are cooked and served in a flat-bottomed pan (as opposed to a round-bottomed [[wok]]). Usually it is a [[Cookware and bakeware|saucepan]] or [[braising]] [[Clay pot cooking|pan]]. Such dishes are cooked by covering and steaming, making the rice and ingredients very hot and soft. Usually the ingredients are layered on top of the rice with little to no mixing in between. Quite a number of ingredients are used with many standard combinations.

===Banquet/night dishes===
There are a number of dishes that are often served in Cantonese restaurants exclusively during dinner. Traditionally [[dim sum]] restaurants stop serving [[bamboo]]-basket dishes after [[yum cha]] hour and begin offering an entirely different menu in the evening. Some dishes are more standard while others are quite regional. Some are customized for special purposes such as [[Chinese marriage]]s or [[banquet]]s. Salt and pepper dishes are one of the few spicy dishes.

===Dessert===
After a night meal or dish, Cantonese restaurants usually offer [[tong sui]], or sweet soups [literally meaning ''sugar water'']. Many of the varieties are shared between Cantonese and other Chinese cuisines. Some desserts are more traditional, while others are more recent. Higher-end restaurants usually offer their own blend and customization of desserts.

===Delicacies===
There are some dishes that are prized within the culture. These dishes range from being relatively affordable to very expensive. Most of these have been around in the [[Far East]] for a long time, while some are becoming available around the world. Many of these prized animals have serious and controversial [[animal rights]] issues, such as the finning of [[Shark cartilage]]s.

==Controversy==
[[Image:HKanimalrightssign.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Posters informing about animal rights in HK]]

===Dog and cat consumption===
One subject of controversy is the raising of [[dog meat|dogs]] and [[Cat meat|cats]] as food in some places in mainland [[China]] centering in the [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]-speaking regions. Eating dogs was common, even from some non-Cantonese parts of the country, in the first half of the 20th century. However, as time goes by the custom is going out of fashion. In [[Hong Kong]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Taiwan]] dog eating has been banned for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Animalasia.org. &quot;[http://www.animalsasia.org/index.php?UID=8HYQ1AS7DGX Animalasia.org].&quot; ''Dog &amp; Cat Eating in China.'' Retrieved on 2009-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the early part of the 21st century, serving dogs as food is illegal and risks ostracism especially from those under the age of 50. This is the result of increasing awareness of animal welfare issues, and within mainland China a growing number of young people have called for its abolition as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abolition of dog meat petition&quot;&gt;[http://www.ccapn.ngo.cn/acpetition.php 伴侣动物保护网络(CCAPN)-拒吃猫狗肉网络签名活动&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Westerners have defended the practice of Chinese serving dogs as a survival tactic in times of [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, Arthur. [1997] (1997). Alas! What Brought Thee Hither: The Chinese in New york, 1800-1950. Fairleigh Dickinson University press. ISBN 0838637043&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese historical records show serving dog as food does have a history going as far back as the [[Shang Dynasty]] as one of the nine varieties of animals that could be eaten. Dogs were raised as food as pigs and chickens were.  One old-style dish found in mainland China that incorporates cat meat is the [[Dragon tiger phoenix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;big1&quot;&gt;Big5.China.com. &quot;[http://big5.china.com.cn/news/zhuanti/zhcx/2007-09/26/content_8955162.htm China.com.cn].&quot; ''Cantonese cuisine.''

Retrieved on 2008-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of December 2008 [[2008 South China animal consumption incidents|a series of dogs and cats were being sold to meat markets in large numbers]].  In Beijing a protest was held to defend the cats.  In South China, a rescue effort was carried out by the [[Animals Asia Foundation]] to rescue the dogs.  About 149 dogs were saved in the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Animalasia.org. &quot;[http://www.animalsasia.org/index.php?UID=OCMBEQ6OOVL Animalasia.org].&quot; ''New year brings hope for Chinese dogs.'' Retrieved on 2009-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the dogs were deceptively sold to consumers as [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] meat, since lamb meat cost more than dog meat yielding higher profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;prc&quot;&gt;PRC [[Guangdong TV]] (新闻在线) December 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===

In 1986, [[Prince Philip]] commented on Chinese eating habits to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] conference saying: &quot;If it has got four legs and it is not a chair, if it has two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot;&gt;Ward, Laura. [2003] (2003). Foolish Words: The Most Stupid Words Ever Spoken. Sterling Publishing Company. ISBN 1856486982&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having the quote presented to a notable organization, it has also appeared in books such as ''&quot;The Most Stupid Words Ever Spoken&quot;'' as it is deemed by some Westerners as a prime example of lack of understanding of foreign culinary traditions in the Western world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot; /&gt; Although, some sources point out that this is a modern Chinese saying used by the Chinese from other regions in reference to Cantonese culinary habits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olszewski&quot;&gt;Olszewski, Wiesław. [2003] (2003). Chiny - zarys kultury. Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu im. Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu. ISBN 83-232-1272-4. p.177 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflated pork===
A 2009 trend in South China is the selling of pork illegally inflated with water during off hour operations using special techniques.  The pork weight is then increased significantly and made to look much healthier than it really is.  The meat is then transported in open air on the back of motorcycles and then sold to consumers the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;prc2&quot;&gt;PRC [[Guangdong TV]] (今日关注) January 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The meat is dubbed by the mainland media as &quot;bad intention pork meat&quot; (黑心豬肉).&lt;ref name=&quot;prc2&quot; /&gt; This mirrors the legal modern practice of adding water to meats in countries such as UK and the USA.

'''Chiuchow cuisine''', '''Teochew cuisine''' or '''Chaozhou cuisine''' or '''Chaoshan cuisine''' ({{zh|c=潮州菜}}) originates from the [[Chaoshan]] region of [[China]] in the north-easternmost area of the [[Guangdong]] province, which includes the cities of [[Chaozhou]], [[Shantou]] and [[Jieyang]]. Teochew cuisine, however, bears more similarities to [[Fujian cuisine]], as which it shares many of the same dishes, than to [[Cantonese cuisine]], under which it is vulnerable to inaccurate categorisation.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} This may be due to Chaoshan and [[Fujian]]'s cultural resemblance and geographic proximity.{{fact|date=April 2011}} 

==Background==
Teochew cuisine is particularly well known for its [[seafood]] and [[vegetarian]] dishes and is commonly regarded as being healthy.  Its use of flavouring is much less heavy-handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and braising, as well as the common Chinese method of stir-frying. Chaozhou cuisine is also known for serving [[congee|rice soup]] (潮州糜 or ''mue''), in addition to steamed rice or noodles with meals. The Teochew mue is rather different from the Cantonese counterpart, the former being very watery with the rice sitting loosely at the bottom of the bowl.

Authentic Teochew restaurants serve very strong [[Oolong]] [[tea]] called [[Tieguanyin]] in very tiny cups before and after the meal. Presented as [[Gongfu tea ceremony|Gongfu cha]], the tea has a thickly bittersweet taste, colloquially known as gam gam (甘甘).

A condiment that is commonly associated with Teochew cuisine is [[Shacha sauce]] (沙茶酱). This popular paste is also used in Fujian and [[Taiwanese cuisine]]. It is made from soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chilis, brill fish, and dried shrimp. The paste has a savory and slightly spicy taste.
As an ingredient, it has multiple uses: 
* as a base for soups
* as a rub for [[barbecue]]d meats
* as a seasoning for [[stir fry]] dishes
* as a component for dipping sauces, for example as used in [[hot pot]] meals
In addition to [[soy sauce]] (widely used in all Chinese cuisines), Teochew cuisine is one of the few regional Chinese that makes use of [[fish sauce]] due to Chaoshan's coastal land. It is used as a flavoring agent (for e.g. in soup), rather than a dip. As an ingredient, [[peanut]]s are a relatively prominent feature in this cuisine; used both in savory dishes and desserts. They can be boiled, fried, roasted, crushed, grounded or even turned into a paste. Peanuts can be used as a garnish or feature in soups, amongst others.

Teochew chefs often use a special stock called [[Asian soups#Traditional soup bases|Superior broth]] (上湯).  This stock remains on the stove and is continuously replenished.  Portrayed in popular media, some Hong Kong chefs allegedly use the same shang tang that is preserved for decades. This stock can as well be seen on Chaozhou TV's cooking programmes of today.
 
There is a notable feast in Teochew cuisine / banquet called &quot;jiat dot&quot; (食桌) which literally means &quot;food table&quot;. A myriad dishes are often served, which include shark fins soup, bird's nest soup, lobster, steamed fish and braised goose.

Teochew chefs pride themselves in their skills of vegetable carving, and carved vegetables are used as garnishes on cold dishes and on the banquet table.

Teochew cuisine is also known for a late night dinner known as &quot;meh siao&quot; (夜宵) locally, or &quot;da lang&quot; (打冷) among the Cantonese.  Teochew people enjoy eating out in restaurants or at roadside food stalls close to midnight before they go to bed. Some [[dai pai dong]]-like restaurants stay open till dawn.

Unlike the typical menu selections of many other Chinese cuisines, Teochew restaurant menus often have a [[dessert]] section.

Many people of Chaoshan origin, also known as Teochiu or Teochew people, have settled in [[Southeast Asia]] during the Chinese Diaspora, especially [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]]; influences they bring can be noted in the [[cuisine of Singapore]] and that of other settlements. A large number of Teochew people have also settled in Taiwan, evident in [[Taiwanese cuisine]].{{fact|date= April 2011}}

|[[Bak kut teh]]
|A hearty soup that, at its simplest, consists of meaty pork ribs in a complex broth of herbs and spices (including star anise, cinnamon, cloves, [[Angelica sinensis|dang gui]], [[fennel|fennel seeds]] and garlic), boiled together with pork bones for hours. Dark and light soy sauce may also be added to the soup during the cooking stages. Some Teochew families like to add extra Chinese herbs such as yu zhu (rhizome of Solomon's Seal) and ju zhi (buckthorn fruit) for a sweeter, slightly stronger flavored soup. These herbs are known to be health-giving. The dish is usually eaten with rice or noodles (sometimes as a noodle soup), and often served with [[youtiao]] (Chinese fried dough sticks). Garnshings include chopped coriander or green onions and a sprinkling of fried shallots. A variation of &quot;bak kut teh&quot; uses chicken instead of pork, which then becomes &quot;chik kut teh&quot;. &quot;Bak kut teh&quot; is particularly popular in [[South East Asia]] countries like [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] (famous in the town of [[Klang]]) where it was brought over with the Chinese diaspora.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{lowercase}}
In [[computational complexity theory]], '''co-NP''' is a [[complexity class]]. A problem &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{X}}&lt;/math&gt; is a member of co-NP if and only if its  [[complement (complexity)|complement]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{X}}&lt;/math&gt; is in the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]'''. In simple terms, co-NP is the class of problems for which efficiently verifiable proofs of ''no'' instances, sometimes called counterexamples, exist.

An example of an [[NP-complete]] problem is the [[subset sum problem]]: given a finite set of integers is there a non-empty subset which sums to zero? To give a proof of a &quot;yes&quot; instance, one must specify a non-empty subset which does sum to zero. The complementary problem is in co-NP and asks: &quot;given a finite set of integers, does every non-empty subset have a nonzero sum?&quot;  To give a proof of a &quot;no&quot; instance one must specify a non-empty subset which does sum to zero, which is easily verified.

'''P''', the class of polynomial time solvable problems, is a subset of both NP and co-NP. P is thought to be a strict subset in both cases (and demonstrably cannot be strict in one case but not the other).  NP and co-NP are also thought to be unequal. If so, then no NP-complete problem can be in co-NP and no [[co-NP-complete]] problem can be in NP.

This can be shown as follows. Assume that there is an NP-complete problem that is in co-NP. Since all problems in NP can be reduced to this problem it follows that for all problems in NP we can construct a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] that decides the complement of the problem in polynomial time, i.e., NP is a subset of co-NP. From this it follows that the set of complements of the problems in NP is a subset of the set of complements of the problems in co-NP, i.e., co-NP is a subset of NP. Since we already knew that NP is a subset of co-NP it follows that they are the same. The proof for the fact that no co-NP-complete problem can be in NP is symmetrical.

If a problem can be shown to be in both NP and co-NP, that is generally accepted as strong evidence that the problem is probably not NP-complete (since otherwise NP = co-NP).  

An example of a problem which is known to be in NP and in co-NP is [[integer factorization]]: given positive integers ''m'' and ''n'' determine if ''m'' has a factor less than ''n'' and greater than one.  Membership in NP is clear; if ''m'' does have such a factor then the factor itself is a certificate.  Membership in co-NP is more subtle; one must list the prime factors of ''m'' and provide a [[primality certificate]] for each one.

[[Integer factorization]] is often confused with the closely related [[primality]] problem.  Both primality testing and factorization have long been known to be NP and co-NP problems.  The [[AKS primality test]], published in 2002, proves that primality testing also lies in P, while factorization may or may not have a polynomial-time algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;

Originally retiring as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], Yeager was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] on the Air Force's retired list 20 years later for his military achievements.

His career began in [[World War II]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942 he entered [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of [[flight officer]] (the [[World War II]] USAAF equivalent to [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officer]]) and became a [[North American P-51 Mustang]] [[fighter pilot]]. After the war he became a [[test pilot]] of many kinds of aircraft and rocket planes. Yeager was the first man to break the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, flying the experimental [[Bell X-1]] at [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 at an altitude of 45,000&amp;nbsp;ft (13,700 m). Although [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] was the first man to fly faster than Mach 2 in 1953, Yeager shortly thereafter set a new record of Mach 2.44.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_252&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; He later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in [[Germany]] and in [[Southeast Asia]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and in recognition of the outstanding performance ratings of those units he then was promoted to brigadier general. Yeager's flying career spans more than 60 years and has taken him to every corner of the globe, including the [[Soviet Union]] during the height of the [[Cold War]].

==Early life==
Yeager was born to farming parents Susie Mae and Albert Hal Yeager in [[Myra, West Virginia]], and graduated from high school in [[Hamlin, West Virginia]]. Yeager had two brothers, Roy and Hal, Jr., and two sisters, Doris Ann (accidentally killed by Roy with a shotgun while still an infant)&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_6&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pansy Lee. His first experience with the military was at the [[Citizens Military Training Camp]] at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], during the summers of 1939 and 1940. On February 26, 1945, Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse, and the couple had four children. Glennis Yeager died in 1990.

The name &quot;Yeager&quot; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|eɪ|ɡ|ər}}) is an Anglicized form of the [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] name, ''Jäger'' (German: &quot;hunter&quot;), and so is common among immigrants of those communities. He is the uncle of former baseball catcher [[Steve Yeager]].{{#tag:ref|Chuck Yeager is not related to [[Jeana Yeager]], one of the two pilots of the [[Rutan Voyager]] aircraft, which circled the world without landing or refueling.|group=N}}

==Career==
===World War II===
Yeager enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on September 12, 1941, and became an aircraft mechanic at [[George Air Force Base]], [[Victorville, California]]. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into [[World War II]] less than two months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Blessed with remarkable 20/10 vision, Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training. He received his wings and a promotion to [[Warrant Officer (United States)#Flight Officer|Flight Officer]] at [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], [[Arizona]], where he graduated from class 43C on March 10, 1943. Assigned to the [[357th Fighter Group]] at [[Tonopah, Nevada]], he initially trained as a fighter pilot flying [[P-39 Airacobra]]s (earning a seven day grounding order for pruning a tree belonging to a local farmer during a training flight),&lt;ref&gt;''Take Off magazine'', Issue 36, p. 991.&lt;/ref&gt; and went overseas with the group on November 23, 1943.

[[File:P51-1 300.jpg|thumb|P-51D-20NA, ''Glamorous Glen III'', is the aircraft in which Yeager achieved most of his aerial victories.]]

Stationed in the [[United Kingdom]] at [[RAF Leiston]], Yeager flew [[P-51 Mustang]]s in combat (he named his aircraft ''Glamorous Glennis''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebudanderson.com/357profileglamorousglend.htm &quot;357th Fighter Group Profile.&quot;] ''cebudanderson.com.'' Retrieved: December 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; after his girlfriend, Glennis Faye Dickhouse, who became his wife in February 1945) with the 363rd Fighter Squadron. He had gained one victory before he was shot down over [[France]] on his eighth mission, on March 5, 1944.&lt;ref name=EscapeEvasion&gt;[http://narademo.umiacs.umd.edu/cgi-bin/isadg/viewitem.pl?item=105467 &quot;Escape and Evasion Case File for Flight Officer Charles (Chuck) E. Yeager&quot;.] ''narademo.umiacs.umd.edu.'' Retrieved: December 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped to Spain on March 30 with the help of the [[Maquis (World War II)|''Maquis'']] (French Resistance) and returned to England on May 15, 1944. During his stay with the ''Maquis'', Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat, though he did help to construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_45&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for helping another airman, who had lost part of his leg during the escape attempt, to cross the [[Pyrenees]].

Despite a regulation that &quot;evaders&quot; (escaped pilots) could not fly over enemy territory again to avoid compromising Resistance allies, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. Yeager had joined a bomber pilot evader, Capt. Fred Glover, in speaking directly to the Allied Supreme Commander, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], on June 12, 1944. With Glover pleading their case, arguing that because the Allies had invaded France, the ''Maquis'' resistance movement was by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops, so there was little or nothing they could reveal if shot down again to expose those who had helped them evade capture. Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from being a decorated combat ace with a good kill record, along with being an airplane maintenance man prior to attending pilot school. In part because of his maintenance background, Yeager also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.

Yeager possessed outstanding eyesight (rated as 20/10, once enabling him to shoot a deer at {{convert|600|yd}}&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_297&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;), flying skills, and combat leadership; he distinguished himself by becoming the first [[aviator|pilot]] in his group to make &quot;[[ace in a day]]&quot;: he shot down five enemy aircraft in one mission, finishing the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter (a German [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]). Two of his &quot;ace in a day&quot; kills were scored without firing a single shot; he flew into firing position against a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman; Yeager later reported both pilots bailed out. Another victory that was not officially counted for him came during the period before his combat status was reinstated: during a training flight in his P-51 over the [[North Sea]], he happened on a German [[Junkers Ju 88]] heavy fighter attacking a downed [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] crew. Yeager's quick thinking and reflexes saved the B-17 crew, but because he was not yet cleared for flying combat again, his gun camera film and credit for the kill were given to his wingman, Eddie Simpson. (Yeager later mistakenly recalled that the credit had given Simpson his fifth kill.)

In his 1986 memoirs, he noted with disgust that &quot;atrocities were committed by both sides&quot; and went on to recount going on a mission with orders from the [[Eighth Air Force]] to &quot;strafe anything that moved&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfgang W. E p454&quot;&gt;Samuel 2004, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;J. Coady p.13&quot;&gt;Coady 2008, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; During the mission briefing he whispered to Major Donald H. Boschkay; &quot;if we are going to do things like this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfgang W. E p454&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;J. Coady p.13&quot;/&gt; He further noted &quot;I’m certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians. But it is there, on the record and in my memory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, pp. 63, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeager was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] while at Leiston and was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Air Force)|captain]] before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on January 15, 1945, and returned to the United States in early February. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose [[Wright Field]] to be near his home in West Virginia. His high flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel [[Albert Boyd]], head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_60&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar===
[[File:Yeager supersonic flight 1947.ogg|thumb|Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947 in the X-1]]
Yeager remained in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] after the war, becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field (now [[Edwards Air Force Base]]) and eventually being selected to fly the rocket-powered Bell X-1 in a [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] program to research high-speed flight, after [[Bell Aircraft]] test pilot [[Chalmers Goodlin|&quot;Slick&quot; Goodlin]] demanded $150,000 to break the sound &quot;barrier.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_121&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;right_stuff_52-53&quot;&gt;Wolfe 1979, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges were along the lines of &quot;Yeager better have paid-up insurance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_157&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeager broke the [[sound barrier]] on October 14, 1947, flying the experimental X-1 at [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 at an altitude of 45,000&amp;nbsp;ft (13,700&amp;nbsp;m). Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, he broke two ribs while riding a horse. He was so afraid of being removed from the mission that he went to a veterinarian in a nearby town for treatment and told only his wife, as well as friend and fellow project pilot [[Jack Ridley]] about it.

[[File:Chuck Yeager.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Yeager in front of the Bell X-1, which, as with all of the aircraft assigned to him, he named ''Glamorous Glennis'' (or some variation thereof), after his wife.]]

On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the airplane's hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch of the X-1. Yeager's flight recorded Mach 1.07, however, he was quick to point out that the public paid attention to whole numbers and that the next milestone would be exceeding Mach 2. Yeager's X-1 is on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's]] [[National Air and Space Museum]]. Yeager was awarded the [[Mackay Trophy|MacKay]] and [[Collier Trophy|Collier Trophies]] in 1948 for his mach-transcending flight, and the [[Harmon Trophy|Harmon International Trophy]] in 1954.

Some aviation historians contend that American pilot [[George Welch (pilot)|George Welch]] broke the sound barrier before Yeager, while diving an [[F-86 Sabre|XP-86 Sabre]] on October 1, 1947, and again, just 30 minutes before Yeager's X-1 flight.{{#tag:ref|
Quote: The capabilities of the Sabre were finally released in June 1948 when the Air Force and North American announced that the XP-86, piloted by George Welch, had broken the sound barrier in a dive. However, the date of Welch's achievement was given as April 26, 1948 with no mention made of his earlier flights.&lt;ref&gt;

This was accomplished by flying to an altitude of approximately 45,000 ft (13,720 m) and with full power applied accelerating to the maximum level flight speed. The aircraft would then be rolled to inverted flight and pulled down until it was pointing straight down at the ground at full power and allowed to accelerate until it was supersonic (Mach 1). Minor buffeting would occur and supersonic flight would be momentarily achieved at approximately 35,000 ft (10,670 m).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061028050426/http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/pdf/SabreMk6.pdf  &quot;Canada Aviation and Space Museum Canadair F-86 Sabre Mk 6&quot;.] ''Canada Aviation and Space Museum''. Retrieved: December 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} There was also a disputed claim by German pilot [[Hans Guido Mutke]] that he was the first person to break the sound barrier, on April 9, 1945, in a Messerschmitt Me 262.

Yeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records. He also was one of the first American pilots to fly a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] after its pilot defected to [[South Korea]] with it due to [[Operation Moolah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Mark|title=From the Danube to the Yalu|year=1954|publisher=Harper|location=New York|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kum-Suk|first=No|title=A MiG-15 to freedom: memoir of the wartime North Korean defector who first delivered the secret fighter jet to the Americans in 1953|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.,|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a [[chase plane]] for the female civilian pilot [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]], a close friend, as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound. However, on November 20, 1953, the NACA's [[Douglas Skyrocket|D-558-II Skyrocket]] and its pilot, Scott Crossfield, became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound. After they were bested, Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfield's speed record in a flight series that they dubbed &quot;Operation NACA Weep.&quot; Not only did they beat Crossfield, but they did it in time to spoil a celebration planned for the [[Wright brothers|50th anniversary of flight]] in which Crossfield was to be called &quot;the fastest man alive.&quot; The Ridley/Yeager USAF team achieved Mach 2.44 on December 12, 1953. Shortly after reaching Mach 2.44, he experienced a loss of aerodynamic control due to [[inertial coupling]] at approximately {{convert|80000|ft|m|abbr=on}}., Yeager lost control of the X-1A. With the aircraft out of control, simultaneously rolling, pitching and yawing out of the sky, Yeager dropped {{convert|51000|ft|m}} in 51 seconds until regaining control of the aircraft at approximately {{convert|29000|ft|m}}. He was able to land the aircraft without further incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_252&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Charles Yeager photo portrait head on shoulders left side.jpg|thumb|]]
Yeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From May 1955 to July 1957 he commanded the [[F-86|F-86H Sabre]]-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport|Hahn AB]], [[Germany]], and [[Toul-Rosieres Air Base]], [[France]]; and from 1957 to 1960 the [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100D]]-equipped [[1st Fighter Squadron (United States)|1st Fighter Day Squadron]] (later, while still under Yeager's command, re-designated the 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron) at [[George Air Force Base]], California, and [[Morón Air Base]], [[Spain]].

In 1962, after completion of a year's studies at the [[Air War College]], he was the first commandant of the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School]], which produced astronauts for [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the USAF, after its redesignation from the USAF Flight Test Pilot School. An accident during a test flight in one of the school's [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104s]] put an end to his record attempts. Between December 1963 and January 1964,&lt;ref name=Crash&gt;[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/NF-104A_crash_site.htm &quot;The Crash of Chuck Yeager's NF-104A&quot;.] ''check-six.com'', December 10, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeager completed five flights in the [[NASA M2-F1]] [[lifting body]].

In 1966 he took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at [[Clark Air Base]], the [[Philippines]], whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in [[South Vietnam]] and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. There he accrued another 414 hours of combat time in 127 missions, mostly in a [[Martin B-57 Canberra]] light bomber. In February 1968, he was assigned command of the [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]], [[North Carolina]], and led the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] wing in [[South Korea]] during the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|''Pueblo'' crisis]].

On June 22, 1969, he was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and was assigned in July as the vice-commander of the [[Seventeenth Air Force]]. In 1971, Yeager was assigned to [[Pakistan]] to advise the [[Pakistan Air Force]] at the behest of [[Ambassador]] Joe Farland.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_391&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the start of hostilities of the [[Bangladesh War]] he is reported to have said that the Pakistani army would be in New Delhi within a week.&lt;ref&gt;Ingraham, Edward C.

===Post-retirement career===
[[File:Edw-yeager-monument-8.jpg|thumb|Monument to Yeager at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]]]
On March 1, 1975, following assignments in Germany and Pakistan, he retired from the Air Force at [[Norton Air Force Base]], but still occasionally flew for the USAF and NASA as a consulting test pilot at Edwards AFB. For his consultant work to the Test Pilot School Commander at Edwards Air Force Base, Yeager was paid one dollar annually, along with all the flying time he wants. The $1 allows him to be covered by workers compensation.

For several years&lt;!-- What years? --&gt;, Yeager was the public face of [[AC Delco]], the automotive parts division of [[General Motors]]. Because of this, AC Delco experienced a sales surge.&lt;!-- anyone have figures? --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_418&quot;&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p.  418.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Yeager was invited to drive the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] [[pace car]] for the [[1986 Indianapolis 500|70th running of the Indianapolis 500]]. In [[1988 Indianapolis 500|1988]] he was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. 

Through the years, Yeager delivered a number of aviation and test pilot related speeches to a variety of groups ranging from test pilots, [[Air Force Association]] banquets, Civil Air Patrol, Experimental Aircraft Association, and even the Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriters (CPCU) National Meeting entitled &quot;Breaking Barriers&quot; in Honolulu in October 1995. Yeager easily adapted his talk to a given audience on the importance of [[stabilator]]s and their role in giving America air combat supremacy. Yeager was enshrined in the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] in 1973, and in 1990, included with the first class of inductees into the [[Aerospace Walk of Honor]].

Yeager made a cameo appearance in the movie ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983). He played &quot;Fred,&quot; a bartender at &quot;Pancho's Place,&quot; which was most appropriate, since of Pancho's Place Yeager said, &quot;if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; His own role in the movie is played by [[Sam Shepard]].

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yeager set a number of light, general aircraft performance records for speed, range, and endurance. Most notable were flights conducted on behalf of [[Piper Aircraft]]. On one such flight, Yeager performed an emergency landing as a result of fuel exhaustion; on another flight he piloted Piper's [[turboprop]] [[Piper PA-42 Cheyenne|Cheyenne 400LS]] to a time-to-height record: FL350 (35,000 feet) in 16 minutes, exceeding the climb performance of a Boeing 737 at gross weight.

Yeager is fully retired from military test flying, after having maintained that status for three decades after his official retirement from the Air Force. On October 14, 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new ''Glamorous Glennis III'', an [[F-15 Eagle|F-15D Eagle]], past Mach 1, with Lt. Col. Troy Fontaine as co-pilot. The chase plane for the flight was an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] piloted by [[Bob Hoover]], a famous air-show pilot, and his wingman for the first supersonic flight. This was Yeager's last official flight with the Air Force. At the end of his speech to the crowd he concluded, &quot;All that I am... I owe to the Air Force.&quot; Later that month, Yeager was the recipient of the ''[[Tony Jannus Award]]'' for his achievements.

==Awards and honors==
In 2004, Congress voted to authorize the President to promote Yeager to the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] on the retired list. In 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] granted the promotion of both Yeager and (posthumously) air-power pioneer [[Billy Mitchell]] to major general. {{#tag:ref|The joint promotion of Yeager and Mitchell was noteworthy as few presidents have authorized retirement promotions. Only Mitchell and [[James Stewart (actor)|Jimmy Stewart]] had previously been recipients of post-retirement promotions.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 108-375 sec 563.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

Yeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by some to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. [[Marshall University]] has named its highest academic scholarship, the [[Society of Yeager Scholars]], in his honor. Additionally, [[Yeager Airport]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], is named after him. The [[Interstate 64]]/[[Interstate 77]] bridge over the [[Kanawha River]] in Charleston is named for Yeager. He was the chairman of [[Experimental Aircraft Association]]'s [[Young Eagles|Young Eagle Program]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Harrison. &quot;Freedom and Responsibility&quot;. ''Sport Aviation'', September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[West Virginia]] honored Yeager with a marker along [[Corridor G (Appalachian Development Highway System)|Corridor G]] (part of [[U.S. Route 119|U.S. 119]]) in his home Lincoln County on October 19, 2006, as well as renamed part of the highway the ''Yeager Highway''.&lt;ref name=YeagerComesHome&gt;[http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=15274 &quot;Yeager Comes Home&quot;.] ''[[WOWK-TV]]'', August 19, 20.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeager is an Honorary Board Member of the humanitarian organization [[Wings of Hope (charity)|Wings of Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wings-of-hope.org &quot;Chuck Yeager&quot;.] ''Wings of Hope''. Retrieved: December 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2009, [[Governor Schwarzenegger]] and [[Maria Shriver]] announced that Yeager would be one of 13 [[California Hall of Fame]] inductees in [[The California Museum]]'s yearlong exhibit. The induction ceremony was on December 1, 2009 in [[Sacramento]], California.

Yeager served on the [[Rogers Commission]] that investigated the explosion of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] on [[STS-51-L]]. The Sacramento ABC affiliate sent a crew to Yeager's home, a few miles northeast of the city, following disaster's coverage on [[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]].Yeager provided a voice of calm, confidence, and understanding during the interview, saying &quot;they [NASA] have all the telemetry data available to understand what happened, and it will be just a matter of time to analyze it,&quot; while noting the risk accepted by crews in aeronautical flight tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.456fis.org/CHUCK_YEAGER_BIOGRAPHY.htm &quot;Brigadier General Charles E.

{{further|[[Cajun]]}}
'''Cajun cuisine''' (in French: ''Cuisine Acadienne'') is the style of cooking named for the French-speaking [[Acadian]] or &quot;Cajun&quot; immigrants deported by the British from [[Acadia]] in [[Canada]] to the [[Acadiana]] region of [[Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]]. It is what could be called a rustic cuisine &amp;mdash; [[local food|locally available ingredients]] predominate, and preparation is simple. An authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed [[rice]], skillet [[cornbread]], or some other grain dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available.

The aromatic vegetables [[bell pepper]], [[onion]], and [[celery]] are called by some chefs the [[Holy trinity (cuisine)|holy trinity]] of Creole and Cajun cuisines. Finely diced and combined in cooking, the method is similar to the use of the ''[[Mirepoix (cuisine)|mire poix]]'' in traditional [[French cuisine]] — which blends finely diced onion, celery, and [[carrot]]. Characteristic seasonings include [[parsley]], [[bay leaf]], [[scallion|green onions]], and dried [[cayenne pepper]].

==History==
Acadian refugees, who largely came from what is now modern-day [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] adapted their French rustic cuisine to local ingredients such as [[rice]], [[crayfish|crawfish]], [[sugar cane]], and [[sassafrass]]. Cajun cuisine heavily relied on game meats supplemented with rice or corn. Other than [[African cuisine|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cuisines, [[French cuisine|French]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]], and [[Indian cuisine|South Asian Indian]] culinary influences can also be detected in Cajun food. Another feature of the cuisine was the frequent use of smoked meats. Smoked meats are a common aspect of many Cajun dishes.

==Cooking methods==
*[[Barbecue]]ing - similar to &quot;slow and low&quot; Southern barbecue traditions, but with Cajun seasoning.
**[[Baking]] - direct and indirect dry heat in a furnace or oven, faster than smoking but slower than grilling.
**[[Grilling]] - direct heat on a shallow surface, fastest of all variants; sub-variants include:
***[[Charbroiling]] - direct dry heat on a solid surface with wide raised ridges.
***[[Gridiron (cooking)|Gridironing]] - direct dry heat on a solid or hollow surface with narrow raised ridges.
***[[Griddle|Griddling]] - direct dry or moist heat along with the use of oils and butter on a flat surface.
**[[Braising]] - combining a direct dry heat charbroil-grill or gridiron-grill with a pot filled with broth for direct moist heat, faster than smoking but slower than regular grilling and baking; time starts fast, slows down, then speeds up again to finish.
*[[Boiling]] - as in boiling of crabs, crawfish, or shrimp, in seasoned liquid.
*[[Deep frying]]
*[[Étouffée]] - cooking a vegetable or meat in its own juices, similar to [[braising]] or what in New Orleans is called &quot;smothering&quot;.
*[[Pan-Broiling]], also known as pan-frying.
*Injecting - using a large [[syringe]]-type setup to place seasoning deep inside large cuts of meat. This technique is much newer than the others on this list, but very common in [[Cajun Country]]
*[[Stewing]], also known as ''fricassée''.

[[Deep-frying]] of [[Turkey_(bird)|turkey]]s or oven-roasted [[turducken]]s entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
,&lt;br&gt;'

==Ingredients==
The following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the [[Staple food|staple ingredients]] of the Acadian food culture.

===Grains===
[[Image:Cajun woman hulling rice.jpg|thumb|right|180px|c. 1938 Cajun woman using crude mortar and pestle in process of hulling rice. Near [[Crowley, Louisiana]].]]

*[[Maize|Corn]]
*[[Rice]] — long, medium, or short grain white; also popcorn rice
:Rice proved to be a valuable commodity in early Acadiana. With an abundance of water and a hot, humid climate, rice could be grown practically anywhere in the region, and grew wild in some areas. Rice became the predominant starch in the diet, easy to grow, store, and prepare. The oldest rice mill in operation in the United States, the Conrad Rice Mill, is located in [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].
*[[Wheat]] (for baking bread)

===Fruits and vegetables===
*[[Bell pepper]]s
*[[Blackberry|Blackberries]]
*[[Cayenne pepper]]s
*[[Celery]]
*[[Cucumbers]]
*[[Ficus|Fig]]s
*[[Lime (fruit)|Limes]]
*[[Lemon]]s
*[[Chayote|Mirlitons]] (also called chayotes or vegetable pears)
*[[Muscadine]]s
*[[Okra]]
*[[Onion]]s
*[[Pecan]]s
*[[Satsuma (fruit)|Satsuma Oranges]]
*[[Scallion]]s (also known as green onions or onion tops)
*[[Squash (plant)|Squash]]
*[[Strawberry|Strawberries]]
*[[Sweet potato]]es
*[[Tabasco pepper]]
*[[Tomato]]es

===Meat and seafood===
Cajun folkways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and [[Mass production|mass-produced]] meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or [[duck confit]] (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.

Game (and [[hunting]]) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.

The recent increase of [[catfish]] farming in the [[Mississippi Delta]] has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species) and redfish.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; width:48%;&quot;&gt;
'''Seafood'''
*Freshwater &lt;!--Please add more--&gt;
**[[Bass (fish)|Bass]] (Commonly known as green trout in south Louisiana)
**[[Catfish]]
**[[White perch|Sac-au-Lait]] (white perch or crappie)
**[[Yellow perch]]
*Saltwater or brackish water species
**[[Cynoscion nebulosus|Trout]]
**[[Red Drum|Redfish]]
**[[Pompano]]
**[[Sciaenidae|Drumfish]]
**[[Flounder]]
**[[Grouper]]
**[[Perch]] - many varieties
**[[Lutjanidae|Snapper]] - many varieties
*Shellfish
**[[Crayfish|Crawfish]]- either wild swamp or farm-raised
**[[Shrimp]]
**[[Oysters]]
**[[Callinectes sapidus|Blue Crab]]
Also included in the seafood mix are some so-called [[trash fish]] that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods. These were brought home by fishermen to feed the family. Examples are garfish, black drum also called gaspergou or just &quot;goo&quot;, croaker, and bream.

'''Poultry'''
*Farm Raised
**[[Turkey (bird)|Turkey]] (and turkey confit)
**[[Chicken]] (and Guinea Hen)
*Game birds
**[[Dove]]
**[[Goose]]
**[[Quail]]
**[[Duck]] (and duck confit)
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; width:48%;&quot;&gt;
'''Pork'''
*[[Andouille]] - a spicy dry smoked sausage, characterized by a coarse-ground texture
*[[Boudin]] - a fresh sausage made with green onions, pork, and rice. Pig's blood is sometimes added to produce &quot;boudin rouge&quot;.
*Chaurice, similar to the Spanish [[chorizo]]
*Chaudin - a pig's stomach, stuffed with spiced pork &amp; smoked. Also known as ponce.
*[[Ham hock]]s
*[[Head cheese]]
*Gratons - hog cracklings or pork rinds; fried, seasoned pork fat &amp; skin, sometimes with small bits of meat attached. Similar to the Spanish chicharrones.
*Pork sausage (fresh) - not smoked or cured, but highly seasoned. Mostly used in gumbos. The sausage itself does not include rice, separating it from boudin.
*Salt Pork
*[[Tasso ham|Tasso]] - a highly seasoned, smoked pork shoulder

'''Beef and dairy'''&lt;br&gt;
Though parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the southern US, although seasoned differently.

Dairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional southern US and New Orleans influenced desserts are common.

'''Other'''
*[[Alligator]]
*[[Frog legs]]
*[[Gros bec]] commonly called Night heron
*[[Nutria]]
*[[Rabbit]]
*[[Turtle]] (farm-raised)
&lt;/div&gt;{{Clear}}

===Seasonings===
[[Image:Woman reaching for garlic.gif|right|frame|c. 1938 Cajun woman reaching for strings of garlic suspended from rafters. Near [[Crowley, Louisiana]].]]

'''Individual'''
*[[Bay leaf]]
*[[Oregano]]
*[[Bell pepper]]s (green or red)
*[[Black pepper]]
*[[Cayenne pepper]]
*[[Celery]]
*[[Garlic]]
*[[Onion]] (bell pepper, onion, and celery used together are known as the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of Cajun cuisine.)
*[[Parsley]], flat leaf
*[[Sassafras]] leaves (dried &amp; ground into the spice known as filé for gumbo)
*[[Sugarcane]], also cane syrup, [[brown sugar]] and molasses
*[[Thyme]]

'''Blended'''
*&quot;Cajun spice&quot; blends such as [[Tony Chachere's]] are sometimes used in Acadiana kitchens, but do not suit every cook's style because Cajun-style seasoning is often achieved from scratch, even by taste. Whole peppers are almost never used in authentic Cajun dishes — ground Cayenne, paprika, and pepper sauces predominate.
*[[Hot sauce]]
*[[Seafood boil]] mix
*Vinegar seasoned with small, pickled, hot green peppers is a common condiment with many Cajun meals.
*[[Persillade]]
*[[Marinade]]s made with [[olive oil]], [[brown sugar]], and [[citrus]] juices
*Various barbecue rubs similar to those in other states

'''Cooking bases'''
*Dark [[roux]]: The Acadians inherited the roux from the French. However, unlike the French, it is made with oil or bacon fat and more lately [[olive oil]], and not butter, and it is used as a thickening agent, especially in gumbo and étouffée. Preparation of a dark roux is probably the most involved or complicated procedure in Cajun cuisine, involving heating fat and flour very carefully, constantly stirring for about 15–45 minutes (depending on the color of the desired product), until the mixture has darkened in color and developed a nutty flavor. A burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable. The scent of a good roux is so strong that even after leaving one's house the smell of roux is still embedded in one's clothes until they are washed{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. The scent is so strong and recognizable that others are able to tell if one is making a roux, and often infer that one is making a gumbo.
*Light [[roux]]: The secret to making a good gumbo is pairing the roux with the protein. A dark roux, with its strong (dense) nutty flavor will completely overpower a simple seafood gumbo, but is the perfect compliment to a gumbo using chicken, sausage. crawfish or alligator. A light roux, on the other hand, is better suited for strictly seafood dishes and unsuitable for meat gumbos for the reason that it does not support the heavier meat flavor as well. Pairing Roux with your protein follows the same orthodox philosophy as pairing your wine with your protein. Dark meat, dark wine, and dark roux. Light meat, light wine, and light roux. All this to create the fullness of flavor.
*[[Stock (food)|Stocks]]: Acadian stocks are more heavily seasoned than Continental counterparts, and the shellfish stock sometimes made with shrimp and crawfish heads is unique to Cajun cuisine.
**Fish stock and [[Court-bouillon]]
**Shellfish stock
**Chicken stock

==Cajun dishes==
Noted by the popular [[Hank Williams]]' [[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]] song, three of the primary dishes in Acadiana are &quot;Jambalaya and-a crawfish pie and filé gumbo.&quot; One variation is that crawfish boils are more popular today than crawfish pies.

===Primary favorites===
[[File:Smoked Boudin Blanc.jpg|thumb|''Boudin'' that has been [[smoked]].]]
[[File:Gumbo3bg 122499.jpg|thumb|Seafood gumbo]]
'''Boudin'''

[[Boudin]] (sometimes spelled incorrectly &quot;boudain&quot; in Texas)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.answers.com/topic/boudain | title = Boudain, from Answers.com | accessdate = 2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[sausage]] made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic, [[green onions]], and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is usually made daily as it doesn't keep well for very long, even when frozen. Boudin is typically stuffed in a [[Casing (sausage)|natural casing]] and has a softer consistency than other, better-known, sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, [[maque choux]] or bread. Boudin balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the boudin out of the case and frying it in spherical form.

'''Gumbo'''

High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called [[gumbo]]s. Contrary to non-Cajun, or Continental, beliefs, gumbo does not mean simply &quot;everything in the pot&quot;.  Gumbo exemplifies the influence of African and [[Native American cuisine|Native American food]] cultures on Cajun cuisine. The word originally meant ''[[okra]]'', which is a word brought to the region from western [[Africa]]. Okra, which can be one of the principal ingredient gumbo recipes, is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor.

A filé gumbo is thickened with [[sassafras]] leaves after the stew has finished cooking, a practice borrowed from the [[Choctaw]] Indians. The backbone of a gumbo is [[roux]] of which there are two variations: acadian, a golden brown [[roux]], and creole, a dark [[roux]], which is made of flour, toasted until well-browned, and [[fat]] or [[cooking oil|oil]]. The classic gumbo is made with [[chicken]] and the Cajun sausage called [[andouille]], pronounced {ann-doo-wee}, but the ingredients vary according to what is available.

'''Jambalaya'''

Another classic Cajun dish is [[jambalaya]]. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains [[rice]], some sort of meat and almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green [[bell pepper|pepper]]s, [[onion]]s, [[celery]] and hot [[chile pepper]]s. Anything else is optional.

===Food as an event===
'''Crawfish boil'''&lt;br&gt;[[File:Louisiana crawfish.jpg|thumb|Louisiana-style crawfish boil]]
The [[seafood boil|crawfish boil]] is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn over large propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper and other spices, commonly known as &quot;crab boil&quot; or &quot;crawfish boil&quot; are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in spice blends, such as Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry or Tony Chachere's. Also, [[Cocktail sauce]], mayonnaise and [[hot sauce]] sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.

Attendees are encouraged to &quot;suck the head&quot; of a crawfish by separating the abdomen of the [[crustacean]] and sucking out the abdominal fat/juices. 

Often, newcomers to the crawfish boil or those unfamiliar with the traditions are jokingly warned &quot;not to eat the dead ones.&quot; This comes from the common belief that when live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves, but when dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp.
Seafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.

'''Boucherie'''&lt;br&gt;
The traditional pig-slaughtering party, or [http://www.cajuncountry.org/boucherie/  Boucherie], where Cajuns  gather to socialize, play music, dance, and preserve meat does still occur in some rural communities and individual farms, but the use of every last bit of meat, including organs and variety cuts in sausages such as '[[boudin]]' (never correctly spelled boudain) and the inaccessible bits in the head as [[head cheese]] is no still a necessity.

'''Cologne''' ({{IPA-en|kəˈloʊn}}, {{lang-de|Köln}} {{IPA-de|kœln|}}, {{lang-ksh|Kölle}} {{IPA-dedia|ˈkœɫə|}}) is Germany's [[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants|fourth-largest city]] (after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Munich]]), and is the largest city both in the German Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and within the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Area]], one of the major European metropolitan areas with more than ten million inhabitants.

Cologne is located on both sides of the [[Rhine]] River. The city's famous [[Cologne Cathedral]] (''Kölner Dom'') is the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]. The [[University of Cologne]] (''Universität zu Köln'') is one of Europe's oldest universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cologneeconomy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Economy|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/economy|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cologne is a major cultural centre of the [[Rhineland]] and has a vibrant arts scene. Cologne is home to more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The [[Cologne Trade Fair]] hosts a number of trade shows such as [[Art Cologne]], [[imm Cologne]] International Furniture Fair and the [[Photokina]]. Cologne is also well-known for its celebration of the [[Cologne Carnival]], the annual reggae [[summerjam]], and [[Cologne Gay Pride]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cologne}}

===Roman Cologne===
The first urban settlement on the grounds of what today is the center of Cologne was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', which was founded in 38 BC by the [[Ubii]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In 50 AD, the Romans founded Colonia on the [[Rhine]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Cologne History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=From Ubii village to metropolis|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/from_ubii_village_metropolis|publisher=City of Cologne|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city became the provincial capital of [[Germania Inferior]] in 85 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts and figures&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and figures|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/facts_and_figures|publisher=City of Cologne|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was named &quot;''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis''&quot; in 50 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts and figures&quot;/&gt; Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a notable discovery of a 1900 year old Roman boat was made in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18208 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&amp;#39;Cologne Wharf'&amp;#39;, The Megalithic Portal, editor Andy Burnham, 2007 |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 260 to 271 Cologne was the capital of the [[Gallic Empire]] under [[Postumus]], [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marius]] and [[Victorinus]]. In 310 under [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. The imperial governors of Rome resided in the city and became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cologne History&quot;/&gt;

Maternus, who was elected as [[bishop]] in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until occupied by the Franks in 459. In 785, Cologne became the seat of an [[archbishop]]ric.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cologne History&quot;/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
During the time of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]] was one of the seven [[prince-elector]]s and one of the three ecclesiastical electors. The archbishops had ruled large temporal domains but in 1288 [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was defeated in the [[Battle of Worringen]] and forced into exile in [[Bonn]].

Cologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west and was the basis of Cologne's growth. Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Cologne History&quot;/&gt; and became a [[Free Imperial City]] in 1475. Interestingly the archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of [[capital punishment]]. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, which sentence was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge, the so-called &quot;Greve&quot;. This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.

Besides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an outstanding centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's Archbishop [[Rainald of Dassel]] gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they in fact had been captured from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Huffman, ''Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne'' (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterized by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub upon the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organized by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.

[[File:Martyrdom of St Ursula at Cologne.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Cologne around 1411]]
As a free city Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. Wearing a red uniform these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (&quot;Reichskontingent&quot;) and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken - Kölsche Funke rut-wieß vun 1823 e.V. - Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free city of Cologne must not be confused with the Archbishopric of Cologne which was a state of its own within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were taken from the [[Bavaria]]n dynasty [[Wittelsbach]]. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th century, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.

===19th and 20th century===

Cologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French Republic]] (which already had occupied Cologne in 1798). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the River Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernized public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815, at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].

The permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874 during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking refuge in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialization changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing were especially successful, though heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by present-day buildings.

Cologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].&lt;ref name=USM&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&amp;pg=PA254&amp;id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835&lt;/ref&gt; It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung Köln |accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very dense built-up area within the city itself.

During [[World War I]] Cologne was the target of several only minor air raids and survived the hostilities without significant damage. Until 1926 Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] under the terms of the armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 15, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; 
Contrary to the harsh measures taken by French occupation troops, the British acted with more tact towards the local population. The mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and future West German chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially that the British had opposed French plans for a permanent Allied occupation of the Rhineland.

As part of the de-militarization of the [[Rhineland]] the fortifications had to be dismantled. This was taken as an opportunity to create two green belts (''Grüngürtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their clear fields of fire into large public parks. However this project was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was refounded. This re-foundation was considered a replacement for the loss of the German [[University of Strasbourg]] that became part of France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933) and progress was made especially in respect to public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and copied by other German cities. As Cologne competed for hosting the Olympics a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, civil aviation was allowed once again and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic: second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]]. 

The democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and other right wing parties. Thereafter [[KPD|Communist]] as well as [[SPD|Social Democratic]] members of the city assembly were imprisoned and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed by the new holders of power. However, compared to other major cities, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne and the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections was always below the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archivedate=2008-02-11 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919-1933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.

===World War II===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]
During World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the Military District (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[Münster]]. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[Jülich]], [[Düren]], and [[Monschau]]. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.

During the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II]], Cologne endured 262 air raids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=koelnarchitektur |url=http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm |title=on the reconstruction of Cologne |publisher=Koelnarchitektur.de |date=2003-07-15 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the centre of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of &quot;[[Operation Millennium]]&quot;, the first 1,000 bomber raid by the [[Royal Air Force]] in World War II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot, Arthur B. et al. ''Life's Picture History of World War II,'' p. 237. Time Incorporated, New York, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed {{convert|600|acre|ha|0}} of built-up area, killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95%. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. At the end of 1945, the population had already risen to about 500,000 again.

By that time, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war [[Jewish]] population of 20,000 had been deported or killed by the German regime of the time. The six synagogues of the city were destroyed. The [[Roonstrasse Synagogue|synagogue on Roonstraße]] was rebuilt in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgk.de/index.php/historie.html |title=Synagogen-Gemeinde Köln |publisher=Sgk.de |date=1931-06-26 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war Cologne===
Despite Cologne's status of being the largest city in the region, nearby [[Düsseldorf]] was chosen as the political capital of the [[States of Germany|Federal State]] [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the [[Germany#Division and reunification (1945–1990)|Federal Republic of Germany]], Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between the two important political centres of the former [[West Germany]]. The city became home to a large number of Federal agencies and organizations. After re-unification in 1990 Berlin was made the Federal capital of Germany.

In 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the &quot;world's greatest heap of rubble.&quot; Schwarz designed the master plan of reconstruction in 1947, which called for the construction of several new thoroughfares through the downtown area, especially the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' (&quot;North-South-Drive&quot;). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already to a certain degree evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier in times when the majority of downtown lots were undeveloped.

The destruction of 95 % of the city centre including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] like [[St. Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St. Martin]], [[St. Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War II meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks like the [[Gürzenich]] event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St. Kunibert]] was finished.

In 1959 the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1 million for about one year from 1975. It has remained just below that until mid 2010, when it exceeded 1 million again.

===Post-reunification Cologne===
In the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. Firstly, a growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly-developed Media Park, which creates a strongly visual focal point in the Cologne town centre and includes the ''KölnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. Secondly, a permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.

Due to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s are rented out to [[RTL Group|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.

The inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World War II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the &quot;Wiederaufbauzeit&quot; (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.

Green areas account for over a quarter of Cologne which is approximately 75 m² of public green space for every citizen of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Cologne had 4.31 million overnight accommodations booked and 2.38 million arrivals in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cologneglance&quot;/&gt;  The city also has the most pubs per capita in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nightlife&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nightlife|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/nightlife|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has 70 clubs and other party spots. The city has &quot;countless&quot; bars, restaurants and pubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nightlife&quot;/&gt;

===Landmarks===
'''Churches'''
* [[Cologne Cathedral]] (German: ''Kölner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most respected landmark. It is a [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Church (building)|church]], started in 1248, and completed in 1880. In 1996, it was designated a [[World Heritage site]]; it houses the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] that supposedly contains the [[relic]]s of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (see also&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |title=Offizielle Webseite des Kölner Doms &amp;#124; Bedeutende Werke |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as &quot;the eternal construction site&quot; (''Dauerbaustelle'').
* [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St. Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard. With the exception of St. Maria Lyskirchen all of these churches were very badly damaged during World War II. Reconstruction was only finished in the 1990s.

'''Medieval houses'''

The Cologne City Hall (''Kölner Rathaus''), established in the 12th century, is the oldest [[city hall]] in Germany still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cologne.strategicmanagement.net/tuesday.php |title=Strategic Management Society - Cologne Conference - Cologne Information |publisher=Cologne.strategicmanagement.net |date=2008-10-14 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance style loggia and tower were added in the 15th century. Other famous houses include the [[Gürzenich]], Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.

'''Streets'''
{{Main|Streets in Cologne}}
* The [[Cologne Ring]] boulevards (such as ''Hohenzollernring'', ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ring'', ''Hansaring'') with their medieval city gates (such as ''Hahnentorburg'' on ''Rudolfplatz'') are also known for their night life.
* [[Hohe Straße]] (literally: ''High Street'') is one of the main shopping areas and extends past the cathedral in an approximately southerly direction. The street contains many gift shops, clothing stores, fast food restaurants and electronic goods dealers.
* [[Schildergasse]] - connects the ''Neumarkt'' plaza on its west end to the southern end of the ''Hohe Strasse'' shopping street at its east end and has been named the busiest shopping street in Europe with 13,000 people passing through every hour.
* Ehrenstraße - the shopping area around ''Apostelnstrasse'', ''Ehrenstrasse'', and ''Rudolfplatz'' is a little more on the eccentric and stylish side.

===Bridges===
Several bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from South to North): the [[Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge]], Southern Railway Bridge, [[Severin Bridge]], [[Deutz Bridge]], [[Hohenzollern Bridge]], Zoo Bridge (''Zoobrücke'') and [[Cologne Mülheim Bridge]]. In particular the iron [[tied arch bridge|tied arch]] Hohenzollern Bridge (''Hohenzollernbrücke'') is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine river crossing of a special kind is provided by the [[Cologne Cable Car]] (German: ''Kölner Seilbahn''), a cableway that runs across the Rhine between the [[Cologne Zoological Garden]] in Niehl and the [[Rheinpark]] in Deutz.

===High rise structures===
Cologne's tallest structure is the [[Colonius]] telecommunication tower at {{convert|266|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}. The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne are listed below. Other tall structures include the [[Hansahochhaus]] (designed by architect Jakob Koerfer and completed in 1925 - it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at [[Rheinauhafen]] and the [[Messeturm Köln]] (English: ''Trade Fair tower'').

==Culture==
[[File:Kolumba Köln - Innenhof.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Kolumba]] museum in 2007, designed by [[Peter Zumthor]]]]
Cologne has [[List of museums in Cologne|several museums]]. The famous [[Roman-Germanic Museum]] features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]] in Europe, including a [[Picasso]] collection matched only by the museums in [[Museu Picasso|Barcelona]] and [[Musée Picasso|Paris]]. The [[Schnütgen Museum]] of religious art is housed in St. Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]. Several [[orchestras]] are active in the city, among them the [[Gürzenich Orchestra]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]], both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=Kölner Philharmonie |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archivedate = 2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua Köln]], as well as several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor Köln]]. Cologne was also an important centre of electronic music in the 1950s ([[Studio für elektronische Musik]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 90s onward. The public radio and TV station [[WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 70s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Latäng'' (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.

The large annual literary festival [[Lit.Cologne]] features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is writer [[Heinrich Böll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

Cologne is well-known for its beer, called [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]. [[Kölsch dialect|Kölsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.

Cologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (german: ''Kölnisch Wasser''; lit: ''Water of Cologne''), a perfume (or toilet water) created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years and after various court battles his grandson [[Ferdinand Mülhens]] had to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during French occupation in the early 19th century: [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[Mäurer and Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.

===Carnival===
The [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the biggest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11 a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. But the so-called &quot;Tolle Tage&quot; (great days) don't start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'' (Thursday before Ash Wednesday), which is the beginning of the street carnival. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080125230206/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archivedate=2008-01-25 |title=Carnival - Cologne`s &quot;fifth season&quot; - Cologne Sights &amp; Events - Stadt Köln |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Cologne}}

===Road transport===
[[File:Koelner Ring.png|thumb|left|Major [[List of streets in Cologne|roads through and around Cologne]].]]
Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. The first German limited access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a [[freeway]] [[beltway|belt]]. Roughly at the same time a downtown bypass freeway (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße (&quot;Federal Road&quot;) B 55a'' which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' (&quot;Zoo Bridge&quot;) and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A 4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A 3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' (&quot;North-South-Drive&quot;) was actually completed, a new four/six lane downtown thoroughfare, which had already been anticipated by planners like Fritz Schumacher in the 1920s. The last section south of Ebertplatz was completed in 1972.

In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane freeway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn 3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.

Like most German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout designed to be [[bicycle-friendly]]. There is an extensive cycle network, featuring pavement-edge cycle lanes linked by cycle priority crossings. In some of the narrow one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways.

===Rail transport===
Cologne has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity|Intercity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Köln Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Cologne Central Station), ''[[Köln Messe/Deutz station|Köln Messe/Deutz]]'' and ''[[Cologne/Bonn Airport station|Cologne/Bonn Airport]]''. ICE and [[Thalys]] high-speed trains link Cologne with [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]] (in 1h47, 6 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]] and Berlin.

The [[Cologne Stadtbahn|Cologne city railway]] operated by [[Kölner Verkehrs-Betriebe|Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe]] (KVB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvb-koeln.de/ |title=Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB) |publisher=Kvb-koeln.de |date= |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[List of Cologne KVB stations|extensive]] [[light rail]] system that is partially underground (referred to as [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]) and serves Cologne and a number of neighboring cities.

'''Buddhist cuisine''' is an [[East Asia]]n [[cuisine]] which is followed by some believers of [[Buddhism]]. It is primarily [[vegetarian]], in order to keep with the general Buddhist precept of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence). Parts of Ancient [[India]] were also Buddhist, and many Indians remain vegetarian.

Vegetarian cuisine is known as ''zhāicài'' (&quot;(Buddhist) vegetarian food&quot;) in [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]; ''đồ chay'' in [[Vietnam]]; ''shōjin ryōri'' (&quot;devotion cuisine&quot;) in [[Japan]]; ''sachal eumsik'' (&quot;temple food&quot;) in [[Korea]] and by other names in many countries.

[[Jainism]], a religion contemporary to Buddhism, also features a similar cuisine, see [[Jain (Satvika)]].

== Buddhism and vegetarianism ==
{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}
[[Jainism]] recognizes that even eating vegetables could contribute to the indirect killing of living beings because animal life is destroyed by tilling the soil or the use of [[pesticides]]. Jainism consequently considers death by [[starvation]] (only after undergoing 12 years of strict [[asceticism]]) as the ultimate practice of [[non-violence]], while Buddhism considers extreme self-mortification&lt;!-- please clarify this word --&gt; to be [[Middle way|undesirable]] for attaining enlightenment. 

Both [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] thinking is that eating meat in and of itself does not constitute a violation of the [[Five Precepts]] which prohibit one from directly harming life. 

When monks and nuns who follow the Theravadan way feed themselves by [[alms]], they must eat whatever leftover foods which are given to them, including meat. (The Pali/Sanskrit term for monks and nuns means &quot;one who seeks alms&quot;.) The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be [[karma|karmically]] negative. The same restriction is also followed by [[laity|lay]] Buddhists and is known as the consumption of the &quot;triply clean meat&quot; (三净肉). 

On the other hand, when lay communities specifically purchase meat for the consumption of monks and nuns, the permissibility of meat eating differ among Buddhist sects. The Theravada Pali Canon records instances of Buddha eating meat that was specifically purchased for him. This act was deliberately performed by the Buddha to demonstrate that, if need be, a Buddhist can bend the rules in times of emergency or inconvenience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Obstinately observing [[vegetarianism]] or Buddhist rules in times when you cannot conflicts with [[Mahayana]] philosophy because obstinacy or [[Upādāna|attachment]] for anything, is considered to be &quot;stubbornness&quot; (执著), which will become an obstacle to [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]] or enlightenment. However, if one undertakes a vow to be a [[Buddhist vegetarianism|Buddhist vegetarian]], one is expected to follow this vow until it is humanly impossible to continue one's vegetarian diet. 

Acceptance of authenticity of the [[Pali Sutras]] differ within Mahayana sects, and the [[Mahayana sutras]] do not record Buddha eating meat. While no Mahayana sects consider the Pali sutras to be inauthentic, [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] sects tend to consider this particular part of writing in Pali sutras to be false. [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhist]] sects generally accept that Buddha ate meat.&lt;ref name=&quot;gfbv&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Powers | first = John | title = Going forth: Buddhist vision of vinaya - book review &lt;Internet&gt; | url= http://www.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/739.pdf | accessdate=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, both [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating [[Bodhisattvas|Bodhisattvas's]] [[paramita]]. Since Mahayana Buddhists recognise the consumption of meat to be cruel and devoid of compassion, some Mahayana Buddhists are vegetarians. Numbers of Mahayana sutra record Buddha praising the virtue of avoiding meat. However, [[Tibetan Buddhism]] believes that [[Vajrayana|tantric practice]] makes vegetarianism unnecessary. All Japanese Kamakura sects of Buddhism ([[Zen]], [[Nichiren]], [[Jōdo shū|Jodo]]) have relaxed Mahayana [[vinaya]], and as a consequence, do not practice vegetarianism but rather [[pescetarianism]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Chinese Buddhism and part of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Buddhism and other food considerations==
{{Cuisine_of_China}}East Asian &quot;Buddhist&quot; cuisine differ from Western vegetarian cuisine in one aspect, that is avoidance of killing plant life. Buddhist [[vinaya]] for monks and nuns prohibit harming of plants. Therefore, strictly speaking, [[root vegetable]]s (such as potatoes, carrots or onion) are not to be used as this will result in death of vegetables.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} Instead, vegetables such as beans or fruits are used. However, this stricter version of diet is often practiced only on special occasions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} 

Some [[Mahayana]] Buddhists in [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]] specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally [[garlic]], ''[[Allium chinense]]'', [[asafoetida]], [[shallot]], and mountain leek, and refer to these as ''wǔ hūn'' (五荤, or 'Five Acrid And Strong Smelling Vegetables') or ''wǔ xīn'' (五辛 or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the [[Brahamajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahamajala Sutra]], the [[Surangama Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] (chapter 8). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the [[Allium|onion]] [[genus]], as well as [[coriander]]. This draws parallels with some sects of [[Hinduism]], who also do not consume pungent tasting foods.

[[Image:Shojin ryori ryuanji.jpg|thumb|250px|left|An example of shōjin-ryōri taken in [[Kyoto]], Japan at the zen temple of [[Ryuanji]].]]The food that a strict Buddhist takes, even if he/she is not a vegetarian, is also specific. For many Chinese Buddhists, beef and the consumption of large animals and exotic species is avoided. Then there would be the aforementioned sanjingrou rule. One restriction on food that is not known to many is the abstinence from eating animal innards and organs. This is known as ''xiàshui'' (下水), and is not to be confused with the term for sewage.

Alcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and &quot;mindfulness&quot;. It is part of the Five Precepts which dictate that one is not to consume &quot;addictive materials&quot;. The definition of &quot;addictive&quot; depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol, [[tobacco]] and [[contraband]] drugs to be addictive.

== Common sources for Buddhist foods ==

Buddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], also known as &quot;seitan&quot; or &quot;wheat meat&quot;, [[soy]] (such as [[tofu]] or [[tempeh]]), [[agar]], and other [[plant]] products.  Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined [[meat analogue]]s in the world.  Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavourings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavourings), whilst having very little flavour of their own.  With the proper [[seasoning]]s, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.

Some of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many [[monastery|monasteries]] which serve ''wu hun'' and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months).  Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic, and/or ''wu hun'' dishes.  Some Buddhists eat vegetarian only once per week or month, or on special occasions such as annual visits to an ancestor's grave.  To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or far-Eastern restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a chicken flavoured soy or wheat gluten might be served instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Tischendorf um 1870.jpg|thumb|Constantin von Tischendorf, around 1870]]
'''Lobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf''' (January 18, 1815 &amp;ndash; December 7, 1874) was a noted [[Germany|German]] [[Biblical]] scholar. He deciphered the ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a 5th century [[Greek language|Greek]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscript]] of the [[New Testament]], in the 1840s, and rediscovered the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'', a 4th century New Testament manuscript, in 1859.

Tischendorf exemplified the [[buccaneer]] image of 19th century [[archaeology]] in his pursuit of unknown manuscripts. Alongside his industry in collecting and collating manuscripts, Tischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873.

==Life==
[[File:Codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus (title).JPG|thumb|right|220px|Title page from facsimile edition of codex Sinaiticus]]

Tischendorf was born in [[Lengenfeld]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], near [[Plauen]], the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the [[University of Leipzig]] where he was mainly influenced by [[Georg Benedikt Winer|JGB Winer]], and he began to take special interest in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism|criticism]]. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Panning, Armin J. [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf Home Tischendorf and the History of the Greek New Testament Text], Milwaukee: Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he took the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]], then became master at a school near [[Leipzig]].

After a journey through southern Germany and [[Switzerland]], and a visit to [[Strassburg]], he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in [[theology]] with a dissertation on the [[recension]]s of the New Testament text — the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars — [[Elsevier]], Knapp, Scholz, and as recent as [[Karl Lachmann|Lachmann]] — whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the received text as used in churches. 

These early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact [[collation]]s of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in [[Paris]], busy with the treasures of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, [[Firmin Didot]], several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the [[Vulgate]]. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bible Researcher&quot;&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/bib-t.html Bible Researcher].&lt;/ref&gt;

From Paris, he had paid short visits to the [[Netherlands]] (1841) and [[England]] (1842). In 1843 he visited [[Italy]], and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to [[Egypt]], [[sinai peninsula|Sinai]], and the [[Levant]], returning by [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]]. In 1844, he paid his first visit to the convent of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery, Mount Sinai|Saint Catherine's Monastery]], on [[Mount Sinai]], where he found, in a trash basket, forty-four pages of what was the then oldest known copy of the [[Septuagint]]. The monks were using the trash to start fires, Tischendorf horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the [[University of Leipzig]], under the title of the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus|Codex Friderico-Augustanus]]'', a name given in honour of his patron, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846 although he kept the place of discovery a secret.

A great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the [[palimpsest]] ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus|Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus]]'', of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the [[Old Testament]] in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been rewritten with other works of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became ''professor extraordinarius'' at Leipzig, and married (1845). He also began to publish an account of his travels in the East (2 vols., 1845–46). 

In the winter of 1849 appeared the great work now titled ''Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit, Apparatum Criticum multis modis'' [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basic rule: &quot;The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and [[Fathers of the Church|fathers]].&quot;
#&quot;A reading altogether peculiar to one or another ancient document is suspicious; as also is any, even if supported by a class of documents, which seems to evince that it has originated in the revision of a learned man.&quot;
#&quot;Readings, however well supported by evidence, are to be rejected, when it is manifest (or very probable) that they have proceeded from the errors of copyists.&quot;
#&quot;In parallel passages, whether of the New or Old Testament, especially in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], which ancient copyists continually brought into increased accordance, those testimonies are preferable, in which precise accordance of such parallel passages is not found; unless, indeed, there are important reasons to the contrary.&quot;
#&quot;In discrepant readings, that should be preferred which may have given occasion to the rest, or which appears to comprise the elements of the others.&quot;
#&quot;Those readings must be maintained which accord with [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]], or with the particular style of each individual writer.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bible Researcher&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, &quot;to clear up in this way,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine [[Twelve apostles|apostolic]] text which is the foundation of our faith.&quot;

In 1850 appeared his edition of the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' and of the [[Septuagint]] version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the ''[[Codex Claromontanus]]''. 

In 1853, he made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]] to find more of the ''Codex Frederico-Augustanus'' or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant — the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' — a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century. 

In 1859 he made a third voyage to the East. There, with the active aid of the [[Russia]]n government, he at length got access to the remainder of the precious Sinaitic codex, and persuaded the monks to present it to the ''[[Alexander II of Russia|tsar]]'', at whose cost it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). By those ignorant of the details of his discovery of the ''Codex Sinaiticus'', Tischendorf was accused of buying manuscripts from ignorant [[monastery]] librarians at low prices. Indeed he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at St. Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the ''tsar''. Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them. In 1869 the ''tsar'' awarded him the style of &quot;von&quot; Tischendorf as a Russian noble. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg. In 1933, the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the British Museum in London, England.

Meanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made ''professor ordinarius'' of theology and of Biblical [[paleography]], this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, ''Aus dem heiligen Lande'', appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.

Besides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both [[Robert Schumann]], with whom he corresponded, and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]] wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the [[University of Glasgow]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Univ Glasgow&quot;&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/collection/tischendorf.html Tischendorf] at the [[University of Glasgow]], Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974.

He died in [[Leipzig]].

His ''magnum opus'' was the &quot;Critical Edition of the New Testament.&quot; 

The great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself ''editio viii''; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from [[stereotype]] plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869–72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]].

Of relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the ''[[Codex Ephraemi]]'', and the ''Friderico-Augustanus'', was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of [[Eberhard Nestle]]'s appendix to the 6th issue (1880). 

Besides this may be mentioned editions of the New Testament [[apocrypha]], ''De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu'' (1851); ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' (1851); ''Evangelia apocrypha'' (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); ''Apocalypses apocryphae'' (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as ''Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?'' (1865; 4th ed., 1866), ''Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?'' (1873), and ''Synopsis evangelica'' (7th ed., 1898).

'''John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.''', (July 4, 1872{{ndash}} January 5, 1933) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|30th]] [[President of the United States]] (1923–1929). A [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawyer from [[Vermont]], Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of [[Massachusetts]] state politics, eventually becoming [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]] of that state. His actions during the [[Boston Police Strike]] of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight. Soon after, he was elected as the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|29th]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon the sudden death of [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government [[Conservatism in the United States#Early 20th century|conservative]], and also as a man who said very little.

Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the [[Warren G. Harding#Administrative scandals|scandals]] of his predecessor's administration, and left office with considerable popularity.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 420–421; Greenberg, 49–53&lt;/ref&gt; As a Coolidge biographer put it, &quot;He embodied the spirit and hopes of the [[middle class]], could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 500&lt;/ref&gt; Some later criticized Coolidge as part of a general criticism of [[laissez-faire]] government.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 418; Greenberg, 146–150; Ferrell, 66–72&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation underwent a renaissance during the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration,&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 12–13; Greenberg, 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is still divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of government programs and those who believe the federal government should be more involved in regulating and controlling the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and family history==
[[Image:JCCoolidgeSr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coolidge's father, [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.]]]]
John Calvin Coolidge, Jr., was born in [[Plymouth, Vermont|Plymouth Notch]], [[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]], [[Vermont]], on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. President to be born on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. He was the elder of the two children of [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.]] (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–1885). Coolidge's chronically ill mother died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when he was twelve years old. His sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), died at the age of fifteen, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father remarried in 1891, to a schoolteacher, and lived to the age of eighty. Coolidge senior engaged in many occupations, and ultimately enjoyed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper and public servant; he farmed, taught school, ran a local store, served in the Vermont House of Representatives and the Vermont Senate, and held various local offices including [[justice of the peace]] and tax collector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,729059,00.html Death Of Colonel John Coolidge, Time Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 17; McCoy, 5; White, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge's family had deep roots in [[New England]]. His earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from [[Cottenham]], Cambridgeshire, England, around 1630 and settled in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=fuess12&gt;Fuess, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Another ancestor, [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]], arrived at Watertown in 1638.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Rice (1638) Association, 2007. Descendants of Edmund Rice: The First Nine Generations. (CD-ROM)&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American military officer in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and one of the first [[Board of Selectmen|selectmen]] of the town of Plymouth Notch.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Coolidge's ancestors were farmers. Other well-known Coolidges, architect [[Charles Allerton Coolidge]], General [[Charles A. Coolidge (general)|Charles Austin Coolidge]], and diplomat [[Archibald Cary Coolidge]] among them, were descended from branches of the family that had remained in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=fuess12/&gt; Coolidge's grandmother Sarah Almeda Brewer had two famous first cousins: [[Arthur Brown (Utah)|Arthur Brown]], a United States [[United States Senate|Senator]], and [[Olympia Brown]], a women's suffragist. It is through Sarah Brewer that Coolidge believed that he inherited [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] blood, but this descent has never been established by modern genealogists.&lt;ref name=mccoy5&gt;McCoy, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career and marriage==
[[Image:CoolidgeAmherst.png|thumb|upright|left|Coolidge as an Amherst undergraduate]]

===Western Massachusetts lawyer===
Coolidge attended [[Black River Academy]] and then [[Amherst College]], where he joined the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 16-20&lt;/ref&gt; At his father's urging, Coolidge moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], after graduating to take up the practice of law. Avoiding the costly alternative of attending a [[law school]], Coolidge followed the more common practice of the time, apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond &amp; Field, and [[reading law]] with them. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to the law practice in the county seat of [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]]. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the bar, becoming a [[country lawyer]]&lt;!--(If a cite is ever requested: http://www.calvincoolidge.us/biography.html )--&gt;. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge was able to open his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced transactional law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 74–81; McCoy 22–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
In 1905 Coolidge met and married a fellow Vermonter, [[Grace Coolidge|Grace Anna Goodhue]], who was working as a teacher at the [[Clarke School for the Deaf]]. While Grace was watering flowers outside the school one day in 1903, she happened to look up at the open window of Robert N. Weir's boardinghouse and caught a glimpse of Calvin Coolidge shaving in front of a mirror with nothing on but long underwear and a hat.&lt;ref name=sobel55&gt;Sobel, 55&lt;/ref&gt; After a more formal introduction sometime later, the two were quickly attracted to each other.&lt;ref name=sobel55/&gt; They were married on October 4, 1905, in the parlor of her parents' home in [[Burlington, Vermont]].

They were opposites in personality: she was talkative and fun-loving, while he was quiet and serious.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after their marriage, Coolidge handed her a bag with fifty-two pairs of socks in it, all of them full of holes. Grace's reply was &quot;Did you marry me to darn your socks?&quot; Without cracking a smile and with his usual seriousness, Calvin answered, &quot;No, but I find it mighty handy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drafthorsejournal.com/daysbeforeyesterday/autumn01/75yearsago/75yearsago.htm |title=75 Years Ago Today|last=Teleen|first=Maurice|date=Autumn, 2001|work=The Draft Horse Journal|&lt;!-- accessdate=2007-05-18 --&gt; |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060518031030/http://www.drafthorsejournal.com/daysbeforeyesterday/autumn01/75yearsago/75yearsago.htm |archivedate = May 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons: [[John Coolidge|John]], born in 1906, and [[Calvin Coolidge, Jr.|Calvin, Jr.]], born in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;White, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was, by most accounts, a happy one.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 89–92; Sobel, 57–58. Some biographers disagree with this rosy portrait, see Ferrell, 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; As Coolidge wrote in his ''Autobiography'', &quot;We thought we were made for each other. For almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities, and I have rejoiced in her graces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coolidge|first=Calvin|title=The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge|publisher=Cosmopolitan Book Corp|year=1929|chapter=Law and Politics|page=93|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/autobiographycal011459mbp#page/n113/mode/2up}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local political office==
===City offices===
The [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was dominant in New England in Coolidge's time, and he followed Hammond's and Field's example by becoming active in local politics.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 49–51&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge campaigned locally for Republican presidential candidate [[William McKinley]] in 1896, and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee.&lt;ref name=sobel51&gt;Sobel, 51&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, he won election to the [[City Council]] of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected.&lt;ref name=sobel51/&gt; The position offered no salary, but gave Coolidge experience in the political world.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 83&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for [[Solicitor#United States|City Solicitor]], a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901.&lt;ref name=fuess84&gt;Fuess, 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer, and paid a salary of $600.&lt;ref name=fuess84/&gt; In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to an exclusively private practice.&lt;ref name=mccoy29&gt;McCoy, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, however, the [[Court clerk|clerk of courts]] for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but barred him from practicing law, so he only remained at the job for one year.&lt;ref name=mccoy29/&gt; The next year, 1904, Coolidge met with his only defeat before the voters, losing an election to the Northampton [[Board of Education|school board]]. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, Coolidge replied &quot;Might give me time!&quot;&lt;ref name=mccoy29/&gt;

===State legislator and mayor===
[[Image:CoolidgeLtGov.png|upright|thumb|Calvin and Grace Coolidge, about 1918.]]

In 1906 the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the state [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. He won a close victory over the incumbent [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and reported to [[Boston]] for the 1907 session of the [[Massachusetts General Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 61&lt;/ref&gt; In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Republican]], voting in favor of such measures as [[women's suffrage]] and the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|direct election of Senators]].&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 62; Fuess, 99&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his time in Boston, Coolidge found himself allied primarily with the western [[Winthrop Murray Crane]] faction of the state Republican Party, as against the [[Henry Cabot Lodge]]-dominated eastern faction.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 63–66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, he was elected to a second term. In the 1908 session, Coolidge was more outspoken, but was still not one of the leaders in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of vying for another term in the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]], Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for [[mayor]] of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1,597 to 1,409.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 72&lt;/ref&gt; During his first term (1910 to 1911), he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 106–107; Sobel, 74&lt;/ref&gt; He was renominated in 1911, and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the [[Massachusetts Senate|State Senator]] for the Hampshire County area retired and encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session. He defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 76&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of that term, Coolidge was selected to be chairman of a committee to arbitrate the &quot;[[Bread and Roses]]&quot; strike by the workers of the [[American Woolen Company]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;''See also the main article, [[Lawrence textile strike]], for a full description.''&lt;/ref&gt; After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands in a settlement the committee proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 110–111; McCoy, 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; The other&lt;!--other than what, the strike? was that really a &quot;major&quot; issue for the national party?--&gt; major issue for Republicans that year was the [[United States presidential election, 1912|party split]] between the progressive wing, which favored [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and the conservative wing, which favored [[William Howard Taft]]. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party.&lt;ref name=progressive&gt;Sobel, 79–80; Fuess, 111&lt;/ref&gt; When the new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.&lt;ref name=progressive/&gt;

The 1913 session was less eventful, and Coolidge's time was mostly spent on the railroad committee, of which he was the chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 111–113&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge intended to retire after the 1913 session, as two terms were the norm, but when the [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|President of the State Senate]], [[Levi H. Greenwood]], considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate in the hopes of being elected as its presiding officer.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated and Coolidge was elected, with Crane's help, as the President of a closely divided Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 80–82&lt;/ref&gt; After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a speech entitled ''Have Faith in Massachusetts'', which summarized his philosophy of government. It was later published in a book, and frequently quoted.&lt;ref name=&quot;havefaithpage2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coolidge|first=Calvin|title=Have Faith in Massachusetts: A Collection of Speeches and Messages|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]|year=1919|edition=2nd|pages=2–9|chapter=To The State Senate On Being Elected Its President|url=http://www.archive.org/details/havefaithinmassa00cooluoft|unused_data=&lt;!-- accessdate=2009-11-07 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Coolidge's speech was well-received and he attracted some admirers on its account.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 90–92&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 90; Fuess, 124&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1915 session ended, Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus [[Frank Stearns]], encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor. This time, he accepted their advice.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 92–98; Fuess, 133–136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lieutenant Governor===
Coolidge entered the [[primary election]] for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate [[Samuel W. McCall]]. Coolidge was the leading vote-getter in the Republican primary, and [[ticket balance|balanced]] the Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall's eastern base of support.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election, with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge's duties as lieutenant governor were few; in Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate, although Coolidge did become an ''ex officio'' member of the governor's cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 150; Sobel, 104&lt;/ref&gt; As a full-time elected official, Coolidge no longer practiced law after 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917 (At the time, both offices were held for one-year terms). When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 107–110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Massachusetts==
===1918 election===
Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor]] of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, [[Channing Cox]], a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], ran on the previous administration's record: [[fiscal conservatism]], a vague opposition to [[Prohibition]], support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 111; McCall, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among [[Irish American|Irish]]- and [[German-American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his state-wide campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 115; McCall, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boston police strike===
{{Main|Boston Police Strike}}
[[File:Coolidge inspects militia.jpg|thumb|right|Governor Coolidge inspects militia]]
In 1919, in response to rumors that policemen of the [[Boston Police Department]] planned to form a [[trade union|union]], Police Commissioner [[Edwin U. Curtis]] issued a statement saying that such a move would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the [[American Federation of Labor]] issued a charter to the Boston Police Union.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 77–79; Sobel, 129&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis said the union's leaders were insubordinate and planned to relieve them of duty, but said that he would suspend the sentence if the union was dissolved by September 4.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor of Boston, [[Andrew James Peters|Andrew Peters]], convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but Curtis ultimately suspended the union leaders on September 8.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 111–113; Sobel, 133–136&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=&quot;toccolours&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; |&quot;Your assertion that the Commissioner was wrong cannot justify the wrong of leaving the city unguarded. That furnished the opportunity; the criminal element furnished the action. '''There is no right to strike against the public safety by anyone, anywhere, any time.''' &amp;nbsp;... I am equally determined to defend the sovereignty of Massachusetts and to maintain the authority and jurisdiction over her public officers where it has been placed by the Constitution and laws of her people.&quot; (emphasis added)

The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike.&lt;ref&gt;The exact total was 1,117 out of 1,544. Russell, 113&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge had observed the situation throughout the conflict, but had not yet intervened. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and [[riot]]ing in the lawless city.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 131–170&lt;/ref&gt; Peters, concerned about [[sympathy strike]]s, had called up some units of the [[Massachusetts National Guard]] stationed in the Boston area and relieved Curtis of duty.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge, furious that the mayor had called out ''state'' guard units, finally acted.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 141&lt;/ref&gt; He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 142&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

That night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader [[Samuel Gompers]]. &quot;Whatever disorder has occurred&quot;, Gompers wrote, &quot;is due to Curtis's order in which the right of the policemen has been denied …&quot;&lt;ref name=sobel143&gt;Sobel, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram with the response that would launch him into the national consciousness (quoted, above left).&lt;ref name=sobel143/&gt; Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to defenders of the public's safety and security. In the midst of the [[First Red Scare]], many Americans were terrified of the spread of [[communist]] revolution, like those that had taken place in [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russia]], [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]], and [[German Revolution|Germany]]. While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star. Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike had given him a national reputation as a man who would take decisive action.

===1919 election===
Coolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his actions in the Police Strike around the state and the nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form.&lt;ref name=&quot;havefaithpage2&quot; /&gt; He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;The tally was Coolidge 317,774, Long 192,673. Fuess, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for President in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 239–243; McCoy, 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 2, 1919, the First World War had ended, and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a $100 bonus to Massachusetts veterans. He also signed a bill reducing the work week for women and [[child labor|children]] from fifty-four hours to forty-eight, saying, &quot;We must humanize the industry, or the system will break down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 117; Fuess, 195&lt;/ref&gt; He signed into law a budget that kept the tax rates the same, while trimming four million dollars from expenditures, thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge also wielded the [[veto]] pen as governor. His most publicized veto was of a bill that would have increased legislators' pay by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 187; McCall, 81&lt;/ref&gt; Although Coolidge was personally opposed to Prohibition, he vetoed a bill in May 1920 that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of [[Near beer#Small beer|2.75% alcohol or less]], in Massachusetts in violation of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. &quot;Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution,&quot; he said in his veto message, &quot;Against it, they are void.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice Presidency==
===1920 election===

{{Main|United States presidential election, 1920}}
At the [[1920 Republican National Convention]] most of the delegates were selected by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses never considered him a serious candidate. After ten ballots, the delegates settled on Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of [[Ohio]] as their nominee for President.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; When the time came to select a Vice Presidential nominee, the party bosses had also made a decision on who they would nominate: Senator [[Irvine Lenroot]] of [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=fuess261&gt;Fuess, 261&lt;/ref&gt; A delegate from [[Oregon]], [[Wallace McCamant]], having read ''Have Faith in Massachusetts'', proposed Coolidge for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] instead.&lt;ref name=fuess261/&gt; The suggestion caught on quickly, and Coolidge found himself unexpectedly nominated.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 262–264&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats nominated another Ohioan, [[James M. Cox]], for President and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], for Vice President. The question of the United States joining the [[League of Nations]] was a major issue in the campaign, as was the unfinished legacy of [[Progressivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 204–212&lt;/ref&gt; Harding ran a &quot;front-porch&quot; campaign from his home in [[Marion, Ohio]], but Coolidge took to the campaign trail in the [[Upper South]], New York, and New England.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 204–207&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 1920, Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide, winning every state outside the South.&lt;ref name=1920election&gt;{{National Archives EV source|year=1920| as of=January 18, 2007}}; {{Leip PV source 2|year=1920| as of=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also won in [[Tennessee]], the first time a Republican ticket had won a Southern state since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name=1920election/&gt;

===&quot;Silent Cal&quot;===
[[Image:HardingCoolidge.jpg|thumb|President Harding and Vice President Coolidge and their wives.]]
The Vice-Presidency did not carry many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, making him the first Vice President to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; He gave speeches around the country, but none were especially noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 219; McCoy, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

As Vice-President, Coolidge and his vivacious wife [[Grace Coolidge|Grace]] were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of &quot;Silent Cal&quot; was born. It is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was therefore commonly referred to as &quot;Silent Cal.&quot; A possibly apocryphal story has it that [[Dorothy Parker]], seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, &quot;Mr. Coolidge, I've made a bet against a fellow who said it was impossible to get more than two words out of you.&quot; His famous reply: &quot;You lose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hannaford, 169&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Parker who, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, &quot;How can they tell?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth]] supposedly once commented that, &quot;He looks as if he'd been weaned on a pickle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pawprints.kashalinka.com/anecdotes/coolidge.shtml Paw Prints Anecdotes]&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, &quot;Got to eat somewhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

As President, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. &quot;The words of a President have an enormous weight,&quot; he would later write, &quot;and ought not to be used indiscriminately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 243&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. &quot;I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President,&quot; he once told [[Ethel Barrymore]], &quot;and I think I will go along with them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did hold a then-record number of presidential press conferences, 520 during his presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;american chronicle&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rouse|first=Robert|date=March 15, 2006|title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference - 93 years young!|journal=American Chronicle|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic,&lt;ref&gt;Kerry W. Buckley, &quot;'A President for the &quot;Great Silent Majority': Bruce Barton's Construction of Calvin Coolidge.&quot; ''New England Quarterly'' 2003 76(4): 593-626.&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening after the death of his son in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Gilbert, &quot;Calvin Coolidge's Tragic Presidency: the Political Effects of Bereavement and Depression.&quot; ''Journal of American Studies'' 2005 39(1): 87-109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency 1923–1929==
===Succession to the Presidency===
On August 2, 1923, President Harding died while on a speaking tour in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;''See the main article, [[Warren G. Harding#Trip to Alaska and death|Warren Harding Death in office]] for a full description''&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his [[Coolidge Homestead|family home]], which had neither [[electricity]] nor a [[telephone]], when he received word by messenger of Harding's death.&lt;ref name=fuess308&gt;Fuess, 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge dressed, said a [[prayer]], and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled.&lt;ref name=fuess308/&gt; His father, a [[notary public]], administered the [[Oath of office#United States|oath of office]] in the family's parlor by the light of a [[kerosene]] lamp at 2:47&amp;nbsp;am on August 3, 1923; Coolidge then went back to bed. Coolidge returned to Washington the next day, and was re-sworn by Justice [[Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr.]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|Supreme Court of the District of Columbia]], as there was some confusion over whether a state notary public had the authority to administer the presidential oath.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 310–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|unused_data=&lt;!-- accessdate=2009-01-28 --&gt;|last=Arbelbide|first=C.

===Finishing Harding's term===
The nation did not know what to make of its new President; Coolidge had not stood out in the Harding administration and many had expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 226–228; Fuess, 303–305; Ferrell, 43–51&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed [[C.

Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice presidential staff, as [[Secretary to the President (US)|Secretaries to the President]] (a position equivalent to the modern [[White House Chief of Staff]]).&lt;ref name=fuess320&gt;Fuess, 320–322&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge announced that he would not demand any of their resignations, believing that since the people had elected Harding, he should carry on Harding's presidency, at least until the next election.&lt;ref name=fuess320/&gt;
[[Image:CalvinCoolidgeimmigration3.jpg|thumb|Coolidge signing the Immigration Act and some appropriation bills. General [[John J. Pershing]] looks on.]]
He addressed Congress when it reconvened on December 6, 1923, giving a speech that echoed many of Harding's themes, including [[Immigration Act of 1924|immigration restriction]] and the need for the government to arbitrate the coal strikes then ongoing in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 328–329; Sobel, 248–249&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge's speech was the first Presidential speech to be broadcast to the nation over the radio&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2033264 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] was proclaimed just one month into Coolidge's term, and was generally well received in the country.&lt;ref name=fuess320/&gt; In May 1924, the World War I veterans' [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] or &quot;Bonus Bill&quot; was passed over his veto.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 341&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge signed the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Act]] later that year, though he appended a [[signing statement]] expressing his unhappiness with the bill's specific exclusion of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 342; Sobel, 269&lt;/ref&gt; Just before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed into law the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], which decreased personal [[income tax]] rates while increasing the [[estate tax]], and creating a [[gift tax]] to reinforce the transfer tax system.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 278–279&lt;/ref&gt;

===1924 election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1924}}
[[Image:ElectoralCollege1924.svg|thumb|300px|right|Electoral votes by state, 1924]]
The [[1924 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] was held from June 10–12, 1924 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]; President Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 345&lt;/ref&gt; The convention nominated [[Frank Orren Lowden|Frank Lowden]] of [[Illinois]] for Vice President on the second ballot, but he declined by telegram.&lt;ref name=fuess346&gt;Fuess, 346&lt;/ref&gt; Former Brigadier General [[Charles G. Dawes]], who would win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1925, was nominated on the third ballot; he accepted.&lt;ref name=fuess346/&gt;

The Democrats held their [[1924 Democratic National Convention|convention]] from June 24 to July 9 in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, [[John W. Davis]], with [[Charles W. Bryan]] nominated for Vice President. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], a Republican Senator from [[Wisconsin]], split from the party to form a new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]]. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JohnWDaviscropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John W. Davis]]Shortly after the conventions Coolidge experienced a personal tragedy. Coolidge's younger son, Calvin, Jr., developed a blister from playing tennis on the [[White House]] courts. The blister became infected, and within days Calvin, Jr. developed [[sepsis]] and died. After that Coolidge became withdrawn. He later said that &quot;when he died, the power and glory of the Presidency went with him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coolidge|first=Calvin|title=The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge|publisher=Cosmopolitan Book Corp|year=1929|chapter=The Presidency|page=190|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/autobiographycal011459mbp#page/n213/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his sadness, Coolidge ran his conventional campaign; he never maligned his opponents (or even mentioned them by name) and delivered speeches on his theory of government, including several that were broadcast over radio.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 300–301&lt;/ref&gt; It was easily the most subdued campaign since 1896, partly because the President was grieving for his son, but partly because Coolidge's style was naturally non-confrontational.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; The other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion, but despite the split in the Republican party, the results were very similar to those of 1920. Coolidge and Dawes won every state outside the South except for Wisconsin, La Follette's home state. Coolidge had a popular vote majority of 2.5&amp;nbsp;million over his opponents' combined total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Leip PV source 2|year=1924| as of=January 21, 2007}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1924| as of=January 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Coolidge's presidency the United States experienced the period of rapid economic growth known as the &quot;[[Roaring Twenties]]&quot;. He left the administration's industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce, [[Herbert Hoover]], who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio.&lt;ref name=f64&gt;Ferrell, 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of favoring increased tariffs, Coolidge disdained regulation, and carried about this belief by appointing commissioners to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, 66–72; Sobel, 318&lt;/ref&gt; The regulatory state under Coolidge was, as one biographer described it, &quot;thin to the point of invisibility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge's economic policy has often been misquoted as &quot;generally speaking, the business of the American people is business&quot; (full quotation at right). Some have criticized Coolidge as an adherent of the [[laissez-faire]] ideology, which they claim led to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ferrell, 207&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, historian [[Robert Sobel]] offers some context based on Coolidge's sense of [[federalism]]: &quot;As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed [[child labor]], imposed economic controls during [[World War I]], favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/coolidge_sobel.html |title=Coolidge and American Business|last=Sobel|first=Robert|publisher=John F.

===Taxation===
[[File:AWMellon.jpg|thumb|left|Secretary of the Treasury [[Andrew W. Mellon]] worked with Coolidge to reduce taxes while retiring government debt]]
Coolidge's taxation policy was that of his Secretary of the Treasury, [[Andrew Mellon]]: taxes should be lower and fewer people should have to pay them.&lt;ref name=sobel310&gt;Sobel, 310–311; Greenberg, 127–129&lt;/ref&gt; Congress agreed, and the taxes were reduced in Coolidge's term.&lt;ref name=sobel310/&gt; In addition to these tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring some of the [[United States public debt|federal debt]].&lt;ref name=sobel310&gt;Sobel, 310–311; Fuess, 382–383&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924 Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people.&lt;ref name=sobel310/&gt; They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of [[Revenue Act of 1926|1926]] and [[Revenue Act of 1928|1928]], all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt.&lt;ref name=fer170&gt;Ferrell, 170–&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, only the richest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax.&lt;ref name=fer170/&gt; Although federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired, state and local governments saw considerable growth, surpassing the federal budget in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, 174&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Farm subsidies===
[[Image:Coolidge-Dawes.jpg|thumb|upright|Coolidge with his [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Charles G. Dawes]].]]
Perhaps the most contentious issue of Coolidge's presidency was that of relief for farmers. Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lowered prices.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, 84; McCoy, 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture Secretary [[Henry Cantwell Wallace|Henry C. Wallace]] and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924, but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary, and it was defeated just before the elections that year.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 235&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, with farm prices falling once more, Senator [[Charles L. McNary]] and Representative [[Gilbert N. Haugen]]—both Republicans—proposed the [[McNary-Haugen Farm Relief Bill]]. The bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in high-yield years and hold it (when feasible) for later sale, or sell it abroad.&lt;ref name=fuess383&gt;Fuess, 383–384&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge opposed McNary-Haugen, declaring that agriculture must stand &quot;on an independent business basis,&quot; and said that &quot;government control cannot be divorced from political control.&quot;&lt;ref name=fuess383/&gt; He favored instead [[Herbert Hoover]]'s proposal to modernize agriculture to create profits, instead of manipulating prices. Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the McNary-Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was defeated.&lt;ref name=sobel327&gt;Sobel, 327&lt;/ref&gt;

After McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge supported a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass.&lt;ref name=sobel327/&gt; In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it.&lt;ref name=fuess388&gt;Fuess, 388; Ferrell, 93&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge vetoed it.&lt;ref name=fuess388/&gt; In his veto message, he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefitting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 331&lt;/ref&gt; Congress did not override the veto, but passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it.&lt;ref name=fuess388/&gt; &quot;Farmers never have made much money,&quot; said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son, &quot;I do not believe we can do much about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flood control===
Coolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=floods&gt;Sobel, 315; Barry, 286–287; Greenberg, 132–135&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, Coolidge's lack of interest in federal flood control has been criticized.&lt;ref name=floods/&gt; Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, but would be seen only as political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, 372–374&lt;/ref&gt; When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights===
[[Image:Coolidge after signing indian treaty.jpg|right|thumb|Coolidge is shown above on October 22, 1924, holding a ceremonial hat.]]
Coolidge spoke out in favor of the civil rights of [[African Americans]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 250; McCoy, 328–329&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed no known members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] to office; indeed the Klan lost most of its influence during his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Felzenberg|first=Alvin S.|year=1988|title=Calvin Coolidge and Race: His Record in Dealing with the Racial Tensions of the 1920s|journal=New England Journal of History|volume=55|issue=1|pages=83–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Coolidge responded to a letter that claimed the United States was a &quot;white man's country&quot;:
{{quote|....I was amazed to receive such a letter. During the war 500,000 colored men and boys were called up under the draft, not one of whom sought to evade it. [As president, I am] one who feels a responsibility for living up to the traditions and maintaining the principles of the Republican Party. Our Constitution guarantees equal rights to all our citizens, without discrimination on account of race or color. I have taken my oath to support that Constitution....&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, ''Foundations of the Republic'' (1926) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924|Indian Citizenship Act]], which granted full U.S. citizenship to all [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], while permitting them to retain tribal land and cultural rights. However, the act was unclear on whether the federal government or the tribal leaders retained tribal sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Deloria|first=Vincent|title=American Indian policy in the twentieth century|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1992|page=91|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VzWIpZBZgA0C|isbn=978-0-8061-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coolidge repeatedly called for anti-[[lynching]] laws to be enacted, but most Congressional attempts to pass this legislation were filibustered by Southern Democrats.

Coolidge appointed some African Americans to federal office. He retained Harding's choice of [[Walter L. Cohen]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], as the comptroller of customs and offered Cohen the post of minister to [[Liberia]], which the businessman declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site20.php|title=[[Louisiana Historical Association]], ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' (lahistory.org)|publisher=lahistory.org|accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
[[Image:Calvin Coolidge.jpg|left|thumb|Official White House portrait of Calvin Coolidge]]While he was not an isolationist, Coolidge was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 342&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge saw the landslide Republican victory of 1920 as a rejection of the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] idea that the United States should join the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=mccoy184&gt;McCoy, 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership in it.&lt;ref name=mccoy184/&gt; He spoke in favor of the United States joining the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 360&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with [[reservation (law)|reservations]]) in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 363&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but suggested some modifications of their own.&lt;ref name=greenberg114&gt;Greenberg, 114–116&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.&lt;ref name=greenberg114/&gt;

Coolidge's best-known initiative was the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928, named for Coolidge's Secretary of State, [[Frank B. Kellogg]], and French foreign minister [[Aristide Briand]]. The treaty, ratified in 1929, committed signatories including the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan to &quot;renounce war, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 421–423&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty did not achieve its intended result{{ndash}} the outlawry of war{{ndash}} but did provide the founding principle for international law after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 380–381; Greenberg, 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge continued the previous administration's policy not to recognize the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 181&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued the United States' support for the elected government of Mexico against the [[Cristero War|rebels]] there, lifting the arms embargo on that country.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; He sent his close friend [[Dwight Morrow]] to Mexico as the [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|American ambassador]].&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 349&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge represented the U.S. at the Pan American Conference in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], making him the only sitting U.S. President to visit the country. The United States' occupation of [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] and [[United States occupation of Haiti|Haiti]] continued under his administration, but Coolidge withdrew American troops from the [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 414–417; Ferrell, 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

===1928 Election===
[[Image:Calvin Coolidge video montage.ogg|thumb|Collection of video clips of the president]]
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1928}}
In the summer of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]], where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and attended [[rodeo]]s. He made [[Custer State Park]] his &quot;summer White House&quot;. News coverage of Coolidge's time in the Black Hills soon increased tourism in the general region and promoted the popularity of [[Wind Cave National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris B. Nelson, &quot;Life along the Road: The Tourist Camp in South Dakota&quot;, ''South Dakota History'', Vol. 13, No. 4 (Winter 2005), pp. 320-321&lt;/ref&gt; While on vacation, Coolidge surprisingly issued his terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as President in 1928: &quot;[[I do not choose to run|I do not choose to run for President in 1928]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 370&lt;/ref&gt; After allowing them to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. &quot;If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933&amp;nbsp;… Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it—too long!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;White, 361&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: &quot;The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coolidge|first=Calvin|title=The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge|publisher=Cosmopolitan Book Corp|year=1929|chapter=Why I Did Not Choose To Run|page=239|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/autobiographycal011459mbp#page/n265/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge's [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], [[Herbert Hoover]].

Coolidge had been reluctant to choose Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that &quot;for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, 195&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the popular Commerce Secretary's nomination.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, 390–391; Wilson, 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates did consider nominating Vice President Charles Dawes to be Hoover's running mate, but the convention selected Senator [[Charles Curtis]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial appointments===
[[Image:Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone photograph circa 1927-1932.jpg|thumb|upright| Coolidge appointed [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] Attorney General and then Supreme Court Justice]]

====Supreme Court====
Coolidge appointed one Justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of [[Columbia Law School]] when Coolidge appointed him to be Attorney General in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, [[Harry M. Daugherty]]. Coolidge named Stone to the Supreme Court in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 364&lt;/ref&gt; Stone was later appointed Chief Justice by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

====Other courts====
{{Main|Calvin Coolidge judicial appointments}}
Along with his Supreme Court appointment, Coolidge successfully nominated 17 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 61 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. He appointed judges to various specialty courts as well, including [[Genevieve R. Cline]], who became the first woman named to the Federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the [[United States Customs Court]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freeman|first=Jo|title=A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2002|page=216|isbn=978-0-8476-9805-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge also signed the [[Judiciary Act of 1925]] into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.

==Retirement and death==
[[Image:Coolidge public address.jpg|thumb|right|Coolidge addressing a crowd at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]'s Roman style [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater|Memorial Amphitheater]] in 1924.]]
After his presidency, Coolidge retired to his beloved [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] home, &quot;The Beeches,&quot; where he became a local fixture. He kept a [[Hacker-Craft|Hacker]] runabout boat on the Connecticut River and was often observed on the water by local boating enthusiasts. During this period he also served as chairman of the non-partisan Railroad Commission, as honorary president of the [[American Foundation for the Blind]], as a director of [[New York Life Insurance Company]], as president of the [[American Antiquarian Society]], and as a trustee of Amherst College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vermonthistory.org/arccat/findaid/coolidge.htm|title=Coolidge Family Papers, 1802–1932|publisher=Vermont Historical Society Library|&lt;!-- accessdate=2007-05-18 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge received an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] from [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]].

Coolidge published his [[autobiography]] in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, &quot;Calvin Coolidge Says,&quot; from 1930 to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 403; Ferrell, 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with looming defeat in 1932, some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former President made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 457–459; Greenberg, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him.&lt;ref&gt;Fuess, 460&lt;/ref&gt;

He died suddenly of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at &quot;The Beeches,&quot; at 12:45&amp;nbsp;pm, January 5, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided to an old friend: &quot;I feel I no longer fit in with these times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 410&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge is buried beneath a simple headstone in Notch Cemetery, [[Plymouth Notch]], Vermont, where the family home is maintained as one of the original buildings on the site, all of which comprise the [[Calvin Coolidge Homestead District]]. The State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors' center nearby to mark Coolidge's 100th birthday on July 4, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicvermont.org/coolidge/coolidge.html|title=President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site|&lt;!-- accessdate=2007-02-12 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Coolidge's &quot;[[Brave Little State of Vermont speech]]&quot; is memorialized in the Hall of Inscriptions at the [[Vermont State House]] in Montpelier, Vermont.

==Radio, film, and commemorations==
[[Image:Coolidge with press.jpg|upright|thumb|Coolidge, reporters, and cameramen]]
Despite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while President. He made himself available to reporters, giving 529 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any President before or since.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge's [[inauguration]] was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first President whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 252&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 1924, he became the first President of the United States to deliver a political speech on radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldradioshows.org/02/22/calvin-coolidge-the-first-us-president-to-do-a-radio-address-2-22-08|title=Calvin Coolidge, the first President to do a radio address 2-22-1924|date=February 22, 2008|publisher= Old Radio Shows.org|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge signed the [[Federal Radio Commission#The Radio Act of 1927|Radio Act of 1927]], which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created [[Federal Radio Commission]].

On August 11, 1924, [[Lee De Forest]] filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn with DeForest's [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process, becoming the first President to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was ''President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/coolidge_1924|title=President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Ground (1924)|accessdate=February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge was the only president to have his portrait on a coin during his lifetime, the [[Early United States commemorative coins|Sesquicentennial of American Independence Half Dollar]], minted in 1926. After his death he also appeared on a [[US Presidents on US postage stamps#Calvin Coolidge|postage stamp]], pictured below.

A '''clanking replicator''' is an artificial [[self-replication|self-replicating]] system that relies on conventional large-scale technology and automation. The term evolved to distinguish such systems from the microscopic &quot;[[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]]&quot; that [[nanotechnology]] may make possible. They are also sometimes called &quot;Auxons&quot;, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''auxein'' which means &quot;to grow&quot;, or &quot;[[von Neumann machine]]s&quot; after [[John von Neumann]], who first rigorously studied the idea. This last term (&quot;von Neumann machine&quot;) is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated computer architecture proposed by von Neumann, so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important. Von Neumann himself used the term [[Universal Constructor]].

The term ''clanking replicator'' was used by Drexler,&lt;ref name=EoC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_4.html#section01of03| title=Engines of Abundance (Chapter 4) Clanking Replicators| work=Engines of Creation| first=K. Eric| last=Drexler| year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; is informal and is rarely used by others in popular or technical discussions.

==Basic concept==
A [[self-replicating machine]] would need to have the capacity to gather energy and [[raw material]]s, process the raw materials into finished components, and then assemble them into a copy of itself. It is unlikely that this would all be contained within a single [[wiktionary:monolith|monolithic]] structure, but would rather be a group of cooperating machines or an [[automatic factory|automated factory]] that is capable of manufacturing all of the machines that make it up.
The factory could produce mining [[robot]]s to collect raw materials, construction robots to put new machines together, and repair robots to maintain itself against wear and tear, all without human intervention or direction. The advantage of such a system lies in its ability to expand its own capacity rapidly and without additional human effort; in essence, the initial investment required to construct the first clanking replicator would have an arbitrarily large payoff with no additional labor cost, with future returns discounted by their [[present value]].

Such a [[machine]] violates no [[physical law]]s, and we already possess the basic technologies necessary for some of the more detailed proposed designs.

Noting another proof that self-replicating machines are possible is the simple fact that all living organisms are self replicating by definition.

==History of the concept==
The idea of non-biological self-replicating systems was introduced in Samuel Butler's article &quot;Darwin Among the Machines&quot; published only a few years after The Origin of Species. As a serious proposal, it was first suggested by mathematician [[John Von Neumann]] in the late 1940s when he proposed a [[kinematic]] self-reproducing automaton model as a [[thought experiment]]. See Von Neumann, J., 1966, ''The Theory of Self-reproducing Automata'', A. Burks, ed., Univ. of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL.

===Advanced Automation for Space Missions===
In 1980, [[NASA]] conducted a summer study entitled
''[[s:Advanced Automation for Space Missions|Advanced Automation for Space Missions]]'', edited by [[Robert Freitas]], to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop [[Moon|lunar]] resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site. The proposed system would have been capable of [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] productive capacity. The design could be modified to build [[Von Neumann probe]]s to explore the galaxy.

The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails.  Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic robot.

Power would be provided by a &quot;canopy&quot; of solar cells supported on pillars.  The other machinery could run under the canopy.

The study identified four key manufacturing capabilities out of the hundreds commonly used in modern industry:
# [[Plaster casting]] for molded parts
# [[Laser machining]] for etching and fine tuning
# [[Vapor deposition]] for electronics, solar cells, and mirror surfaces
# Extrusion of spun [[mineral wool|basalt fiber]] for electrical insulation and fiberglass

A &quot;[[casting]] robot&quot; would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|molds]].  Plaster molds are easy to make, and can make precise parts with good surface finishes.  The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals.  An [[electricity|electric]] or solar [[oven]] would melt the materials. A carbon dioxide laser cutting and welding system was also included.

A more speculative, more complex &quot;chip factory&quot; was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were &quot;vitamins.&quot;

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing the ores, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in lunar [[regolith]].  The element that most limited the growth rate was [[chlorine]], needed to process regolith for [[aluminium]].  Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, so the design recycled it.

==Clanking replicators in fiction==
In fiction, the idea dates back at least as far as [[Karel &amp;#268;apek]]'s 1921 play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]''.

[[A. E. van Vogt]] used the idea as a plot device in his story &quot;M33 in Andromeda&quot; (1943), which was later combined with the three other ''Space Beagle'' stories to became the novel, [[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]. The story describes the creation of self-replicating weapons factories designed to destroy the Anabis, a galaxy-spanning malevolent life form bent on destruction of the human race.

An early treatment was the short story ''[[Autofac]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], published in 1955, which precedes von Neumann's original paper about self-reproducing machines. Dick also touched on this theme in his earlier 1953 short story ''[[Second Variety]]''. Another example can be found in the 1962 short story ''[[Epilogue (short story)|Epilogue]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]], in which self-replicating factory barges were proposed that used minerals extracted from ocean water as raw materials.

In his short story &quot;Crabs on the Island&quot; (1958) [[Anatoli Dneprov]] speculated on the idea that since the replication process is never 100% accurate, leading to slight differences in the descendants, over several generations of replication the machines would be subjected to [[evolution]] similar to that of living organisms. In the story, a machine is designed, the sole purpose of which is to find metal to produce copies of itself, intended to be used as a weapon against an enemy's war machines. The machines are released on a deserted island, the idea being that once the available metal is all used and they start fighting each other, [[natural selection]] will enhance their design. However, the evolution has stopped by itself when the last descendant, an enormously large crab, was created, being unable to reproduce itself due to lack of energy and materials.

[[Stanisław Lem]] has also studied the same idea in his novel ''[[The Invincible]]'' (1964), in which the crew of a spacecraft landing on a distant planet finds non-biological life-form, which is the product of long, possibly of millions of years of mechanical evolution. This phenomenon is also key to the aforementioned Anderson story.

[[John Sladek]] used the concept to humorous ends in his first novel ''The Reproductive System'' (1968, also titled ''Mechasm'' in some markets), where a U.S. military research project goes out of control.

NASA's Advanced Automation for Space Missions study directly inspired the science fiction novel ''[[Code of the Lifemaker]]'' (1983) by author [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]].

The movie ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]'', based on Dick's short story ''Second Variety'', features a group of robot weapons created by mankind to act as Von Neumann devices / berserkers. The original robots are subterranean buzzsaws that make a screaming sound as they approach a potential victim beneath the soil. These machines are self-replicating and, as is found out through the course of the movie, they are quite intelligent and have managed to &quot;evolve&quot; into newer, more dangerous forms, most notably human forms which the real humans in the movie cannot tell apart from other real humans except by trial and error.

{{Reflist|group=note}}

==Prospects for implementation==
As the use of industrial automation has expanded over time, some factories have begun to approach a semblance of self-sufficiency that is suggestive of clanking replicators. However, such factories are unlikely to achieve &quot;full closure&quot; until the cost and flexibility of automated machinery comes close to that of human labour and the manufacture of spare parts and other components locally becomes more economical than transporting them from elsewhere. Fully-capable machine replicators are most useful for developing resources in dangerous environments which are not easily reached by existing transportation systems (such as [[outer space]]).

A clanking replicator can be considered to be a form of [[artificial life]]. Depending on its design, it might be subject to evolution over long time periods. However, with robust [[error correction]], and the possibility of external intervention, the common [[science fiction]] theme of robotic life run amok is unlikely in the near term.

==Etymology==
It should probably be noted that ''clanking'' is an example of [[onomatopoeia]], understandable to some English speakers, but not to all. The term is meant to evoke the image of a nineteenth century factory, powered by [[steam]], pushing [[gear]]s and rods, noisy and clamorous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Convention on Biological Diversity''' ('''CBD'''), known informally as the '''Biodiversity Convention''', is an international legally binding [[treaty]]. The Convention has three main goals:

#conservation of biological diversity (or [[biodiversity]]);
#sustainable use of its components; and
#fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources

In other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It is often seen as the key document regarding [[sustainable development]].

The Convention was opened for signature at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993.

2010 was the [[International Year of Biodiversity]]. The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity is the focal point for the International Year of Biodiversity.
At the 2010 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]], the Nagoya Protocol was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/cop10/&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 22 December 2010, the UN declared the period from 2011 to 2020 as the UN-Decade on Biodiversity. They, hence, followed a recommendation of the CBD signatories during COP10 at [[Nagoya]] in October 2010.

==About the convention==
The convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biological diversity is &quot;a common concern of humankind&quot; and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and [[biosafety]] issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.

The convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of [[sustainable use]]. While past [[conservation biology|conservation]] efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity. 

The convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the [[precautionary principle]] that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.

The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would ban some forms of [[geoengineering]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19660-what-the-un-ban-on-geoengineering-really-means.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues under the convention==
Some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include: 

* Measures and incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
* Regulated access to genetic resources and [[traditional knowledge]], including Prior Informed Consent of the party providing resources.
* Sharing, in a fair and equitable way, the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of [[Genetics|genetic]] resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources (governments and/or local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized).
* Access to and transfer of technology, including [[biotechnology]], to the governments and/or local communities that provided traditional knowledge and/or biodiversity resources.
* Technical and scientific cooperation.
* Impact assessment.
* Education and public awareness.
* Provision of financial resources.
* National reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments.

==Cartagena Protocol==
The [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] of the Convention, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.

The Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the [[precautionary principle]] and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a [[genetically modified organism]] if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is [[safe]] and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically altered commodities such as corn or cotton.

The required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.

== Global Strategy for Plant Conservation ==
{{main|Global strategy for plant conservation}}

In April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16 point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.

==Non-parties==
[[Andorra]], the [[Holy See]], the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] including the [[United States]]. The US has signed, but not ratified the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovereignty.net/p/land/biotreatystop.htm|title=How the Convention on Biodiversity was Defeated in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International bodies established by the convention==

'''Conference of the Parties (COP):'''
The convention's governing body is the Conference of the Parties (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements. 

The Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, two main organs are: 

'''Secretariat:'''
The CBD Secretariat. Based in [[Montreal]], it operates under the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information. 

'''Subsidiary body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA):'''
The Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA). The SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues. 13th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA-13) held from 18 to 22 February 2008 in the FAO at Rome, Italy. SBSTTA-13 delegates met in the Committee of the Whole in the morning to finalize and adopt recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and [[forest]] biodiversity and SBSTTA’s modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues. The closing plenary convened in the afternoon to adopt recommendations on inland waters biodiversity, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] biodiversity, invasive alien [[species]] and biodiversity and [[climate change]]. The current chairperson of the SBSTTA is Dr. Asghar Mohammadi Fazel.

==Country implementation==
===National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)===
Most of the Parties have established National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP) to implement the convention. 

For example, the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tanzania]] have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The [[United States of America]], a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/oct/27/harrison-ford-conservation-nagoya | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | title=Harrison Ford calls on US to ratify treaty on conservation | date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species Recovery Programs and other mechanisms long in place in the USA for species conservation. 

Singapore has also established a detailed [http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/docs/nbc/NPark-booklet-final-4sep.pdf National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan].

The '''Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution''', often abbreviated as '''Air Pollution''' or '''CLRTAP''', is intended to protect the human environment against [[air pollution]] and to gradually reduce and prevent air pollution, including long-range transboundary air pollution.

==Overview==
The convention opened for signature on 1979-11-13 and entered into force on 1983-03-16.

The current parties to the Convention are shown on the map.

The Convention, which now has 51 Parties, identifies the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) as its secretariat.

Since 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants.

The aim of the Convention is that Parties shall endeavour to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Parties develop policies and strategies to combat the discharge of air pollutants through exchanges of information, consultation, research and monitoring.

The Parties meet annually at sessions of the Executive Body to review ongoing work and plan future activities including a workplan for the coming year. The three main subsidiary bodies - the Working Group on Effects, the Steering Body to EMEP and the Working Group on Strategies and Review - as well as the Convention's Implementation Committee, report to the Executive Body each year.

Currently, the Convention's priority activities include review and possible revision of its most recent protocols, implementation of the Convention and its protocols across the entire UNECE region (with special focus on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and South-East Europe) and sharing its knowledge and information with other regions of the world.

'''CITES''' (the '''Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora''', also known as the '''Washington Convention''') is an international agreement between governments, drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The text of the convention was agreed upon in 1973, and CITES entered into force on July 1, 1975. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 33,000 [[species]] of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.&lt;ref name=&quot;what_is_cites&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.shtml|title=What is CITES?|work=cites.org|publisher=CITES|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one species protected by CITES, the [[Spix's Macaw]], has become extinct in the wild&lt;ref name = birdlife-1546&gt;{{cite web| publisher =BirdLife International (2008) |url = http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=1546&amp;m=0 |title = Species factsheet: ''Cyanopsitta spixii'' | accessdate = 24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of trade since the Convention entered into force (but see case studies in Hutton and Dickinson&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;Hutton and Dickinson, Endangered Species Threatened Convention: The Past, Present and Future of CITES. London: Africa Resources Trust, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stiles&lt;ref name=Stiles&gt;Stiles, &quot;The Ivory Trade and Elephant Conservation,&quot; ''Environmental Conservation'' 31(4) 309-321 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; for further discussion of the role CITES has played in the fate of particular species).

==Background and operation==
CITES is one of the largest conservation agreements in existence. Participation is voluntary, and countries that have agreed to be bound by the Convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level.  Often, domestic legislation is either non-existent (especially in Parties that have not ratified it), or with penalties incommensurate with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|title=Zimmerman, &quot;The Black Market for Wildlife: Combating Transnational Organized Crime in the Illegal Wildlife Trade,&quot; ''Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law'' 36 (5) 1657-1689 (November 2003)|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a Party: designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.&lt;ref name=Reeve&gt;Reeve, Policing International Trade in Endangered Species: The CITES Treaty and Compliance.  London: Earthscan, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on March 3, 1973. It was then open for signature until December 31, 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on July 1, 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the Convention. As of 21 April 2009, 175 States had become Parties to the Convention with [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] being the latest.&lt;ref name=&quot;cites_parties&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/index.shtml|title=Discover CITES: Member Countries|publisher=CITES|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the activities of the Secretariat and COP meetings comes from a Trust Fund derived from Party contributions.  Trust Fund money is not available to Parties to improve implementation or compliance. These activities, and all those outside Secretariat activities (training, species specific programmes such as Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants - MIKE) must find external funding (often from [[NGOs]] and [[bilateral aid]]).&lt;ref name=Reeve/&gt;

Although the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 30 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties.  The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP 11 resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:
*Mandatory confirmation of all permits by the Secretariat
*Suspension of cooperation from the Secretariat
*A formal warning
*A visit by the Secretariat to verify capacity
*Recommendations to all Parties to suspend CITES related trade with the offending party&lt;ref name=&quot;cites_suspend&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/suspension.shtml|title=Countries currently subject to a recommendation to suspend trade|publisher=CITES|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dictation of corrective measures to be taken by the offending Party before the Secretariat will resume cooperation or recommend resumption of trade
Bilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).

Infractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and  failing to produce annual reports (the most common).

==Regulation of trade==

CITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of listed species to certain controls. These require that all import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a permitting system.

Each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering the licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to provide advice about the effects of any proposed trade on the status of the species.

==Appendices==

Roughly 5,000 species of animals and 28,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against [[over-exploitation]] through international trade. Each protected species or population is included in one of three lists, called Appendices (explained below). The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.

Species may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another.  Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be ‘laundered’ through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected.  The [[African elephant]] (Loxodonta africana) is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I.   Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II.  Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such ‘laundering’ but also restricts trade in wildlife products by range States with good management practices.

Species are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), the most recent of which was held in [[Qatar]] in January 2010.  Species may be proposed for listing (or deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and may be included despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing.  These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.

There has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations.  for instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection.  Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.&lt;ref name=Hutton/&gt;

===Appendix I===
Appendix I, about 800 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licenced circumstances). Trade of captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII).  The management authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population.  Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately. Notable animal species include the [[Red Panda|red panda]] (''Aluris fulgenis''), [[gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla''), the [[chimpanzee]] species (''Pan spp.''), [[tigers]] (''Panthera tigris'' subspecies), Asiatic [[lion]] (''Panthera leo persica''), leopards (''Panthera pardus''), [[Jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), [[Cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''), some populations of [[African Elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s ([[Sirenia]]), and all [[Rhinoceros]] species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml Appendices I, II and III&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appendix II===
Appendix II, about 32,500 species, are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.  In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices.  International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate.  In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded on an [http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.shtml annual basis]. No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES.  A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Examples of species listed on Appendix II are the [[Great White Shark]] (''carcharadon carcharias''), the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''Equus hartmannae''), [[African grey parrot]] (''Psittacus erithacus''), [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana''), [[queen conch]] (''Lobatus gigas''), [[Mertens' Water Monitor]] (''Varanus mertensi''), bigleaf mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]'') and [[Lignum Vitae]] &quot;ironwood&quot; (''Guaiacum officinale'').

===Appendix III===
Appendix III, about 170 species, are species that are listed after one member country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species.  The species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally.  In all member countries trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Examples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the [[two-toed sloth]]  (''Choloepus hoffmanni'') by Costa Rica, [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta'') by Botswana, and the [[alligator snapping turtle]] (''Macrochelys temminckii'') by the USA.

==Amendments and reservations==
Amendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting.  The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty.  Reservations (Article XXIII) can be made by any Party with respect to any species, which considerably weakens the treaty (see [http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve_index.shtml] for current reservations).  Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.

Notable reservations include those by Iceland, Japan and Norway on various [[baleen]] whale species and those on [[Falconiformes]] by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve_index.shtml Reservations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings and concerns==
General limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, [[ecosystem approach]]es to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the Convention on Biological Diversity), although this has been changing (see [[Nile Crocodile]], [[African elephant]], South African [[white rhino]] case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;Hill, 1990, &quot;The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species: Fifteen Years Later,&quot; ''Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Journal'' 13: 231&lt;/ref&gt; Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).

By design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a &quot;negative list&quot; such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated ''unless'' the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa ... then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained.  Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review.  For example, recently several bird classified as [[IUCN Red List|threatened with extinction]] appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status.  If a &quot;positive list&quot; approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly-known species.

While many developing countries have been eager to join CITES, the annual costs of staffing and maintaining a CITES office and an effective presence at the biennial CoP gatherings remain unaffordable for many signatory nations. In practice, these offices and staff are nearly always the same as those that license, permit, and collect fees for hunting, trade, and protection of wild plants and animals. Because these wildlife trading fees often represent a significant source of these CITES offices' operational budgets, the structure of CITES creates a direct conflict of interest between these offices and the resources they manage.  Moreover, the CITES Secretariat itself is largely dependent on signatories' offices for determinations on whether the trade in a given species is &quot;non-detrimental.&quot; Consequently, this structure for information gathering and decision making at both the national and Secretariat level is inherently biased in favor of trade over protection.

Specific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.

Suggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, [[TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network]] and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting.  CITES would benefit from access to [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF) funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds.  Development of a funding mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.&lt;ref name=Reeve/&gt;

On July 15, 2008, the Committee that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the Parties granted China and Japan permission to import elephant [[ivory]] from four African government stockpiles, the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country. The amounts to be sold comprise approximately 44 tons from Botswana, 9 tons from Namibia, 51 tons from South Africa, and 4 tons from Zimbabwe. The Chinese government in 2003 acknowledged that it had lost track of 121 tons of ivory between 1991 and 2002.

The '''Environmental Modification Convention''' ('''ENMOD'''), formally the '''Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques''' is an international [[treaty]] prohibiting the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques. It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in [[Geneva]] and entered into force on 5 October 1978.

The Convention bans [[weather warfare]], which is the use of [[weather modification]] techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction.

The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] of 2010 would also ban some forms of [[weather modification]] or geoengineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/cop10&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[computer science]] subfield of [[algorithmic information theory]], a '''Chaitin constant''' or '''halting probability''' is a [[real number]] that informally represents the [[probability]] that a randomly-chosen program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to [[Gregory Chaitin]]. 

Although there are infinitely many halting probabilities, it is common to use the letter Ω to refer to them as if there were only one.  Because Ω depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called '''Chaitin's construction''' instead of '''Chaitin's constant''' when not referring to any specific encoding.

Each halting probability is a [[normal number|normal]] and [[transcendental number|transcendental]] real number which is not [[computable number|computable]], which means that there is no halting [[algorithm]] that enumerates its digits.

==Background==

The definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of '''prefix-free universal computable functions.'''  Such a function, intuitively, represents a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.

Suppose that ''F'' is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function ''F'' is called '''[[Computable function|computable]]''' if there is a [[Turing machine]] that computes it.

The function ''F'' is called '''[[Computational universality|universal]]''' if the following property holds:  for every computable function ''f'' of a single variable there is a string ''w'' such that for all ''x'', ''F''(''w'' ''x'') = ''f''(''x''); here ''w''&amp;nbsp;''x'' represents the [[concatenation]] of the two strings ''w'' and ''x''.  This means that ''F'' can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable.  Informally, ''w'' represents a &quot;script&quot; for the computable function ''f'', and ''F'' represents an &quot;interpreter&quot; that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.
Note that for any fixed ''w'' the function ''f''(''x'') = ''F''(''w'' ''x'') is computable; thus the universality property states that all computable functions of one variable can be obtained in this fashion.

The '''domain''' of ''F'' is the set of all inputs ''p'' on which it is defined. For ''F'' that are universal, such a ''p'' can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, and as a single program for the function ''F''.

The function ''F'' is called '''prefix-free''' if there are no two elements ''p'', ''p&amp;prime;'' in its domain such that ''p&amp;prime;'' is a proper extension of ''p''. This can be rephrased as: the domain of ''F'' is a [[prefix-free code]] (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; the one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.

The domain of any universal computable function is a [[computably enumerable set]] but never a [[computable set]].  The domain is always [[Turing equivalent]] to the [[halting problem]].

==Definition of halting probabilities==

Let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function ''F''.  The constant Ω&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_F = \sum_{p \in P_F} 2^{-|p|}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\left|p\right|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the length of a string ''p''.
This is an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] which has one summand for every ''p'' in the domain of ''F''.  The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with [[Kraft's inequality]], ensures that this sum converges to a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.  If ''F'' is clear from context then Ω&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; may be denoted simply Ω, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of Ω.

==Use of Chaitin's constant in proving unsolved problems in number theory==

Chaitin's constant could be used, in principle, to solve many outstanding problems in number theory, including [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Cover and Joy A. Thomas, Elements of Information Theory, 2nd Edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldbach's  conjecture says every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.  For a given even number, let a computer program iterate through the even numbers, beginning with the given one, searching for corresponding two primes in each instance.  If the appropriate primes exist, then the program finds them eventually, advances to the next even number and the search is continued.  If there are no two primes that add to the even number, then the program exhausts eventually all possible prime pairs in the test, thus it notices that a counterexample has just been found, it halts and Goldbach's conjecture has been disproved. Thus, this is a counterexample-searching program: it runs forever exactly if Goldbach's conjecture is true; it halts (with a counterexample) exactly if the conjecture is false.

Let this program be ''N'' bits long.  Given unlimited resources and time, the first ''N'' bits of Chaitin's number can be used to prove Goldbach's conjecture as follows. In [[Dovetailing_(computer_science)|dovetailing]] fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first ''N'' bits. If the Goldbach program hasn't halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first N bits.
Thus, the conjecture holds unless we already found a counterexample.

The same Chaitin constant can be used to prove (or disprove) the [[Riemann hypothesis]] and many other of the [[unsolved problems in mathematics]].

==Interpretation as a probability==

The [[Cantor space]] is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the [[measure theory|measure]] of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual [[probability measure]] on Cantor space.  It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.

The probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string ''x'' the set of sequences that begin with ''x'' has measure 2&lt;sup&gt;-|''x''|&lt;/sup&gt;. This implies that for each natural number ''n'', the set of sequences ''f'' in Cantor space such that ''f''(''n'') = 1 has measure 1/2, and the set of sequences whose ''n''th element is 0 also has measure 1/2.

Let ''F'' be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain ''P'' of ''F'' consists of an infinite set of binary strings
:&lt;math&gt;P = \{p_1,p_2,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Each of these strings ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; determines a subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of Cantor space; the set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. These sets are disjoint because ''P'' is a prefix-free set.  The sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p \in P} 2^{-|p|}&lt;/math&gt;
represents the measure of the set 
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} S_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In this way, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of ''F''. It is for this reason that Ω&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; is called a halting probability.

== Properties ==

Each Chaitin constant Ω has the following properties:
* It is [[algorithmic randomness|algorithmically random]]. This means that the shortest program to output the first ''n'' bits of Ω must be of size at least ''n''-O(1). This is because, as in the Goldbach example, those ''n'' bits enable us to find out exactly which programs halt among all those of length at most ''n''.
* It is a [[normal number]], which means that its digits are equidistributed as if they were generated by tossing a fair coin.
* It is not a [[computable number]]; there is no computable function that enumerates its binary expansion, as discussed below. 
* The set of rational numbers ''q'' such that ''q'' ≤ Ω is [[computably enumerable set|computably enumerable]]; a real number with such a property is called a '''left-c.e. real number''' in [[recursion theory]]. 
* It is [[Turing equivalent]] to the [[halting problem]] and thus at level &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_2&lt;/math&gt; of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]. 

Not every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability.   A [[equivalence relation#Comparing equivalence relations|finer]] equivalence relation, '''Solovay equivalence''', can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals.

== Uncomputability of halting probabilities ==
A real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given ''n'', returns the first ''n'' digits of the number.  This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.

No halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first ''n'' digits of Ω, solves Turing's [[halting problem]] for programs of length up to ''n''. Since the halting problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], Ω can not be computed.

The algorithm proceeds as follows.  Given the first ''n'' digits of Ω and a ''k''≤''n'', the algorithm enumerates the domain of ''F'' until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2&lt;sup&gt;-(k+1)&lt;/sup&gt; of Ω. After this point, no additional program of length ''k'' can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2&lt;sup&gt;-''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to the measure, which is impossible.  Thus the set of strings of length ''k'' in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.

== Incompleteness theorem for halting probabilities ==
{{main|Kolmogorov complexity#Chaitin's incompleteness theorem}}

For each specific consistent effectively represented [[axiomatic system]] for the [[natural numbers]], such as [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]], there exists a constant ''N'' such that no bit of Ω after the ''N''th can be proven to be one or zero within that system. The constant ''N'' depends on how the [[formal system]] is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete. 

== Super Omega ==

As mentioned above, the first n bits of [[Gregory Chaitin]]'s constant Omega are random or  incompressible in the sense that we cannot compute them by a halting algorithm with fewer than n-O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of Omega. In other words, the [[enumerable]] first n bits of Omega are highly [[compressible]] in the sense that they are limit-computable by a very short algorithm; they are not [[random]] with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2000) constructed a limit-computable &quot;Super Omega&quot; which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable Omega, as one cannot significantly compress the Super Omega by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]], the '''computable numbers''', also known as the '''recursive numbers''' or the '''computable reals''', are the [[real numbers]] that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating [[algorithm]].  Equivalent definitions can be given using [[μ-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machines]] or [[lambda-calculus|λ-calculus]] as the formal representation of algorithms. The computable numbers form a [[real closed field]] and can be used in the place of real numbers for many, but not all, mathematical purposes.

== Informal definition using a Turing machine as example ==
In the following, [[Marvin Minsky]] defines the numbers to be computed in a manner similar to those defined by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, i.e. as &quot;sequences of digits interpreted as decimal fractions&quot; between 0 and 1:
 
:&quot;A computable number [is] one for which there is a Turing machine which, given ''n'' on its initial tape, terminates with the ''nth'' digit of that number [encoded on its tape].&quot; (Minsky 1967:159)

The key notions in the definition are (1) that some ''n'' is specified at the start, (2) for any ''n'' the computation only takes a finite number of steps, after which the machine produces the desired output and terminates.

An alternate form of (2) – the machine successively prints all n of the digits on its tape, halting after printing the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; – emphasizes Minsky's observation: (3) That by use of a Turing machine, a ''finite'' definition – in the form of the machine's TABLE – is being used to define what is a potentially-''infinite'' string of decimal digits.

This is however not the modern definition which only  requires the result be accurate to within any given accuracy. The informal definition above is subject to a rounding problem called the [[table-maker's dilemma]] whereas the modern definition is not.

==Formal definition==

A [[real number]] ''a'' is said to be '''computable''' if it can be approximated by some  [[computable function]] in the following manner: given any [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, the function produces an integer ''k'' such that:

:&lt;math&gt;{k-1\over n} \leq a \leq {k+1\over n}.&lt;/math&gt;

There are two similar definitions that are equivalent:
* There exists a computable function which, given any positive rational [[error bound]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, produces a [[rational number]] ''r'' such that &lt;math&gt;|r - a| \leq \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
*There is a computable sequence of rational numbers &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; converging to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|q_i - q_{i+1}| &lt; 2^{-i}\,&lt;/math&gt; for each ''i''.

There is another equivalent definition of computable numbers via computable [[Dedekind cut]]s.  A '''computable Dedekind cut''' is a computable function &lt;math&gt;D\;&lt;/math&gt; which when provided with a rational number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as input returns &lt;math&gt;D(r)=\mathrm{true}\;&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;D(r)=false\;&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the following conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;\exists r D(r)=\mathrm{true}\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\exists r D(r)=\mathrm{false}\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(D(r)=\mathrm{true}) \wedge (D(s)=\mathrm{false}) \Rightarrow r&lt;s\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D(r)=\mathrm{true} \Rightarrow \exist s&gt;r, D(s)=\mathrm{true}\;&lt;/math&gt;
An example is given by a program ''D'' that defines the [[cube root]] of 3. Assuming &lt;math&gt;q&gt;0\;&lt;/math&gt; this is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;p^3&lt;3 q^3 \Rightarrow  D(p/q)=\mathrm{true}\;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p^3&gt;3 q^3 \Rightarrow  D(p/q)=\mathrm{false}\;&lt;/math&gt;

A real number is computable if and only if there is a computable Dedekind cut ''D'' converging to it. The function ''D'' is unique for each irrational computable number (although of course two different programs may provide the same function).

A [[complex number]] is called computable if its real and imaginary parts are computable.

== Properties ==
Although the set of real numbers is [[uncountable]], the set of computable numbers is [[countable]] and thus [[almost all]] real numbers are not computable.  The computable numbers can be counted by assigning a [[Gödel number]] to each Turing machine definition.  This gives a function from the naturals to the computable reals.  Although the computable numbers are an ordered field, the set of Gödel numbers corresponding to computable numbers is not itself [[computably enumerable]], because it is not possible to effectively determine which  Gödel numbers correspond to Turing machines that produce computable reals. In order to produce a computable real, a Turing machine must compute a [[total function]], but the corresponding [[decision problem]] is in [[Turing degree]] '''0&amp;prime;&amp;prime;'''. Thus [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] cannot be used to produce uncountably many computable reals; at best, the reals formed from this method will be uncomputable.

The arithmetical operations on computable numbers are themselves computable in the sense that whenever real numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are computable then the following real numbers are also computable:  ''a + b'', ''a - b'', ''ab'', and ''a/b'' if ''b'' is nonzero.
These operations are actually ''uniformly computable''; for example, there is a Turing machine which on input (''A'',''B'',&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) produces output ''r'', where ''A'' is the description of a Turing machine approximating ''a'', ''B'' is the description of a Turing machine approximating ''b'', and ''r'' is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximation of ''a''+''b''.

The computable real numbers do not share all the properties of the real numbers used in analysis. For example, the least upper bound of a bounded increasing computable sequence of computable real numbers need not be a computable real number (Bridges and Richman, 1987:58). A sequence with this property is known as a [[Specker sequence]], as the first construction is due to E. Specker (1949). Despite the existence of counterexamples such as these, parts of calculus and real analysis can be developed in the field of computable numbers, leading to the study of [[computable analysis]]. 

The order relation on the computable numbers is not computable. There is no Turing machine which on input ''A'' (the description of a Turing machine approximating the number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) outputs &quot;YES&quot; if &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &quot;NO&quot; if &lt;math&gt;a \le 0&lt;/math&gt;. The reason: suppose the machine described by ''A'' keeps outputting 0 as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximations. It is not clear how long to wait before deciding that the machine will ''never'' output an approximation which forces ''a'' to be positive.   Thus the machine will eventually have to guess that the number will equal 0, in order to produce an output;  the sequence may later become different from 0.  This idea can be used to show that the machine is incorrect on some sequences if it computes a total function.  A similar problem occurs when the computable reals are represented as [[Dedekind cut]]s. The same holds for the equality relation : the equality test is not computable.

While the full order relation is not computable, the restriction of it to pairs of unequal numbers is computable. That is, there is a program that takes an input two turing machines ''A'' and ''B'' approximating numbers ''a'' and ''b'', where ''a''≠''b'', and outputs whether ''a''&lt;''b'' or ''a''&gt;''b''. It is sufficient to use ε-approximations where ε&lt;|b-a|/2; so by taking increasingly small ε (with a limit to 0), one eventually can decide whether ''a''&lt;''b'' or ''a''&gt;''b''.

Every computable number is [[Definable number|definable]], but not vice versa. There are many definable, noncomputable real numbers, including:
* The binary representation of the [[Halting problem]] (or any other uncomputable set of natural numbers).
* [[Chaitin's constant]], &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, which is a type of real number that is  [[Turing equivalent]] to the Halting problem.
A real number is computable if and only if the set of natural numbers it represents (when written in binary and viewed as a characteristic function) is computable.

== Digit Strings and the Cantor and Baire spaces ==

Turing's original paper defined computable numbers as follows:

:A real number is computable if its digit sequence can be produced by some algorithm or Turing machine. The algorithm takes an integer &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; as input and produces the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th digit of the real number's decimal expansion as output.

(Note that the decimal expansion of ''a'' only refers to the digits following the decimal point.)

Turing was aware that this definition is equivalent to the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approximation definition given above. The argument proceeds as follows: if a number is computable in the Turing sense, then it is also computable in the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; sense: if &lt;math&gt;n &gt; \log_{10} (1/\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, then the first ''n'' digits  of the decimal expansion for ''a''  provide an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximation of ''a''. For the converse, we pick an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; computable real number ''a'' and generate increasingly precisce approximations until  the ''n''th digit after the decimal point is certain.  This always generates a decimal expansion equal to ''a'' but it may improperly end in an infinite sequence of 9's in which case it must have a finite (and thus computable) proper decimal expansion. 

Unless certain topological properties of the real numbers are relevant it is often more convenient to deal with elements of &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; (total 0,1 valued functions) instead of reals numbers in &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.  The members of &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with binary decimal expansions but since the decimal expansions &lt;math&gt;.d_1d_2\ldots d_n0111\ldots&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;.d_1d_2\ldots d_n10&lt;/math&gt; denote the same real number the inteveral &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; can only be bijectively (and homeomorphically under the subset topology) identified with the subset of &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; not ending in all 1's. 

Note that this property of decimal expansions means it's impossible to effectively identify computable real numbers defined in terms of a decimal expansion and those defined in the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximation sense.  Hirst has shown there is no algorithm which takes as input the description of a Turing machine which produces &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximations for the computable number ''a'', and produces as output a Turing machine which enumerates the digits of ''a'' in the sense of Turing's definition (see Hirst 2007).   Similarly it means that the arithmetic operations on the computable reals are not effective on their decimal representations as when adding decimal numbers, in order to produce one digit it may be necessary to look arbitrarily far to the right to determine if there is a carry to the current location.  This lack of uniformity is one reason that the contemporary definition of computable numbers uses &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximations rather than decimal expansions.

However, from a computational or measure theoretic perspective the two structures &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; are essentially identical. and computability theorists often refer to members of &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; as reals.  While &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] for questions about &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; classes or randomness it's much less messy to work in &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;.

Elements of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes called reals as well and though containing a homeomorphic image of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; in addition to being totally disconnected isn't even locally compact.  This leads to genuine differences in the computational properties.  For instance the &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\forall(n \in \omega)\phi(x,n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,n)&lt;/math&gt; quatifier free must be computable while the unique &lt;math&gt;x \in \omega^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying a universal formula can be arbitrarily high in the hyperarithmetic hierarchy.

==Can computable numbers be used instead of the reals?==

The computable numbers include many of the specific real numbers which appear in practice, including all [[algebraic number]]s, as well as ''e'', &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, and many other [[transcendental number]]s. Though the computable reals exhaust those reals we can calculate or approximate, the assumption that all reals are computable leads to substantially different conclusions about the real numbers. The question naturally arises of whether it is possible to dispose of the full set of reals and use computable numbers for all of mathematics.  This idea is appealing from a [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] point of view, and has been pursued by what [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]] and Richman call the ''Russian school'' of constructive mathematics. 

To actually develop analysis over computable numbers, some care must be taken. For example, if one uses the classical definition of a sequence, the set of computable numbers is not closed under the basic operation of taking the [[supremum]] of a [[bounded sequence]] (for example, consider a [[Specker sequence]]). This difficulty is addressed by considering only sequences which have a computable [[modulus of convergence]]. The resulting mathematical theory is called [[computable analysis]].

==Implementation==

There are some computer packages that work with computable real numbers,
representing the real numbers as programs computing approximations.
One example is the [[RealLib]] package ([http://www.brics.dk/~barnie/RealLib/ reallib home page]).

This charge is typically carried by moving [[electron]]s in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] such as [[wire]]. It can also be carried by [[ion]]s in an [[Electrolyte#Electrochemistry|electrolyte]], or by both ions and electrons in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for measuring the rate of flow of electric charge is the [[ampere]], which is charge flowing through some surface at the rate of one [[coulomb]] per second. Electric current is measured using an [[ammeter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;learn-physics-today&quot; /&gt;

==Symbol==
The conventional symbol for current is &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, which may seem puzzling.  It originates from the French phrase ''intensité de courant'', or in English ''current intensity''.&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Lowe, John Rounce, ''Calculations for A-level Physics'', p.2, Nelson Thornes, 2002 ISBN 0748767487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard M. Berlin, Frank C. Getz, ''Principles of Electronic Instrumentation and Measurement'', p.37, Merrill Pub. Co., 1988 ISBN 0675204496.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phrase is frequently used when discussing the value of an electric current, especially in older texts; modern practice often shortens this to simply ''current'' but ''current intensity'' is still used in many recent textbooks.  The &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; symbol was used by [[André-Marie Ampère]] himself, after whom the unit of electric current is named, in formulating the eponymous [[Ampère's force law]] which he discovered in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;A-M Ampère, [http://www.ampere.cnrs.fr/textes/recueil/pdf/recueilobservationsd.pdf ''Recuil d'Observations Électro-dynamiques''], p.56, Paris: Chez Crochard Libraire 1822 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;  The notation travelled from France to England where it became standard, although at least one journal did not change from using &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; until 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=k9WPTb6uDYntsgbG3dyRCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=BCZLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22current+intensity%22 ''Electric Power''], '''vol.6''', p.411, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conduction mechanisms in various media==

{{unreferenced-section|date=February 2011}}
In metallic solids, electricity flows by means of [[electron]]s, from lower to higher [[electrical potential]]. In other media, any stream of charged objects may constitute an electric current.  To provide a definition of current that is independent of the type of charge carriers flowing, ''conventional current'' is defined to flow in the same direction as positive charges.  So in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current flows in the opposite direction as the electrons.  In conductors where the charge carriers are positive, conventional current flows in the same direction as the charge carriers.

In a [[vacuum]], a beam of ions or electrons may be formed. In other conductive materials, the electric current is due to the flow of both positively and negatively charged particles at the same time. In still others, the current is entirely due to [[proton conductor|positive charge flow]]. For example, the electric currents in [[electrolytes]] are flows of electrically charged atoms (ions), which exist in both positive and negative varieties.  In a common lead-acid [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] cell, electric currents are composed of positive hydrogen ions (protons) flowing in one direction, and negative sulfate ions flowing in the other.  Electric currents in [[electric spark|sparks]] or [[Plasma physics|plasma]] are flows of electrons as well as positive and negative ions.  In ice and in certain solid electrolytes, the electric current is entirely composed of flowing ions. In a [[semiconductor]] it is sometimes useful to think of the current as due to the flow of positive &quot;[[electron hole|holes]]&quot; (the mobile positive charge carriers that are places where the semiconductor crystal is missing a valence electron). This is the case in a p-type semiconductor.

=== Metals ===

A [[solid]] [[Electrical conductor|conductive]] metal contains mobile, or [[free electron]]s, originating in the [[conduction electrons]]. These electrons are bound to the [[Metal#Definition|metal lattice]] but no longer to any individual atom. Even with no external [[electric field]] applied, these electrons move about randomly due to [[thermal energy]] but, on average, there is zero net current within the metal.  Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, the number of electrons moving from one side to the other in any period of time is on average equal to the number passing in the opposite direction. As [[George Gamow]] put in his science-popularizing book, ''One, Two, Three...Infinity'' (1947), &quot;The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.&quot;

When a metal wire is connected across the two terminals of a [[Direct current|DC]] [[voltage source]] such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the source places an electric field across the conductor. The moment contact is made, the [[free electron]]s of the conductor are forced to drift toward the [[Positive (electricity)|positive]] terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the [[charge carrier]] in a typical solid conductor. For an electric current of 1 ampere, 1 [[coulomb]] of electric charge (which consists of about 6.242 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[elementary charge]]s) drifts every [[second]] through any plane through which the conductor passes.

For a steady flow of charge through a surface, the current ''I'' in amperes can be calculated with the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;I = {Q \over t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Q'' is the electric charge transferred through the surface over some [[time]] ''t''.  If ''Q'' and ''t'' are measured in [[coulomb]]s and seconds respectively, ''I'' is in amperes.

More generally, electric current can be represented as the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}t} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Electrolytes===
{{main|Conductivity (electrolytic)}}
Electric currents in [[electrolyte]]s are flows of electrically charged particles ([[ion]]s). For example, if an electric field is placed across a solution of [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (and conditions are right) the sodium ions move towards the negative electrode (cathode), while the chloride ions move towards the positive electrode (anode). Reactions take place at both electrode surfaces, absorbing each ion.

Water-ice and certain solid electrolytes called [[proton conductor]]s contain positive hydrogen ions or &quot;[[protons]]&quot; which are mobile.  In these materials, electric currents are composed of moving protons, as opposed to the moving electrons found in metals.

In certain electrolyte mixtures, brightly-colored ions form the moving electric charges.  The slow migration of these ions means that the current is visible.

===Gases and plasmas===
In air and other ordinary [[gas]]es below the breakdown field, the dominant source of electrical conduction is via a relatively small number of mobile ions produced by radioactive gases, ultraviolet light, or cosmic rays. Since the electrical conductivity is low, gases are [[dielectric]]s or [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s. However, once the applied [[electric field]] approaches the [[dielectric breakdown|breakdown]] value, free electrons become sufficiently accelerated by the electric field to create additional free electrons by colliding, and [[ionizing]], neutral gas atoms or molecules in a process called [[avalanche breakdown]]. The breakdown process forms a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that contains a significant number of mobile electrons and positive ions, causing it to behave as an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a [[Electrostatic discharge|spark]], [[electric arc|arc]] or [[lightning]].

[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] is the state of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or &quot;ionized&quot; from their [[molecule]]s or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high [[temperature]], or by application of a high electric or alternating magnetic field as noted above. Due to their lower mass, the electrons in a plasma accelerate more quickly in response to an electric field than the heavier positive ions, and hence carry the bulk of the current.

===Vacuum===
Since a &quot;[[free space|perfect vacuum]]&quot; contains no charged particles, it normally behaves as perfect insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting [[free electron]]s or [[ion]]s through either [[field electron emission]] or [[thermionic emission]]. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's [[work function]], while [[field electron emission]] occurs when the electric field at the surface of the metal is high enough to cause [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]], which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an [[electron cloud]] as in the [[electrical filament|filament]] or indirectly heated [[cathode]] of [[vacuum tubes]]. [[cold cathode|Cold electrodes]] can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called '''cathode spots''' or '''anode spots''') are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current flow. These regions may be initiated by [[field electron emission]], but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a [[vacuum arc]] forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. [[Vacuum tube]]s and [[Krytron|sprytron]]s are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.

== Current density and Ohm's law==

{{Main|Current density}}
Current density is a measure of the density of an electric current. It is defined as a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] whose magnitude is the electric current per cross-sectional area. In [[SI|SI units]], the current density is measured in amperes per [[square meter]].

:&lt;math&gt;I = \vec{J} \cdot \vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is current in the conductor, '''J''' is the current density, and '''A''' is the cross-sectional area.
The [[dot product]] of the two vector quantities ('''A''' and '''J''') is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] that represents the electric current.

Current density (current per unit area) ''J'' in a material is proportional to the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] ''σ'' and [[electric field]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in the medium:

:&lt;math&gt;J =\sigma E \,&lt;/math&gt;

Instead of conductivity, reciprocal quantity called [[electrical resistivity|resistivity]] ''ρ'', can be used:

:&lt;math&gt;J = {E \over \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Conduction in [[semiconductor devices]] may occur by a combination of electric field (drift) and diffusion, which is proportional to [[diffusion constant]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and [[charge density]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha_q&lt;/math&gt;. The current density is then:

:&lt;math&gt;J =\sigma E + D q \nabla n ,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; being the [[elementary charge]] and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the electron density. The carriers move in the direction of decreasing concentration, so for electrons a positive current results for a positive density gradient. If the carriers are holes, replace electron density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by the negative of the [[electron hole|hole]] density &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

In linear [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] materials, ''σ'', ''ρ'' and ''D'' are [[tensor]]s.

In linear materials such as metals, and under low frequencies, the current density across the conductor surface is uniform. In such conditions, [[Ohm's law]] states that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference between two ends (across) of that metal (ideal) [[resistor]] (or other [[ohmic device]]):
:&lt;math&gt;I = {V \over R} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the current, measured in amperes; &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[potential difference]], measured in [[volt]]s; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s. The letter &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; stands for the German word, &quot;Intensität&quot; meaning &quot;Intensity&quot;. For [[alternating current]]s, especially at higher frequencies, [[skin effect]] causes the current to spread unevenly across the conductor cross-section, with higher density near the surface, thus increasing the apparent resistance.

== Drift speed ==
The mobile charged particles within a conductor move constantly in random directions, like the particles of a [[gas]].  In order for there to be a net flow of charge, the particles must also move together with an average drift rate. Electrons are the charge carriers in [[metal]]s and they follow an erratic path, bouncing from atom to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed at which they drift can be calculated from the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;I=nAvQ \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the electric current
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is number of charged particles per unit volume (or charge carrier density)
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the conductor
:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[drift velocity]], and
:&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge on each particle.
Electric currents in solids typically flow very slowly.  For example, in a [[copper]] wire of cross-section 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, carrying a current of 5&amp;nbsp;A, the ''drift velocity'' of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example, in the near-vacuum inside a [[cathode ray tube]], the electrons travel in near-straight lines at about a tenth of the [[speed of light]].

Any accelerating electric charge, and therefore any changing electric current, gives rise to an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] wave that propagates at very high speed outside the surface of the conductor.  This speed is usually a significant fraction of the speed of light, as can be deduced from [[Maxwell's Equations]], and is therefore many times faster than the drift velocity of the electrons. For example, in [[electric power transmission|AC power lines]], the waves of electromagnetic energy propagate through the space between the wires, moving from a source to a distant [[external electric load|load]], even though the electrons in the wires only move back and forth over a tiny distance.

The ratio of the speed of the electromagnetic wave to the speed of light in free space is called the [[velocity factor]], and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.

The magnitudes (but, not the natures) of these three velocities can be illustrated by an analogy with the three similar velocities associated with gases.
*The low drift velocity of charge carriers is analogous to air motion; in other words, winds.
*The high speed of electromagnetic waves is roughly analogous to the speed of sound in a gas (these waves move through the medium much faster than any individual particles do)
*The random motion of charges is analogous to heat - the thermal velocity of randomly vibrating gas particles.
This analogy is extremely simplistic and incomplete: The rapid propagation of a sound wave doesn't impart any change in the air molecules' drift velocity, whereas EM waves do carry the energy to propagate the actual current at a rate which is much, much higher than the electrons' drift velocity. To illustrate the difference: The sound and the change in the air's drift velocity (the force of the wind gust) cross distance at rates equaling the speeds of sound and of mechanical transmission of force ('''not higher''' than rate of drift velocity); while a change in an EM field and the '''change''' in current (electrons' drift velocity) both propagate across distance at rates '''much higher''' than the actual drift velocity. You can hear wind much earlier than the force of the gust reaches you, but you don't observe a change in an EM field earlier than you can observe the change of current.

== Electromagnetism ==
[[Image:Electromagnetism.svg|175px|thumb|According to [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]], an electric current produces a [[magnetic field]].]]
Electric current produces a [[magnetic field]].  The magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire.

Electric current can be directly measured with a [[galvanometer]], but this method involves breaking the [[electrical circuit]], which is sometimes inconvenient.  Current can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current.  Devices used for this include [[Hall effect]] [[sensor]]s, [[current clamp]]s, [[current transformer]]s, and [[Rogowski coil]]s.

The theory of [[Special_relativity#Relativity_and_unifying_electromagnetism|Special Relativity]] allows one to [[Classical_electromagnetism_and_special_relativity#Relationship_between_electricity_and_magnetism|transform the magnetic field into a static electric field]] for an observer moving at the same speed as the charge in the diagram.  The amount of current is particular to a reference frame.

==Conventions==
{{anchor|Current}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hall effect]] and [[conventional current]] --&gt;
[[Image:Current notation.svg|left|230px|thumb|The [[electrons]], the [[charge carriers]] in an electrical circuit, flow in the opposite direction of the ''conventional'' electric current.]]
[[File:Battery symbol2.svg|thumb|right|100px|The [[electronic symbol|symbol]] for a battery in a [[circuit diagram]].]]
A flow of positive charges gives the same ''electric'' current as a flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. Since current can be the flow of either positive or negative charges, or both, a convention for the direction of current which is independent of the type of [[charge carrier]]s is needed.  Therefore the direction of ''conventional current'' is defined to be the direction of the flow of positive charges.

In metals, which make up the wires and other conductors in most [[electrical circuit]]s, the positive charges are immobile, and only the negatively charged electrons flow.  Because the electron carries negative charge, the ''electron'' motion in a metal conductor is in the direction opposite to that of conventional (or ''electric'') current.

=== Reference direction ===
When analyzing electrical circuits, the actual direction of current through a specific circuit element is usually unknown. Consequently, each circuit element is assigned a current variable with an arbitrarily chosen ''reference direction''. When the circuit is solved, the circuit element currents may have positive or negative values. A negative value means that the actual direction of current through that circuit element is opposite that of the chosen reference direction.
In electronic circuits the reference current directions are usually chosen so that all currents flow toward ground. This often matches conventional current direction, because in many circuits the [[power supply]] voltage is positive with respect to ground.

== Occurrences ==
Natural examples include [[lightning]] and the [[solar wind]], the source of the [[polar aurora]]s (the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]]).  The artificial form of electric current is the flow of [[electrical conduction|conduction]] electrons in metal wires, such as the overhead power lines that deliver [[electric power transmission|electrical energy]] across long distances and the smaller wires within electrical and electronic equipment. In [[electronics]], other forms of electric current include the flow of electrons through [[resistor]]s or through the vacuum in a [[vacuum tube]], the flow of ions inside a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or a [[neuron]], and the flow of [[Electron hole|holes]] within a [[semiconductor]].

==Current measurement==
Current can be measured using an [[ammeter]].

At the circuit level, there are various techniques that can be used to measure current:
*Shunt resistors&lt;ref&gt;http://focus.ti.com/analog/docs/microsite.tsp?sectionId=560&amp;tabId=2180&amp;micrositeId=7&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hall effect]] current sensor transducers
*Transformers (however DC cannot be measured)
*Magnetoresistive field sensors&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/electric-magnetic/the-universal-current-sensor-1029&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Charles Ancillon''' (28 July 1659 – 5 July 1715) was a [[France|French]] [[jurist]] and [[diplomat]].

Ancillon was born in [[Metz]] into a distinguished family of [[Huguenot]]s.  His father, [[David Ancillon]] (1617–1692), was obliged to leave [[France]] on the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], and became pastor of the French [[Protestant]] community in [[Berlin]].

Ancillon studied law at [[Marburg]], [[Geneva]], and [[Paris]], where he was called to the bar.  At the request of the Huguenots at Metz, he pleaded its cause at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], but his efforts were unsuccessful, and he joined his father in Berlin. He was at once appointed by Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] &quot;''juge et directeur de colonie de Berlin''.&quot; Before this, he had published several works on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and its consequences, but his literary capacity was mediocre, his style stiff and cold, and it was his personal character rather than his reputation as a writer that earned him the confidence of the elector.

In 1687 Ancillon was appointed head of the so-called ''Academie des nobles,'' the principal educational establishment of the state; later on, as councillor of embassy, he took part in the negotiations which led to the assumption of the title of &quot;[[King in Prussia]]&quot; by the elector.  In 1699 he succeeded [[Samuel Pufendorf]] as historiographer to the elector, and the same year replaced his uncle [[Joseph Ancillon]] as judge of all the French refugees in the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].

Ancillon is mainly remembered for what he did for education in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]],  and the share he took, in co-operation with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], in founding the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Berlin]]. Of his fairly numerous works the one of the most value is the &quot;''Histoire de l'etablissement des Francais refugies dans les etats de Brandebourg''&quot; published in Berlin in 1690.

'''Clark Ashton Smith''' (13 January 1893 – 14 August 1961) was a self-educated American [[poet]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], [[Painting|painter]] and author of [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] [[short story|short stories]]. He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of [[George Sterling]], for traditional verse in the vein of [[Swinburne]]. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics (alongside [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Joaquin Miller]], Sterling, [[Nora May French]], and others) and remembered as 'The Last of the Great Romantics' and 'The Bard of Auburn'.
As a member of the Lovecraft circle, (Smith's literary friendship with [[H. P. Lovecraft]] lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft's death in 1937), Smith remains second only to Lovecraft in general esteem and importance amongst contributors to the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[Weird Tales]]'', where some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. (It has been said of him that &quot;Nobody since Poe has so loved a well-rotted corpse.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clark Ashton Smith: Sierran Shaman&quot; in L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerors: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'' (Arkham House, 1976), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;
His work is marked chiefly by an extraordinarily wide and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humour.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Smith was born Jan 13, 1893 in Long Valley, California, of English and Yankee parentage. He spent most of his life in the small town of [[Auburn, California]], living in a small cabin built by his parents, Fanny and Timeus Smith. His formal education was limited: he suffered from psychological disorders including a fear of crowds, and although admitted to high school after attending eight years of grammar school (Long Valley School, whence dates the earliest known photo of him), he never went to high school. His parents decided it was better for him to be educated at home.

However, he was an insatiable reader, and continued to teach himself after he left school. His education began with the reading of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (unabridged), ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', the fairy tales of [[Hans Christian Anderson]] and [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' and (at the age of 13) the poems of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He read an unabridged dictionary (the 13th edition of Webster’s) through, word for word, studying not only the definitions of the words but also their derivations from ancient languages. Having an extraordinary [[eidetic]] memory, he seems to have retained most or all of it.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clark Ashton Smith: Sierran Shaman&quot; in L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerors: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'' (Arkham House, 1976), p. 197-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main course in Smith's self-education was to read the 11th edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'' through at least twice.&lt;ref&gt;Behrends, Steve. ''Clark Ashton Smith''. Starmont Reader's Guide 49. Mercer Island, WA: Starmont House, 1990, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later taught himself [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in order to translate verse out of those languages. Smith professed to hate the provinciality of the small town of Auburn but rarely left it until he married late in life.

===Writing career===
==Early stories and poetry ==

His first literary efforts, at the age of 11, took the form of fairy tales and imitations of the Arabian Nights. Later, he wrote long adventure novels dealing with Oriental life. By 14 he had already written a short adventure novel called ''The Black Diamonds'' which was lost for years until published in 2002. Another juvenile novel was written in his teenaged years—''[[The Sword of Zagan]]'' (unpublished until 2004). Like ''The Black Diamonds'', it uses a [[Middle Ages|medieval]], [[Arabian Nights]]–like setting, and the [[Arabian Nights]], like the fairy tales of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], are known to have strongly influenced Smith's early writing, as did [[William Beckford]]'s [[Vathek]].

At age 17, he sold several tales to ''The Black Cat'', a magazine which specialised in unusual tales. He also published some tales in [[The Overland Monthly]] in this brief foray into fiction which preceded his poetic career. 

However, it was primarily poetry that motivated the young Smith and he confined his efforts for poetry for more than a decade. In his later youth, Smith made the acquaintance of the [[San Francisco]] poet [[George Sterling]] through a member of the local [[Auburn Monday Night Club]], where he read several of his poems with considerable success. On a month-long visit to Sterling in [[Carmel, California]], Smith was introduced by Sterling to the poetry of [[Baudelaire]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clark Ashton Smith: Sierran Shaman&quot; in L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'' (Arkham House, 1976), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

He became Sterling's [[protégé]] and Sterling helped him to publish his first volume of poems, ''[[The Star-Treader and Other Poems]]'', at the age of 19. Smith received international acclaim for the collection ''[[The Star-Treader]]'' was received very favorably by American critics, one of whom named Smith &quot;the [[John Keats|Keats]] of the Pacific.&quot; Smith briefly moved among the circle that included [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Jack London]] but his early fame soon faded away.

==Health breakdown period==

A little later, Smith's health broke down and for eight years his literary production was intermittent, though he produced his best poetry during this period. A small volume, ''Odes and Sonnets'', was brought out in 1918. Smith came into contact with literary figures who would later form part of H.P. Lovecraft's circle of correspondents; Smith knew them far earlier than Lovecraft. These figures include poet [[Samuel Loveman]] and bookman George Kirk. It was Smith who in fact later introduced [[Donald Wandrei]] to Lovecraft. For this reason, it has been suggested that Lovecraft might as well be referred to as a member of a &quot;Smith&quot; circle as Smith as a member of a Lovecraft one.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Schultz and Scott Connors, ''Selected Letters of Clark Ashton Smith'', (Arkham House, 2003), p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 Smith composed a celebrated long poem in blank verse, ''The Hashish Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil'' which was published in ''[[Ebony and Crystal]]'' (1922). This was followed by a fan letter from [[H. P. Lovecraft]], which was the beginning of 15 years of friendship and correspondence. With studied playfulness, Smith and Lovecraft borrowed each other's coinages of place names and the names of strange gods for their stories, though so different is Smith's treatment of the Lovecraft theme that it has been dubbed the 'Clark Ashton Smythos'.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Clark Ashton Smythos&quot; in Price, Robert M. (ed). ''The Horror of it All: Encrusted gems from the Crypt of Cthulhu''. Mercer Island WA: Starmont House, 1990. ISBN 1-55742-122-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Smith published ''Sandalwood''. He wrote little fiction in this period with the exception of some imaginative vignettes or [[prose poem]]s. Smith was poor for most of his life and often did hard manual jobs such as such as fruitpicking and [[woodcutting]] in order to support himself and his parents. He was an able cook and made many kinds of wine. He also did well digging, typing and journalism, as well as contributing a column to ''The Auburn Journal'' and sometimes worked as its night editor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clark Ashton Smith: Sierran Shaman&quot; in L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerors: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'' (Arkham House, 1976), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Smith's artistic patrons was businessman Albert N. Bender.

==Prolific fiction-writing period==

At the beginning of the Depression in 1929, with his aged parents' health weakening, Smith resumed fiction-writing and turned out more than a hundred short stories, nearly all of which can be classed as weird horror or science fiction. Like Lovecraft, he drew upon the nightmares that had plagued him during youthful spells of sickness. 
He published at his own expense a volume containing six of his best stories, ''The Double Shadow and Other Fantasies'', in an edition of 1000 copies printed by the ''Auburn Journal''.The theme of much of his work is egotism and its supernatural punishment; his weird fiction is generally macabre in subject matter, gloatingly preoccupied with images of death, decay and abnormality.

Most of Smith's weird fiction falls into four series set variously in [[Hyperborea]], [[Poseidonis]], [[Averoigne]] and [[Zothique]]. Hyperborea, which is a lost continent of the Miocene period, and Poseidonis, which is a remnant of Atlantis, are much the same, with a magical culture characterised by bizareness, cruelty, death and post-mortem horrors. Averoigne is Smith's version of pre-modern France, comparable to [[James Branch Cabell]]'s Poictesme. Zothique exists millions of years in the future. It is &quot;the last continent of earth, when the sun is dim and tarnished.&quot; These tales have been compared to the ''Dying Earth'' sequence of [[Jack Vance]]. 

In 1933 Smith began corresponding with [[Robert E. Howard]], the Texan creator of [[Conan the Barbarian]]. From 1933-1937, Smith, Howard and Lovecraft were the leaders of the [[Weird Tales]] school of fiction, and corresponded frequently although they never met. The writer of oriental fantasies, [[E. Hoffman Price]], is the only man known to have met all three in the flesh.

==Mid-late career: return to poetry and sculpture==

In Sept 1937, Smith's mother Fanny died. Smith spent the next two years nursing his father through his last illness. Timeus died in December 1937. Aged 44, Smith now virtually ceased writing fiction. He had been severely affected by several tragedies occurring in a short period of time: [[Robert E. Howard]]'s death by suicide (1936), Lovecraft's death from cancer (1937) and the deaths of his parents, which left him exhausted. As a result, he withdrew from the scene, marking the end of ''Weird Tales''' [[Golden Age]].He began sculpting and resumed the writing of poetry. However, Smith was visited by many writers at his cabin, including [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Rah Hoffman]], [[Francis T. Laney]] and others.

In 1942, three years after [[August Derleth]] founded [[Arkham House]] for the purpose of preserving the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections of Smith's fiction, ''Out of Space and Time'' (1942). This was followed by ''Lost Worlds'' (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes of Smith's prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume of Smith's poems in press.

==Later life, marriage and death==

In 1953 Smith suffered a coronary attack. Aged 61, he married Carol(yn) Jones Dorman on 10 November 1954. Dorman had much experience in Hollywood and radio public relations. After honeymooning at the Smith cabin, they moved to [[Pacific Grove, California]], where he set up a household with their children. (Carol had been married before and had three children). For several years he alternated between the house on Indian Ridge and his wife's house in Pacific Grove. Having sold most of his father's tract, in 1957 the old house burned - the Smiths believed by arson, others said by accident. 

Smith now reluctantly did gardening for other residents at Pacific Grove, and grew a goatee. He spent much time shopping and walking near the seafront but despite Derleth's badgering, resisted the writing of more fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Haefele, John D. &quot;Far from Time: Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth, and Arkham House.&quot; ''Weird Fiction Review'' No 1 (Fall 2010),170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 he suffered strokes. In August 1961 he quietly died in his sleep, aged 68. After Smith's death Carol remarried (becoming Carolyn Wakefield) and subsequently died of cancer.  

The poet's ashes were buried beside, or beneath, a boulder to the immediate west of where his childhood home (destroyed by fire in 1957) stood; some were also scattered in a stand of blue oaks near the boulder. There was no marker.[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=18549] However in more recent times a plaque to his memory has been erected at the [[Auburn, California]] Placer County Library.[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=18549&amp;PIpi=26712944]

Bookseller [[Roy A. Squires]] was appointed Smith's &quot;west coast executor&quot;, with [[Jack L. Chalker]] as his &quot;east coast executor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Haefele, John D. &quot;Far from Time: Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth, and Arkham House.&quot; ''Weird Fiction Review'' No 1 (Fall 2010), 172&lt;/ref&gt; Squires published many letterpress editions of individual Smith poems. 

Smith's literary estate is represented by his stepson, Prof William Dorman, director of CASiana Literary Enterprises. [[Arkham House]] owns the copyright in many Smith stories, though some are now in the public domain.

For 'posthumous collaborations' of Smith (stories completed by Lin Carter), see the entry on [[Lin Carter]].

==Artistic periods==

While Smith was always an artist who worked in several very different media, it is possible to identify three distinct periods in which one form of art had precedence over the others.

===Poetry: Until 1925===
Smith published most of his volumes of poetry in this period, including the aforementioned ''[[The Star-Treader and Other Poems]]'', as well as ''[[Odes and Sonnets]]'' (1918), ''[[Ebony and Crystal]]'' (1922) and ''[[Sandalwood]]'' (1925). His [[long poem]] ''[[The Hashish-Eater; Or, the Apocalypse of Evil]]'' was written in 1920.

===Weird Fiction: 1926–1935===

Smith wrote most of his [[weird fiction]] and [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories, partially inspired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Creatures of his invention include [[Aforgomon]], [[Rlim-Shaikorth]], [[Mordiggian]], [[Tsathoggua]], the wizard [[Eibon]], and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in some of his stories to a great dark wizard, &quot;Klarkash-Ton.&quot;

Smith's weird stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: [[Averoigne]], [[Hyperborean cycle|Hyperborea]], [[Mars in fiction|Mars]], [[Atlantis|Poseidonis]], [[Zothique]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackgate.com/articles/zothique.htm Blackgate.com]&lt;/ref&gt; To some extent Smith was influenced in his vision of such lost worlds by the teachings of [[Theosophy]] and the writings of [[Helena Blavatsky]].Stories set in Zothique belong to the [[Dying Earth subgenre]]. Amongst Smith's science fiction tales are stories set on [[Mars]] and the invented planet of [[Xiccarph]]. 

His short stories originally appeared in the magazines ''[[Weird Tales]]'', ''[[Strange Tales]]'', ''[[Astounding Stories]]'', ''[[Science fiction magazine|Stirring Science Stories]]'' and ''[[Wonder Stories]]''.

Clark Ashton Smith was the third member of the great triumvirate of ''Weird Tales'', with Lovecraft and [[Robert E. Howard]]. 

Many of Smith's stories were published in six hardcover volumes by [[August Derleth]] under his [[Arkham House]] imprint.  For a full bibliography to 1978, see Sidney-Fryer, ''Emperor of Dreams'' (cited below). [[S.T. Joshi]] is working with other scholars to produce an updated bibliography of Smith's work.

===Sculpture and Art 1935–1961===

By this time his interest in writing fiction began to lessen and he turned to creating sculptures from soft rock such as [[soapstone]]. Many examples are reproduced in Dennis Rickard's ''The Fantastic Art of Clark Ashton Smith'' (Baltimore, MD: The Mirage Press, 1973). Smith also made hundreds of fantastic paintings and drawings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''context-sensitive grammar''' ('''CSG''') is a [[formal grammar]] in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any [[production rule]]s may be surrounded by a context of [[terminal symbol|terminal]] and [[nonterminal symbol]]s. Context-sensitive grammars are more general than [[context-free grammar]]s but still orderly enough to be [[parsing|parsed]] by a [[linear bounded automaton]].

The concept of context-sensitive grammar was introduced by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s as a way to describe the syntax of [[natural language]] where it is indeed often the case that a word may or may not be appropriate in a certain place depending upon the context. A [[formal language]] that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar is called a [[context-sensitive language]].

==Formal definition==
A [[formal grammar]] ''G'' = (''N'', Σ, ''P'', ''S'') ( this is the same as ''G'' = (''V'', ''T'', ''P'', ''S'') , just that the Non - Terminal V(ariable) is replaced by N and T(erminal) is replaced by Σ ) is context-sensitive if all rules in ''P'' are of the form
: α''A''β → αγβ
where ''A'' ∈ ''N'' (i.e., ''A'' is a single [[nonterminal]]), α,β ∈ (''N'' U Σ)* (i.e., α and β are strings of nonterminals and [[Terminal symbol|terminal]]s) and γ ∈ (''N'' U Σ)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., γ is a nonempty string of nonterminals and terminals). 

Some definitions also add that for any production rule of the form u → v of a context-sensitive grammar, it shall be true that |u|≤|v|. Here |u| and |v| denote the length of the strings respectively.

In addition, a rule of the form
: S → λ   provided S does not appear on the right side of any rule
where λ represents the [[empty string]] is permitted.  The addition of the empty string allows the statement that the context sensitive languages are a proper superset of the context free languages, rather than having to make the weaker statement that all context free grammars with no →λ productions are also context sensitive grammars.

The name ''context-sensitive'' is explained by the α and β that form the context of ''A'' and determine whether ''A'' can be replaced with γ or not. This is different from a [[context-free grammar]] where the context of a nonterminal is not taken into consideration. (Indeed, every production of a context free grammar is of the form V → w where V is a ''single'' nonterminal symbol, and w is a string of terminals and/or nonterminals (w can be empty)).

If the possibility of adding the empty string to a language is added to the strings recognized by the noncontracting grammars (which can never include the empty string) then the languages in these two definitions are identical.

== Examples ==

* This grammar generates the canonical non-[[context-free language]] &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n c^n | n \ge 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;:
# &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aSBC&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aBC   &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;CB \rightarrow HB   &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;HB \rightarrow HC   &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;HC \rightarrow BC   &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;aB \rightarrow ab   &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;bB \rightarrow bb   &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;bC \rightarrow bc   &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;cC \rightarrow cc   &lt;/math&gt;

The generation chain for aaa bbb ccc is:

: &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_1 aSBC&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_1 a\boldsymbol{aSBC}BC     &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_2 aa\boldsymbol{aBC}BCBC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_3 aaaB\boldsymbol{HB}CBC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_4 aaaB\boldsymbol{HC}CBC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_5 aaaB\boldsymbol{BC}CBC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_3 aaaBBC\boldsymbol{HB}C   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_4 aaaBBC\boldsymbol{HC}C   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_5 aaaBBC\boldsymbol{BC}C   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_3 aaaBB\boldsymbol{HB}CC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_4 aaaBB\boldsymbol{HC}CC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_5 aaaBB\boldsymbol{BC}CC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_6 aa\boldsymbol{ab}BBCCC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_7 aaa\boldsymbol{bb}BCCC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_7 aaab\boldsymbol{bb}CCC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_8 aaabb\boldsymbol{bc}CC   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_9 aaabbb\boldsymbol{cc}C   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_9 aaabbbc\boldsymbol{cc}   &lt;/math&gt;


More complicated grammars can be used to parse &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n c^n d^n | n \ge 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;, and other languages with even more letters.

* This language generates the non-context-free copy language, &lt;math&gt;C = \{ x x | x \in \{a,b\}^* \} &lt;/math&gt;:
# &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aAS | bBS | T &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Aa \rightarrow aA &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Ba \rightarrow aB &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Ab \rightarrow bA &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Bb \rightarrow bB &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;BT \rightarrow Tb &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;AT \rightarrow Ta &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T \rightarrow \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

The generation chain for abab is:

: &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_1 aAS&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_1 aA\boldsymbol{bBS}     &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_1 aAbB\boldsymbol{T}   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_4 a\boldsymbol{bA}BT   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_6 abA\boldsymbol{Tb}   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_7 ab\boldsymbol{Ta}b   &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_8 abab   &lt;/math&gt;

== Normal forms ==
Every context-sensitive grammar which does not generate the empty string can be transformed into an equivalent one in [[Kuroda normal form]]. &quot;Equivalent&quot; here means that the two grammars generate the same language. The normal form will not in general be context-sensitive, but will be a [[noncontracting grammar]].

== Computational properties and uses ==
The [[decision problem]] that asks whether a certain string ''s'' belongs to the language of a certain context-sensitive grammar ''G'', is [[PSPACE-complete]]. There are even some context-sensitive grammars whose fixed grammar recognition problem is PSPACE-complete.

The emptiness problem for context-sensitive grammars (given a context-sensitive grammar G, is &lt;math&gt;L(G)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; ?) is [[Undecidable language|undecidable]]. 

It has been shown that nearly all [[natural language]]s may in general be characterized by context-sensitive grammars, but the whole class of CSG's seems to be much bigger than natural languages.  Worse yet, since the aforementioned decision problem for CSG's is PSPACE-complete, that makes them totally unworkable for practical use, as a polynomial-time algorithm for a PSPACE-complete problem would imply [[P=NP problem|P=NP]]. Ongoing research on [[computational linguistics]] has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are &quot;[[mildly context-sensitive language|mildly context-sensitive]]&quot; whose decision problems are feasible, such as [[tree-adjoining grammar]]s, [[combinatory categorial grammar]]s, [[coupled context-free language]]s, and [[linear context-free rewriting system]]s.  The languages generated by these formalisms properly lie between the context-free and context-sensitive languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''context-sensitive language''' is a [[formal language]] that can be defined by a [[context-sensitive grammar]].  That is one of the four types of grammars in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].  Of the four, this is the least often used, in both theory and practice.

== Computational properties ==

Computationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded [[nondeterministic Turing machine]], also called a [[linear bounded automaton]]. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only ''kn'' cells, where ''n'' is the size of the input and ''k'' is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.

This set of languages is also known as '''NLIN-SPACE''', because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine.  The class '''LIN-SPACE''' is defined the same, except using a [[Deterministic_automaton|deterministic]] Turing machine.  Clearly '''LIN-SPACE''' is a subset of '''NLIN-SPACE''', but it is not known whether '''LIN-SPACE'''='''NLIN-SPACE'''.  It is widely suspected they are not equal.

== Examples ==

An example of a context-sensitive language that is not context-free is ''L'' = { ''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' : ''p'' is a [[prime number]] }. ''L'' can be shown to be a context-sensitive language by constructing a linear bounded automaton which accepts ''L''. The language can easily be shown to be neither [[regular language|regular]] nor [[context-free language|context free]] by applying the respective [[pumping lemma]]s for each of the language classes to ''L''.

An example of [[recursive language]] that is not context-sensitive is any recursive language whose decision is an [[EXPSPACE]]-hard problem, say, the set of pairs of equivalent [[regular expression]]s with exponentiation.

== Properties of context-sensitive languages ==

* The union, intersection, and concatenation of two context-sensitive languages is context-sensitive.
* The complement of a context-sensitive language is itself context-sensitive.
* Every [[context-free grammar|context-free]] language is context-sensitive.
* Membership of a string in a language defined by an arbitrary context-sensitive grammar, or by an arbitrary deterministic context-sensitive grammar, is a [[PSPACE-complete]] problem.

The '''Chinese room''' is a [[thought experiment]] by [[John Searle]] which first appeared in his paper &quot;Minds, Brains, and Programs&quot;, published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' in 1980.{{sfn|Searle|1980}} It addresses the question: if a machine can convincingly simulate an intelligent conversation, does it necessarily understand?  In the experiment Searle imagines himself in a room, acting as a [[computer]] by manually executing a [[computer program|program]] that convincingly simulates the behavior of a native Chinese speaker. People outside the room slide Chinese characters under the door and Searle, to whom &quot;Chinese writing is just so many meaningless squiggles&quot;,{{sfn|Searle|1980}} is able to create sensible replies, in Chinese, by following the instructions of the program; that is, by moving papers around.  The question arises whether Searle can be said to understand Chinese in the same way that, as Searle says:&lt;blockquote&gt;according to strong AI, . . . the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.{{sfn|Searle|1980}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The experiment is the centerpiece of Searle's '''Chinese Room Argument''' which holds that a program cannot give a computer a &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot;, regardless of how intelligently it may make it behave.{{sfn|Searle|1980}} He concludes that &quot;programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1990}} &quot;I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980}}

&lt;!-- TOPIC: Searle's targets --&gt;
The Chinese room is an argument against certain claims of leading thinkers in the field of [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;
Larry Hauser writes that the Chinese room is &quot;the most influential and widely cited argument against [[artificial intelligence]]&quot;. {{harv|Hauser|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not concerned with the level of intelligence that an AI program can display.&lt;ref&gt;See {{sectionlink|Strong AI vs. AI research}}. Searle writes that the argument &quot;assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition.&quot; {{harv|Searle|2004|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Searle's argument is directed against [[functionalism]] and [[computationalism]] (philosophical positions inspired by AI), rather than the goals of applied AI research itself.&lt;ref&gt;See {{sectionlink|Strong AI as computationalism or functionalism}}. Searle's argument is directed against {{sectionlink|Strong AI}}, a philosophical position that he now identifies with [[functionalism]]. {{harv|Searle|1994|p=44}} {{harv|Searle|2004|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument leaves aside the question of creating an artificial mind by methods other than symbol manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;See {{sectionlink|Computers vs. machines vs. brains}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversial, and the subject of an entire literature of counterargument,&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick J. Hayes|Pat Hayes]] said that the field of [[cognitive science]] ought to be redefined as &quot;the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false.&quot;{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'''s &quot;most influential target article&quot;,{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades.

==Chinese room thought experiment==
Searle's [[thought experiment]] begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that [[artificial intelligence]] research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. It takes [[Chinese character]]s as input and, by following the instructions of a [[computer program]], produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the [[Turing test]]: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that he or she is talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.

The question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine ''literally'' &quot;understand&quot; Chinese? Or is it merely ''simulating'' the ability to understand Chinese?&lt;ref name=Searle1980StrongAIQuote/&gt; Searle calls the first position &quot;[[#Strong AI|strong AI]]&quot; (see below) and the latter &quot;weak AI&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Searle writes that &quot;according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.&quot; {{Harv|Searle|2008|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient paper, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. As the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it is fair, says Searle, to deduce that he would be able to do so as well, simply by running the program manually.

Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the role the computer plays in the first case and the role he plays in the latter. Each is simply following a program, step-by-step, which simulates intelligent behavior. And yet, Searle points out, &quot;I don't speak a word of Chinese&quot;.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}} Since he does not understand Chinese, Searle argues, we must infer that the computer does not understand Chinese either.

Searle argues that without &quot;understanding&quot; (what philosophers call &quot;[[intentionality]]&quot;), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as &quot;thinking&quot;. Because it does not think, it does not have a &quot;mind&quot; in anything like the normal sense of the word, according to Searle. Therefore, he concludes, &quot;strong AI&quot; is mistaken.

==History==
Searle's argument first appeared in his paper &quot;Minds, Brains, and Programs&quot;, published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' in 1980.{{sfn|Searle|1980}} It eventually became the journal's &quot;most influential target article&quot;,{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades.

Most of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. &quot;The overwhelming majority,&quot; notes ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences|BBS]]'' editor [[Stevan Harnad]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]] edited ''BBS'' during the years which saw the introduction and popularisation of the Chinese Room argument.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong.&quot;{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired [[Patrick J. Hayes|Pat Hayes]] to quip that the field of [[cognitive science]] ought to be redefined as &quot;the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false.&quot;{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}}

The paper has become &quot;something of a classic in cognitive science,&quot; according to Harnad.{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} [[Varol Akman]] agrees, and has described Searle's paper as &quot;an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Varol Akman|Akman]]'s [http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=cogprints.org/539/0/md2.ps&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 review of ''Mind Design II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searle's targets: &quot;strong AI&quot; and computationalism==
Although the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers, philosophers have come to view it as an important part of the [[philosophy of mind]]. It is a challenge to [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and the [[computational theory of mind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harnad|2005}} holds that the Searle's argument is against the thesis that &quot;has since come to be called 'computationalism,' according to which cognition is just computation, hence mental states are just computational states&quot;. {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004}} agrees that &quot;the argument also has broad implications for functionalist and computational theories of meaning and of mind&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to such questions as the [[mind-body dichotomy|mind-body problem]],&lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Systems reply&quot; below.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[problem of other minds]],&lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Other minds reply&quot; below.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[symbol grounding|symbol-grounding]] problem, and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;The relationship between Searle's argument and consciousness is detailed in {{Harvnb|Chalmers|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong AI ===&lt;!--This section title is linked to from several places --&gt;
Searle identified a [[philosophical position]] he calls &quot;strong AI&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.&lt;ref&gt;This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was &quot;The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.&quot; {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=1}}. Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}: &quot;The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition hinges on the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''actually having'' a mind. Searle writes that &quot;according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|2008|p=1}}

The position is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder [[Herbert Simon]] declared that &quot;there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=21}}. Simon, together with [[Allen Newell]] and [[Cliff Shaw]], had just completed the first &quot;AI&quot; program, the [[Logic Theorist]].&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that they had &quot;solved the venerable [[mind-body problem]], explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of [[mind]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=46}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haugeland]] wrote that &quot;AI wants only the genuine article: ''machines with minds'', in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, ''computers ourselves''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugeland|1986|p=2}}. (Italics his)&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle also ascribes the following positions to advocates of strong AI:
* AI systems can be used to explain the mind;&lt;ref name=Searle1980StrongAIQuote&gt;&quot;Partisans of strong AI,&quot; Searle writes, &quot;claim that in this question and answer sequence the machine is not only simulating a human ability but also (1) that the machine can literally be said to ''understand'' the story and provide the answers to questions, and (2) that what the machine and its program do ''explains'' the human ability to understand the story and answer questions about it.&quot; {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The study of the brain is irrelevant to the study of the mind;&lt;ref&gt;Searle believes that &quot;strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter.&quot; {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=13}} He writes elsewhere, &quot;I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works.&quot; {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=8}} This position owes its phrasing to {{Harvtxt|Harnad|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* The [[Turing test]] is adequate for establishing the existence of mental states.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One of the points at issue,&quot; writes Searle, &quot;is the adequacy of the Turing test.&quot; {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong AI as computationalism or functionalism ===
In more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified &quot;strong AI&quot; as &quot;computer [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]&quot; (a term he attributes to [[Daniel Dennett]]).{{sfn|Searle|1994|p=44}}{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=45}} Functionalism is a position in modern [[philosophy of mind]] that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.

[[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as &quot;recognizable tenets of ''[[computationalism]]'', a position (unlike 'strong AI') that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harnad|2001|p=3}} (Italics his)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Computationalism]] is associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]]. {{Harv|Horst|2005|p=1}} {{Harvtxt|Harnad|2001}} also cites [[Allen Newell]] and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]]. {{Harvtxt|Pinker|1997}} also advocates a version of computationalism.&lt;/ref&gt; is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the [[mind]] can be accurately described as an [[information processing|information-processing]] system.

Each of the following, according to Harnad, is a &quot;tenet&quot; of computationalism:{{sfn|Harnad|2001|pp=3–5}}
* Mental states are computational states (which is why computers can have mental states and help to explain the mind);
* Computational states are [[multiple realizability|implementation-independent]] — in other words, it is the software that determines the computational state, not the hardware (which is why the brain, being hardware, is irrelevant); and that
* Since implementation is unimportant, the only empirical data that matters is how the system functions; hence the [[Turing test]] is definitive.

=== Computers vs. machines vs. brains ===
&lt;!--TOPIC: Theory of computation applied to CR--&gt;
The Chinese room has exactly the same design as any modern computer. It has a [[Von Neumann architecture]], which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a [[central processing unit|CPU]] which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in [[theoretical computer science]] as &quot;[[Turing complete]]&quot;, because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a [[Turing machine]] can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine. [[Alan Turing]] writes, &quot;all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.&quot;{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=442}} In other words, the Chinese room can do whatever any other computer can do (albeit much, much slower). The widely accepted [[Church-Turing thesis]] holds that anything computable is computable by any [[Turing complete]] machine.

&lt;!--TOPIC: Symbol manipulation--&gt;
The Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers [[Alan Newell]] and [[Herbert Simon]] called this kind of machine a [[physical symbol system]]. It is also equivalent to the [[formal system]]s used in the field of [[mathematical logic]]. Searle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is [[syntax|syntactic]] (borrowing a term from the study of [[grammar]]). The [[central processing unit|CPU]] manipulates the symbols using a form of [[syntax|syntax rule]]s, without any knowledge of the symbol's [[semantics]] (that is, their [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]).

&lt;!--TOPIC: Brains vs. machines vs. computers--&gt;
Searle's argument applies specifically to computers (that is, devices that can only manipulate symbols without knowing what they mean) and not to machines in general. Searle does not disagree that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, &quot;we are precisely such machines&quot;.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. Searle writes &quot;brains cause minds&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} and that &quot;actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains&quot;,{{sfn|Searle|1990|p=29}} a position called &quot;[[biological naturalism]]&quot; (as opposed to alternatives like [[dualism]], [[behaviorism]], [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] or [[type physicalism|identity theory]]).{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} Indeed, Searle accuses &quot;strong AI&quot; of [[dualism]], the idea that the brain and mind are made of different &quot;substances&quot;. He writes that &quot;strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}}

=== Intentionality vs. consciousness ===
{{See also|Hard problem of consciousness}}

Searle's original argument centered on 'understanding' — that is, mental states with what philosophers call '[[intentionality]]' — and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as 'consciousness'. [[David Chalmers]] argued that &quot;it is fairly clear that [[consciousness]] is at the root of the matter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chalmers|1996|p=322}}, quoted in Larry Hauser's [http://host.uniroma3.it/progetti/kant/field/chinesebiblio.html annotated bibliography].&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent presentations of the Chinese Room, Searle has included 'consciousness' as part of the argument as well.{{sfn|Searle|1994|p=44}}

===Strong AI vs. AI research===
Searle's argument does not limit the intelligence with which machines can behave or act; indeed, it does not address this issue directly. &quot;The Chinese room argument ... assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition,&quot; Searle writes.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=63}} This leaves open the possibility that a machine could be built that ''acts'' more intelligent than a person, but does not have a [[mind]] or [[intentionality]] in the same way that [[Human brain|brain]]s do.

Since the primary mission of [[artificial intelligence]] research is only to create useful systems that act intelligently, Searle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. [[Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] observe that most AI researchers &quot;don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.&quot;{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}

Searle's &quot;strong AI&quot; should not be confused with &quot;[[strong AI]]&quot; as defined by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and other futurists,&lt;ref name=&quot;K&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the ''amount'' of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this, as long as it is understood that it is a simulation and not the real thing.

==Replies==
Replies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|pp=5–6}} combines the second and third categories, as well as the fourth and fifth.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Those which identify ''who'' speaks Chinese;
* Those which demonstrate how meaningless symbols can become meaningful;
* Those which suggest that the Chinese room should be redesigned in some way;
* Those which demonstrate the ways in which Searle's argument is misleading; and
* Those which argue that the argument makes false assumptions about subjective conscious experience and therefore proves nothing.

Some of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.

===System and virtual mind replies: finding the mind===
These replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room doesn't speak Chinese, ''where'' is the &quot;mind&quot; that does? These replies address the key [[ontological]] issues of [[mind/body problem|mind vs. body]] and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of &quot;the system reply&quot;.

;System reply&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=5–6}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=6–7}}, {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=2–3}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=439}}, {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|p=44}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}. This position is held by (according to {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=6}}) [[Ned Block]], [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt;: The basic &quot;system reply&quot; argues that it is the &quot;whole system&quot; which understands Chinese. While the man understands only English, when he is combined with the program, scratch paper, pencils and file cabinets, they form a system that can understand Chinese. &quot;Here, understanding is not being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to this whole system of which he is a part&quot; Searle explains.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The fact that man does not understand Chinese is irrelevant, because it is only the system as a whole which matters.

:Searle notes that (in this simple version of the systems reply) there is nothing more than a list of physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to &quot;the conjunction of that person and bits of paper&quot;.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} Searle responds by simplifying the list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man doesn't understand Chinese then the system doesn't understand Chinese either and the fact that the man ''appears'' to understand Chinese proves nothing.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} Critics of Searle's response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head.{{who|date=March 2011}}

More sophisticated versions of the system reply try to identify more precisely what &quot;the system&quot; is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies,{{who|date=March 2011}} the &quot;mind that speaks Chinese&quot; could be such things as: the &quot;software&quot;, a &quot;program&quot;, a &quot;running program&quot;, a simulation of the &quot;neural correlates of consciousness&quot;, the &quot;functional system&quot;, a &quot;simulated mind&quot;, an &quot;[[strong emergence|emergent]] property&quot;, or &quot;a [[virtual (computing)|virtual]] mind&quot; ([[Marvin Minsky]]'s version of the system reply, described below).

;Virtual mind reply&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|pp=7–9}} ascribes this position to [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]] and David Cole. According to Cole, the reply was introduced by [[Marvin Minsky]]. {{harvtxt|Minsky|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;: The term &quot;[[virtual (computing)|virtual]]&quot; is used in computer science to describe an object which appears to exist &quot;in&quot; a computer (or computer network) only because software is making it appear to exist. The objects &quot;inside&quot; computers (including files, folders, and so on) are all &quot;virtual&quot;, except for the computer's electronic components. Similarly, [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] argues, a computer may contain a &quot;mind&quot; that is virtual in the same sense as [[virtual machine]]s, [[virtual community|virtual communities]] and [[virtual reality]].

:To clarify the distinction between the simple systems reply given above and virtual mind reply, David Cole notes that two simulations could be running on one system at the same time; one speaking Chinese and one speaking Korean. While there is only one system, there can be multiple &quot;virtual minds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Searle responds that such a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: &quot;No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=12}} Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. &quot;When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't ''really'' a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? (The issue of simulation is also discussed in the article [[synthetic intelligence]].)

These replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something ''besides'' the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that &quot;strong AI&quot; is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=21}} writes &quot;From the intuition that in the CR thought experiment he would not understand Chinese by running a program, Searle infers that there is no understanding created by running a program. Clearly, whether that inference is valid or not turns on a metaphysical question about the identity of persons and minds. If the person understanding is not identical with the room operator, then the inference is unsound.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the replies, by themselves, do not prove that strong AI is ''true'', either: they provide no evidence that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the [[hypothetical]] premise that it passes the [[Turing Test]]. As Searle writes &quot;the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that system must understand Chinese.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}

===Robot and semantics replies: finding the meaning===
As far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless &quot;squiggles.&quot; But if the Chinese room really &quot;understands&quot; what it's saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about [[intentionality]], [[symbol grounding]] and [[syntax]] vs. [[semantic]]s.

;Robot reply&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=9–11}}, {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=3}}, {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|p=44}}. {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=9}} ascribes this position to [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Stevan Harnad]], [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Georges Rey]]&lt;/ref&gt;: Suppose that instead of a room, the program was placed into a robot that could wander around and interact with its environment. This would allow a &quot;[[causality|causal]] connection&quot; between the symbols and things they represent. [[Hans Moravec]] comments: 'If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}. {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=18}} calls this the &quot;externalist&quot; account of meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Searle’s reply is to suppose that, unbeknownst to the individual in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, and some of the outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person in the room is still just following the rules, and ''does not know what the symbols mean.'' Searle writes &quot;he doesn't ''see'' what comes into the robot's eyes.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} (See [[Mary's room]] for a similar thought experiment.)

;Derived meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=19}}. This argument is supported by [[Daniel Dennett]] and others.&lt;/ref&gt;: Some respond that the room, as Searle describes it, ''is'' connected to the world: through the Chinese speakers that it is &quot;talking&quot; to and through the programmers who designed the [[knowledge base]] in his file cabinet. The symbols Searle manipulates ''are already meaningful'', they're just not meaningful to ''him''.

:Searle says that the symbols only have a &quot;derived&quot; meaning, like the meaning of words in books. The meaning of the symbols depends on the conscious understanding of the Chinese speakers and the programmers outside the room. The room, according to Searle, has no understanding of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Searle distinguishes between &quot;intrinsic&quot; intentionality and &quot;derived&quot; intentionality. &quot;Intrinsic&quot; intentionality is the kind that involves &quot;conscious understanding&quot; like you would have in a human mind. [[Daniel Dennett]] doesn't agree that there is a distinction. {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=19}} writes &quot;derived intentionality is all there is, according to Dennett.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

;Commonsense knowledge / contextualist reply&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=18}} (where he calls this the &quot;internalist&quot; approach to meaning.) Proponents of this position include [[Roger Schank]], [[Doug Lenat]], [[Marvin Minsky]] and (with reservations) [[Daniel Dennett]], who writes &quot;The fact is that any program [that passed a Turing test] would have to be an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge.&quot; {{Harv|Dennett|1997|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Some have argued that the meanings of the symbols would come from a vast &quot;background&quot; of [[commonsense knowledge]] encoded in the program and the filing cabinets. This would provide a &quot;[[contextualism|context]]&quot; that would give the symbols their meaning.

:Searle agrees that this background exists, but he does not agree that it can be built into programs. [[Hubert Dreyfus]] has also criticized the idea that the &quot;background&quot; can be represented symbolically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979}}. See &quot;the [[epistemological]] assumption&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

To each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are [[syntax|syntactic]] and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes &quot;syntax is insufficient for semantics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}. He also writes &quot;Formal symbols by themselves can never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by definition, have no meaning (or [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], or semantics) except insofar as someone outside the system gives it to them&quot; {{Harvnb|Searle|1989|p=45}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean ''to Searle'', what is important is what they mean ''to the virtual mind.'' While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that [[roboticist]]s can supply.

===Brain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room===
These arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular ''kind'' of system as being important. They try to outline what kind of a system would be able to pass the Turing test and give rise to conscious awareness in a machine. (Note that the &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;commonsense knowledge&quot; replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)

;Brain simulator reply&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=7–8}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}}, {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=3–4}}, {{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}. {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=12}} ascribes this position to [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;/ref&gt;: Suppose that the program simulated in fine detail the action of every neuron in the brain of a Chinese speaker. This strengthens the intuition that there would be no significant difference between the operation of the program and the operation of a live human brain.

:Searle replies that such a simulation will not have reproduced the important features of the brain — its causal and intentional states. [[John Searle|Searle]] is adamant that &quot;human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}}

:Two variations on the brain simulator reply are:
:;[[China brain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=4}}, {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}. Early versions of this argument were put forward in 1974 by [[Lawrence Davis]] and in 1978 by [[Ned Block]]. Block's version used walky talkies and was called the &quot;Chinese Gym&quot;. {{Harvtxt|Churchland|Churchland|1990}} described this scenario as well.&lt;/ref&gt;: What if we ask each citizen of China to simulate one neuron, using the telephone system to simulate the connections between [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s? In this version, it seems obvious that no individual would have any understanding of what the brain might be saying.

:;Brain replacement scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|pp=956–8}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=20}}, {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}, {{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}. An early version of this argument was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-70s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] in 1980. {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988}} presented a vivid version of it, and it is now associated with [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s version of [[transhumanism]].&lt;/ref&gt;: In this, we are asked to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue that there would be no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins.&lt;ref&gt; Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, &quot;you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; pleas tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' ... [Y]our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same.&quot; {{Harvnb|Searle|1992}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;(See [[Ship of Theseus]] for a similar thought experiment.)

;Connectionist replies&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|pp=12 &amp; 17}} ascribes this position to [[Andy Clark]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]]. {{Harvtxt|Hauser|2006|p=7}} associates this position with [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;/ref&gt;: Closely related to the brain simulator reply, this claims that a massively parallel connectionist architecture would be capable of understanding.

;Combination reply&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=8–9}}, {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}},&lt;/ref&gt;: This response combines the robot reply with the brain simulation reply, arguing that a brain simulation connected to the world through a robot body could have a mind.

Arguments such as these (and the robot and commonsense knowledge replies above) recommend that Searle's room be redesigned. Searle's replies all point out that, however the program is written or however it is connected to the world, it is still being ''simulated'' by a simple step by step [[Turing complete]] machine (or machines). These machines are still just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean.

Searle also argues that, if features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are ''required'', then strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Searle|1980|p=7}} writes that the robot reply &quot;tacitly concedes that cognition is not solely a matter of formal symbol manipulation.&quot; {{Harvtxt|Harnad|2001|p=14}} makes the same point, writing: &quot;Now just as it is no refutation (but rather an affirmation) of the CRA to deny that [the Turing test] is a strong enough test, or to deny that a computer could ever pass it, it is merely special pleading to try to save computationalism by stipulating ad hoc (in the face of the CRA) that implementational details do matter after all, and that the computer's is the 'right' kind of implementation, whereas Searle's is the 'wrong' kind.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Either (1) Searle's room can't pass the Turing test, because formal symbol manipulation (by a Turing complete machine) is not enough, or (2) Searle's room ''could'' pass the Turing test, but the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a &quot;mind.&quot; Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of &quot;strong AI&quot;, proving his argument.

The brain arguments also suggests that computation can't provide an ''explanation'' of the human mind (another aspect of what Searle thinks of as &quot;strong AI&quot;). They assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes &quot;I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}}

Other critics don't argue that these improvements are ''necessary'' for the Chinese room to pass the [[Turing test]] or to have a mind. They accept the premise that the room as Searle describes it does, in fact, have a mind, but they argue that it is difficult to see—Searle's description is correct, but ''misleading.'' By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section). Searle's intuition, however, is never shaken. He writes: &quot;I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}}

In fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to ''weaken'' our intuitions. [[Ned Block]]'s &quot;[[Blockhead (Computer system)|blockhead]]&quot; argument {{Harv|Block|1981}} suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple [[lookup table]] of [[production system|rules]] of the form &quot;if the user writes ''S'', reply with ''P'' and goto X&quot;. At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or &quot;[[refactored]]&quot;) into this form, even a brain simulation.&lt;ref&gt;That is, any program running on a machine with a finite amount memory.&lt;/ref&gt; In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a [[memory address]]—a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what &quot;strong AI&quot; claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (probably to the point of being impossible in practice), and the states could therefore be ''extremely'' specific.

===Speed and complexity: appeals to intuition===
The following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies.

Some of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies.

Several critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. [[Ned Block]] writes &quot;Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading &quot;[[intuition pump]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|pp=437 &amp; 440}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writes &quot;Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it.&quot;{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}

;Speed and complexity replies&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=14–15}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269–270}}, {{Harvnb|Pinker|p=95}}. {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=14}} ascribes this &quot;speed&quot; position to [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others. {{Harvtxt|Dennett|1991|p=438}} points out the complexity of world knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;: The speed at which our brains process information is (by some estimates) 100 billion operations per second.{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=269}} Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require &quot;filing cabinets&quot; of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.

An especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]. They propose this analogous thought experiment:

;Churchland's luminous room&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=12}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=270}}, {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=45–46}}, {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;Consider a dark room containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to [[James Clark Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of [[electromagnetic]] waves and will thus be luminous. But as all of us who have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!&quot;{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}} The problem is that he would have to wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.

Several of the replies above address the issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be &quot;an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge,&quot; as [[Daniel Dennett]] explains.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}

These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.

[[Stevan Harnad]] is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes &quot;Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a [[phase transition]] into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an ''[[ad hoc]]'' speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harnad|2001|p=7}}. Critics of the &quot;phase transition&quot; form of this argument include Harnad, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|p=14}}. This &quot;phase transition&quot; idea is a version of [[strong emergentism]] (what [[Daniel Dennett]] derides as &quot;Woo woo West Coast emergence&quot; {{Harv|Crevier|1993|p=275}}). Harnad accuses [[Paul Churchland|Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] of espousing strong emergentism. Ray {{Harvtxt|Kurzweil|2005}} also holds a form of strong emergentism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness===

Several replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that  human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question.  He writes that we must &quot;presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=10}} These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we can't use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not &quot;exist&quot; in the sense that Searle thinks it does.

;Other minds reply&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=9}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}, {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=4–5}}, {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1984}}. {{Harvtxt|Turing|1950|pp=11–12}} makes this reply to what he calls &quot;The Argument from Consciousness.&quot; {{Harvtxt|Cole|2004|pp=12–13}} ascribes this position to [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Hans Moravec]].&lt;/ref&gt;: This reply points out that Searle's argument is a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. There is no way we can determine if other people's subjective experience is the same as our own. We can only study their behavior (i.e., by giving them our own [[Turing test]]). Critics of Searle argue that he is holding the Chinese room to a higher standard than we would hold an ordinary person.

:[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes &quot;If a program behaves ''as if''  it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying.  For all I know, Searle may only be behaving ''as if''  he were thinking deeply about these matters.  But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I’m willing to credit him with real thought.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nilsson|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Alan Turing]] (writing 30 years before Searle presented his argument) noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that &quot;instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turing test]] simply extends this &quot;polite convention&quot; to machines. He doesn't intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he doesn't think we need to.&lt;ref&gt;One of Turing's motivations for devising the [[Turing test]] is to avoid precisely the kind of philosophical problems that Searle is interested in. He writes &quot;I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery ... [but] I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.&quot; {{Harv|Turing|1950|p=12}} Although Turing is discussing consciousness (not the mind or understanding or intentionality), {{Harvtxt|Norvig|Russell|2003|pp=952–953}} argue that Turing's comments apply the Chinese room.&lt;/ref&gt;

;'''Epiphenomenon / zombie reply''': Several philosophers{{who|date=February 2011}} argue that consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist. This position is sometimes referred to as [[eliminative materialism]]: the view that consciousness is a property that can be reduced to a strictly mechanical description, and that our experience of consciousness is, as Daniel Dennett describes it a &quot;[[user illusion]]&quot;.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|loc={{page needed|date=February 2011}}}}

:{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}} argue that, if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is  [[epiphenomenal]]: that it &quot;casts no shadow&quot;, that is undetectable in the outside world. Searle believes that there are &quot;causal properties&quot; in our neurons that give rise to the mind. However, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the [[Turing test]]—the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. Therefor, Russell and Norvig argue, Searle is mistaken about the &quot;knowability of the mental&quot;. 

[[Daniel Dennett]] provides this extension to the &quot;epiphenomena&quot; argument. 
;Dennett's reply from natural selection&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=22}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=271}}, {{Harvnb|Harnad|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle's &quot;causal properties&quot; but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a &quot;[[philosophical zombie|zombie]]&quot; in thought experiments in the [[philosophy of mind]]). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it's most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually &quot;zombies,&quot; who nevertheless insist they are conscious. This suggests it's unlikely that Searle's &quot;causal properties&quot; would have ever evolved in the first place. Nature has no incentive to create them.

Searle disagrees with this analysis and argues that &quot;the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers.&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.

==Formal arguments==
Searle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}, {{Harvnb|Searle|1990}}. The wording of each axiom and conclusion if from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1990}}. This version is based on {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=5}}. (A1-3) and (C1) are described as 1,2,3 and 4 in {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of the argument which should be controversial is A3 and it is this point which the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.&lt;ref name=CC1990&gt;{{Harvtxt|Churchland|Churchland|1990|p=34}} explain that the Chinese Room argument is intended to &quot;shore up axiom 3&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

He begins with three axioms:
:(A1) &quot;Programs are formal ([[syntax|syntactic]]).&quot;
::A program uses [[syntax]] to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the [[semantics]] of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it doesn't know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.

:(A2) &quot;Minds have mental contents ([[semantics]]).&quot;
::Unlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.

:(A3) &quot;Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics.&quot;
::This is what the Chinese room argument is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.

Searle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:

:(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.
::This should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don't have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore programs are not minds.

This much of the argument is intended to show that [[artificial intelligence]] will never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the [[computational theory of mind]] correct?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harnad|2001}} argues that Searle's primary target is [[computationalism]].&lt;/ref&gt; He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:

:(A4) Brains cause minds.

Searle claims that we can derive &quot;immediately&quot; and &quot;trivially&quot;{{sfn|Searle|1990}} that:

:(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.
::Brains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it &quot;causal powers&quot;. &quot;Causal powers&quot; is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot;. &quot;Equivalent causal powers&quot; is whatever ''else'' that could be used to make a mind.

And from this he derives the further conclusions:

:(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.
::This follows from C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot; produce minds, it follows that programs do not have &quot;equivalent causal powers.&quot;

:(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.
::Since programs do not have &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot;, &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot; produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.

[[Image:CIRCLE 1.svg|thumb|Circle illustration showing a radius, a diameter, the centre and the circumference]]

[[Image:Tycho crater on the Moon.jpg|thumb|[[Tycho (crater)|Tycho crater]], one of many examples of circles that arise in nature.]]

A '''circle''' is a simple [[shape]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] consisting of the set of [[point (geometry)|points]] in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] that are a given distance from a given point, the &lt;!-- This article is written using British English - see WP:ENGVAR, Wikipedia articles should remain with the original variant 'center' is the American English spelling  --&gt;[[Centre (geometry)|centre]]&lt;!-- see comment before about 'center' --&gt;. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the [[radius]].

Circles are  simple closed [[curve]]s which divide the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] into two regions: an [[interior (topology)|interior]] and an exterior. In everyday use, the term &quot;circle&quot; may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is the former and the latter is called a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]. 

A circle is a special [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] are coincident and the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] is 0. Circles are [[conic section]]s attained when a [[conical surface|right circular cone]] is intersected by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone.
__TOC__&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;!-- To avoid layout breaking when TOC is hidden --&gt;

==Terminology==
A circle's [[diameter]] is the length of a line segment whose [[endpoint]]s lie on the circle and which passes through the centre. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. The diameter of a circle is twice the [[radius]], or distance from the centre to the circle's boundary. The terms &quot;diameter&quot; and &quot;radius&quot; also refer to the line segments which fit these descriptions. The [[circumference]] is the distance around the outside of a circle.

A [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle. A diameter is the longest chord in a circle. A [[tangent]] to a circle is a straight line that touches the circle at a single point, while a [[Secant line|secant]] is an extended chord: a straight line cutting the circle at two points.

An [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] of a circle is any [[Connected space|connected]] part of the circle's circumference. A [[Circular sector|sector]] is a region bounded by two radii and an arc lying between the radii, and a [[Circular segment|segment]] is a region bounded by a chord and an arc lying between the chord's endpoints.

==History==
The word &quot;circle&quot; derives from the Greek, ''kirkos'' &quot;a circle,&quot; from the base ''ker-'' which means to turn or bend.  The origins of the words &quot;[[circus]]&quot; and &quot;[[circuit]]&quot; are closely related.

The circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history.  Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the [[wheel]], which, with related inventions such as [[gear]]s, makes much of modern civilization possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, [[astronomy]], and calculus.

Early [[science]], particularly [[geometry]] and [[astrology and astronomy]], was connected to the divine for most [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval scholars]], and many believed that there was something intrinsically &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; that could be found in circles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Some highlights in the history of the circle are:
* 1700 BC – The [[Rhind papyrus]] gives a method to find the area of a circular field. The result corresponds to 256/81 (3.16049...) as an approximate value of {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Chronology/30000BC_500BC.html#1700BC Chronology for 30000 BC to 500 BC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 300 BC – Book 3 of [[Euclid's Elements]] deals with the properties of circles.
* In [[Plato]]'s [[Seventh Letter]] there is a detailed definition and explanation of the circle. Plato explains the perfect circle, and how it is different from any drawing, words, definition or explanation.
* 1880 – [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proves that {{pi}} is transcendental, effectively settling the millennia-old problem of [[squaring the circle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Squaring_the_circle.html Squaring the circle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;

==Analytic results==
===Length of circumference===
{{see|Pi}}

The ratio of a circle's [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]] is [[Pi|{{pi}}]] (pi), an [[Irrational number|irrational]] [[mathematical constant|constant]] approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the length of the circumference {{math|''C''}} is related to the radius {{math|''r''}} and diameter {{math|''d''}} by: 

:&lt;math&gt;C = 2\pi r = \pi d\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Area enclosed===
[[Image:Circle Area.svg|thumb|Area of the circle = {{pi}} × area of the shaded square]]

{{Main|Area of a disk}}

As proved by Archimedes, the [[Area of a disk|area enclosed by a circle]] is {{pi}} multiplied by the radius squared:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \mathrm{Area} = \pi r^2.\, &lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, denoting diameter by {{math|''d''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Area} = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \approx 0{.}7854d^2, &lt;/math&gt;

that is, approximately 79 percent of the [[Circumscribe|circumscribing]] square (whose side is of length {{math|''d''}}). These results can be obtained in several ways, including via [[integration (mathematics)|integration]] and by considering the circle as a [[regular polygon]] with an infinite number of sides. 

The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length.  This relates the circle to a problem in the [[calculus of variations]], namely the [[isoperimetric inequality]].

===Equations===
====Cartesian coordinates====
[[Image:Circle center a b radius r.svg|thumb|right|Circle of radius {{math|''r''}} = 1, centre ({{math|a}}, {{math|b}}) = (1.2, -0.5)]]
In an {{math|''x''}}-{{math|''y''}} [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the circle with centre [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] ({{math|a}}, {{math|b}}) and radius {{math|''r''}} is the set of all points ({{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}) such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(x - a \right)^2 + \left( y - b \right)^2=r^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

This [[equation]] of the circle follows from the [[Pythagorean theorem]] applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the diagram to the right, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length {{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{math|a}} and {{math|''y''}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{math|b}}. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = r^2. \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

The equation can be written in [[parametric equations|parametric form]] using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as

:&lt;math&gt;x = a+r\,\cos t,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = b+r\,\sin t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]], interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from the origin to ({{math|''x''}},&amp;nbsp;{{math|''y''}}) makes with the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Alternatively, a rational parametrization of the circle is:

:&lt;math&gt; x = a + r \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y = b + r \frac{2t}{1+t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this parametrization, the ratio of {{math|t}} to {{math|''r''}} can be interpreted geometrically as the [[stereographic projection]] of the circle onto the line passing through the centre parallel to the {{math|''x''}}-axis.

In [[homogeneous coordinates]] each [[conic section]] with equation of a circle is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\ ax^2+ay^2+2b_1xz+2b_2yz+cz^2 = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proven that a conic section is a circle if and only if the point I(1: i: 0) and J(1: −i: 0) lie on the conic section. These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].

====Polar coordinates====
In [[polar coordinates]] the equation of a circle is:

:&lt;math&gt;
r^2 - 2 r r_0 \cos(\theta - \phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|a}} is the radius of the circle, {{math|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and φ is the anticlockwise angle from the positive {{math|''x''}}-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle. For a circle centred at the origin, i.e. {{math|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, this reduces to simply {{math|''r''}} = {{math|a}}. When {{math|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{math|a}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;r = 2 a\cos(\theta - \phi)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the general case, the equation can be solved for {{math|''r''}}, giving
:&lt;math&gt;r = r_0 \cos(\theta - \phi) + \sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \sin^2(\theta - \phi)}&lt;/math&gt;,
the solution with a minus sign in front of the square root giving the same curve.

====Complex plane====
In the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at {{math|c}} and radius ({{math|''r''}}) has the equation &lt;math&gt;|z-c|^2 = r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;. In parametric form this can be written &lt;math&gt;z = re^{it}+c&lt;/math&gt;.

The slightly generalised equation &lt;math&gt;pz\overline{z} + gz + \overline{gz} = q&lt;/math&gt; for real ''{{math|p}}'', ''{{math|q}}'' and complex ''{{math|g}}'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]]. This becomes the above equation for a circle with &lt;math&gt;p = 1,\ g=-\overline{c},\ q=r^2-|c|^2&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;|z-c|^2 = z\overline{z}-\overline{c}z-c\overline{z}+c\overline{c}&lt;/math&gt;. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].

===Tangent lines===
{{Main|Tangent lines to circles}}

The [[tangent line]] through a point {{math|P}} on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through {{math|P}}. If {{math|P}} = ({{math|''x''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{math|''y''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and the circle has centre ({{math|a}}, {{math|b}}) and radius {{math|''r''}}, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from ({{math|a}}, {{math|b}}) to ({{math|''x''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,{{math|''y''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), so it has the form ({{math|''x''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−{{math|a}}){{math|''x''}}+({{math|''y''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−{{math|b}}){{math|''y''}} = {{math|c}}. Evaluating at ({{math|''x''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{math|''y''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) determines the value of {{math|c}} and the result is that the equation of the tangent is
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''{{math|''y''}}''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠{{math|b}} then slope of this line is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}&lt;/math&gt;.
This can also be found using [[implicit differentiation]].

When the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes
:&lt;math&gt;x_1x+y_1y = r^2&lt;/math&gt;,
and its slope is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x_1}{y_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

*The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)
*The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] {{math|O}}(2,'''{{math|R}}'''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''{{math|T}}'''.
*All circles are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].
**A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].
**The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].
***The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2{{pi}} and {{pi}}, respectively.
*The circle which is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].
**Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].
*Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].

===Chord===
* Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.
* The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector:
** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.
** The [[line segment]] ([[circular segment]]) through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplemental.
** For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.
* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [[Thales' theorem]]).
* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.
* If the intersection of any two chords divides one chord into lengths {{math|a}} and {{math|b}} and divides the other chord into lengths {{math|c}} and {{math|''d''}}, then {{math|ab}} = {{math|cd}}.
* If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths {{math|a}} and {{math|b}} and divides the other chord into lengths {{math|c}} and {{math|''d''}},  then &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2&lt;/math&gt; equals the square of the diameter.
* The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Roger A., ''Advanced Euclidean Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.71}}

===Sagitta===
[[Image:circle sagitta.jpg|thumb|right|The sagitta is the vertical segment.]]
*  The sagitta (also known as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.
*  Given the length {{math|''y''}} of a chord, and the length {{math|''x''}} of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the two lines:

:: &lt;math&gt;r=\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \frac{x}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows.  Given a chord of length {{math|''y''}} and with sagitta of length {{math|''x''}}, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle.  Since the diameter is twice the radius, the “missing” part of the diameter is (2{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (2{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}){{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;({{math|''y''}}/2)². Solving for {{math|''r''}}, we find the required result.

===Tangent===
*The line perpendicular drawn to a radius through the end point of the radius is a tangent to the circle.
*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.
*Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.
*If a tangent at ''A'' and a tangent at ''B'' intersect at the exterior point {{math|P}}, then denoting the centre as {{math|O}}, the angles ∠{{math|BOA}} and ∠{{math|BPA}} are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]].
*If {{math|AD}} is tangent to the circle at {{math|A}} and if {{math|AQ}} is a chord of the circle, then ∠{{math|DAQ}} = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;arc({{math|AQ}}).

===Theorems===
[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|right|Secant-secant theorem]]
{{See also|Power of a point}}
*The chord theorem states that if two chords, {{math|CD}} and {{math|EB}}, intersect at {{math|A}}, then {{math|CA}}×{{math|DA}} = {{math|EA}}×{{math|BA}}.
*If a [[tangent]] from an external point {{math|D}} meets the circle at {{math|C}} and a [[Secant line|secant]] from the external point {{math|D}} meets the circle at {{math|G}} and {{math|E}} respectively, then {{math|DC}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{math|DG}}×{{math|DE}}. (Tangent-secant theorem.)
*If two secants, {{math|DG}} and {{math|DE}}, also cut the circle at {{math|H}} and {{math|F}} respectively, then {{math|DH}}×{{math|DG}} = {{math|DF}}×{{math|DE}}. (Corollary of the tangent-secant theorem.)
*The angle between a tangent and chord is equal to one half the subtended angle on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).
*If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then {{math|l}} = √2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}, where {{math|l}} is the length of the chord and {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the circle.
*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle {{math|A}} is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs ({{math|DE}} and {{math|BC}}). This is the secant-secant theorem.

===Inscribed angles===
{{See also|Inscribed angle theorem}}

[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]

An [[inscribed angle]] (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [[central angle]] (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).

==Circle of Apollonius==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sphere]] among others --&gt;

[[Image:Apollonius circle definition labels.svg|thumb|left|Apollonius' definition of a circle:{{math|''d''}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/{{math|''d''}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; constant]]

[[Apollonius of Perga]] showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant ''ratio'' (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, {{math|A}} and {{math|B}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harkness, James|title=Introduction to the theory of analytic functions|location=London, New York|publisher=Macmillan and Co.| year= 1898 |pages= 30|url=http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=01680002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogilvy, C. Stanley, ''Excursions in Geometry'', Dover, 1969, 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt; (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of {{math|A}} and {{math|B}}, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points.

The proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci {{math|A}} and {{math|B}} and a ratio of distances, any point {{math|P}} satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let {{math|C}} be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment {{math|AB}}. By the [[angle bisector theorem]] the line segment {{math|PC}} will bisect the [[interior angle]] {{math|APB}}, since the segments are similar:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{AP}{BP} = \frac{AC}{BC}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, a line segment {{math|PD}} through some point {{math|D}} on {{math|AB}} extended bisects the corresponding [[exterior angle]] {{math|BPQ}} where {{math|Q}} is on {{math|AP}} extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a [[right angle]]. The set of points {{math|P}} such that angle {{math|CPD}} is a right angle forms a circle, of which {{math|CD}} is a diameter.

Second, see&lt;ref&gt;Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.15}} for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.

===Cross-ratios===
A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]]. If {{math|A}}, {{math|B}}, and {{math|C}} are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points {{math|P}} for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:
:&lt;math&gt;|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\ &lt;/math&gt;
Stated another way, {{math|P}} is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [{{math|A}},{{math|B}};{{math|C}},{{math|P}}] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.

===Generalized circles===
{{See also|Generalized circle}}
If {{math|C}} is the [[midpoint]] of the segment {{math|AB}}, then the collection of points {{math|P}} satisfying the Apollonius condition

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \frac{|AC|}{|BC|}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1)

is not a circle, but rather a line.

Thus, if {{math|A}}, {{math|B}}, and {{math|C}} are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points {{math|P}} satisfying (1) is called a '''generalized circle'''.  It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is a generalized circle of infinite radius.

==Circles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures==

In every [[triangle]] a unique circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], can be inscribed such that it is [[tangent]] to each of the three sides of the triangle.

About every triangle a unique circle, called the [[circumcircle]], can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]].

A tangential polygon, such as a [[tangential quadrilateral]], is any [[convex polygon]] within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon.

A [[cyclic polygon]] is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the [[cyclic quadrilateral]].

A [[hypocycloid]] is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.

==Circle as limiting case of other figures==

The circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:

*A [[Cartesian oval]] is a set of points such that a [[weighted sum]] of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points ([[Focus (geometry)|foci]]) is a constant. An [[ellipse]] is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.

*A [[superellipse]] has an equation of the form  &lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{x}{a}\right|^n\! + \left|\frac{y}{b}\right|^n\! = 1&lt;/math&gt; for positive {{math|a}}, {{math|b}}, and {{math|n}}. A supercircle has {{math|b}}={{math|a}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which {{math|n}}=2.

*A [[Cassini oval]] is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.

*A [[curve of constant width]] is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:CardinalCoA PioM.svg|thumb|right|180px|The coat of arms of a cardinal is indicated by a red [[galero]] (wide-brimmed hat) with 15 tassels on each side (the [[motto]] and [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] are proper to the individual cardinal).]]
A '''cardinal''' is a senior [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] official, usually an ordained [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], and [[ecclesiastical]] [[prince]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. They are collectively known as the [[College of Cardinals]], which as a body elects a new [[pope]]. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or collectively to the pope if he requests their counsel. Most cardinals have additional duties, such as leading a [[diocese]] or [[archdiocese]] or running a [[Dicastery|department]] of the [[Roman Curia]].

A cardinal's other main function is [[papal election|electing the pope]] whenever, by death or resignation, the seat becomes vacant. In 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven [[suburbicarian see]]s. During the ''[[sede vacante]]'', the period between a pope's death and the election of his successor, the day-to-day governance of the Church as a whole is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] of cardinals who elect the pope is now limited to those who are not over 80 years old on the day of the pope's death or resignation.

The term &quot;cardinal&quot; at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or [[incardinated]] to a church,&lt;ref name=&quot;CE-cardinal&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy | wstitle=Cardinal (1) | title=Cardinal | last=Sägmüller | first=Johannes Baptist}}&lt;/ref&gt; or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin ''cardo'' (hinge), meaning &quot;principal&quot; or &quot;chief&quot;. The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the ''tituli'' (parishes) of the [[diocese of Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CE-cardinal&quot; /&gt; In the twelfth century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them being assigned a church in Rome as his [[titular church]], or being linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.

==History==
{{Further|[[Papal selection before 1059]]}}
[[Image:Cardinal Richelieu (Champaigne).jpg|thumb|right|155 px|[[Cardinal Richelieu]], chief minister of [[France]].]]
The election of the pope was not always reserved to the cardinals; the pope was originally elected by the clergy and the people of the [[diocese of Rome]]. In [[medieval]] times, Roman nobility gained influence. The Holy Roman Emperors had a hand in choosing the pontiff. But as the pope gained greater political independence, the right of election was with the bull ''[[In nomine Domini]]'' reserved to cardinals in 1059, leaving the emperor only with a vague right of approbation.

However the influence of temporal rulers, notably the French kings, largely reemerged via cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements; there even developed traditions entitling certain monarchs — e.g. of Austria, Spain, and Portugal — to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called [[crown-cardinal]].

In theory, the pope could substitute another body of electors for the College of Cardinals. Some proposed that the [[Synod of Bishops]] should perform this function, a proposal that was not accepted, because, among other reasons, the Synod of Bishops can only meet when called by the pope.

In [[Early Modern period|early modern]] times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. An example of this was found in [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s England where his chief minister was [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]. An even more prominent example is that of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], whose power was so great that he was for many years the real ruler of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rXSqwPFMn3oC Henry Kitchell Webster, Hutton Webster, Early European History], p. 604&lt;/ref&gt; Richelieu was so successful that his successor, [[Cardinal Mazarin|Jules Mazarin]], was also a cardinal. [[Guillaume Dubois]] and [[André-Hercule de Fleury]] complete the list of the &quot;four great&quot; cardinals to have ruled [[France]].

As of 2011, the youngest cardinal is [[Reinhard Marx]] (elevated 2010) - the [[Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. The oldest living cardinal, following the death of [[Paul Augustin Mayer|Cardinal Mayer]] in 2010, is [[Ersilio Tonini]], the Archbishop [[Emeritus]] of Ravenna-Cervia.

==College and orders of cardinalate==
[[Pope Sixtus V]] limited the number of cardinals to 70, composed of six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons; however, [[Pope John XXIII]] began to exceed the overall limit of 70, and this continued under his successors. At the start of 1971, [[Pope Paul VI]] set an age limit of eighty years for electors, who were to number no more than 120, but set no limit to the number of cardinals as a whole, including those over eighty. (As a result of the setting of the age limit at the start of 1971, twenty-five living cardinals lost the right to participate in a conclave.) Since Popes can [[dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispense]] from church laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newcesite.com/2008/02/08/81136/ Are There Any Limitations on the Power of the Pope?]&lt;/ref&gt; they have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120, perhaps calculating that the number would be sufficiently reduced by the time the need for a conclave would arise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/May2005/Wiseman.asp#F1 Electing a New Pope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://papam.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/november-20-2010-cardinal-creating-conistory-college-at-203-121-electors-82-non-electors/ College at 203, 121 Electors &amp; 82 Non-Electors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There would also have been 121 under-80 cardinals after Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 consistory, if Cardinal [[Stephen Fumio Hamao]] had not died between the announcement of the consistory and the date on which it was held.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in fact, since the 120 limit was enacted, no conclave has been held with even a full 120 entitled to participate. Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] who are made cardinals.

==Titular church==
[[Image:Theodor Kardinal Innitzer -001-.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Theodor Innitzer|Cardinal Innitzer]], cardinal priest of [[San Crisogono]]]]
Each cardinal takes on a [[titular church]], either a church in the city of Rome or one of the [[Suburbicarian diocese|suburbicarian see]]s. The only exception is for patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches. The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] in addition to such a titular church also receives the [[Bishop of Ostia|titular bishopric of Ostia]], the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a [[particular Church]] retain that church.

== Title and reference style ==

Since 1630, cardinals have taken the [[style (address)|style]] ''[[His Eminence|Eminence]]''. In accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title &quot;Cardinal&quot; (abbreviated ''Card.'') after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, &quot;John Card(inal) Doe&quot; or, in [[Latin]], &quot;Ioannes Card(inalis) Cognomen&quot;. Similarly, the official signature of popes inserts the Latin title ''Papa'' (abbreviated ''Pp.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01022a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia:''Ecclesiastical Abbreviations'']&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after the personal name, as &quot;Benedictus Pp. XVI&quot; for Pope Benedict  XVI. Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan,&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them, even in English; and this is the usual but not the only way of referring to cardinals in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;An Internet search will uncover some hundreds of examples of &quot;Cardinalis Ioannes &lt;surname&gt;&quot;, examples modern and centuries-old (such as [http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenahist/hsj/t2/HSJ_2_2.html this from 1620)], and the phrase &quot;dominus cardinalis Petrus Caputius&quot; is found in a [http://regesten.regesta-imperii.de/anzeige.php?pk=&amp;bandanzeige=&amp;
