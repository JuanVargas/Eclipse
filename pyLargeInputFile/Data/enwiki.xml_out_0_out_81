extremely high and acute [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s that had little function other than piercing. The [[dentition]] of ''Cimolestes'' foreshadows the same cutting structures seen in all later carnivores. While the earlier smaller species were [[insectivores]], the later marmot-sized ''[[Cimolestes magnus]]'' probably took larger prey and were definitely a carnivore to some degree. The cheek teeth of ''[[Hyracolestes ermineus]]'' (an [[ermine]]-like [[shrew]] - 40g) and ''[[Sarcodon pygmaeus]]'' (&quot;pygmy flesh tooth&quot; - 75g), were common in the latest [[Paleocene]] of Mongolia and China and occupied the small predator niche. The cheek teeth show the same characteristic notches that serve in today's carnivores to hold flesh in place to shear apart with cutting ridges.

The [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' that existed during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]] were &quot;obligate carnivores&quot;.

The '''Celts''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɛ|l|t|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|t|s}}, see [[Pronunciation of Celtic|pronunciation of ''Celtic'']]) were a diverse group of [[tribal societies]] in [[Iron Age]] and [[Roman era|Roman-era]] [[Europe]] who spoke [[Celtic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Koch | first = John | authorlink = | coauthors = |title = Celtic Culture : A Historical Encyclopedia | publisher = ABL-CIO | year = 2005 | location =| pages = xx | url = http://books.google.com/?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=peoples%20and%20countries | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1851094400 | accessdate = June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest archaeological culture commonly accepted as Celtic, or rather [[Proto-Celtic]], was the [[central Europe]]an [[Hallstatt culture]] (c. 800-450 BC), named for the rich grave finds in [[Hallstatt]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe, Barry. ''The Ancient Celts'', pp. 39-67. Penguin Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; By the later [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest), this Celtic culture had expanded over a wide range of regions, whether by [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] or [[human migration|migration]]: to the [[British Isles]] ([[Insular Celts]]), the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Celtiberians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Gallaeci]]), much of [[Central Europe]], ([[Gauls]]) and following the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans]] in 279 BC as far east as  central [[Anatolia]] ([[Galatia]]ns).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-209125/Turkey Britannica] (Turkey) People and Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest directly attested examples of a Celtic language are the [[Lepontic language|Lepontic]] inscriptions, beginning from the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name=Stifter&gt;{{cite book|last=Stifter|first=David|title=Old Celtic Languages|year=2008|pages=24–37|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/indogermanistik/download/Stifter/oldcelt2008_2_lepontic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continental Celtic languages]] are attested only in inscriptions and place-names. [[Insular Celtic]] is attested from about the 4th century AD in [[ogham inscription]]s, although it is clearly much earlier. Literary tradition begins with [[Old Irish]] from about the 8th century. Coherent texts of [[Early Irish literature]], such as the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' (''The Cattle Raid of Cooley''), survive in 12th-century recensions. According to the theory of [[John T. Koch]] and others, the [[Tartessian language]] may have been the earliest directly attested Celtic language with the Tartessian written script used in the inscriptions based on a version of a [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] script in use around 825 BC.&lt;ref name=Koch2009&gt;{{cite book | last = Koch | first = John | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 (2009)| publisher = Palaeohispanica | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 339–351 | url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf | doi = | id = | issn = 1578-5386 | accessdate = 2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid 1st millennium AD, following the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Migration Period|Great Migration]]s ([[Migration Period]]) of [[Germanic peoples]], Celtic culture and [[Insular Celtic]] had become restricted to [[Ireland]] and to the western and northern parts of [[Great Britain]] ([[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Cornwall]] and the [[Isle of Man]]) and northern [[France]] ([[Brittany]]). Between the fifth and eighth centuries AD the Celtic-speaking communities of the Atlantic regions had emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. In language, religion, and art they shared a common heritage that distinguished them from the culture of surrounding polities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=The Celts - A Very Short Introduction|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280418-9|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Continental Celtic languages]] ceased to be widely used by the 6th century.

Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the [[Gaels]] ([[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Manx people|Manx]]), the [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] Celts ([[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Cornish people|Cornish]], and [[Bretons]]) of the medieval and modern periods. A modern &quot;[[Celtic identity]]&quot; was constructed in the context of the Romanticist [[Celtic Revival]] in Great Britain, Ireland, and other European territories, such as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKevitt|first=Kerry Ann|title=Mythologizing Identity and History: A Look at the Celtic Past of Galicia|journal=e-Keltoi|date=2006|year=2006|month=1|volume=6|pages=651-673|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_13/mckevitt_6_13.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a revival of [[Breton language|Breton]] is taking place in [[Brittany]].

Latin &quot;Gallus&quot; might originally be from a Celtic ethnic or [[tribal name]], perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansions into Italy of the early 5th century BC. Its root may be the [[Proto-Celtic|Common Celtic]] &quot;*galno&quot;, meaning power or strength. ''Galli'', ''[[Gallaeci]]'' and ''Galatae'' most probably go with Old Irish ''gal'' 'boldness, ferocity' and Welsh ''gallu'' 'to be able, power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=John Thomas|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-440-7|pages=794–795}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek &quot;Galatai&quot; seems to be based on the same root, borrowed directly from the same hypothetical Celtic source which gave us &quot;Galli&quot; (the suffix &quot;-atai&quot; is an Ancient Greek inflection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spencer and Zwicky|first=Andrew and Arnold M|title=The handbook of morphology|year=1998|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|isbn=0-631-18544-5|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(see [[Galatia]] in Anatolia)''

The English word &quot;Celt&quot; is modern, attested from 1707 in the writings of [[Edward Lhuyd]] whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of these early inhabitants of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;(Lhuyd, p. 290) Lhuyd, E.

In Old French, the words &quot;gualeis&quot;, &quot;galois&quot;, &quot;walois&quot; (NF phonetics keeping /w/) had different meanings : Welsh or the [[Langue d'oïl]], etc. On the other hand, the word &quot;Waulle&quot; (NF phonetics keeping /w/) is recorded for the first time in the 13th century to translate the Latin word &quot;Gallia&quot; and then, &quot;gaulois&quot; is recorded for the first time in the 15th century and the scholars use it to translate the Latin words &quot;Gallus&quot; / &quot;Gallicus&quot;.

&quot;Celtic&quot; is a descriptor of a [[Language family|family of languages]] and, more generally, means &quot;of the Celts&quot;, or &quot;in the style of the Celts&quot;. It has also been used to refer to several archaeological cultures defined by unique sets of artifacts. The link between language and artifact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruta et al|first=Venceslas et al|title=The Celts|year=1991|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=95–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(see [[Celtic (disambiguation)]] for other applications of the term)''

Today, the term Celtic is generally used to describe the languages and respective cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, [[Cornwall]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Brittany]], also known as the [[Celtic nations|Six Celtic Nations]]. These are the regions where four Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent as mother tongues: [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and [[Breton language|Breton]] plus two recent revivals, [[Cornish language|Cornish]] (one of the [[Brythonic languages]]) and [[Manx language|Manx]] (one of the [[Goidelic languages]]). There are also attempts to reconstruct the [[Cumbric language]] (a Brythonic language from [[North West England|Northwest England]] and Southwest Scotland). 'Celtic' is also sometimes used to describe regions of [[Continental Europe]] that claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language has survived; these areas include the western [[Iberian Peninsula]], i.e. Portugal, and   north-central Spain ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|year=2008|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=9780816075560}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(see [[Modern Celts]])''

&quot;Continental Celts&quot; refers to the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe. &quot;Insular Celts&quot; refers to the different Celtic-speaking peoples of the British and Irish islands and to their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating insular Celts mainly from Wales and [[Cornwall]] and so are grouped accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Nora|title=The Celts with an introductory chapter by J.X.W.P.Corcoran|year=1970.|publisher=Penguin Books|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Celtic languages]] form a branch of the larger [[Indo-European family]].  By the time speakers of Celtic languages enter history around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of Western continental Europe, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Ireland and Britain.

Some scholars think that the [[Urnfield|Urnfield culture]] of Western [[Middle Europe]] represents an origin for the Celts as a distinct cultural branch of the Indo-European family. This culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late [[Bronze Age]], from [[circa|ca.]] 1200 BC until 700 BC, itself following the [[Unetice culture|Unetice]] and [[Tumulus cultures]]. The Urnfield period saw a dramatic increase in population in the region, probably due to innovations in technology and [[Agriculture|agricultural practices]]. The Greek historian [[Ephorus|Ephoros]] of Cyme in [[Asia Minor]], writing in the 4th century BC, believed that the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the [[Rhine]] and were &quot;driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea&quot;.

The spread of [[Iron Age|iron-working]] led to the development of the [[Hallstatt culture]] directly from the Urnfield ([[circa|ca.]] 700 to 500 BC). [[Proto-Celtic]], the latest [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of all known Celtic languages, is considered by this school of thought to have been spoken at the time of the late Urnfield or early Hallstatt cultures, in the early 1st millennium BC.  The spread of the Celtic languages to Iberia, Ireland and Britain would have occurred during the first half of the 1st millennium BC, the earliest [[chariot burial]]s in Britain dating to c. 500 BC. Over the centuries they developed into the separate [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]], Goidelic and [[Brythonic languages]].

The Hallstatt culture was succeeded by the [[La Tène]] culture of central Europe, and during the final stages of the [[Iron Age]] gradually transformed into the explicitly Celtic culture of early historical times. Celtic river-names are found in great numbers around the upper reaches of [[Danube|the Danube]] and Rhine, which led many Celtic scholars to place the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Celts in this area.

[[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Strabo]] both suggest that the Celtic heartland was in [[southern France]]. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls. Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tene, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern France, see [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] for 1813.

===Linguistic evidence===
{{Main|Proto-Celtic language}}
{{See|Celtic toponymy}}
The [[Proto-Celtic language]] is usually dated to the early [[European Iron Age]]. The earliest records of a Celtic language are the [[Lepontic]] inscriptions of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], the oldest of which still predate the  [[La Tène period]]. Other early inscriptions are [[Gaulish]], appearing from the early La Tène period in inscriptions in the area of [[Massilia]], in the [[Greek alphabet]]. [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] inscriptions appear comparatively late, after about 200 BC. Evidence of [[Insular Celtic]] is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of [[Primitive Irish]] [[Ogham inscriptions]].
Besides epigraphical evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is [[toponymy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Patrick Sims-Williams, ''Ancient Celtic Placenames in Europe and Asia Minor'', Publications of the [[Philological Society]], No. 39 (2006);
Bethany Fox, ''[http://www.alarichall.org.uk/placenames/fox.htm The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland]''

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological evidence===
{{See|Iron Age Europe}}
[[Image:Hallstatt culture.png|thumb|300px|left|Map of the Hallstatt Culture]]
Before the 19th century, scholars assumed that the original land of the Celts was west of the Rhine, more precisely in Gaul, because it was where Greek and Roman ancient sources,  namely  Cesar, located  the Celts.  This view was challenged by Jubainville who placed the land of origin of the Celts east of the Rhine. Jubainville based his arguments on a phrase of Herodotus´ that placed the Celts at the source of the Danube, and argued that Herodotus had meant to place the Celtic homeland in southern Germany.
The finding of the prehistoric cemetery of Hallstat in 1846 by Johan Ramsauer and almost ten years later the finding of the archaeological site of La Tène by Hansli Kopp in 1857 draw attention to this area.
The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tene cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as “Culture Groups”, entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, started to grow  by  the end of the 19th century.  In the beginning of the 20th century  the belief that those “Culture Groups” could be thought in racial or ethnic terms was strongly held by [[Gordon Childe]] whose theory was  influenced by the writings of [[Gustaf Kossinna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EZ7Gj2ocIEsC&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=%22Gordon+Childe%22+la+tene&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FJlPTI7SHNiJ4gbyjYTWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=pg346 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the  20th century the racial ethnic interpretation of La Tene culture rooted much stronger, and any findings of “La Tene culture” and “flat inhumation cemeteries” were directly associated with the celts and the celtic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bQMxOC66jvsC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=The+view+that+Hallstat+and+La+Tene+could+be+viewed+not+merely+as+chronological+periods++but+also+as+%E2%80%9CCulture+Groups%E2%80%9D+had+been+developing+during+the+late+19+century+and+in+1911+the+idea+that+such+groups+could+be+interpreted+in+racial+terms+was+firmly+advocated&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OnJXTKa3HcbKjAfC-NW3Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=pg 48 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] (c. 800-475 BC) and [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] (c. 500-50 BC) cultures are typically associated with Proto-Celtic and Celtic culture.&lt;ref&gt;F. Fleming, ''Heroes of the Dawn: Celtic Myth'', 1996. p. 9 &amp; 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In various{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in the Iberian Peninsula, in southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jEJyWT1gwg0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=no+la+tene+in+western+france&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nR9QTO-LOs-VsQbfj-CsAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=pg5 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA386&amp;dq=no+la+tene+in+south+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=O81QTJ3kLc6M4gaDi4mEBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=no%20la%20tene%20in%20south%20ireland&amp;f=false |title=pg 386 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not provide enough evidence for a cultural scenario comparable to that of Central Europe. It is considered equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Peninsular Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture, leading to a more recent approach that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation having its initial roots in the Bronze Age [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker culture]].&lt;ref name=Lorrio&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_4/lorrio_zapatero_6_4.html] The Celts in Iberia: An Overview - Alberto J. Lorrio (Universidad de Alicante) &amp; Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero ([[Complutense University of Madrid|Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]) - Journal of Interdisciplinary [[Celtic studies|Celtic Studies]], Volume 6: 167-254 The Celts in the Iberian Peninsula, February 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the  Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], and later [[Etruscan civilisation]]s. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century.

The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical [[Gaul|Celtic Gaul]]. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language, material culture, and [[Political party|political affiliation]] do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes  that in the 5th century, &quot;burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://web.archive.org/web/20071203185235/http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/journaldb/index.asp?select=fulltext&amp;id=100427.  Otto Hermann Frey, &quot;A new approach to early Celtic art&quot;]. Setting the Glauberg finds in context of shifting iconography, [[Royal Irish Academy]] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the [[Gauls]], the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.

===Historical evidence===
[[Polybius]] published a [[history of Rome]] about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century BC says that the Gauls &quot;originally called Celts&quot;, &quot;live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea&quot;. [[Posidonius]] described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost it was used by later writers such as [[Strabo]]. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy and Galatia. [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] wrote extensively about his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic Wars]] in 58-51 BC. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.

===Continental Celts===
====Gaul====
[[Image:Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Repartition of Gaul ca. 54 BC]]
{{Main|Gauls}}
At the dawn of history in Europe, the Celts then living in what is now France were known as Gauls to the Romans. The territory of these peoples probably included [[Low Countries|the low countries]], the Alps and what is now northern Italy. Their descendants were described by Julius Caesar in his ''[[Gallic Wars]]''. Eastern Gaul was the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation was similar to that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage, and texts with Greek characters are known in southern Gaul from the 2nd century.

Greek traders founded Massalia in about 600 BC, with exchange up the [[Rhône River|Rhone valley]], but trade was disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in Italy. [[Roman Empire|The Romans]] arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a Gaul that was mostly Celtic-speaking. Rome needed land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124-123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the [[Roman province|Roman Province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis|Gallia Transalpina]] was formed along the Mediterranean coast. The remainder was known as Gallia Comata - &quot;Hairy Gaul&quot;.

In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but were forced back by Julius Caesar. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC, most of Gaul had been overrun. In 52 BC, [[Vercingetorix]] led a revolt against the Roman occupation but was defeated at the siege of Alesia and surrendered.

Following the Gallic Wars of 58-51 BC, Caesar's ''Celtica'' formed the main part of Roman Gaul. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=The Celts|year=2003|publisher=Oxford Press|isbn=0-19-280418-9|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Place and personal name analysis and inscriptions suggest that the Gaulish Celtic language was spoken over most of what is now France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=The Celts|year=2003|publisher=Oxford Press|isbn=0-19-280418-9|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K_fmF-Rpt0QC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=celts+portuguese |title=Chambers's information for the people pg50 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rTEEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA505&amp;dq=portuguese+celts&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Brownson's Quarterly Review pg505 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Archaeological culture|material culture]] relatable to the [[Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène]] cultures. However, since according to the definition of the [[Iron Age]] in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Three divisions of the Celts of the Iberian Peninsula were assumed to have existed: the [[Celtiberians]] in the mountains near the centre of the peninsula, the [[Celtici]] in the southwest, and the celts in the northwest (in [[Gallaecia]] and [[Asturias]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8PsWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=celtiberian+celtici&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship, however, has clearly proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.&lt;ref name=Quintela&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_10/garcia_quintela_6_10.html|title=Celtic Elements in Northwestern Spain in Pre-Roman times|last=Quintela|first=Marco V.

The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the [[Gallaeci|Callaici]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eugenio|last=R.

John T. Koch of the University of  Wales-Aberystwyth suggested that [[Tartessian language|Tartessian]] inscriptions of the 8th century BC might already be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by margin of more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Koch, ''Tartessian: Celtic From the South-west at the Dawn of History'', Celtic Studies Publications, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alps and Po Valley====
{{Main|Golasecca culture|Lepontii|Cisalpine Gaul}}
{{See|History of the Alps}}
[[File:Römische Provinzen im Alpenraum ca 14 n Chr.png|thumb|Map of the Alpine region of the Roman Empire as of AD 14.]]
It had been known for some time that there was an early, although apparently somewhat limited, Celtic ([[Lepontic]], sometimes called Cisalpine Celtic) presence in [[Northern Italy]] since inscriptions dated to the 6th century BC have been found there.

The site of [[Golasecca]], where the [[Ticino river|Ticino]] exits from [[Lake Maggiore]], was particularly suitable for long-distance exchanges, in which Golaseccans acted as intermediaries between [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and the [[Halstatt culture]] of Austria, supported on the all-important trade in [[salt]].

In 391 BC Celts &quot;who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the [[Apennine Mountains|Appennine mountains]] and the Alps&quot; according to [[Diodorus Siculus]]. The [[River Po|Po Valley]] and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as [[Cisalpine Gaul]]) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=The Celts - A Very Short Introduction|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280418-9|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the Roman army was routed at the [[Battle of the Allia|battle of Allia]] and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the [[Senones]].

At the [[battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.

The defeat of the combined [[Samnium|Samnite]], Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the [[Samnite Wars|Third Samnite War]] sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.

====Eastward expansion====
{{Main|Gallic invasion of the Balkans}}

[[Image:Celts in Illyria &amp; Pannonia.png|thumb|310px|left|Celtic tribes in S.E.E c. 1st century BC (in purple)]]
The Celts also expanded down the [[Danube]] river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the [[Scordisci]], had established their capital at [[Singidunum]] in 3rd century BC, which is present-day [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a [[Population density|density of population]] in the [[Tisza]] valley of modern-day [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]], Hungary and into [[Ukraine]]. Expansion into [[Romania]] was however blocked by the [[Dacians]].

Further south, Celts settled in [[Thrace]] ([[Bulgaria]]), which they ruled for over a century, and [[Anatolia]], where they settled as the [[Galatia]]ns ''(see also: [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic Invasion of Greece]])''. Despite their [[geographical isolation]] from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. [[St Jerome]], who visited Ancyra (modern-day [[Ankara]]) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the [[Treveri]] of northern Gaul.

For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense celtic settlement.

The [[Boii]] tribe gave their name to [[Bohemia]], [[Bologna]] and possibly [[Bavaria]], and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and [[Slovakia]]. A celtic coin ([[Biatec]]) from [[Bratislava]]'s mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.

As there is no archaeological evidence for large scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=The Celts: A Very Short Introduction|year=2003|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-280418-9|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|expedition in Greece and western Anatolia]], are well documented in Greek and Latin history.

There are records of Celtic mercenaries in [[Egypt]] serving the [[Ptolemies]]. Thousands were employed in 283-246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.

===Insular Celts===
{{main|Insular Celts}}
{{See|Iron Age Britain|Celtic immigration to the British Isles}}
{{See|Iron Age tribes in Britain|Goidelic substrate hypothesis|O'Rahilly's historical model}}
[[Image:Romanbritain.jpg|200px|thumb|Principal sites in [[Roman Britain]], with indication of tribal territories.]]
All Celtic languages extant today belong to the  [[Insular Celtic languages]], derived from the Celtic languages spoken in [[Iron Age Britain]]. They were separated into a [[Goidelic]] and a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] branch from an early period.

Linguists have been arguing for many years whether a Celtic language came to Britain and Ireland and then split or whether there were two separate &quot;invasions&quot;. The older view of prehistorians was that the Celtic influence in the British Isles was the result of successive invasions from the European continent by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over the course of several centuries, accounting for the [[P-Celtic]] vs. [[Q-Celtic]] isogloss. This view is now generally discredited in favour of a phylogenetic [[Insular Celtic]] dialect group.

Celtic arrival in Britain is usually taken to correspond to [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] influence and the appearance of [[chariot burial]]s in what is now England from about the 6th century BC.
Some Iron Age migration does seem to have occurred but the nature of the interactions with the indigenous populations of the isles is unknown. In the late [[Iron Age]] Pryor estimates that the population of Britain and Ireland was between 1 and 1.5 million, upon which a smaller number of Celtic-speaking immigrant populations would have installed themselves as a [[superstrate]].

By about the 6th century ([[Sub-Roman Britain]]), most of the inhabitants of the Isles were speaking Celtic languages of either the [[Goidelic]] or the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] branch.

After Caesar's conquest of [[Gaul]] in the 50s BC, some [[Belgic people]] seem to have come to central southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13752-germanic-invaders-may-not-have-ruled-by-apartheid.html&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was a tribe called [[Parisi]] in eastern Yorkshire, these were probably a British people with cultural links to the continent. It has been claimed that there were a tribe of [[Iverni]] in Ireland who spoke a Brythonic language.

In Ireland as in Great Britain, beginning Celtic influence is taken to correspond to the beginning  [[Iron Age]]. The adoption of Celtic culture and language was likely a gradual transformation, brought on by cultural exchange with Celtic groups in the mainland or otherwise southwest continental Europe.

==Romanisation==
{{Main|Gallo-Roman culture}}
[[Image:Cesare prima Gallia 58 a.C. jpg.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The [[Roman republic]] and its neighbours in 58 BC.]]

Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from [[Claudius]] onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal  boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.

The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.

The Roman occupation of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], and to a lesser extent of [[Roman Britain|Britain]], led to Roman-Celtic [[syncretism]]. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a [[language shift]] to [[Vulgar Latin]], while the Insular Celts retained their language.

There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served  in the [[Roman cavalry]]. The Romans  adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the [[spatha]], and [[Epona]], the Celtic horse goddess.&lt;ref name=Tristram&gt;{{cite book|last=Tristram|first=Hildegard L.

To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Celtic [[social structure]] based formally on class and kingship. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.

In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] [[republic]]an [[form of government|forms of government]] eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as [[druid]], poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by [[election]] under the system of [[tanistry]], which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of [[primogeniture]] in which succession goes to the first born son.

Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in [[hillfort]]s and [[dun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/hist_periods/iron_age.htm The Iron Age]&quot;. Smr.herefordshire.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;  drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 [[List of hill forts in England|hill forts]] known in Britain)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=LspvFOZQTakC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Landscape of Britain]''&quot;. Michael Reed (1997). [[CRC Press]]. p.56. ISBN 0-203-44411-6&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tene areas, with the many significant ''[[oppida]]'' of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of [[Cisalpine Gaul|Gallia Cisalpina]].

[[Slavery]], as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented [[Slavery in antiquity|practice in ancient Greece and Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons 1615&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Victoria|title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|editor=John T.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland [[trade route]]s that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Neolithic wooden trackways and bog hydrology |journal= Journal of Paleolimnology |publisher =Springer Netherlands | volume =12 |date = January 1994| pages= 49–64 | doi=10.1007/BF00677989 | author=Casparie, Wil A. | last2=Moloney | first2=Aonghus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory held by the Celts contained [[tin]], [[lead]], [[iron]], [[silver]] and [[gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-ar_r_wal.pdf|369&amp;nbsp;KB}} Beatrice Cauuet (Université Toulouse Le Mirail, UTAH, France)&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and [[jewelry]] for [[international trade]], particularly with the Romans.

The myth that the Celtic [[monetary system]] consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that &quot;proto-money&quot; was used. This is the collective term used to describe bronze items made from the early La Tene period onwards, which were often in the shape of [[axe]]heads, [[ring]]s, or [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high [[Value (economics)|monetary value]], and could be used for &quot;day to day&quot; purchases. Low-value coinages of [[potin]], a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. [[Gold coin]]age was much more common than [[silver coin]]age, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparcity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.

There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The [[Ogham]] script, an [[Early Medieval]] [[alphabet]], was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by [[monastery|monasteries]]. The oldest recorded rhyming poetry in the world is of Irish origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Poetry|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08116a.htm|work=Irish Literature|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a transcription of a much older [[epic poetry|epic poem]], leading some scholars to claim that the Celts invented [[rhyme]]. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.

In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used [[chariot]]s in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic [[chariot tactics]] were able to repel the invasion of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.

According to Diodorus Siculus:

{{quote|The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth.|[[Diodorus Siculus]]}}

===Clothing===
[[File:Britishmuseumwaterloohelmet.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Waterloo Helmet]]]]
During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or [[tunic]]s and long trousers (called ''[[braccae]]'' by the Romans).&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, ''Bibliotheca Historica''&lt;/ref&gt; Clothes were made of [[wool]] or [[linen]], with some [[silk]] being used by the rich. [[Cloak]]s were worn in the winter. [[Brooch]]es and [[armlet]]s were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the [[torc]], a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold.  The horned [[Waterloo Helmet]] in the [[British Museum]], which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.

Rankin in ''Celts and the Classical World'' notes that &quot;Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] (30.9). It seems to be the general opinion of antiquity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In book XIII of his ''[[Deipnosophistae|Deipnosophists]]'', the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian [[Athenaeus]], repeating assertions made by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC ([[Bibliotheca historica]] 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that &quot;the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused&quot;. Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be [[Poseidonius]] and speculates that these authors may be recording male &quot;bonding rituals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sexual norm|sexual freedom]] of women in Britain was noted by [[Cassius Dio]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Dio Cassius&quot;&gt;[[List of Ancient Rome-related topics|Roman History]] Volume IX Books 71-80, Dio Cassiuss and Earnest Carry translator (1927), [[Loeb Classical Library]] ISBN 0-674-99196-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are instances recorded where women participated both in warfare and in kingship, although they were in the minority in these areas. [[Plutarch]] reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celts chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;

Among the insular Celts, there is a greater amount of historic documentation to suggest warrior roles for women.

===Celtic art===
[[File:Romano-Celtic mirror (Desborough).jpg|thumb|The reverse side of a British bronze mirror, with spiral and trumpet motifs typical of La Tène Celtic art in Britain]]
{{main|Celtic art}}

Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, that is what &quot;Celtic art&quot; evokes for much of the general public, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.  Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence.  Energetic circular forms, [[triskele]]s and spirals are characteristic.  Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from [[Pictish stones]] and the Insular [[high crosses]], large [[monumental sculpture]], even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood.

The [[interlace (art)|interlace]] patterns that are often regarded as typical of &quot;Celtic art&quot; were in fact introduced to Insular art from the [[Germanic animal style|animal Style II]] of Germanic [[Migration Period art]], though taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: [[Gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]], chalices like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and [[Derrynaflan Chalice]], and [[penannular brooch]]es like the [[Tara Brooch]].  These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the [[Viking]] attacks sharply set back cultural life.

In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other &quot;foreign&quot; styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic.  After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially [[Ancient Roman pottery]], of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including [[figurine]]s of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles.  [[Roman Britain]] also took more interest in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] than most of the Empire, and its development of [[champlevé]] technique was probably important to the later [[Medieval art]] of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element.

==Warfare and weapons==
[[Image:Parade helmet.jpg|thumb|left|Parade Helmet, Agris, France. 350 BC, with stylistic borrowings from around the Mediterranean.]]
{{Main|Celtic warfare|Celtic sword}}
Principal sites in Roman Britain, with indication of the Celtic tribes. [[Prehistoric warfare|Tribal warfare]] appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for [[Comparative advantage|economic advantage]], and in some instances to conquer territory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The Celts were described by classical writers such as [[Strabo]], [[Livy]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and [[Florus]] as fighting like &quot;wild beasts&quot;, and as hordes. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] said that their &quot;manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in [[military science]]. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of [[wild boar]]s, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus,  ''Roman Antiquities''

[[Polybius]] (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a [[Iron Age sword|long bladed sword]] which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. [[Celtic Warriors|Celtic warriors]] are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that [[Noric steel]], steel produced in Celtic [[Noricum]], was famous in the [[Roman Empire]] period and was used to equip the [[Roman military]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Noricus ensis,&quot; [[Horace]], Odes, i. 16.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, Iron and steel in [[Ancient history|ancient times]], 2005, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; However, Radomir Pleiner, in ''The Celtic Sword'' (1993) argues that &quot;the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point&quot;, as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.&lt;ref&gt;Radomir Pleiner, in ''The Celtic Sword'', Oxford: Clarendon Press (1993), p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked, &quot;The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, ''Histories'' II.28&lt;/ref&gt; According to Livy this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History'' XXII.46 and XXXVIII.21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Head hunting===
[[Image:nudeCeltwarrior.jpg|200px|thumb|A Gallic statue of a Celtic warrior, in the Museum of Brittany]]
Celts had a reputation as [[Headhunting|head hunters]]. According to [[Paul Jacobsthal]], &quot;Amongst the Celts the [[Head|human head]] was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jacobsthal ''Early Celtic Art''&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments for a Celtic cult of the severed head include the many sculptured representations of severed heads in La Tène carvings, and the surviving Celtic mythology, which is full of stories of the severed heads of heroes and the saints who [[cephalophore|carry their decapitated heads]], right down to ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', where the [[Green Knight]] picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off, just as [[St. Denis]] carried his head to the top of [[Montmartre]].

A further example of this regeneration after beheading lies in the tales of [[Connemara]]'s [[St. Feichin]], who after being beheaded by Viking pirates carried his head to the Holy Well on [[Omey Island]] and on dipping the head into the well placed it back upon his neck and was restored to full health.

[[Diodorus Siculus]], in his 1st century ''History'' had this to say about Celtic head-hunting:
{{quote|They cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses. The blood-stained spoils they hand over to their attendants and striking up a paean and singing a song of victory; and they nail up these first fruits upon their houses, just as do those who lay low wild animals in certain kinds of hunting. They embalm in [[cedar oil]] the heads of the most distinguished enemies, and preserve them carefully in a chest, and display them with pride to strangers, saying that for this head one of their ancestors, or his father, or the man himself, refused the offer of a large sum of money. They say that some of them boast that they refused the weight of the head in gold}}

In ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'', [[Lady Gregory]]'s [[Celtic Revival]] translation of [[Irish mythology]], heads of men killed in battle are described in the beginning of the story ''The Fight With The Fir Bolgs'' as pleasing to [[Macha]], one aspect of the war goddess [[Morrigan|Morrigu]].

==Religion==
===Polytheism===
{{Main|Celtic polytheism}}
[[Image:BrigitteCelt.jpg|thumb|left|270px|A statuette in the Museum of [[Brittany]], [[Rennes]], probably depicting [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia/Brigid]]: ca. 1st century AD, with iconography derived from Roman statues of [[Minerva]].]]

Like all Iron Age tribal societies, the Celts practised a [[Celtic polytheism|polytheistic religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunliffe&quot;/&gt;
Many [[List of Celtic gods|Celtic gods]] are known from texts and inscriptions from the Roman period.
Rites and sacrifices were carried out by priests known as [[druid]]s. The Celts did not see their gods as having human shapes until late in the Iron Age. Celtic [[shrine]]s were situated in remote areas such as hilltops, groves, and lakes.

Celtic religious patterns were regionally variable; however, some patterns of deity forms, and ways of worshipping these deities, appeared over a wide geographical and temporal range. The Celts worshipped both gods and goddesses. In general, Celtic gods were deities of particular skills, such as the many-skilled [[Lugh]] and [[The Dagda|Dagda]], while goddesses were associated with natural features, particularly rivers (such as [[Boann]], goddess of the [[River Boyne]]). This was not universal, however, as goddesses such as [[Brigid|Brighid]] and [[Morrígan|The Morrígan]] were associated with both natural features ([[clootie well|holy wells]] and the River Unius) and skills such as blacksmithing and healing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoestedt&quot;&gt;[[Marie-Louise Sjoestedt|Sjoestedt, Marie-Louise]] (originally published in French, 1940, reissued 1982) ''Gods and Heroes of the Celts''. Translated by Myles Dillon, Berkeley, CA, Turtle Island Foundation ISBN 0-913666-52-1, pp. 24-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoestedt2&quot;&gt;Sjoestedt (1940) pp.16, 24-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This trait is exhibited by The Three Mothers, a group of goddesses worshipped by many Celtic tribes (with regional variations).&lt;ref name=&quot;Inse Jones 1995&quot;&gt;Inse
Jones, Prudence, and Nigel Pennick. History of pagan Europe. London: Routledge, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celts had literally hundreds of deities, some of which were unknown outside a single family or tribe, while others were popular enough to have a following that crossed lingual and cultural barriers. For instance, the Irish god Lugh, associated with [[storm]]s, [[lightning]], and culture, is seen in similar forms as [[Lugos]] in Gaul and [[Lleu]] in Wales. Similar patterns are also seen with the continental Celtic horse goddess [[Epona]] and what may well be her Irish and Welsh counterparts, [[Macha (Irish mythology)|Macha]] and [[Rhiannon]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoestedt3&quot;&gt;Sjoestedt (1940) pp.xiv-xvi, 14-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman reports of the druids mention ceremonies being held in [[sacred grove]]s. La Tène Celts built temples of varying size and shape, though they also maintained shrines at [[sacred tree]]s and [[Cult (religious practice)|votive pool]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunliffe&quot;&gt;Cunliffe, Barry, (1997) ''The Ancient Celts''. Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]] ISBN 0-19-815010-5, pp.202, 204-8. p. 183 (religion)&lt;/ref&gt;

Druids fulfilled a variety of roles in Celtic religion, serving as priests and religious officiants, but also as judges, sacrificers, teachers, and lore-keepers. Druids organised and ran religious ceremonies, and they memorised and taught the [[Celtic calendar|calendar]]. Other classes of druids performed ceremonial sacrifices of crops and [[animal sacrifice|animals]] for the perceived benefit of the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoestedt5&quot;&gt;Sjoestedt (1982) pp.xxvi-xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallic Calendar===
{{Main|Coligny calendar}}
The [[Coligny calendar]], which was found in 1897 in [[Coligny, Ain|Coligny]], [[Ain]], was engraved on a [[bronze]] tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 m wide and 0.9 m high (Lambert p.&amp;nbsp;111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Pierre-Yves (2003). ''La langue gauloise''. Paris, Editions Errance. 2nd edition. ISBN 2-87772-224-4. Chapter 9 is titled &quot;Un calandrier gaulois&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in the [[Gaulish language|Gallic language]]. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.

The French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by [[druid]]s wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the [[Julian calendar]] was imposed throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or ''parapegmata'') found throughout the Greek and Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;Lehoux, D. R.  ''Parapegmata: or Astrology, Weather, and Calendars in the Ancient World'', pp63-5. [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/NQ53766.pdf PhD Dissertation, University of Toronto, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four major festivals in the Gallic Calendar: &quot;Imbolc&quot; on 1 February, possibly linked to the lactation of the ewes and sacred to the Irish Goddess Brigid. &quot;Beltaine&quot; on 1 May, connected to fertility and warmth, possibly linked to the [[Solar deity|Sun God]] Belenos. &quot;Lúnasa&quot; on 1 August, connected with the harvest and associated with the God Lugh. And finally &quot;Samhain&quot; on 1 November, possibly the start of the year.&lt;ref&gt;James, Simon (1993). &quot;Exploring the World of the Celts&quot; Reprint, 2002. pp-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these festivals, Beltaine and ''Lúnasa'' are shown on the Coligny Calendar by sigils, and it is easy to imagine that the first month on the Calendar (Samonios) matches Samhain. However, ''Imbolc'' does not seem to be shown at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Togodumnus (Kevan White) |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/celtic/coligny.htm |title=The Coligny Calendar, Roman Britain, 2/10/01 |publisher=Roman-britain.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes and combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities. Other changes included the adaptation of the [[Jupiter Pole]], a sacred pole which was used throughout Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in the north. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had only created wooden idols (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) previously to Roman conquest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inse Jones 1995&quot;/&gt;

===Celtic Christianity===
{{Main|Celtic Christianity}}
[[Image:Ccross.svg|thumb|right|170px|A [[Celtic cross]].]]
While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland moved from [[Celtic polytheism]] to Christianity in the 5th century AD. Ireland was converted under missionaries from Britain, such as [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]]. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of [[missionary|missionary work]] in Scotland, Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]). The term [[Celtic Christianity]] has been applied to the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, with especial reference to its traditions that were distinct from the rest of Western Christianity. The development of Christianity in Ireland and Britain brought an early [[medieval]] renaissance of [[Celtic art]] between 390 and 1200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Nora|title=The Celts|year=1970|pages=232–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruta|first=Venceslas|title=The Celts|year=1991|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=621–637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the styles now thought of as typically &quot;Celtic&quot; developed in this period, and are found throughout much of Ireland and Britain, including the northeast and far north of Scotland, [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]. Notable works produced during this period include the [[Book of Kells]] and the [[Ardagh Chalice]]. [[Antiquarian]] interest from the 17th century led to the term ''Celt'' being extended, and rising [[nationalism]] brought [[Celtic Revival|Celtic revival]]s from the 19th century.

'''Claude Monet''' ({{IPA-fr|klod mɔnɛ}}), born '''Oscar Claude Monet'''  (14&amp;nbsp;November 1840 – 5 December 1926), was a founder of French [[impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to [[plein-air]] [[landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;House, John, et al.: ''Monet in the 20th Century'', page 2, Yale University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=giverny&gt;[http://giverny.org/monet/biograph/Biography of Claude Monet giverny.org] . Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' (''Impression, soleil levant'').

==Early life==
Claude Monet was born on 14 November 1840 on the 5th floor of 45 [[rue Laffitte]], in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker5&quot;&gt;P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine Aubrée Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians. On 20 May 1841, he was baptized in the local parish church, [[Notre-Dame de Lorette (church in Paris)|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]], as Oscar-Claude, but his parents called him simply Oscar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Patin, ''Monet &quot;un œil...mais bon Dieu, quel œil !&quot;, Collection Découverte Gallimard. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, his family moved to [[Le Havre]] in [[Normandy]]. His father wanted him to go into the family grocery business, but Monet wanted to become an artist. His mother was a singer.

On the first of April 1851, Monet entered Le Havre secondary school of the arts. Locals knew him well for his charcoal caricatures, which he would sell for ten to twenty [[franc]]s. Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from [[Jacques-François Ochard]], a former student of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. On the beaches of Normandy in about 1856/1857, he met fellow artist [[Eugène Boudin]], who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet &quot;[[en plein air]]&quot; (outdoor) techniques for painting.&lt;ref Name=guggenheim&gt;[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_165.html Biography for Claude Monet] Guggenheim Collection. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Both received the influence of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]].

On 28 January 1857, his mother died. At the age of sixteen, he left school and went to live with his widowed childless aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.

==Paris==
[[File:Claude Monet River Scene at Bennecourt, Seine.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt'' (1868), an early example of ''plein-air'' impressionism, in which a gestural and suggestive use of oil paint was presented as a finished work of art.]]
When Monet traveled to Paris to visit the [[Louvre]], he witnessed painters copying from the old masters. Having brought his paints and other tools with him, he would instead go and sit by a window and paint what he saw.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Monet was in Paris for several years and met other young painters who would become friends and fellow impressionists; among them was [[Édouard Manet]].

In June 1861, Monet joined the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry in [[Algeria]] for a seven-year commitment, but, two years later, after he had contracted typhoid fever, his aunt intervened to get him out of the army if he agreed to complete an art course at an art school. It is possible that the Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], whom Monet knew, may have prompted his aunt on this matter. Disillusioned with the traditional art taught at art schools, in 1862 Monet became a student of [[Charles Gleyre]] in Paris, where he met [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Frédéric Bazille]] and [[Alfred Sisley]]. Together they shared new approaches to art, painting the effects of light ''[[en plein air]]'' with broken color and rapid brushstrokes, in what later came to be known as [[Impressionism]].

Monet's ''Camille'' or ''The Woman in the Green Dress'' (''La femme à la robe verte''), painted in 1866, brought him recognition and was one of many works featuring his future wife, [[Camille Doncieux]]; she was the model for the figures in ''[[Women in the Garden]]'' of the following year, as well as for ''On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt'', 1868, pictured here. Shortly thereafter, Camille became pregnant and gave birth to their first child, Jean.

==Franco-Prussian War, Impressionism, and Argenteuil==
[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant, 1872.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''[[Impression, Sunrise]] (Impression, soleil levant)'' (1872).]]
[[File:Pierre August Renoir, Claude Monet Reading.jpg|thumb|200px|''Claude Monet Reading'' (1872) by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]]]
After the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (19 July 1870), Monet took refuge in England in September 1870,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/ Monet, Claude] Nicolas Pioch, www.ibiblio.org, 19 September 2002. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied the works of [[John Constable]] and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], both of whose landscapes would serve to inspire Monet's innovations in the study of color. In the spring of 1871, Monet's works were refused authorisation for inclusion in the Royal Academy exhibition.&lt;ref name = &quot;Stuckey&quot;&gt;Charles Stuckey &quot;Monet, a Retrospective&quot;, Hugh Lauter Levin Associates, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1871, he left London to live in [[Zaandam]], in the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Stuckey&quot;/&gt; where he made twenty-five paintings (and the police suspected him of revolutionary activities).&lt;ref&gt;The texts of seven police reports, written on 2 June – 9 October 1871 are included in ''Monet in Holland'', the catalog of an exhibition in the Amsterdam [[Van Gogh Museum]] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; He also paid a first visit to nearby [[Amsterdam]]. In October or November 1871, he returned to France. Monet lived from December 1871 to 1878 at [[Argenteuil]], a village on the right bank of the [[Seine]] river near Paris, and a popular Sunday-outing destination for Parisians, where he painted some of his best known works. In 1874, he briefly returned to Holland.&lt;ref&gt;His paintings are shown and discussed here [http://www.livius.org/a/netherlands/amsterdam-monet/amsterdam-monet.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, he painted ''[[Impression, Sunrise]] (Impression, soleil levant)'' depicting a [[Le Havre]] port landscape. It hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 and is now displayed in the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] in Paris. From the painting's title, art critic [[Louis Leroy]] coined the term &quot;[[Impressionism]]&quot;, which he intended as disparagement but which the Impressionists appropriated for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinthepicture.com/styles/Impressionism/ Impressionism — Overview] ARTinthePICTURE.com. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this exhibition was a painting titled ''Boulevard des Capucines'', a painting of [[Boulevard des Capucines|the boulevard]] done from the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar's]] apartment at no. 35. There were, however, two paintings by Monet of the boulevard: one is now in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in [[Moscow]], the other in the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. It has never become clear which painting appeared in the groundbreaking 1874 exhibition, though more recently the Moscow picture has been favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Ian. [http://apollo-magazine.co.uk/march-2007/66398/monets-boulevard-des-capucines.thtml &quot;Kansas city or Moscow?&quot;], ''[[Apollo (magazine)]]'', 2007-03-01. Retrieved on 2009-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet and Camille Doncieux had married just before the war (28 June 1870)&lt;ref name = &quot;Stuckey&quot;/&gt; and, after their excursion to London and Zaandam, they had moved to Argenteuil, in December 1871. It was during this time that Monet painted various works of modern life. Camille became ill in 1876. They had a second son, Michel, on 17 March 1878, (Jean was born in 1867). This second child weakened her already fading health. In that same year, he moved to the village of [[Vétheuil]]. On 5 September 1879, Camille Monet died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of thirty-two; Monet painted her on her death bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Artelino |publisher= Artelino.com |url=http://www.artelino.com/articles/la_japonaise.asp |title=accessed 25 September 2007 |date= |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted on November 6, 2008 1:30PM by Kelly Wilson |url=http://members.aol.com/wwjohnston/camille.htm |title=accessed 25 September 2007 |publisher=Members.aol.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Clémentel monet in seinen gaerten 20008 1.jpg|thumb|''Claude Monet, in his garden'', by Étienne Clémentel, c. 1917]]
After several difficult months following the death of Camille, a grief-stricken Monet (resolving never to be mired in poverty again) began in earnest to create some of his best paintings of the 19th century. During the early 1880s, Monet painted several groups of landscapes and seascapes in what he considered to be campaigns to document the French countryside. His extensive campaigns evolved into his series' paintings.

[[Camille Doncieux|Camille Monet]] had become ill with tuberculosis in 1876. Pregnant with her second child she gave birth to Michel Monet in March 1878. In 1878 the Monets temporarily moved into the home of [[Ernest Hoschedé]], (1837–1891), a wealthy department store owner and patron of the arts. Both families then shared a house in [[Vétheuil]] during the summer. After her husband ([[Ernest Hoschedé]]) became bankrupt, and left in 1878 for Belgium, and after the death of Camille Monet in September 1879, and while Monet continued to live in the house in Vétheuil; [[Alice Hoschedé]] helped Monet to raise his two sons, Jean and Michel, by taking them to Paris to live alongside her own six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monetalia.com/biography.aspx |title=online biography retrieved 28 December 2007 |publisher=Monetalia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[Blanche Hoschedé Monet]], (she eventually married Jean Monet), Germaine, [[Suzanne Hoschedé]], Marthe, Jean-Pierre, and Jacques. In the spring of 1880, Alice Hoschedé and all the children left Paris and rejoined Monet still living in the house in Vétheuil.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Merrill Mount, ''Monet a biography,'' [[Simon and Schuster]] publisher, copyright 1966, pp.309-322.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881, all of them moved to [[Poissy]], which Monet hated. In April 1883, looking out the window of the little train between Vernon and Gasny, he discovered Giverny &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monetalia.com/biography.aspx monetalia.com] Retrieved April 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://giverny.org/giverny/ Giverny.org] Retrieved April 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Charles Merrill Mount, ''Monet a biography,'' [[Simon and Schuster]] publisher, copyright 1966, p326.&lt;/ref&gt;. They then moved to [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]], then to a house in [[Giverny]] in [[Normandy]], where he planted a large garden and where he painted for much of the rest of his life. Following the death of her estranged husband, Alice Hoschedé married Claude Monet in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;guggenheim&quot;/&gt;

==Giverny==
[[File:'Port-Goulphar, Belle-Île', oil on canvas painting by Claude Monet, 1887, Art Gallery of New South Wales.jpg|thumb|left|''Port-Goulphar, [[Belle Île]]'', 1887, [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]]]
[[Image:Charing Cross Bridge, Monet.jpg|thumb|right|''Charing Cross Bridge'', 1899, Collection Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza, [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]], Madrid]]
At the beginning of May 1883, Monet and his large family rented a house and {{convert|2|acre|m2}} from a local landowner. The house was situated near the main road between the towns of [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] and Gasny at [[Giverny]]. There was a barn that doubled as a painting studio, orchards and a small garden. The house was close enough to the local schools for the children to attend and the surrounding landscape offered many suitable motifs for Monet's work. The family worked and built up the gardens and Monet's fortunes began to change for the better as his dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] had increasing success in selling his paintings. By November 1890, Monet was prosperous enough to buy the house, the surrounding buildings and the land for his gardens. During the 1890s, Monet built a greenhouse and a second studio, a spacious building well lit with skylights. Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s through the end of his life in 1926, Monet worked on &quot;series&quot; paintings, in which a subject was depicted in varying light and weather conditions. His first series exhibited as such was of [[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]], painted from different points of view and at different times of the day. Fifteen of the paintings were exhibited at the [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Galerie Durand-Ruel]] in 1891. He later produced several series of paintings including: ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]],'' ''[[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplars]],'' the ''[[London Parliament (Monet)|Parliament]],'' ''Mornings on the Seine,'' and the ''[[Water Lilies]]''  that were painted on his property at Giverny.

Monet was fond of painting controlled nature: his own gardens in Giverny, with its [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]], pond, and bridge. He also painted up and down the banks of the Seine, producing paintings such as ''Break-up of the ice on the Seine''. He wrote daily instructions to his gardener, precise designs and layouts for plantings, and invoices for his floral purchases and his collection of botany books. As Monet's wealth grew, his garden evolved. He remained its architect, even after he hired seven gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/travel/getaways/europe/articles/2007/05/20/monets_gardens_a_draw_to_giverny_and_to_his_art/|title=Monet's gardens a draw to Giverny and to his art|publisher=Globe Correspondents|date=2007-05-20|accessdate=2008-10-13 | first=Robert | last=Garrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1883 and 1908, Monet traveled to the [[Mediterranean]], where he painted landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes, such as ''Bordighera''. He  painted  an important series of paintings in [[Venice, Italy|Venice]], Italy, and in London he painted two important series—views of [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] and views of Charing Cross Bridge. His second wife, Alice, died in 1911 and his oldest son Jean, who had married Alice's daughter Blanche, Monet's particular favourite, died in 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;guggenheim&quot;/&gt; After his wife died, Blanche looked after and cared for him. It was during this time that Monet began to develop the first signs of [[cataract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Forge, Andrew, and Gordon, Robert, ''Monet'', page 224. Harry N. Abrams, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], in which his younger son Michel served and his friend and admirer [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] led the French nation, Monet painted a series of [[weeping willow]] trees as homage to the French fallen soldiers. In 1923, he underwent two operations to remove his cataracts: the paintings done while the cataracts affected his vision have a general reddish tone, which is characteristic of the vision of cataract victims. It may also be that after surgery he was able to see certain [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths of light that are normally excluded by the lens of the eye, this may have had an effect on the colors he perceived. After his operations, he even repainted some of these paintings, with bluer water lilies than before the operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/medicalscience/story/0,9837,724257,00.html Let the light shine in] Guardian News, 30 May 2002.

==Death==
[[File:Claude Monet 038.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[Water Lilies]]'', 1920-1926, [[Musée de l'Orangerie]]]]
Monet died of [[lung cancer]] on 5 December 1926 at the age of 86 and is buried in the [[Giverny]] church cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://giverny.org/giverny/  The village of Giverny] giverny.org. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet had insisted that the occasion be simple; thus only about fifty people attended the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

His home, garden and waterlily pond were bequeathed by his son Michel, his only heir, to the French Academy of Fine Arts (part of the [[Institut de France]]) in 1966. Through the ''Fondation Claude Monet'', the house and gardens were opened for visit in 1980, following restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-monet.fr/uk/?q=content/historical-record |title=Historical record &amp;#124; |publisher=Fondation-monet.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to souvenirs of Monet and other objects of his life, the house contains his collection of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodcut prints]]. The house is one of the two main attractions of [[Giverny]], which hosts tourists from all over the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conectiva''' was a company founded on August 28, 1995, in [[Curitiba]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Brazil]], by a group of friends, among them [[Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo]], who was a pioneer in the distribution of [[Linux]] and [[open source]] software in [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]] for all of [[Latin America]]. Besides a customized Linux distribution for the Latin American market, Conectiva developed a series of products and additional services directed to meet the market demand for open source tools, including books, manuals, additional software like Linux Tools and embedded systems, OEM programs, applications port, training kits and the &quot;Revista do Linux&quot; Linux magazine. In addition, the company provided consulting services, training and technical support in all of Latin America through its own service centers and certified partners.

Conectiva also provided development, customization and professional services on a worldwide basis through its team of open source software engineers. Conectiva's development team had expertise in, amongst others, the following areas: [[Linux kernel]] development, [[high availability]], [[device driver]]s, [[XFree86]], [[network protocol]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalling]], [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]]ing, [[performance analysis]] and [[Optimization (computer science)|optimisation]], [[filesystem]]s and [[resource management]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

On 24 January 2005 it was announced that [[Mandrakesoft]] had acquired Conectiva for 1.79 million [[euro]] (2.3 million U.S. dollars at the time). On 7 April 2005 Mandrakesoft announced the decision to change the name of the parent company to [[Mandriva]] and their distribution name to [[Mandriva Linux]], although the Brazilian operation would not change its name from Conectiva immediately.

'''Carthage''' ({{lang-la|Carthago}} or ''Karthago'', {{lang-grc|Καρχηδών ''Karkhēdōn''}}, {{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;قرطاج&lt;/big&gt; ''Qarṭāj''}},  [[Berber languages|Berber]]: ⴽⴰⵔⵜⴰⵊⴻⵏ ''Kartajen'', [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]: ''*Carθaza'', Modern {{lang-he|קרתגו}} ''Qartágo'', from the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]  ''{{lang|phn-Latn|Qart-ḥadašt}}''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.ca/books?ei=hKY7Tb2bAdL2gAfPn7HCCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=lrIiAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=carthage+%22hadsat%22&amp;q=+%22hadsat%22#search_anchor Annales]'', 1908. p.253.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ''New City'' ([[Aramaic]]: ''Qert Ḥdaša''), implying it was a 'new [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.ugent.be/carthage/history.php Carthage: new excavations in Mediterranean capital]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a major urban centre that has existed for nearly 3,000 years on the [[Gulf of Tunis]], developing from a [[Phoenician]] colony of the 1st millennium BC which has given place to the current suburb outside [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], with a population (2004 Census) of 20,715.

The first civilization that developed within the city's sphere of influence is referred to as Punic (a form of the word &quot;Phoenician&quot;) or Carthaginian. The city of Carthage is located on the eastern side of [[Lake Tunis]] across from the centre of Tunis. According to Roman legend it was founded in 814 BC by [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from Tyre under the leadership of Elissa ([[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]]). It became a large and rich city and thus a major power in the Mediterranean. The resulting rivalry with [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] was accompanied by several wars with respective invasions of each other's homeland. [[Hannibal]]'s invasion of Italy in the [[Second Punic War]] culminated in the Carthaginian [[battle of Cannae|victory at Cannae]] and led to a serious threat to the continuation of Roman rule over Italy; however, Carthage emerged from the conflict at its historical weakest after Hannibal's defeat at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202 BC. After the [[Third Punic War]], the city was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC. However, the Romans refounded Carthage, which became the Empire's fourth most important city and the capital of the short-lived [[Vandals#The Vandal Kingdom in North Africa|Vandal kingdom]]. It remained one of the most important Roman cities until the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Muslim conquest]] when it was destroyed a second time in 698 AD.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Topography==
Carthage was built on a [[promontory]] with inlets to the sea to the north and south. The city's location made it master of the Mediterranean's maritime trade. All ships crossing the sea had to pass between [[Sicily]] and the coast of Tunisia, where Carthage was built, affording it great power and influence.

[[Image:Carthage, Tunisia EO-1.jpg|[[Earth Observing-1|EO-1]] |right|thumb|260px]]
Two large, artificial harbours were built within the city, one for harbouring the city's massive navy of 220 warships and the other for mercantile trade. A walled tower overlooked both harbours.

The city had massive walls, 23 miles (37 kilometres) in length, longer than the walls of comparable cities. Most of the walls were located on the shore and thus could be less impressive, as Carthaginian control of the sea made attack from that direction difficult. The 2.5 to 3 miles (4 to 4.8 kilometres) of wall on the [[isthmus]] to the west were truly large and, in fact, were never penetrated.

The city had a huge [[necropolis]] or burial ground, religious area, market places, council house, towers and a theatre and was divided into four equally sized residential areas with the same layout. Roughly in the middle of the city stood a high citadel called the Byrsa.

Carthage was one of the largest cities in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] times (by some estimates only [[Alexandria]] was larger) and was among the largest cities in pre-industrial history.

==History==
[[File:Carthage.gif|thumb|Layout of the city.]]
{{Main|History of Carthage}}
The historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the [[Third Punic War]], very few Carthaginian [[primary source|primary historical sources]] survive. While there are a few ancient translations of [[Punic]] texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in North Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main sources are [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians, including [[Livy]], [[Polybius]], [[Appian]], [[Cornelius Nepos]], [[Silius Italicus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Dio Cassius]], and [[Herodotus]]. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=9384201 Carthage by B. H. Warmington p11]&lt;/ref&gt; Greek cities contested with Carthage for [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, V2. 165–7&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] fought three wars [[Punic Wars|against Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, World History: 1.7–1.60&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favorable view, these works have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Warmington, B. H. ''Carthage'', p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation legends===
====Queen Elissa (Dido)====
[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|Carthage]]
According to Roman sources, [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from modern-day [[Lebanon]], led by Queen Dido (Elissa) founded Carthage in 814 BC. [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Elissa]] (also known as &quot;Alissar&quot;), was an exiled princess of the ancient Phoenician city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. At its peak,  the metropolis she founded, Carthage, came to be called the &quot;shining city,&quot; ruling 300 other cities around the western Mediterranean and leading the Phoenician (or Punic) world.

Elissa's brother, King [[Pygmalion of Tyre]], had murdered her husband, the high priest. Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the &quot;new city&quot; of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to Justin, Princess Elissa was the daughter of King Matten of Tyre (also known as Muttoial or Belus II). When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her and her brother, Pygmalion. She married her uncle Acherbas (also known as Sychaeus), the High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between [[religion and politics|religion and the monarchy]]. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acherbas.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Pygmalion assassinated Acherbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign, causing dissent within the royal family.

====The mention of Queen Elissa (Dido) in Virgil's Aeneid====
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] epic of [[Virgil]], the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]], the Greek name for Queen Elissa, is first introduced as an extremely respected character. In just seven years, since their exodus from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who have recently escaped from [[Troy]]. A spirit in the form of the messenger god, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a [[pyre]] to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: &quot;rise up from my bones, avenging spirit&quot; (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of [[Hannibal]].  The details of Virgil's story do not, however form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carthaginian Republic===
{{Main|Carthaginian Republic}}
[[File:CarthageMap.png|thumb|Carthaginian held territory in the early 3rd century BC]]
The Carthaginian Republic was one of the longest-lived and largest states in the ancient Mediterranean. Reports relay several wars with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and finally, Rome, which eventually resulted in the defeat and destruction of Carthage in the third Punic war.

====Army====
{{Main|Punic Military Forces}}
According to Polybius, Carthage relied heavily, though not exclusively, on foreign mercenaries,&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, Book 6, 52. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234&amp;query=head%3D%23524 On the ''Perseus'' project] &lt;blockquote&gt;
The former (the Romans - editor's note) bestow their whole attention upon this department (upon military service on land - editor's note): whereas the Carthaginians wholly neglect their infantry, though they do take some slight interest in the cavalry. The reason of this is that they employ foreign mercenaries, the Romans native and citizen levies. It is in this point that the latter polity is preferable to the former. They have their hopes of freedom ever resting on the courage of mercenary troops: the Romans on the valour of their own citizens and the aid of their allies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; especially in overseas warfare. The core of its army was from its own territory in north Africa (ethnic [[Libyans]] and [[Numidians]], as well as &quot;Liby-Phoenicians&quot; — i.e. Phoenicians proper). These troops were supported by mercenaries from different ethnic groups and geographic locations across the Mediterranean who fought in their own national units; [[Celt]]ic, [[Balearic]], and [[Iberians|Iberian]] troops were especially common. Later, after the Barcid conquest of Iberia, Iberians came to form an even greater part of the Carthaginian forces. Carthage seems to have fielded a formidable cavalry force, especially in its north African homeland; a significant part of it was composed of Numidian contingents of [[Numidian cavalry|light cavalry]]. Other mounted troops included the now extinct [[North African elephant]]s, trained for war, which, among other uses, were commonly used for frontal assaults or as anti-cavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants in case they charged toward their own army.

====Navy====
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|Roman [[trireme]] mosaic from Carthage, [[Bardo Museum]], Tunis ]]
The navy of Carthage was one of the largest in the [[Mediterranean]], using [[serial production]] to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. The sailors and [[marine (military)|marines]] of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the [[Punic]] citizenry, unlike the multi-ethnic allied and [[mercenary]] troops of the Carthaginian armies. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworthy - The Fall of Carthage&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of her skilled sailors implies that there was in peacetime a training of oarsmen and coxswains, giving their navy a cutting edge in naval matters.
The trade of Carthaginian merchantmen was by land across the Sahara and especially by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic to the tin-rich islands of Britain and to West Africa.
There is evidence that at least one Punic expedition under [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno]] sailed along the West African coast to regions south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], describing how the sun was in the north at noon.

[[Polybius]] wrote in the sixth book of his History that the Carthaginians were &quot;more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, History Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; Their navy included some 300 to 350 warships. The Romans, who had little experience in naval warfare prior to the [[First Punic War]], managed to finally defeat Carthage with a combination of reverse engineering captured Carthaginian ships, recruitment of experienced [[Greeks|Greek]] sailors from the ranks of its conquered cities, the unorthodox [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] device, and their superior numbers in marines and rowers. In the [[Third Punic War]] Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, augmenting their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). With this new combination, they were able to stand their ground against the superior Roman numbers for a whole day.

====Fall====
[[File:Tunisie Carthage Ruines 08.JPG|right|thumb|Ruins of Carthage]]
The fall of Carthage came at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Wine: The 8,000-Year-Old Story of the Wine Trade'', Thomas Pellechia (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial devastating Roman naval losses and Rome's recovery from the brink of defeat after the terror of a 15-year occupation of much of Italy by [[Hannibal]], the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, capturing, raping and enslaving the people. Fifty thousand Carthaginians were sold into [[slavery in ancient Rome|slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001198.html Ancient History]&lt;/ref&gt; The city was set ablaze, and razed to the ground, leaving only ruins and rubble. After the fall of Carthage, Rome annexed the majority of the Carthaginian colonies, including other North African locations such as [[Volubilis]], [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]], [[Chellah]], and [[Mogador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan (2007) ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. by A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt; The legend that the city was [[Salting the earth|sown with salt]] is not mentioned by the ancient sources; R.T. Ridley suggested that the story originated from 1930 in section of the Cambridge Ancient History written by B Hallward whose influence might be an account of [[Abimelech]]'s salting of [[Shechem]] in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 9:45.&lt;ref&gt;R.T. Ridley, &quot;To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' '''81''':2 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Ripley, Charles Anderson Dana, ''The New American Cyclopædia: a Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge'' '''4''':497, 1863 [http://books.google.com/books?id=bK4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA497&amp;dq=carthage+sowing+salt&amp;q=carthage+sowing+salt#v=onepage full text]&lt;/ref&gt;  Warmington admitted his fault in repeating Hallward's error but mentions an example of the story that goes back to 1299 when Bonaface VIII destroyed Palestrina.&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Warmington &quot;The Destruction of Carthage, A Retratatio&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' '''83''':4 (1988). pp308-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===A city of survivors===
====Byrsa====

{{Main|Byrsa}}

[[File:Maison punique byrsa.jpg|thumb|right|District of punic Byrsa]]

On the top of the [[Byrsa]] hill, location of the [[Forum (Roman)|Roman Forum]], was unearthed a residential area from the last century of existence of the Punic city, more precisely from the early 2nd century. It was excavated by the French archaeologist Serge Lancel. This site is an interesting alternative for those who cannot go to the more extensive ruins at [[Kerkuane]] (Punic city of [[Cape Bon]]). The neighborhood between houses and shops and private spaces is particularly significant.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel and Jean-Paul Morel, &quot;Byrsa. Punic vestiges&quot;; ''To save Carthage. Exploration and conservation of the city Punic, Roman and Byzantine'', Unesco / INAA, 1992, pp. 43-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The habitat is typical, even stereotypical.  The street may be used as a store; a tank is installed in the basement to collect water for domestic use, and a long corridor on the right side leads to a courtyard containing a [[sump]], around which various other elements may be found. In some places the ground is covered with mosaics called punica pavement, sometimes using a characteristic red mortar.

The remains have been preserved through the embankments, substructures of the later [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[substructures]] forum, whose foundation piles dot the district. The housing blocks are separated by a grid of straight streets of a width of approximately six metres, with a roadway consisting of clay. We also note ''in situ'' stairs to compensate for the fall of the hill. Construction of this type presupposes organization and political will, and has inspired the name of the neighborhood, &quot;Hannibal district&quot;, referring to the Punic general or [[Suffete]]  at the beginning of the 2nd century BC.

===Roman Carthage===

[[File:Karta Karthago.PNG|thumb|Roman Carthage]]
When Carthage fell, its nearby rival [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading center of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the Lake of Tunis and the outlet of the [[Majardah River]], Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of [[silt]] to erode into the river. This silt was accumulated in the harbor until it was made useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.

By 122 BC, [[Gaius Gracchus]] founded a short-lived [[Colonia (Roman)|''colonia'']], called [[Colonia Junonia|''Colonia Iunonia'']], after the Latin name for the punic goddess Tanit, ''Iuno caelestis''. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] abolished the colony some time later, in order to undermine Gracchus' power.
After this ill-fated attempt, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49-44 BC period, and by the 1st century it had grown to the second largest city in the western half of the [[Roman Empire]], with a peak population of 500,000{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. It was the center of the Roman province of [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa]], which was a major breadbasket of the empire.

Carthage also became a [[Early centers of Christianity#Carthage|centre of early Christianity]]. In the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than seventy bishops attended. [[Tertullian]] later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|bishop of Rome]], but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatist]] controversy, which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. In 397 at the [[Council at Carthage]], the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed]].

[[File:NE 500ad.jpg|thumb|Vandal Empire in 500 AD, centered in Carthage.]]

The political fallout from the deep disaffection of African Christians is supposedly a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centres were captured in the 5th century by [[Gaiseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[general]] [[Bonifacius]] and made the city his capital. Gaiseric was considered a heretic too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] finally subdued the Vandals in the 6th century.

During the emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice's]] reign, Carthage was made into an [[Exarchate]], as was [[Ravenna]] in [[Italy]]. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of Byzantium, all that remained of its power in the west. In the early 7th century, it was the Exarch of Carthage, [[Heraclius]] (of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin), who overthrew Emperor [[Phocas]].

===Islamic Carthage===

The [[Exarchate of Africa]] was not able to withstand the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim]] conquerors of the 7th century. [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] in 686 AD sent a force led by Zuhayr ibn Qais who won a battle over Byzantines and [[Berber people|Berbers]] led by [[Kusaila]], on the [[Qairawan]] plain, but could not follow that up. In 695 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] captured Carthage and advanced into the [[Atlas Mountains]]. A [[Byzantine]] fleet arrived and retook Carthage, but in 698 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] returned and defeated [[Tiberios III]] at the [[Battle of Carthage (698)|Battle of Carthage]]. The Byzantines withdrew from all of Africa except [[Ceuta]]. Roman Carthage was destroyed, just as the Romans had destroyed the Carthaginian Republic in 146 BC. Carthage was replaced by [[Tunis]] as the major regional centre. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to Roman or Byzantine influence there.

==Culture==
===Language===
Carthaginians spoke [[Punic language|Punic]], a variety of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] which was a [[Semitic]] language originating in the Carthaginians' original homeland of [[Phoenicia]] (modern [[Lebanon]]).

===Economy===
{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}
[[File:Port circulaire laurier rose.jpg|thumb|left|Carthaginian port]]
Carthaginian commerce was by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic and by land across the Sahara desert. According to Aristotle, the Carthaginians and others had treaties of commerce to regulate their exports and imports.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics Book 3,IX&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire of Carthage depended heavily on its trade with [[Tartessos]] and other cities of the Iberian peninsula, from which it obtained vast quantities of [[silver]], [[lead]], and, even more importantly, [[tin]] ore, which was essential for the manufacture of [[bronze]] objects by the civilizations of antiquity. Its trade relations with the Iberians and the naval might that enforced Carthage's monopoly on trade with tin-rich Britain and the Canary Islands allowed it to be the sole significant broker of tin and maker of bronze. Maintaining this monopoly was one of the major sources of power and prosperity for Carthage, and a Carthaginian merchant would rather crash his ship upon the rocky shores of Britain than reveal to any rival how it could be safely approached. In addition to being the sole significant distributor of tin, its central location in the Mediterranean and control of the waters between Sicily and Tunisia allowed it to control the eastern nations' supply of tin. Carthage was also the Mediterranean's largest producer of silver, mined in Iberia and the North African coast, and, after the tin monopoly, this was one of its most profitable trades. One mine in Iberia provided Hannibal with 300 Roman pounds (3.75 [[Talent (unit)|talent]]s) of silver a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Nat His'' 33,96&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthage's economy began as an extension of that of its parent city, [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the art of making the extremely valuable dye [[Tyrian Purple]]. It was one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean, being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. High Roman officials could only afford togas with a small stripe of it. Carthage also produced a less-valuable crimson pigment from the [[cochineal]].

Carthage produced finely embroidered and dyed [[textiles]] of [[cotton]], [[linen]], [[wool]], and [[silk]], artistic and functional [[pottery]], [[faience]], [[incense]], and perfumes. Its artisans worked with glass, wood, [[alabaster]], ivory, bronze, brass, lead, gold, silver, and precious stones to create a wide array of goods, including mirrors, highly admired furniture and cabinetry, beds, bedding, and pillows, jewelry, arms, implements, and household items. It traded in salted Atlantic fish and fish sauce, and brokered the manufactured, agricultural, and natural products of almost every Mediterranean people.

[[File:Head man Carthage Louvre AO3783.jpg|thumb|Punic pendant in the form of a bearded head, 4th–3rd century BC.]]
In addition to manufacturing, Carthage practised highly advanced and productive agriculture, using iron ploughs, irrigation, and crop rotation. [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago]] wrote a famous treatise on agriculture which the Romans ordered translated after Carthage was captured. After the Second Punic War, [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] promoted agriculture to help restore Carthage's economy and pay the war indemnity to Rome (10,000 talents or 800,000 Roman pounds of silver&lt;ref&gt;Pliny 33,51&lt;/ref&gt;), and he was largely successful.

Carthage produced wine, which was highly prized in Rome, [[Etruria]] (the [[Etruscans]]), and Greece. Rome was a major consumer of raisin wine, a Carthaginian specialty. Fruits, nuts, grain, grapes, dates, and olives were grown, and olive oil was exported in competition with Greece. Carthage also raised fine horses, similar to today's [[Arabian horse]]s, which were greatly prized and exported.

Carthage's merchant ships, which surpassed even those of the cities of the [[Levant]], visited every major port of the Mediterranean, Britain, the coast of Africa, and the [[Canary Islands]]. These ships were able to carry over 100 tons of goods. The commercial fleet of Carthage was comparable in size and tonnage to the fleets of major European powers in the 18th century.

Merchants at first favored the ports of the east: Egypt, the Levant, Greece, Cyprus, and Asia Minor. But after Carthage's control of Sicily brought it into conflict with Greek colonists, it established commercial relations in the western Mediterranean, including trade with the [[Etruscans]].

Carthage also sent caravans into the interior of Africa and [[Persia]]. It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides. Its merchants invented the practice of sale by auction and used it to trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia and tin from the Canary Islands. From the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts, they obtained amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. Carthage supplied poorer civilizations with simple things, such as pottery, metallic products, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered white warriors into Northern African slavery).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

These trade ships went all the way down the Atlantic coast of Africa to [[Senegal]] and Nigeria. One account has a Carthaginian trading vessel exploring Nigeria, including identification of distinguishing geographic features such as a coastal volcano and an encounter with gorillas (See [[Hanno the Navigator]]). Irregular trade exchanges occurred as far west as Madeira and the [[Canary Islands]], and as far south as southern Africa. Carthage also traded with [[History of India|India]] by traveling through the [[Red Sea]] and the perhaps-mythical lands of [[Ophir]] (India/Arabia?) and [[Land of Punt|Punt]], which may be present-day [[Somalia]].

Archaeological finds show evidence of all kinds of exchanges, from the vast quantities of tin needed for a bronze-based metals civilization to all manner of textiles, ceramics and fine metalwork. Before and in between the wars, Carthaginian merchants were in every port in the Mediterranean, buying and selling, establishing warehouses where they could, or just bargaining in open-air markets after getting off their ships.

The Etruscan language has not yet been deciphered, but archaeological excavations of Etruscan cities show that the Etruscan civilization was for several centuries a customer and a vendor to Carthage, long before the rise of Rome. The Etruscan city-states were, at times, both commercial partners of Carthage and military allies.

===Government===
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2007}}
[[File:Quartier Punique.JPG|thumb|left|Punic district of Carthage]]
The government of  Carthage was an [[oligarchy|oligarchal]] [[republic]], which relied on a system of [[checks and balances]] and ensured a form of public accountability. The Carthaginian heads of state were called [[Shofet|Suffets]] (thus rendered in Latin by [[Livy]] 30.7.5, attested in Punic inscriptions as SPΘM {{IPA|/ʃuftˤim/}}, meaning &quot;judges&quot; and obviously related to the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ruler title {{lang|he-Latn|''Shophet''}}  &quot;[[Biblical Judges|Judge]]&quot;). Greek and Roman authors more commonly referred to them as &quot;kings&quot;. SPΘ {{IPA|/ʃufitˤ/}} might originally have been the title of the city's governor, installed by the mother city of Tyre. In the historically attested period, the two Suffets were elected annually from among the most wealthy and influential families and ruled collegially, similarly to [[Roman consul]]s (and equated with these by Livy). This practice might have descended from the [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] oligarchies that limited the Suffet's power in the first Phoenician cities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The aristocratic families were represented in a supreme council (Roman sources speak of a Carthaginian &quot;[[Senate]]&quot;, and Greek ones of a &quot;council of [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]]&quot; or a [[gerousia]]), which had a wide range of powers; however, it is not known whether the Suffets were elected by this council or by an assembly of the people. Suffets appear to have exercised judicial and executive power, but not military {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. Although the city's administration was firmly controlled by oligarchs {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, democratic elements were to be found as well: Carthage had elected legislators, trade unions and town meetings. [[Aristotle]] reported in his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] that unless the Suffets and the Council reached a unanimous decision, the Carthaginian popular assembly had the decisive vote - unlike the situation in Greek states with similar constitutions such as [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]]. [[Polybius]], in his History book 6, also stated that at the time of the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government than the people of Rome held over theirs (a development he regarded as evidence of decline). Finally, there was a body known as the [[Hundred and Four]], which Aristotle compared to the Spartan [[ephors]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristiotle, Politics, Book 2, part 11&lt;/ref&gt; These were judges who oversaw the actions of generals {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, who could sometimes be sentenced to [[crucifixion]].

[[Eratosthenes]], head of the [[Library of Alexandria]], noted that the Greeks had been wrong to describe all non-Greeks as barbarians, since the Carthaginians as well as the Romans had a constitution. [[Aristotle]] also knew and discussed the Carthaginian constitution in his ''Politics'' (Book II, Chapter 11).

During the period between the end of the First Punic War and the end of the Second Punic War, members of the [[Barcid]] family dominated in Carthaginian politics. They were given control of the Carthaginian military and all the Carthaginian territories outside of Africa.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Carthage}}
Carthaginian religion was based on Phoenician religion (derived from the faiths of the [[Levant]]), a form of [[polytheism]]. Many of the gods the Carthaginians worshiped were localized and are now known only under their local names. It also had [[Jewish]] communities (which still exist; see [[Tunisian Jews]] and [[Algerian Jews]]).

===Pantheon===
[[File:Carthage EL shekel 2250013.jpg|thumb|Carthaginian coins from circa 310-290 BC showing the wreathed head of [[Tanit]]]]
The supreme divine couple was that of [[Tanit]] and [[Ba%27al_Hammon#Ba.27al_of_Carthage|Ba'al Hammon]]. The goddess [[Astarte]] seems to have been popular in early times. At the height of its cosmopolitan era, Carthage seems to have hosted a large array of divinities from the neighbouring civilizations of Greece, Egypt and the Etruscan city-states. A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon.

===Caste of priests and acolytes===
Surviving Punic texts are detailed enough to give a portrait of a very well organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions, for a variety of prices. Priests were clean shaven, unlike most of the population. In the first centuries of the city ritual celebrations included rhythmic dancing, derived from Phoenician traditions.

===Punic stelae===
[[File:Karthago Tophet 2.JPG|thumb|Stelae on the Tophet]]
[[Cippi]] and [[stelae]] of limestone are characteristic monuments of Punic art and religion, and are found throughout the western Phoenician world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. Most of them were set up over urns containing cremated human remains, placed within open-air sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries constitute striking relics of Punic civilization.

===Child sacrifice question===
&lt;!--
Before making any edits regarding the alleged practice of child sacrifice, please read the archived discussion at [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]]. We have been around this block several times before.

Please refrain from entering text that comes down conclusively on the question of whether or not child sacrifice was, in fact, practiced in Carthage. This question has been the subject of long and heated debate among editors of this article and has occasioned edit warring, semi-protection, etc.

The current consensus is that nobody knows for sure and that we should simply report both sides of the question without asserting which one is right. Any departure from this stance is likely to get edited out fairly quickly.

Parts of this section may be canted towards the assertion that child sacrifice ''was'' practiced in Carthage. It is reasonable to put in qualifying text that asserts that the details of the child sacrifice are based on accounts which may not be altogether reliable.

We are in the process of looking for sources for these details so that the descriptions can be based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

See [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]] for details of past debate on this topic.

--&gt;

Carthage under the Phoenicians was criticized by its neighbors for [[child sacrifice]]. [[Plutarch]] (''c.'' 46–120) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Philo]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus. Trans. C.H. Oldfather. ''Diodorus of Sicily 1, VI, VIII, IX''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1954-1963 (The Loeb Classical Library).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Herodotos]] and [[Polybius]] do not. Skeptics contend that if Carthage's critics were aware of such a practice, however limited, they would have been horrified by it and exaggerated its extent due to their polemical treatment of the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage a History, S Lancel, trans A Nevill, p252&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions child sacrifice practiced by the [[Canaan]]ites, ancestors of the Carthaginians. The Greek and Roman critics, according to Charles Picard, objected not to the killing of children but to the religious nature of it, as in both ancient Greece and Rome children were not uncommonly killed by exposure to the elements.  However, the Greeks and Romans engaged in the practice for economic rather than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Life in Carthage Gilbert and Colette Charels-Picard pp149-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[archaeology]] in formerly Punic areas has discovered a number of large cemeteries for children and infants. These cemeteries may have been used as graves for [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infants or children who died very early.&lt;ref&gt;Carhtage a History, S Lancel, trans A Nevill, pp251&lt;/ref&gt; Modern archeological excavations have been interpreted as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ualberta.ca/~kmacfarl/CLASS_110/5.HittitesPhoeneciansIsraelites.html Kelly A. MacFarlane, University of Alberta, ''Hittites and Phoenician'']&lt;/ref&gt; In a single child cemetery called the [[Tophet]] by archaeologists, an estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BC and 200 BC, with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and 2-year-olds. These remains have been interpreted to mean that in the cases of stillborn babies, the parents would sacrifice their youngest child. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not possible to know why. The correlation could be because bad times inspired the Carthaginians to pray for divine intervention (via child sacrifice), or because bad times increased child mortality, leading to more child burials (via cremation).

Accounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba`al Hammon and Tanit in Tophet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own. However, Carthage priests demanded the flower of their youth in times of crisis or calamity like war, drought or famine. Special ceremonies during extreme crisis saw up to 200 children of the most affluent and powerful families slain and tossed into the burning pyre.{{Citation needed|reason=Long, and detailed, with very relevant information: But badly needs a citation|date=February 2010}}

Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children who died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was &quot;a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were &quot;offered&quot; to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, &quot;Beliefs and Religious Life&quot; in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make absolutely no mention of child sacrifice, though most of them pertain to matters entirely unrelated to religion, such as the practice of agriculture.

==Modern times==
Carthage remains a popular [[tourist]] attraction and residential [[suburb]] of [[Tunis]].

In February 1985,  [[Ugo Vetere]], the mayor of [[Rome]], and Chedly Klibi, the mayor of Carthage, signed a symbolic treaty &quot;officially&quot; ending the conflict between their cities, which had been supposedly [[List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity|extended by the lack of a peace treaty]] for more than 2,100 years.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198503/delenda.est.carthago.htm written by John Lawton&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carthage in fiction ==
Carthage features in Gustave Flaubert's historical novel ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'' (1862).  Set around the time of the Mercenaries' War, it includes a dramatic description of child sacrifice, and the boy Hannibal narrowly avoiding being sacrificed.

In ''[[The Dead Past]]'', a science fiction short story by [[Isaac Asimov]], a leading character is an ancient historian who is trying to disprove the allegation that the Carthaginians carried out child sacrifice.

In [[Kushiel's Mercy]] by [[Jacqueline Carey]], Carthage is a conquering nation that is geographically and culturally based on the historical Carthage.

''The Purple Quest'' by [[Frank G. Slaughter]] is about the founding of Carthage.

In [[mathematics]], two [[integer]]s ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be '''coprime''' (also spelled '''co-prime''') or '''relatively prime''' if they have no common positive [[divisor]] other than 1 or, equivalently, if their [[greatest common divisor]] is 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G.H. Hardy | authorlink=G. H. Hardy | coauthors=[[E. M. Wright]] | title=An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers | edition=6th ed. | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2008 | isbn=9780199219865| page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notation ''a'' &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''b'' is sometimes used to indicate that ''a'' and ''b'' are relatively prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=R. L.|last1=Graham|first2=D. E.|last2=Knuth|first3=O.|last3=Patashnik|title=Concrete Mathematics|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, 14 and 15 are coprime, but 14 and 21 are not, because they are both divisible by 7. The numbers 1 and −1 are coprime to every integer, and they are the only integers to be coprime with 0.

A fast way to determine whether two numbers are coprime is given by the [[Euclidean algorithm]].

[[Euler's totient function]] (or Euler's phi function) ''φ''(''n'') for a positive integer ''n'' gives the number of integers between 1 and ''n'' which are coprime to ''n''.

== Properties ==

[[Image:coprime-lattice.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1. The numbers 4 and 9 are coprime. Therefore, the diagonal of a 4 x 9 lattice does not intersect any other [[square lattice|lattice points]]]]

There are a number of conditions which are equivalent to ''a'' and ''b'' being coprime:
*No [[prime number]] divides both ''a'' and ''b''.
*There exist integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = 1 (see [[Bézout's identity]]).
*The integer ''b'' has a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]] modulo ''a'': there exists an integer ''y'' such that ''by'' ≡ 1 (mod ''a''). In other words, ''b'' is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] in the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z'''/''a'''''Z''' of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo]] ''a''.
*Every pair of [[congruence relation]]s for an unknown integer ''x'', of the form ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''k'' (mod ''a'') and ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''l'' (mod ''b''), has a solution, as stated by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]; in fact the solutions are described by a single congruence relation modulo ''ab''.

As a consequence of the third point, if ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime and ''br'' &amp;equiv; ''bs'' ([[modular arithmetic|mod]] ''a''), then ''r'' &amp;equiv; ''s'' (mod ''a'') (because we may &quot;divide by ''b''&quot; when working modulo ''a''). Furthermore, if ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are both coprime with ''a'', then so is their product ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (modulo ''a'' it is a product of invertible elements, and therefore invertible); this also follows from the first point by [[Euclid's lemma]], which states that if a prime number ''p'' divides a product ''bc'', then ''p'' divides at least one of the factors ''b'', ''c''.

As a consequence of the first point, if ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime, then so are any powers ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;.

If ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime and ''a'' divides the product ''bc'', then ''a'' divides ''c''. This can be viewed as a generalization of Euclid's lemma.

The two integers ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime if and only if the point with coordinates (''a'', ''b'') in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is &quot;visible&quot; from the origin (0,0), in the sense that there is no point with integer coordinates between the origin and (''a'', ''b''). (See figure 1.)

In a sense that can be made precise, the [[probability]] that two randomly chosen integers are coprime is 6/π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (see [[pi]]), which is about 61%. See below.

Two [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime if and only if the numbers 2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 and 2&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 are coprime. As a generalization of this, following easily from [[Euclidean algorithm]] in [[Radix|base]] ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1:

: &lt;math&gt;\gcd (n^a-1,n^b-1)=n^{\gcd(a,b)}-1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cross notation, group==
If ''n''≥1 and is an [[integer]], the numbers coprime to ''n'', taken [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with multiplication as operation; it is written as ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt; or '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Generalizations ==

Two [[ring ideal|ideals]] ''A'' and ''B'' in the [[commutative ring]] ''R'' are called '''coprime''' if ''A'' + ''B'' = ''R''. This generalizes [[Bézout's identity]]: with this definition, two [[principal ideal]]s (''a'') and (''b'') in the ring of integers '''Z''' are coprime if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime.

If the ideals ''A'' and ''B'' of ''R'' are coprime, then ''AB'' = ''A''∩''B''; furthermore, if ''C'' is a third ideal such that ''A'' contains ''BC'', then ''A'' contains ''C''. The [[Chinese remainder theorem]] is an important statement about coprime ideals.

The concept of being relatively prime can also be extended to any [[finite set]] of integers ''S'' = {''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, .... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} to mean that the [[greatest common divisor]] of the elements of the set is 1. If every pair in a (finite or [[infinite set|infinite]]) set of integers is relatively prime, then the set is called [[pairwise relatively prime]].

Every pairwise relatively prime finite set is relatively prime; however, the converse is not true: {6, 10, 15} is relatively prime, but not pairwise relative prime (in fact, each pair of integers in the set has a non-trivial common factor).

==Probabilities==

Given two randomly chosen integers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, it is reasonable to ask how likely it is that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are coprime. In this determination, it is convenient to use the characterization that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are coprime if and only if no prime number divides both of them (see [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]).

Intuitively, the probability that any number is divisible by a prime (or any integer), &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1/p&lt;/math&gt; (for example, every 7th integer is divisible by 7.) Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by this prime is &lt;math&gt;1/p^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the probability that at least one of them is not is &lt;math&gt;1-1/p^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, for distinct primes, these divisibility events are mutually independent. (This would not, in general, be true if they were not prime.) (For the case of two events, a number is divisible by ''p'' and ''q'' if and only if it is divisible by ''pq''; the latter has probability 1/''pq''.) Thus the probability that two numbers are coprime is given by a product over all primes,

: &lt;math&gt;\prod_p^{\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right) = \left( \prod_p^{\infty} \frac{1}{1-p^{-2}} \right)^{-1} = \frac{1}{\zeta(2)} = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \approx 0.607927102 \approx 61%. &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''&amp;zeta;'' refers to the [[Riemann zeta function]], the identity relating the product over primes to ''&amp;zeta;''(2) is an example of an [[Euler product]], and the evaluation of ''&amp;zeta;''(2) as ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/6 is the [[Basel problem]], solved by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1735. In general, the probability of ''k'' randomly chosen integers being coprime is 1/''&amp;zeta;''(''k'').

There is often confusion about what a &quot;randomly chosen integer&quot; is. One way of understanding this is to assume that the integers are chosen randomly between 1 and an integer&amp;nbsp;''N''. Then, for each upper bound ''N'', there is a probability ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; that two randomly chosen numbers are coprime. This will never be exactly &lt;math&gt;6/\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;, but in the limit as &lt;math&gt;N \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_N \to 6/\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This theorem was proved by [[Ernesto Cesàro]] in 1881. For a more rigorous proof than the intuitive and informal one given here, see {{cite book | author=G.H. Hardy | authorlink=G. H. Hardy | coauthors=[[E. M. Wright]] | title=An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers | edition=6th ed. | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2008 | isbn=9780199219865}}, theorem 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generating all coprime pairs==

All pairs of coprime numbers &lt;math&gt;m, n&lt;/math&gt; can be generated in a parent-3 children-9 grandchildren... family tree starting from &lt;math&gt;(2,1)&lt;/math&gt; (for even-odd or odd-even pairs)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Saunders |first=Robert |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Randall |first2=Trevor |title=The family tree of the Pythagorean triplets revisited |journal=Mathematical Gazette |volume=78 |month=July |year=1994 |pages=190–193 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or from &lt;math&gt;(3,1)&lt;/math&gt; (for odd-odd pairs),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mitchell |first=Douglas W. |title=An alternative characterisation of all primitive Pythagorean triples |journal=Mathematical Gazette |volume=85 |month=July |year=2001 |pages= 273–275 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; with three branches from each node. The branches are generated as follows:

Branch 1:  &lt;math&gt;m_\text{next}=2m-n,&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;n_\text{next}=m&lt;/math&gt;

Branch 2:  &lt;math&gt;m_\text{next}=2m+n,&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;n_\text{next}=m&lt;/math&gt;

Branch 3:  &lt;math&gt;m_\text{next}=m+2n,&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;n_\text{next}=n&lt;/math&gt;

This family tree is exhaustive and non-redundant with no invalid members.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''control unit''' in general is a central (or sometimes distributed but clearly distinguishable&lt;!--and delimited--&gt;) part of the machinery that controls its operation, provided that a piece of machinery is complex and organized enough to contain any such unit. One domain in which the term is specifically used is the area of computer design. In the [[automotive industry]], the control unit helps maintain various functions of the [[motor vehicle]].

''The rest of this article describes ''control unit'' in terms of computer design. There is no further article on other uses under this lemma as yet. (Disambiguation and/or integration of this article in [[Computer]] with respective linkage—and retention/creation of a more broad-sense article—may be appropriate.)''

== Definition ==

Control Unit Co-ordinates the input and output devices of a computer system. It fetches the code of all of the instructions in the microprograms.
it directs the operation of the other units by providing timing and control signals

== Application in Computer Design ==

{{Multiple issues|section=y|refimprove = June 2008|cleanup = June 2008|expert=Computing|date=November 2008}}

In computers, the control unit was historically &lt;!-- reluctant to write &quot;first&quot; for &quot;historically&quot; without further research which, sorry, I'm not bothering about right now --&gt; defined as one distinct part of the 1946 reference model of [[Von Neumann architecture]]. In modern computer designs, the control unit is typically an internal part of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]&lt;!-- or other device that directs its operation--&gt; with its overall role and operation unchanged.

===General operation===
The outputs of the control unit control the activity of the rest of the device. A control unit can be thought of as a [[finite state machine]]. 

The control unit is the circuitry that controls the flow of data through the processor, and coordinates the activities of the other units within it. In a way, it is the &quot;brain within the brain&quot;, as it controls what happens inside the processor, which in turn controls the rest of the PC.{{vague|date=November 2010}}

A few examples of devices that require a control unit are CPUs and GPUs. The modern information age would not be possible without complex control unit designs.{{vague|date=November 2010}}

=== Hardwired Control ===
{{main|Hardwired control}}

At one time, control units for CPUs were ad-hoc logic, and they were difficult to design.  These can be identified as the main part of the computer and the main device that helps the computer to function in an appropriate manner.
It is constructed of logic gates, flip-flops, encoder circuits, decoder circuits, digital counters and other digital circuits.
Their control is based on fixed architecture i.e. it requires changes in the wiring if the instruction set is modified
or changed.
This architecture is preferred in RISC computers as it consists of a lesser instruction set.

Hardwired control units are implemented through use of [[sequential logic]] units, featuring a finite number of gates that can act as a generator of specific results, based on the instructions that were used to invoke those responses. These instructions are apparent in the design of the architecture, but can also be represented in other ways.

=== Microprogram Control Unit ===

The idea of microprogramming was introduced by M. V. Wilkes in 1951 as an intermediate level to execute computer program instructions (see also: [[microcode]]). Microprograms were organized as a sequence of microinstructions and stored in special control memory. The algorithm for the microprogram control unit is usually specified by flow-chart description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Barkalov | first1 = Alexander | title = Logic synthesis for FSM based control units / Alexander Barkalov and Larysa Titarenko | year = 2009 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | isbn = 978-3-642-04308-6 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of the microprogram control unit is the simplicity of its structure. Outputs of the controller are organized in microinstructions and  they can be easily replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Wiśniewski | first1 = Remigiusz | title = Synthesis of compositional microprogram control units for programmable devices   | year = 2009 | publisher = University of Zielona Góra | location = Zielona Góra | isbn = 978-83-7481-293-1 | pages = 153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functions of the Control Unit ===

The functions performed by the control unit vary greatly by the internal architecture of the CPU, since the control unit really implements this architecture. On a regular processor that executes x86 instructions natively the control unit performs the tasks of fetching, decoding, managing execution and then storing results. On a x86 processor with a [[RISC]] core, the control unit has significantly more work to do. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}It manages the translation of x86 instructions to RISC micro-instructions, manages scheduling the micro-instructions between the various execution units, and juggles the output from these units to make sure they end up where they are supposed to go. On one of these processors the control unit may be broken into other units (such as a scheduling unit to handle scheduling and a retirement unit to deal with results coming from the pipeline) due to the complexity of the job it must perform.....

The '''cello''' (pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈtʃɛloʊ|}} {{respell|CHEL|oh}}; plural '''cellos''' or '''celli''') is a [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. It is a member of the [[violin family]] of musical instruments, which also includes the [[violin]], [[viola]] and the [[contrabass]]. Old forms of the instrument in the [[Baroque]] era are [[baryton]] and [[viol]] ([[viola da gamba]]).

The word derives from the Italian 'violoncello'. The word derives ultimately from ''vitula'', meaning a stringed instrument. A person who plays a cello is called a cellist. The cello is used as a solo instrument, in [[chamber music]], in a [[string orchestra]] and as a member of the [[string section]] of an [[orchestra]]. It is the second largest [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] in the modern [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]], the [[double bass]] being the largest.

Cellos were derived from other mid- to large-sized bowed instruments in the 16th century, such as the [[viola da gamba]], and the generally smaller and squarer [[viola da braccio]], and such instruments made by members of the [[Amati]] family of [[luthier]]s. The invention of wire-wrapped strings in Bologna gave the cello greater versatility. By the 18th century the cello had largely replaced other mid-sized bowed instruments.

==Description==
[[Image:Cello study.jpg|thumb|Cello close-up]]
The name ''cello'' is an abbreviation of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'', which means &quot;little [[violone]]&quot;,or referring to the [[violone]] (&quot;big viol&quot;), the lowest-pitched instrument of the [[viol]] family, the group of string instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century or so before the louder [[violin]] family came into greater favour in that country too. The viols have enjoyed a vigorous revival in the 20th and 21st centuries. Thus, the name carries both an [[augmentative]] ''&quot;-one&quot;'' (&quot;big&quot;) and a [[diminutive]] ''&quot;-cello&quot;'' (&quot;little&quot;). By the turn of the 20th century, it had grown customary to abbreviate the name violoncello to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the six missing prefix letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;countess&quot;&gt;Delbanco, Nicholas. (January 1, 2001) [[Harper's Bazaar]]. ''[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html The Countess of Stanlein Restored. (Violoncello owned by [[Bernard Greenhouse]] is restored).]'' Volume 302; Issue 1808; Page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now customary to use the name &quot;cello&quot; without the apostrophe and as a full designation.&lt;ref name=&quot;countess&quot;/&gt; Cellos are tuned in fifths, starting with [[Scientific pitch notation|C2]] (two [[octave]]s below [[middle C]]) as the lowest string, followed by G2, D3, and A3. It is tuned in same intervals as the [[viola]], but an octave lower. Unlike [[violin]] and [[viola]], and like [[double bass]], cello has a pin at the bottom pinning the instrument to the floor in order to support its heavy weight. The cellist [[Paul Tortelier]] is credited with inventing a bent pin, enabling the instrument to lie more horizontally than vertically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulperleycellos.com/chatterfurthertonalimprovements.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The cello is most closely associated with European classical music, and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the human voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&amp;jid=ajcb&amp;theme=2&amp;issueno=4&amp;articleno=17# Welcome::. to Academic Journals Inc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is a part of the standard [[orchestra]] and is the bass voice of the [[string quartet]], as well as being part of many other [[chamber music|chamber]] groups. A large number of [[cello concerto|concertos]] and [[cello sonata|sonatas]] have been written for the cello.

Among the most well-known [[Baroque]] works for the cello are [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s six unaccompanied [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites]]. The ''Prelude'' from the ''First Suite'' is particularly famous. From the [[Classical music era|Classical era]], the two concertos by [[Joseph Haydn]] in [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|C major]] and [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Haydn)|D major]] stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. [[Romantic music era|Romantic era]] repertoire includes the [[Robert Schumann]] [[Cello Concerto (Schumann)|Concerto]], the [[Antonín Dvořák]] [[Cello Concerto (Dvořák)|Concerto]] as well as the two sonatas and the [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] by [[Johannes Brahms]]. Compositions from the early 20th century include [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto in E minor]], [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Debussy)|Sonata for Cello and Piano]] and unaccompanied cello sonatas by [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Paul Hindemith]]. The cello's versatility made it popular with composers in the mid- to late 20th century such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[György Ligeti]] and [[Henri Dutilleux]], encouraged by soloists who specialized in contemporary music (such as [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]) commissioning from and collaborating with composers.

Today the instrument is less common in [[popular music]], but was commonly used in 1970's pop and [[disco]] music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Today it is still sometimes featured in [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] recordings, examples of which are noted later in this article. The cello has also recently appeared in major [[hip-hop]] and [[R &amp; B]] performances, such as singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Ne-Yo]]'s performance at the [[American Music Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The instrument has also been modified for [[Indian classical music]] by [[Nancy Lesh]] and [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==History==
The history of [[Bow (music)|bowed]] string [[musical instrument]]s in Europe dates back to the 9th century with the [[Byzantine lyra|''lira'']] (''Greek: λύρα, Latin: lūrā''), the bowed instrument of the [[Byzantine Empire]], equivalent to the [[rabāb]] of the Islamic Empires. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d. 911) of the 9th century, in his lexicographical discussion of instruments, cited the [[Byzantine lyra|Byzantine lira]] as a typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' (organ), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the ''salandj''.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. Kartomi: On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments. Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology, University of Chicago Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Byzantine lyra|lira]] spread through Europe westward and in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms ''[[fiddle]]'' and ''[[Byzantine lira|lira]]'' interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments (Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009). In the meantime the Arab [[rabāb]] was introduced to the Western Europe possibly through the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and both bowed instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments.

Over the centuries that followed, Europe continued to have two distinct types of bowed instruments: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, known with the Italian term '''Lira da braccio''' (or ''[[Viola da braccio]]'', meaning ''viol for the arm''), family of the modern [[violin]]; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, known with the Italian term '''[[Lira da gamba]]''' (or ''viola da gamba'', meaning ''viol for the leg''), family of the [[Byzantine lyra]] and the modern Cello.&lt;ref&gt;stringed instrument. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved March 14, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569200/stringed-instrument (Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Renaissance]], the gambas were important and elegant instruments; they eventually lost ground to the louder (and originally less aristocratic) ''[[lira da braccio]]''.  However, the ''a gamba'' playing position remained popular to larger instruments that could not be played with ''a braccio'' position.

{{anchor|Violoncello da spalla}}The violoncello da spalla (sometimes &quot;violoncello piccolo da spalla&quot; or &quot;violoncello da span&quot;) was the first cello referred to in print (by [[Philibert Jambe de Fer|Jambe de Fer]] in 1556).&lt;ref name=&quot;countess&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[Violone]]&quot; means a [[Augmentative|larger]] &quot;viola&quot; ([[viol]]), while &quot;-cello&quot; in Italian is a diminutive and spalla means &quot;shoulder&quot; in Italian so that violoncello da spalla suggest a &quot;little big violin&quot; that may be held on the shoulder so that the player could perform while walking or that the early, short-necked instrument was hung across the shoulder by a strap.&lt;ref name=&quot;countess&quot;/&gt;

Monteverdi referred to the instrument as &quot;basso de viola da braccio&quot; in ''Orfeo'' (1607). Although the first bass violin, possibly invented by Amati as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consorts with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a ''&quot;violone,&quot;'' or &quot;large viola,&quot; as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the ''viola de gamba'' appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.

The invention of wire-wound [[strings (music)|strings]] (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in [[Bologna]], allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] passages. This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by [[double bass|basses]] or [[violone]]s.

Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}&lt;!--I believe you, I would just like to know where you got the info--&gt; Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by [[Stradivarius]], who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais').&lt;ref name = &quot;vrzuok&quot;&gt;Cyr 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The bass violin remained the &quot;most used&quot; instrument in England as late as 1740, where the violoncello was still &quot;not common.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grassineau 1740&lt;/ref&gt; The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.&lt;ref name = &quot;vrzuok&quot;/&gt; The size was not standardized until around 1750.

Despite similarities to the [[viol|viola da gamba]], the cello is actually part of the [[viola da braccio]] family, meaning &quot;viol of the arm,&quot; which includes, among others, the [[violin]] and [[viola]].  Though paintings like [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s &quot;The Rustic Wedding&quot; and de Fer in his ''Epitome Musical'' suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic ''a gamba'' position eventually replaced them entirely.

[[Image:Cello strung gut.JPG|thumb|right|A baroque cello strung with gut strings. Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.]]
[[Baroque]] era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways.  The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor), while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of [[Catgut|gut]], with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.

No educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. The earliest cello manual is [[Michel Corrette]]'s ''Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection'' (Paris, 1741).

==Current use==
===Orchestral===
Cellos are part of the standard [[symphony orchestra]], which usually includes eight to twelve players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The ''principal'' cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, and playing solos. Principal players always sit closest to the audience.

The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the harmony for the orchestra. On many occasions, the cello section will play the melody for a brief period of time, before returning to the harmony. There are also cello [[concerto]]s, which are orchestral pieces in which a featured, solo cellist is accompanied by an entire orchestra.

There are numerous [[cello concerto]]s - where a solo cello is accompanied by an [[orchestra]] -  notably 25 by [[Vivaldi]], 12 by [[Boccherini]], 4 by [[Haydn]], 3 by [[C.P.E. Bach]], 2 by [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], 2 by [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], and one each by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Lalo]], and [[Elgar]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] for Cello, Violin and Piano and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar &quot;concertos&quot; are [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]]' [[tone poem]] [[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]], [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Variations on a Rococo Theme]], [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]]'s [[Schelomo]] and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]'s [[Kol Nidrei]].

In the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] who inspired, commissioned and/or premiered dozens of new works. Among these, [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''Symphonia Concertante'', [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''Cello Symphony'' and the concertos of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Witold Lutosławski|Lutosławski]] and [[Henri Dutilleux|Dutilleux]] have already become part of the standard repertoire. In addition, [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]], [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], [[William Walton|Walton]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Joaquin Rodrigo|Rodrigo]], [[Malcolm Arnold|Arnold]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]] and [[György Ligeti|Ligeti]] also wrote major [[List of compositions for cello and orchestra|concertos]] for other cellists, notably for [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Julian Lloyd Webber]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rostro pic.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cellists Julian Lloyd Webber (left) and Mstislav Rostropovich]] --&gt;
There are also many [[cello sonata|sonatas]] for cello and [[piano]]. Those written by [[Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Fauré]], [[Shostakovich]], [[Prokofiev]], [[Poulenc]], [[Elliot Carter|Carter]], and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] are the most famous. Other important pieces for cello and piano include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] 's five ''Stücke im Volkston'' and transcriptions like [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[Arpeggione Sonata (Schubert)|sonata in a minor]] (originally for [[arpeggione]] and piano), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Suite Italienne]]'' (transcribed by the composer from his ballet ''Pulcinella'') and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano)  

Finally, there are several pieces for [[List of solo cello pieces|cello solo]], most importantly [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s  six [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites for Cello]] (arguably the most important cello pieces), [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]]'s ''Sonata for Solo Cello'' and [[Britten]]'s three [[Cello Suites (Britten)|Cello Suites]]. Other notable examples include [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]'s and [[Ysaÿe]]'s ''Sonatas for Solo Cello'', [[Henri Dutilleux|Dutilleux]]' ''Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher'', [[Luciano Berio|Berio]]'s ''Les Mots Sont Allés'' (both part of a series of twelve compositions for solo cello commissioned by Rostropovich for Swiss conductor [[Paul Sacher]]'s 70th birthday), [[Gaspar Cassado|Cassado]]'s &quot;Suite for Solo Cello&quot;, [[György Ligeti|Ligeti]]'s [[Solo Cello Sonata (Ligeti)|''Sonata'']], [[Elliot Carter|Carter]]'s two ''Figment''s and [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]' ''[[Nomos Alpha]]'' and ''Kottos''.

===Quartets and other ensembles===
The cello is a member of the traditional [[string quartet]] as well as string [[string quintets|quintets]], [[string sextet|sextet]] or [[string trio|trios]] and other mixed ensembles.
There are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a &quot;cello choir&quot; and its sound is familiar from the introduction to [[Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture]] as well as Zaccharias' prayer scene in [[Verdi]]'s [[Nabucco]]. As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is [[Villa-Lobos]]' first of his [[Bachianas Brasileiras]] for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s cello duets, quartet, and sextet, [[Pärt]]'s [[Fratres]] for 8 cellos and [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]' ''Messagesquisse'' for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played ''Fantasia Concertante'' (1958) for 32 cellos. The [[The 12 cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic|Twelve Cellists]] of the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] (or &quot;the Twelve&quot; as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.

===Popular music, jazz and neoclassical===
Though the cello is less common in [[popular music]] than in classical music, it is sometimes featured in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] recordings. The cello is rarely part of a group's standard lineup but like its cousin the [[violin]] it is becoming more common in mainstream pop (e.g. the [[baroque rock]] band [[Arcade Fire]] uses the cello in their songs).

In the 1960s, artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Cher]] used the cello in popular music, in songs such as &quot;[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]&quot;, &quot;[[Eleanor Rigby]]&quot; and &quot;[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]&quot;. Bass guitarist [[Jack Bruce]], who had  originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in &quot;As You Said&quot; on [[Cream]]'s [[Wheels of Fire]] studio album (1968). In the 1970s, the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called &quot;Beatlesque&quot; arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, [[Colosseum II]], collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording [[Variations (album)|Variations]]. Most notably, [[Pink Floyd]] included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental [[Atom Heart Mother]]. Bass guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their ''[[Foxtrot]]'' album.

Established non-traditional cello groups include [[Apocalyptica]], a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of [[Metallica]] songs, [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, [[Von Cello]], a cello fronted rock power trio, [[Break of Reality]] who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, and Jelloslave ([http://www.jelloslave.com]) a Minneapolis based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as [[cello rock]]. The crossover string quartet [[Bond (band)|bond]] also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Vivacello are Russian (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in Siberia. [[Cold Fairyland]] from Shanghai China is using a cello along a [[Pipa]] as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.

More recent bands using the cello are [[Aerosmith]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Murder by Death (band)|Murder by Death]], [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]], [[A Genuine Freakshow]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[James (band)|James]], and [[OneRepublic]]. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called &quot;chamber pop&quot; artists like [[Kronos Quartet]], The Vitamin String Quartet and [[Margot and the Nuclear So and So's]] have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band [[The Stiletto Formal]] are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band [[Canada (music group)|Canada]] employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, [[The Polyphonic Spree]], which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their &quot;psychedelic-esque&quot; melodies. The first wave [[screamo]] band [[I Would Set Myself On Fire For You]] featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented sound. The band, [[Panic! At the Disco]] uses a cello in their song, &quot;Build God, Then We'll Talk.&quot; The lead vocalist of the band, [[Brendon Urie]], also did the recording of the cello solo.

In [[jazz]], bassists [[Oscar Pettiford]] and [[Harry Babasin]] were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass.  [[Fred Katz]] (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique.  Contemporary jazz cellists include [[Abdul Wadud (musician)|Abdul Wadud]], [[Diedre Murray]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Dave Holland]], [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]], [[Lucio Amanti]], [[Akua Dixon]], [[Ernst Reijseger]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Tom Cora]], Vincent Courtois, Jean-Charles Capon, [[Erik Friedlander]], and James Hinkley of jazz combo ''Billet-Deux''.

Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's [[The Last Five Years]], Duncan Sheik's [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]], Adam Guettel's [[Floyd Collins (musical)|Floyd Collins]], and Ricky Ian Gordon's [[My Life with Albertine]] use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.

The cello can also be used in bluegrass and folk music, with notable players including [[Ben Sollee]] of the [[Sparrow Quartet]] and the &quot;Cajun cellist&quot; [[Sean Grissom]] as well as [[Damien Rice]]. [[Lindsay Mac]] is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of [[The Beatles]] [[Blackbird (song)|Blackbird]] a big hit on [[The Bob &amp; Tom Show]].

==Construction==
The cello is typically made from wood, although other materials such as [[carbon fibre]] or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of [[Plywood|laminated wood]].

The top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[F holes]] just below the middle.

The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as [[purfling]]. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but will spread no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.

===Alternative materials===
Cello manufacturer [[Luis and Clark|Luis &amp; Clark]] constructs cellos from [[carbon fibre]].  Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis &amp; Clark has produced over 600 such cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as [[Yo-Yo Ma]]&lt;ref&gt;stringed instrument. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 23, 2009, from The New York Times Online: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/arts/music/19carb.html (NY Times. Jan. 18, 2009 &quot;The Sound of Carbon for Yo-Yo Ma?&quot; by Chris Museler)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephine van Lier]].&lt;ref&gt;LUIS AND CLARK Carbon Fibre Cello: http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/Newsletter/Summer%202006/ASA%20Newsletter%20Summer%202006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins). An advertisement published in N.Y. Music Service catalogue (1930) reads: &quot;...made entirely of aluminum with the exception of the fingerboard. They have many advantages over the wood basses and violoncellos, as they cannot crack, split or warp and are made to last forever ... possessing a tone quality that is deep, resonant and responsive to the utmost degree. Violoncello $150.&quot; Only a handful of aluminum cellos exist today including a Pfretzschner played by modern classical cellist [[Frances-Marie Uitti]], another played by bluegrass cellist Stan Young.

===Neck, pegbox, and scroll===
Above the main body is the carved neck, which leads to a [[pegbox]] and the [[scroll (music)|scroll]]. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood. Attached to the neck and extending over the body of the instrument is the fingerboard. The [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] is a raised piece of wood, where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, which the strings rest on. The pegbox houses four [[tuning peg]]s, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The scroll is a traditional part of the cello and all other members of the [[violin family]]. [[Ebony]] is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hard woods, such as [[Buxus|boxwood]] or [[rosewood]], can be used.

===Strings===
[[String (music)|Strings]] on a cello have cores made out of [[Catgut|gut]] (sheep or goat), metal, or synthetic materials, such as [[nylon|Perlon]]. Most modern strings used today are also wound with metallic materials like aluminum, titanium and chromium. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning ([[scordatura]]) is used.

===Tailpiece and endpin===
The [[tailpiece]] and [[endpin]] are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of [[ebony]] or another hard wood, but can also be made of [[plastic]] or [[steel]]. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves. Around the 1830s, the Belgian cellist Auguste Adrien Servais introduced the endpin and propagated its use. Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word &quot;endpin&quot; sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called &quot;tailpin&quot;.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569200/stringed-instrument]) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor.

===Bridge and f-holes===
[[Image:Cello bridge2.JPG|right|thumb|The bridge of a cello, with a mute (the mute is not in use)]]
The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The [[sound-hole|f-hole]]s, named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a [[Dampit]], is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier.

===Internal features===
Internally, the cello has two important features: a [[bass bar]], which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden [[sound post]], which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to produce the instrument's sound.

===Glue===
Cellos are constructed and repaired using [[hide glue]], which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it will let go, avoiding a crack in the plate.

===Bow===
[[Image:Bow hand Violoncello.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A cello French bow held with the palm facing down,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;as opposed to the German bow popular in baroque era, held underhand [[:File:Lute-viol ABosse Fr 1635.jpg]] [[:File:Viol Abel TGainsborough1765.jpg]](''see'' [[Viol]]) used commonly today with the [[double bass]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cello#Sul_ponticello.2Fsul_tasto|''sul ponticello'']]]]
Traditionally, [[bow (music)|bows]] are made from pernambuco or [[brazilwood]]. Both come from the same species of tree (''Caesalpina echinata''), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, &lt;!--and high sound velocity--&gt;which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows.

Bows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, low-quality student bows). An average cello bow is 73&amp;nbsp;cm long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) 3&amp;nbsp;cm high (from the frog to the stick) and 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly 10&amp;nbsp;grams heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly 10&amp;nbsp;grams heavier than a violin bow. &lt;!-- for example, see http://www.codabow.com/info_buyfirstbow.html --&gt;

Bow hair is traditionally [[horsehair]], though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. [[Rosin]] is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically.

[[Baroque]] style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.

The cello bow, though not made conventionally for the use, has also been used to play [[guitar]]s. The [[post-rock]] [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] band [[Sigur Rós]]' lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow, as did Jimmy Page on tracks such as &quot;[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]&quot;.

==Physics==
===Physical Aspects===
When a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates, or moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not as much air is moved, and consequently the sound is weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. The design of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, Elizabeth. The Cello. New Edition. Charles Scribner’s Sons. 1975. ISBN 0684178702. pp 1 – 50&lt;/ref&gt;

A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244&quot;&gt;Bloomfield, Louis A. How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life. Second Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2001. ISBN 0471381519. pp 241-244&lt;/ref&gt; A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension in its strings using pegs in its neck and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece. 

A string’s length also affects its fundamental pitch. Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass. Since a stiffer string with a smaller mass vibrates faster, shortening a string increases the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello’s neck and effectively shortening it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244&quot;/&gt;

===Subjective Aspects===
[[File:Spectogram Cello D Arpeggio.png|thumb|225 px|Spectogram of a D chord arpeggiated on the cello. Yellow bands at the same level indicate the same harmonics excited by the bowing of different notes. Notes played from left to right: D F# A F# D.]] 
When a string is bowed or plucked to produce a note, the note is accompanied by other higher, resonant frequencies. You actually hear a superposition of these frequencies. The reason you can distinguish among the sources is that each sound has a unique combination of intensities of the various harmonics. One sound might be composed of a strong fundamental frequency and weaker higher harmonics, and another may have a particularly strong second harmonic. Each sound has a particular recipe of resonant frequencies that combine to make the total sound.&lt;ref&gt;Chattopadhyay, D. Elements of Physics, Volume 1. New Age International Publishers, 2004. ISBN 9788122415384. pp. 318, 319, 321&lt;/ref&gt;

For the cello, the main wood resonance generally appears very close to the note F#&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,  often with serious consequences. When the cellist plays the note F#&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the main wood resonance vibrates at its frequency as the cello sounds the frequency of the note F#&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A loud beating sound results between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “wolf tone” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator, or moving the sound post.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329&quot;&gt;Berg, Richard E. Stork, David G. The Physics of Sound. Third edition. Pearson Education, Inc. 2005. ISBN 0131457896. pp 314, 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmonics===
[[Image:Moodswingerscale.svg|thumb|175px|left|The modes of a vibrating cello string are harmonics.]]
A vibrating string subdivides itself into many parts vibrating at the same time. Each part produces a pitch of its own, called a partial. A vibrating string has one fundamental and a series of partials. The most pure combination of two pitches is when one is double the frequency of the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329&quot;/&gt;

For a repeating wave, the velocity, v, equals the wavelength, λ, times the frequency, f.
v = λf
On a cello string, waves reflect from both ends. The superposition of reflecting waves results in a standing wave pattern, but only for wavelengths λ = 2L, L, L/2, … = 2L/n, where L is the length of the string. Therefore the only frequencies produced on a single string are f = nv/(2L). Timbre is largely determined by the content of these harmonics. Different instruments have different harmonic content for the same pitch. A real string vibrates at harmonics that are not perfect multiples of the fundamental. This results in a little in-harmonicity, which gives richness to the tone and covers up slight de-tunings of different notes in a chord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.odu.edu/~hyde/Teaching/Phys332_Wk13.ppt Physics of the Piano by the Piano Tuners Guild]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing technique==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}

===Body position===
The cello is played while seated. Its weight is supported mainly by its [[endpin]] or spike, which rests on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Potter LA. The Art of Cello Playing. Alfred Music Publishing, 1996 ISBN 0874870712,  pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; The cello is steadied on the lower bout between the knees of the seated player, and on the upper bout against the upper chest. The neck of the cello is above the player's left shoulder, and the C-String tuning peg is just behind the left ear. The [[bow (music)|bow]] is drawn horizontally across the strings. In early times, female cellists sometimes played side-saddle, since it was considered improper for a lady to part her knees in public. A player's [[handedness]] does not alter the way the cello is held or used. In rare cases, a player has used a mirror-image posture&amp;mdash;usually because of a physical disability of the arm or hand that makes the required technique impossible for that side of the body. In such a situation, the player must decide whether or not to reverse the set-up of the cello (the string positions, bass-bar, sound post, fingerboard shape, and bridge carving are all asymmetrical).

===Left hand technique===
[[Image:Cello first position.svg|thumb|Cello first position [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] chart.]]

The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in  higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the ''neck'' positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in ''[[thumb position]]'' (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.

====Vibrato====
[[Vibrato]] is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. It is not created by an upper arm motion; rather, it is more of forearm motion. The fixed point of contact of the fingertip on the string absorbs this motion by rocking back and forth. This change in the attitude of the fingertip to the string varies the pitch. Since vibrato is usually considered a key expressive device, a well-developed vibrato technique is an essential element of a modern cellist's skill. In some styles of music, such as that of the [[Romantic Music|Romantic]] period, vibrato may be used on almost every note. However, in other styles, such as [[Baroque]] repertoire, vibrato is used only rarely, as an ornament. In any case, the choice of whether to use vibrato, and how much, is normally a stylistic decision on the part of the player. Typically, the lower the pitch of the note played, the wider and slower the vibrato.

====Harmonics====
[[Harmonics]] played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C. They usually appear with the touching note a perfect fourth above the [[stopped note]], which produces a sound two octaves above the stopped note, although other intervals are available. All harmonics produce a distinctive flute-like sound, and are usually performed without vibrato.

====Glissando====
[[Glissando]] (Italian for &quot;sliding&quot;) is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.

===Right hand technique===
In cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a [[wind instrument]] player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the [[fingerboard]] and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. The shape of the hand should resemble that of its relaxed state, with all fingers curved, including the thumb. The transmission of weight from the arm to the bow happens through the [[pronation]] (inward rotation) of the forearm, which pushes the index finger and to a lesser degree the middle finger onto the bow. The necessary counterforce is provided by the thumb. Depending upon the school of training, the other two fingers are used in various degrees to help maintain the angle of the bow to the string and are critical to controlling the bow when it is off the string. (See also [[spiccato]]).

In English, the terminology for bow direction (''up'' and ''down'') can be misleading. A downbow is drawn to the right of the player, and an upbow to the left. A downbow is drawn by first using the upper arm, then the forearm, then the wrist (turning slightly inward) to maintain a straight stroke. An upbow is drawn by moving first the forearm, then the upper arm, then the wrist (pushing slightly upward). The bow is mostly used perpendicular to the strings. To perform string changes the whole arm is either lowered or lifted, with as little wrist movement as possible to maintain the angle to the string. However, flexibility of the wrist is necessary when changing the bow direction from up-bow to down-bow and vice versa. For very fast bow movements, the wrist is used to accomplish the horizontal movement of the bow. For longer strokes, the arm is used as well as the wrist.

Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string. A good player will be capable of a very even tone, and will counter the natural tendency to play with the most force with the part of the bow nearest to the frog or heel, and the least force near the tip. The closer to the bridge the string is bowed, the more projecting and brighter the tone, with the extreme (''sul ponticello'') producing a metallic, shimmery sound. If bowing closer to the fingerboard (''sul tasto''), the sound produced will be softer, more mellow, and less defined.

====Double stops====
[[Image:Violoncello chord on C.png|thumb|right|Violoncello chord on C [[major chord|major]] {{audio|Violoncello chord on C.mid|Play}}.]]
[[Image:Violoncello chord on G.png|thumb|right|Violoncello chord on G {{audio|Violoncello chord on G.mid|Play}}.]]
[[Image:Violoncello chord on D.png|thumb|right|Violoncello chord on D [[minor chord|minor]] {{audio|Violoncello chord on D.mid|Play}}.]]
[[Double stop]]s involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. Triple and quadruple stops may also be played (in a &quot;broken&quot; fashion), but are difficult to sustain because of the change in slope of the bridge. To extend the technique in this area, [[Frances-Marie Uitti]] has invented a two-bow system: one bow plays above the strings and one below, allowing for sustained triple and quadruple stops. However, this technique is very rarely seen or used.

====Pizzicato====
In [[pizzicato]] playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Position of the hand is slightly over the finger board and away from the bridge. Usually this is done with the right hand, while the bow is held away from the strings by the rest of the hand or (for extended passages) set down. A single string can be played ''pizzicato,'' or double, triple, or quadruple stops can be played. Occasionally, a player must bow one string with the right hand and simultaneously pluck another with the left. This is marked by a &quot;+&quot; above the note. Strumming of chords is also possible, in guitar fashion.

====Col legno====
A player using the [[Col legno]] technique rubs the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair. There are two forms, ''col legno battuto'' and ''col legno tratto''. ''Col legno battuto'' is performed as a percussive technique with no sustaining of the sound. The much less common alternative is ''col legno tratto'', wherein the wood is drawn across the string as the hair is in a normal bow stroke. Some players refuse to use this technique because of potential damage to the bow.

====Spiccato====
{{listen
|filename=David Popper - Elfentanz (Hans Goldstein, cello).ogg
|title=Elfentanz
|description=A [[perpetuum mobile]] by [[David Popper]], consisting of continuous spiccato, performed by Hans Goldstein (cello) and Mellicia Straaf (piano)
|format=[[Ogg]]
}}
In [[spiccato]] playing, the strings are not &quot;drawn&quot; by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. It may be performed by using the wrist to &quot;dip&quot; the bow into the strings. Spiccato is usually associated with lively playing. On a violin, ''spiccato'' bowing comes off the string, but on a cello, the wood of the bow may rise briskly up without the hair actually leaving the string. While playing spiccato, the bow is literally bouncing off the string. Cello players simply &quot;dip&quot; the bow into the string, and touch it very fast, and then lift the bow off the string.

====Staccato====
In [[staccato]], the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence.

====Legato====
[[Legato]] is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks.

====Sul ponticello/sul tasto====
[[Image:Proper Bow Placement.JPG|thumb|Sul tasto]]
''Sul ponticello'' (&quot;on the bridge&quot;) refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while ''sul tasto'' (&quot;on the fingerboard&quot;) calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. (While reading music, &quot;tasto&quot; can also mean to play with the bow in normal postiton when having been playing &quot;ponticello&quot;) Ponticello calls for more bow weight and slower bow speed, and produces a &quot;harder&quot; sound, with strong overtone content. Sul tasto, in extreme cases called &quot;flautando,&quot; produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.

====Con/Senza sord.====
This refers to using a mute, or sordino, which is placed on the bridge to mellow or soften the tone, or to take it off.

==Sizes==
[[Image:Full size and fractional cello.jpg|thumb|1/8 size cello with full size cello]]
Standard-sized cellos are referred to as &quot;full-size&quot;. However, cellos come in smaller (fractional) sizes, from &quot;7/8&quot; and &quot;3/4&quot; down to &quot;1/16&quot; sized cellos (e.g. 7/8, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, 1/16). The smaller-sized cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply 'scaled-down' for the benefit of children and shorter adults. A &quot;half-size&quot; cello is not actually half the size of a &quot;full-size&quot;, but only slightly smaller (i.e., roughly half-size by [[volume]], not by [[length]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Many smaller cellists prefer to play a &quot;7/8&quot; cello as the hand stretches in the lower positions are less demanding. Although rare, cellos in sizes larger than 4/4 do exist. Cellists with unusually large hands may play a slightly larger than full-sized cello. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly played today.

Around 1680, string-making technology made lower pitches on shorter strings possible. The cellos of [[Stradivari]], for example, can be clearly divided into two models, the style made before 1702 characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1702, when Stradivari, presumably in response to the &quot;new&quot; strings, began making smaller cellos. This later model is the one most commonly used by modern luthiers.

==Accessories==
There are many accessories for the cello.
*Cases are used to protect the cello and bow (or multiple bows) when traveling and for safe storage. They are often made of carbon fiber, fiber-glass, and less commonly wood.
*[[Rosin]], made from [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[resin]], is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction, grip or bite, and allow proper sound production.  Rosin may have additives to modify the friction such as beeswax, gold, silver or tin.  Commonly, rosins are classified as either Dark or Light. Dark rosins increase the friction more than Light rosins.
*[[Endpin]] stops or straps (tradenames include Rockstop and Black Hole) keep the cello from sliding if the end pin does not have a rubber piece on the end (used on wood floors) though in many cases a rubber piece will not suffice on even a wood floor. Many Cellists often use a square or rectangle of carpet that can be secured under the front two legs of the chair as an endpin stop. This is however less likely to be seen in a professional arena and more used in rehearsal or in private.

*[[Wolf tone eliminator]]s are often placed on cello strings between the tailpiece and the bridge to eliminate acoustic anomalies known as [[wolf tone]]s or &quot;wolfs&quot;.
*[[Mute (music)#String|Mutes]] are used to change the sound of the cello by reducing [[overtones]]. Practice mutes (made of metal) significantly reduce the instrument's volume (they are also referred to as &quot;hotel mutes&quot;). The most common mute is a rubber disc with two holes to fit the two middle strings. It sits just after the bridge and has a flap that can be placed over the top of the bridge to mute the vibrations travelling down it to the sound post inside the cello. These are especially used due to their simplicity and can be taken off or put on very quickly because they can be stored on the strings past the bridge.
*[[Metronome]]s provide a steady [[tempo]] by sounding out a certain number of beats per minute. They are adjustable to fit the tempo of the piece. Many models can also produce a [[Musical tuning|tuning]] pitch of A4 (440&amp;nbsp;Hz), among others. These can, of course, be used for all instruments.
*[[Humidifier]]s are used to control and stabilize the humidity around and inside the cello and are popular with traveling cellists. Often, these are placed inside the cello itself or inside the case. Some players will not use humidifiers inside their cellos because they have the potential to drip, which may cause damage to the cello.
*[[Electronic tuner]]s are sometimes used to [[Musical tuning|tune]] the instrument. A tuner indicates if a played note is sharp or flat.

==Instrument makers==
{{Main|Luthier}}
Cellos are made by [[luthier]]s, specialists in building and repairing stringed instruments, ranging from guitars to violins. The following luthiers are notable for the cellos they have produced:
*[[Nicolò Amati]] and others in the Amati family
*[[William Forster (English luthier)|William Forster]]
*[[Nicolò Gagliano]]
*[[Matteo Goffriller]]
*[[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini]]
*[[Giuseppe Guarneri]]
*[[Domenico Montagnana]]
*[[Giovanni Battista Rogeri]]
*[[Francesco Ruggieri]]
*[[Stefano Scarampella]]
*[[Antonio Stradivari]]
*[[David Tecchler]]
*[[Carlo Giuseppe Testore]]
*[[Jean Baptiste Vuillaume]]

==Cellists==
{{Main|List of cellists}}
A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist''. For a list of notable cellists, see the [[list of cellists]] and [[:Category:Cellists]].

==Famous cellos==
{{See also|Category:Individual cellos}}

Specific instruments are, or become, famous, for a variety of reasons.   An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers.  The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things.  The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians.  These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which loans the instrument to a performer.  (For example, the [[Davidov Stradivarius]], which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely known living cellists, [[Yo-Yo Ma]], is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Beare | first=Charles | coauthors=Carlson, Bruce | chapter=Foreword by Yo-Yo Ma  | title=Antonio Stradivari: The Cremona Exhibition of 1987| location=London | publisher=J. &amp; A.

A '''control store''' is the part of a [[Central processing unit|CPU's]] [[control unit]] that stores the CPU's [[microprogram]].  It is usually accessed by a [[microsequencer]].

A control store is usually implemented as a [[diode]]-array of [[read-only memory]]. This tradition dates back to the ''program timing matrix'' on the [[MIT Whirlwind]], first described in 1947. Modern [[VLSI]] CPUs also use a [[diode matrix]] for the read-only control store{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. The original [[System/360]] models of [[IBM mainframe]] had read-only control store, but later [[System/370]] and successor models loaded their microprograms from floppy disks into a '''writeable control store''' consisting of ultra-high speed [[random-access memory|random-access]] [[read-write memory]].  This permitted IBM to easily repair microprogramming defects in the field. Even when the majority of the control store is stored in ROM of some sort, computer vendors often sell writeable control store as an option, allowing the customers to customize the machine's microprogram.

The control store usually has a register on its outputs. The outputs that go back into the sequencer to determine the next address have to go through some sort of register to prevent the creation of a race condition. In most designs all of the other bits also go through a register. This is because the machine will work faster if the execution of the next microinstruction is delayed by one cycle. This register is known as a pipeline register. Very often the execution of the next microinstruction is dependent on the result of the current microinstruction, which will not be stable until the end of the current microcycle. It can be seen that either way, all of the outputs of the control store go into one big register. Historically it used to be possible to buy EPROMs with these register bits on the same chip.

The clock signal determining the cycle time of the system primarily clocks this register.

He was one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flood&quot;/&gt;

==Early life in Ireland==
Columba was born to Fedlimid and Eithne of the [[Cenel Conaill]] in [[Gartan]], near Lough Gartan, in modern [[County Donegal]], part of the Province of [[Ulster]] in the north of [[Ireland]]. On his father's side he was great-great-grandson of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]], an [[High King of Ireland|Irish high king]] of the 5th century. He was baptised in Temple-Douglas, in the County Donegal parish of Conwal (mid-way between Gartan and [[Letterkenny]]), by his teacher and foster-uncle [[Saint Crunathan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colton&quot;&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/catholic-church-archdiocese-of-armagh-northern-i/acts-of-archbishop-colton-in-his-metropolitan-visitation-in-the-diocese-of-derry-hta/page-10-acts-of-archbishop-colton-in-his-metropolitan-visitation-in-the-diocese-of-derry-hta.shtml Acts of Archbishop Colton in his metropolitan visitation in the diocese of Derry, A.D.

In [[early Christian Ireland]] the [[druid]]ic tradition collapsed due to the spread of the new Christian faith. The study of [[Latin]] learning and Christian theology in [[Monastery|monasteries]] flourished. Columba became a pupil at the monastic school at [[Clonard Abbey]], situated on the [[River Boyne]] in modern [[County Meath]]. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000.&lt;ref name =&quot;Flood&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|first=W.H. |last=Gratton-Flood|title=The Twelve Apostles of Erin|id=01632a|accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve students who studied under [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finian]] became known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]. Columba was one of these. He became a monk and was ordained as a priest. During this time he is said to have founded a number of monasteries, including ones at [[Abbey of Kells|Kells]], [[Bishop of Derry|Derry]], and [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]].&lt;ref name=Sidwell_70&gt;{{Citation |last= Sidwell|first=Keith|title= Reading Medieval Latin|pages=70|year= 1995|city=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-52144747-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Tradition asserts that, sometime around 560, he became involved in a quarrel with Saint Finian of [[Movilla Abbey]] over a [[psalter]]. Columba copied the manuscript at the [[scriptorium]] under Saint Finian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finian disputed his right to keep the copy. The dispute eventually led to the pitched Battle of Cúl Dreimhne in 561, during which many men were killed. A synod of clerics and scholars threatened to excommunicate him for these deaths, but St. [[Brendan of Birr]] spoke on his behalf with the result that he was allowed to go into exile instead. Columba suggested that he would work as a missionary in [[Scotland]] to help convert as many people as had been killed in the battle. He [[exile]]d himself from Ireland, to return only once again, several years later.

Columba's copy of the psalter has been traditionally associated with the [[Cathach of St. Columba]].

==Scotland==
In 563 he travelled to [[Scotland]] with twelve companions, where according to his legend he first landed at the southern tip of the [[Kintyre]] peninsula, near [[Southend, Kintyre|Southend]]. However, being still in sight of his native land he moved further north up the west coast of Scotland. In 563 he was granted land on the island of [[Iona]] off the west coast of Scotland which became the centre of his [[evangelism|evangelising]] mission to the [[Picts]].  However, there is a sense in which he was not leaving his native people, as the [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Gaels]] had been colonizing the west coast of Scotland for the previous couple of centuries.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_23&gt;{{Citation |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=23–24|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the services he provided guiding the only centre of [[literacy]] in the region, his reputation as a holy man led to his role as a [[diplomat]] among the tribes;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stcolumbaretreathouse.com/saint_columba.htm &quot;Who is St. Columba?&quot;] St. Columba Retreat House. Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there are also many stories of miracles which he performed during his work to [[convert]] the Picts. He visited the [[Paganism|pagan]] king [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]], king of [[Fortriu]], at his base in [[Inverness]], winning the king's respect, although not his conversion.  He subsequently played a major role in the politics of the country.  He was also very energetic in his evangelical work, and, in addition to founding several churches in the [[Hebrides]], he worked to turn his monastery at Iona into a school for missionaries.  He was a renowned man of letters, having written several [[hymns]] and being credited with having [[Calligraphy|transcribe]]d 300 books.  One of the few, if not the only, times he left Scotland after his arrival was toward the end of his life, when he returned to Ireland to found the [[Durrow Abbey|monastery]] at [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]]. 

Columba died on Iona and was buried by his monks in the abbey he created. He was later disinterred and is reputed to be buried in [[Downpatrick]], [[County Down]], with [[St. Patrick]] and [[St. Brigid]] or at Saul Church neighbouring Downpatrick.  

Several islands are named after Columba in Scotland, including Ì Chaluim Chille (one of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] names of Iona), [[Inchcolm]] and [[Eilean Chaluim Chille]].

==Lasting legacy==
[[Image:Stcolumbaduncanunknowndate.jpg|thumb|left|''St. Columba Bidding Farewell to the White Horse'' by [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866-1945)]]

Columba is credited as being a leading figure in the revitalization of [[monasticism]], and &quot;His achievements illustrated the importance of the [[Celtic church]] in bringing a revival of Christianity to Western Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire.&quot; {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} It is said Clan Robertson are heirs of Columba.  Clan MacKinnon may also have some claim to being descendant of St Columcille as after he founded his Church on Isle Iona, The MacKinnons were the abbotts to the Church for centuries.  This would also account for the fact that Clan MacKinnon is among the ancient clans of Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eerdman's&quot;&gt;{{Citation |editor=Dowley, Tim, et al.| title=Eerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity |year=1977|publisher= [[Eerdmans Publishing]] |location= Grand Rapids, Michigan|language= |isbn= 0-8028-3450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parish (Catholic Church)|Parish]] of [[Boston College#Saint Columbkille's|Saint Columbkille]] serves the neighborhood of [[Brighton, MA]] with a church and [[grammar school]].  The current church was built to be the [[Cathedral]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston]] since it is in the same neighborhood as the former Cardinal's residence, but does not serve in this function.  [[Papillion, Nebraska]] also has a church and grammar school named after Saint Columbkille.  [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]], a small [[Catholic]] [[liberal arts]] [[college]] in [[New Rochelle, NY]] is named after the island of Iona off the coast of [[Scotland]] on which, St. Columba founded his church.

Today, [[Aer Lingus]], Ireland's national [[flag carrier]] has named one of its [[Airbus A330]] aircraft in commemoration of the saint (reg: EI-DUO).

Saint Columba is the patron saint of the city of [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]].  The saint founded a monastic settlement there in c. AD 540. The name of the city in Irish is Doire Colmcille and is derived from the native oak trees in the area and the city's association with the great saint. Today, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Columba's Long Tower stands at the spot of this original settlement. There is also a Church of Ireland Cathedral dedicated to St Columba in Derry.

The Munich [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] is named [[Muenchen]] Colmcilles:  [http://www.munichgaa.de/].

The village of [[Kilmacolm]] in [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]] is named after the saint.

[http://www.stcolmcilles.org/ St. Colmcilles Primary School] and [http://www.stcolmcilles.ie/ St. Colmcilles Community School] are two schools in [[Knocklyon]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] named after St. Colmcille, with the former having an annual day dedicated to the saint on June 9.

==''Vita Columbae''==
[[Image:Saint Columba.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Columba in [[stained glass]]]]
The main source of information about Columba's life is the ''Vita Columbae'' by [[Adomnán]] (also known as Eunan), the ninth Abbot of [[Iona]], who died in 704. Both the ''Vita Columbae'' and [[Bede]] record Columba's visit to [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]]. Whereas Adomnán just tells us that Columba visited Bridei, Bede relates a later, perhaps Pictish tradition, whereby the saint actually converts the Pictish king. Another early source is a poem in praise of Columba, most probably commissioned by Columba's kinsman, the king of the [[Uí Néill]] clan. It was almost certainly written within three or four years of Columba's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history. It consists of 25 [[stanza]]s of four verses of seven syllables each.  

The vita of Columba contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. According to Adomnán, Columba came across a group of Picts who were burying a man&lt;ref&gt;''misellum ... homunculum'' ([http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/L201040/text063.html ''Vita Columbae'']): &quot;a poor little fellow&quot; (P. Jones and K. Sidwell, ''An independent study guide to reading Latin'' (2000), p. 197). Otherwise: &quot;an unfortunate man&quot; (''Life of Saint Columba, Founder of Hy. Written by Adamnan, Ninth Abbot of that Monastery'', ed. William Reeves, 1874 ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/columba-e.html Medieval Sourcebook])); &quot;a poor fellow&quot; (K. Sidwell, ''Reading medieval Latin'' (1995), pp. 89-90); referred to as &quot;a man&quot; (D. Alexander, ''Saints and animals in the Middle Ages'' (2008), p. 64; B. Lehane, ''Early Celtic Christianity'' (1994), p. 128). Not &quot;a dwarf&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been killed by the monster, and saved a swimmer with the [[sign of the Cross]] and the imprecation &quot;You will go no further,&quot; at which the beast fled terrified, to the amazement of the assembled Picts who glorified Columba's God. Whether or not this incident is true, Adomnan's text specifically states that the monster was swimming in the [[River Ness]] - the river flowing from the loch - rather than in [[Loch Ness]] itself.

Through the reputation of its venerable founder and its position as a major European centre of learning, Columba's Iona became a place of [[pilgrimage]]. A network of Celtic [[high cross]]es marking processional routes developed around his shrine at Iona.  

Columba is historically revered as a warrior saint, and was often invoked for victory in battle.
His relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between Alba and Ireland. Relics of Columba were carried before Scottish armies in the reliquary made at Iona in the mid-8th century, called the Brecbennoch.
Legend has it that the Brecbennoch, was carried to [[Bannockburn]] by the vastly outnumbered Scots army and the intercession of the Saint helped them to victory. It is widely thought that the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] is this object.
 
''O Columba spes Scotorum...'' &quot;O Columba, hope of the Scots&quot; begins a 13th century prayer in the [[Antiphoner]] of Inchcolm, the &quot;Iona of the East.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''conditional proof''' is a [[mathematical proof|proof]] that takes the form of asserting a [[Material conditional|conditional]], and proving that the  [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of the conditional necessarily leads to the [[consequent]]. 

The assumed antecedent of a conditional proof is called the ''conditional proof assumption'' (CPA).  Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion necessarily follows.  Note that the validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA is actually true, only that ''if it is true'' it leads to the consequent.

Conditional proofs are of great importance in [[mathematics]]. Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven [[conjecture]]s, so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a proposition's truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.

A famous network of conditional proofs is the [[NP-complete]] class of complexity theory.  There are a [[List of NP-complete problems|large number]] of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them.

Likewise, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] has a large number of consequences already proven.

== Symbolic logic ==

As an example of a conditional proof in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], suppose we want to prove A → C (if A, then C) from the first two premises below:

{|
|-
|align=right| 1. || A → B&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (&quot;If A, then B&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 2. || B → C || (&quot;If B, then C&quot;)
|-
|colspan=3| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
|align=right| 3. || A ||(conditional proof assumption, &quot;Suppose A is true&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 4. || B || (follows from lines 1 and 3, [[modus ponens]]; &quot;If A then B; A, therefore B&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 5. || C || (follows from lines 2 and 4, [[modus ponens]]; &quot;If B then C; B, therefore C&quot;)
|-
|align=right| 6. || A → C || (follows from lines 3–5, conditional proof; &quot;If A, then C&quot;)
|}

'''Conjunction introduction''' is the [[inference]] that, if ''p'' is true, and ''q'' is true, then the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] ''p and q'' is true.

For example, if it's true that it's raining, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that it's raining, and I'm inside.

Formally:

:&lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{q\,\!\qquad\quad}{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;( p \wedge q )&lt;/math&gt;

The use of the [[English language]] in most [[List of members of the Commonwealth of Nations|member countries]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was inherited from [[British Empire|British colonisation]]. English is spoken as a first or second language in most of the Commonwealth. In a few countries, such as [[Cyprus]] and [[Malaysia]], it does not have [[official language|official status]], but is widely used as a [[lingua franca]]. [[Mozambique]] is an exception - although English is widely spoken there, it is a former Portuguese colony which joined the Commonwealth in 1996.

Many regions, notably [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Caribbean]], have developed their own native varieties of the language. 

Written English as used in the Commonwealth generally favours [[American and British English spelling differences|British as opposed to American spelling]], with Canada having a mix of both. 

The report of the Inter-Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership states that English is a symbol of Commonwealth heritage and unity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Native varieties ==
[[Southern Hemisphere]] native varieties of English began to develop during the 18th century, with the colonisation of Australasia and South Africa.  [[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] are closely related to each other, and share some similarities with [[South African English]].  The vocabularies of these dialects draw from both [[British English|British]] and [[American English]] as well as numerous native peculiarities.

[[Canadian English]] is a variety of [[North American English]].  It shares the same roots as the English of the United States because it is based on the immigration of [[British Loyalist]]s fleeing the [[American Revolution]] in the late eighteenth century.  It is also influenced by Scottish, Irish and English immigration after the [[War of 1812]].  While the language has continued to change in all of these places, modern Canadian has inherited significant vocabulary and spelling from the shared political and social institutions of Commonwealth countries.

=== The Caribbean ===
[[Caribbean English]] is influenced by the English-based [[Creole language|Creole]] varieties spoken, but they are not one and the same.  There is a great deal of variation in the way English is spoken, with a &quot;Standard English&quot; at the top of the social scale and creoles at the bottom.  These dialects have roots in 17th-century English and [[African language]]s; unlike most native varieties of English, West Indian dialects often tend to be syllable-timed rather than [[Timing (linguistics)|stress-timed]].

== Non-native varieties ==

Second language varieties of English in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] have often undergone &quot;indigenisation&quot;; that is, each English-speaking community has developed (or is in the process of developing) its own standards of usage, often under the influence of local languages.  These dialects are sometimes referred to as ''New Englishes'' (McArthur, p.&amp;nbsp;36); most of them inherited [[non-rhotic]]ity from Southern British English.

=== Africa ===
Several dialects of [[West African English]] exist, with a lot of regional variation and some influence from indigenous language.  West African English tends to be syllable-timed, and its phoneme inventory is much simpler than that of [[Received Pronunciation]]; this sometimes affects mutual intelligibility with native varieties of English.  A distinctive [[East African English]] is spoken in countries such as [[Kenya]] or [[Tanzania]].

Small communities of native English speakers can be found in [[Kenya]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]]; the dialects spoken are similar to [[South African English]].

=== Asia ===
[[India]] has the world's largest English-speaking population, although most speakers of [[Indian English]] are not native speakers.  Indian English phonology is highly variable; stress, rhythm and intonation are generally different from those of native varieties.  There are also several peculiarities at the levels of morphology, syntax and usage, some of which can also be found among educated speakers.

[[Southeast Asian English]] comprises [[Singapore English]] and [[Malaysian English]]; it features some influence from [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

[[Hong Kong]] ceased to be part of the Commonwealth in [[1997]]. Nonetheless, the English language still enjoys the status as an official language, alongside the [[Chinese language]].

'''Charles McCarry''' (born 1930 [[Massachusetts]], USA) is an American writer primarily of [[spy fiction]].

==Life==
McCarry served in the [[United States Army]], where he was a correspondent for ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', has been a small-town newspaperman, and was a speechwriter in the [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. From 1958 to 1967 he worked for the [[CIA]], under deep cover in Europe, Asia, and Africa. However, his cover was not as a writer or journalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;morning news&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/personalities/birnbaum_v_charles_mccarry.php |title=Birnbaum v. Charles McCarry by Robert Birnbaum |publisher=The Morning News |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married with four grown sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;morning news&quot; /&gt; His family is from [[The Berkshires]] area of western [[Massachusetts]], where he currently lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;morning news&quot; /&gt;

He is an admirer of the work of [[W. Somerset Maugham]], especially the [[Ashenden]] stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;morning news&quot; /&gt; He was also an admirer of [[Richard Condon]], author of [[The Manchurian Candidate]], [[Prizzi's Honor]] and numerous other novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;morning news&quot; /&gt;

McCarry was editor-at-large for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' and has contributed pieces to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and other national publications.

His novels are currently being reprinted by Overlook Press, starting with ''Tears of Autumn'', republished in 2005.  [[Charles N. Brown]], the publisher of [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]], which primarily addresses the science-fiction publishing world, wrote in the July 2006 issue: &quot;Two Charles McCarry hardcover reprints from Overlook... aren't really SF or fantasy, but they are two of the best spy thrillers ever written and form a secret or alternate history of the 20th century.&quot;&lt;ref name=locusmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/index/yr2006/b31.htm#A1096 |title=Locus Magazine 2006 index |publisher=Locusmag.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

McCarry is best known for a series of books concerning the life of super spy Paul Christopher.  Born in Germany before WWII of a German mother and an American father, Christopher joins the CIA after the war and becomes one of its most effective spies.  After launching an unauthorized investigation of the Kennedy assassination, Christopher becomes a pariah to the agency and a hunted man.  Eventually he spends ten years in a Chinese prison before being released and embarking on a solution to the mystery that has haunted him his entire life: the fate of his mother who disappeared at the beginning of WWII.  The books are notable for their historical detail and depiction of spycraft, as well as their careful and extensive examination of Christopher's relationship with his family, friends, wives, and lovers.

Also notable are two books dealing with Paul Christopher's American cousins, Horace and Julian Hubbard: ''The Better Angels'' and ''Shelley's Heart''.  These novels tell the story of a U.S. President who approves the assassination of the leader of an oil-rich Arab nation who has acquired nuclear arms and intends to pass them onto a terrorist organization.  When news of this threatens to ruin the President's chances for re-election, the Hubbards conspire to steal the election.  In ''Shelley's Heart'', the conspiracy is revealed and the newly re-elected President is impeached and placed on trial in the Senate.  Both books indicate an extensive knowledge of Washington politics on the part of the author.

McCarry's most unusual book in the series, also concerning the Christopher family, is ''Bride of the Wilderness''.  Set in the 17th century, it's a historical romance concerning one of Paul Christopher's ancestors, the English-born Fanny Harding.  After the death of her father, she travels to America and is abducted by Indians during the French-Indian Wars and eventually marries one of her captors, a French officer named Philippe de Saint-Christophe (or Christopher).

The film ''[[Wrong is Right]]'' (1982) starring [[Sean Connery]] was loosely based on his novel, ''The Better Angels''.

The '''Cimbri''' were a tribe from Northern Europe, who, together with the [[Teutones]] and the [[Ambrones]] threatened the [[Roman Republic]] in the late 2nd century BC. The Cimbri were probably [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], though some believe them to be of Celtic origin.  The ancient sources located their original home in [[Jutland]], in present-day [[Denmark]], which was referred to as the Cimbrian peninsula throughout antiquity (Greek: {{Polytonic|Κιμβρικὴ Χερσόνησος}} / ''Kimbrikē Chersonēsos'').&lt;ref&gt;References to modern discussions in W. Pohl, ''Die Germanen'', 2000, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homeland and name ==
Archaeologists have not found any clear indications of a mass migration from [[Jutland]] in the early [[Iron Age]]. The [[Gundestrup Cauldron]], which was deposited in a bog in [[Himmerland]] in the 2nd or 1st century BC, shows that there was some sort of contact with southeastern Europe, but it is uncertain if this contact can be associated with the Cimbrian expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Kaul, F. &amp; Martens, J. &quot;Southeast European Influences in the Early Iron Age of Southern Scandinavia. Gundestrup and the Cimbri&quot;, ''[[Acta Archaeologica]]'' 66 (1995) 111-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for a northern homeland point to Greek and Roman sources that associate the Cimbri with the peninsula of [[Jutland]], Denmark. According to the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res gestae]]'' (ch. 26) of [[Augustus]], the Cimbri were still found in the area around the turn of the First Century AD:

{{quote|My fleet sailed from the mouth of the Rhine eastward as far as the lands of the Cimbri, to which, up to that time, no Roman had ever penetrated either by land or by sea, and the Cimbri and [[Charudes|Charydes]] and [[Semnones]] and other peoples of the Germans of that same region through their envoys sought my friendship and that of the Roman people.}}

The contemporary Greek geographer [[Strabo]] testifies that the Cimbri still existed as a Germanic tribe, presumably in the &quot;Cimbric peninsula&quot; (since they are said to live by the North Sea and to have paid tribute to Augustus):

{{quote|As for the Cimbri, some things that are told about them are incorrect and others are extremely improbable. For instance, one could not accept such a reason for their having become a wandering and piratical folk as this that while they were dwelling on a Peninsula they were driven out of their habitations by a great flood-tide; for in fact they still hold the country which they held in earlier times; and they sent as a present to Augustus the most sacred kettle in their country, with a plea for his friendship and for an amnesty of their earlier offences, and when their petition was granted they set sail for home; and it is ridiculous to suppose that they departed from their homes because they were incensed on account of a phenomenon that is natural and eternal, occurring twice every day. And the assertion that an excessive flood-tide once occurred looks like a fabrication, for when the ocean is affected in this way it is subject to increases and diminutions, but these are regulated and periodical.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geogr.'' 7.2.1, trans. H.L. Jones; as a geologist, Strabo reveals himself as a [[Gradualism|gradualist]]; in 1998, however, the archaeologist B.J. Coles identified as &quot;[[Doggerland]]&quot; the now-drowned habitable and huntable lands in the coastal plain that had formed in the [[North Sea]] when sea level dropped, and that was re-flooded following the withdrawal of the ice sheets.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the map of [[Claudius Ptolemaeus|Ptolemy]], the &quot;Kimbroi&quot; are placed on the northernmost part of the peninsula of Jutland.,&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, ''Geography'' 2.11.7: {{Polytonic|πάντων δ᾽ ἀρκτικώτεροι Κίμβροι}} &quot;the Cimbri are more northern than all (of these tribes)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. in the modern landscape of [[Himmerland]] south of [[Limfjorden]] (since [[Vendsyssel-Thy]] north of the fjord was at that time a group of islands). ''Himmerland'' (Old Danish ''Himbersysel'') is generally thought to preserve their name,&lt;ref&gt;Jan Katlev, ''Politikens etymologisk ordbog'', Copenhagen 2000:294; Kenneth W. Harl, ''Rome and the Barbarians'', The Teaching Company, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in an older form without [[Grimm's law]] ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''k'' &gt; [[Germanic Languages|Germ.]] ''h''). Alternatively, Latin ''C-'' represents an attempt to render the unfamiliar Proto-Germanic ''h'' = {{IPA|[χ]}}, perhaps due to Celtic-speaking interpreters (a Celtic intermediary would also explain why Germanic *''Þeuðanōz'' became Latin ''Teutones'').

The origin of the name ''Cimbri'' is unknown. One etymology&lt;ref&gt;Vasmer, ''Russisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', 1958, vol. 3, p. 62; Z. Gołąb, &quot;About the connection between kinship terms and some ethnica in Slavic&quot;, ''International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics'' 25-26 (1982) 166-7.&lt;/ref&gt; is PIE ''{{PIE|*tḱim-ro-}}'' &quot;inhabitant&quot;, from ''{{PIE|tḱoi-m-}}'' &quot;home&quot; (&gt; Eng. ''home''), itself a derivation from ''{{PIE|tḱei-}}'' &quot;live&quot; (&gt; Greek {{Polytonic|κτίζω}}, Latin ''sinō''); then, the Germanic *''χimbra-'' finds an exact cognate in Slavic ''sębrъ'' &quot;farmer&quot; (&gt; Croatian, Serbian ''sebar'', Russ. ''sjabër'').

Because of the similarity of the names, the Cimbri were at times associated with [[Cymry]], the Welsh name for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;C. Rawlinson, &quot;On the Ethnography of the Cimbri&quot;, ''Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' 6 (1877) 150-158.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this word is generally derived from Celtic *''Kombroges'', meaning ''compatriots'',&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Onions and R.W. Burchfield,  eds. ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', 1966, ''s.v.'' ''Cymry''; ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary''. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 2002: 321&lt;/ref&gt; and it is hardly conceivable that the Romans would have recorded such a form as ''Cimbri''.&lt;ref&gt;The form ''Cambria'' is Neo-Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; The name has also been related to the word ''kimme'' meaning &quot;rim&quot;, i.e. the people of the coast,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbe/0183.html ''Nordisk familjebok''], Projekt Runeborg&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, since Antiquity, the name has been related to that of the [[Cimmerians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Posidonius]] in Strabo, ''Geography'' 7.2.2; [[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibl.'' 5.32.4; [[Plutarch]], ''Vit.Mar.'' 11.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language of the Cimbri ==
A major problem in determining whether the Cimbri were speaking a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] or a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] is that at this time the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups to the north of their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar seems to be one of the first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he has a political motive for doing so (it is an argument in favour of the Rhine border).&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Lund, ''Die ersten Germanen: Ethnizität und Ethnogenese'', Heidelberg 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, one cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear distinctions between the two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe,&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' 1.33.3-4; [[Strabo]], ''Geographica'' 4.4.3, 7.1.3; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 4.100; [[Tacitus]], ''Germania'' 37, ''History'' 4.73.&lt;/ref&gt; but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian of Alexandria|Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' 1.4.29, ''Illyrica'' 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few direct testimonies to the language of the Cimbri: Referring to the Northern Ocean (the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or the [[North Sea]]), [[Pliny the Elder]] states:&lt;ref&gt;''Naturalis Historia'', 4.95: ''Philemon Morimarusam a Cimbris vocari, hoc est mortuum mare, inde usque ad promunturium Rusbeas, ultra deinde Cronium''.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Philemon says that it is called Morimarusa, i.e. the Dead Sea, by the Cimbri, until the promontory of Rubea, and after that Cronium.&quot; The words for &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; were mori and *maruo- in Gaulish (''muir'' and ''marbh'' in [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] and ''môr'' and ''marw'' in [[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]]).&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Ahl, &quot;Amber, Avallon, and Apollo's Singing Swan&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' 103 (1982) 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The same word for &quot;sea&quot; is also known from Germanic, but with an ''a'' (*''mari-''), whereas a cognate of ''marbh'' is unknown in all dialects of Germanic.&lt;ref&gt;Germanic has *''murþ(r)a'' &quot;murder&quot; (with the verb *''murþ(r)jan''), but uses *''daujan'' and *''dauða-'' for &quot;die&quot; and &quot;dead&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, given that Pliny had not heard the word directly from a Cimbric informant, it cannot be ruled out that the word is in fact Gaulish instead.&lt;ref&gt;Accordingly, Pokorny, ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', 1959, p. 735, describes the word as &quot;Gaulish?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The known Cimbri chiefs have names that look Celtic, including [[Boiorix]] (which may mean &quot;King of the Boii&quot; or, more literally, &quot;King of Strikers&quot;), Gaesorix (which means &quot;Spear King&quot;), and Lugius (which may be named after the Celtic god [[Lugus]]), although this may not mean that they are Celtic as the elements could work in Germanic.&lt;ref name=RIVES&gt;{{cite book
 Rives, J.B. (Trans.) (1999). ''Germania: Germania''. [[Oxford University Press]] ISBN 0198150504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, although the kings of the Cimbri and Teutones carry what look like Celtic names, the origin of a name need not say anything about the ethnicity or language of the individual carrying the name. Other evidence to the language of the Cimbri is circumstantial: thus, we are told that the Romans enlisted Gaulish Celts to act as spies in the Cimbri camp prior to the final showdown with the Roman army in 101 BC. Some take this as evidence in support of &quot;the Celtic rather than the German theory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, in ''Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' ''6'' (1877) 156.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jean Markale&lt;ref&gt;Markale, ''Celtic Civilization'' 1976:40.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that the Cimbri were associated with the [[Helvetii]], and more especially with the indisputably Celtic [[Tigurini]]. These associations may link to a common ancestry, recalled from two hundred years previous, though they may not. [[Henri Hubert]]&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, ''The Greatness and Decline of the Celts''1934 Ch. IV, I.&lt;/ref&gt; states &lt;!--a direct quote?--&gt;&quot;All these names are Celtic, and they cannot be anything else&quot;. Some authors take a different perspective.&lt;ref name=celtshistory&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ó hÓgáin |first=Dáithí |authorlink= |title=The Celts: A History |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2003 |location= |page=131 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-yd1huHoXJwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=1-085115-923-0 9780851159232}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Peter S. Wells&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1995) p. 606{{Verify credibility|date=December 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Cimbri &quot;are certainly not Celts&quot;.

Countering the argument of a Celtic origin is the literary evidence that the Cimbri originally came from northern [[Jutland]],&lt;ref name=celtshistory&gt;

. Boiorix, who may have a Celtic name if not a Celticized Germanic name, was king of the Cimbri after they moved away for their ancestral home of northern Jutland; Boiorix and his tribe lived around Celtic peoples during his era as [[J. B. Rives]] points out in his introduction to Tacitus's [[Germania (book)]] and moreover that the name Boiorix can work in Proto-Germanic as well as Celtic.&lt;ref name=RIVES/&gt;

===Moving south-east===
Some time before 100 BC many of the Cimbri, as well as the [[Teutons|Teutones]] and [[Ambrones]] migrated south-east. After several unsuccessful battles with the [[Boii]] and other [[Celtic tribes]], they appeared ca 113 BC in [[Noricum]], where they invaded the lands of one of Rome's allies, the [[Taurisci]]. 

On the request of the Roman [[consul]] [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo (consul 113 BC)|Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]], sent to defend the Taurisci, they retreated, only to find themselves deceived and attacked at the [[Battle of Noreia]], where they defeated the Romans. Only a storm, which separated the combatants, saved the Roman forces from complete annihilation.

===Invading Gaul===
Now the road to Italy was open, but they turned west towards [[Gaul]]. They came into frequent conflict with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who usually came out the losers. In 109 BC, they defeated a Roman army under the consul [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 109 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]], who was the commander of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. The same year, they defeated another Roman army under the consul [[Gaius Cassius Longinus, consul 124 BC|Gaius Cassius Longinus]], who was killed at Burdigala (modern day [[Bordeaux]]). In 107 BC, the Romans once again lost against the [[Tigurines]], who were allies of the Cimbri.

==The war against the Romans==
===Attacking the Roman Republic===
It was not until 105 BC that they planned an attack on the Roman Republic itself. At the [[Rhône River|Rhône]], the Cimbri clashed with the Roman armies.  The Roman commanders, the proconsul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and the consul [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]], hindered Roman coordination and so the Cimbri succeeded in first defeating the legate [[Marcus Aurelius Scaurus]] and later cause a devastating defeat on Caepio and Maximus at the [[Battle of Arausio]]. The Romans lost as many as 80,000 men, excluding auxiliary cavalry and non-combatants who brought the total loss closer to 112,000.

Rome was in panic, and the ''terror cimbricus'' became proverbial. Everyone expected to soon see the ''new Gauls'' outside of the gates of Rome. Desperate measures were taken: contrary to the Roman constitution, [[Gaius Marius]], who had defeated [[Jugurtha]], was elected consul and supreme commander for five years in a row (104-100 BC).

===Defeat===
[[Image:The defeat of the Cimbri.jpg|right|thumb|''The Defeat of the Cimbri'', by [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps|Alexandre-Gabriel Décamps]].]]
In 103 BC, the Cimbri and their proto-Germanic allies, the [[Teutons]], had turned to the Iberia Peninsula where they pillaged far and wide. During this time C. Marius had the time to prepare and, in 102 BC, he was ready to meet the Teutons and the Ambrones at the Rhône. These two tribes intended to pass into Italy through the western passes, while the Cimbri and the Tigurines were to take the northern route across the [[Rhine]] and later across the [[German Tyrol|Tirol]]ian [[Alps]].

At the estuary of the [[Isère River]], the Teutons and the Ambrones met Marius, whose well-defended camp they did not manage to overrun. Instead, they pursued their route, and Marius followed them.  At [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]], the Romans won two battles and took the Teuton king [[Teutobod]] prisoner.

The Cimbri had penetrated through the Alps into northern Italy. The consul [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] had not dared to fortify the passes, but instead he had retreated behind the [[River Po]], and so the land was open to the invaders. The Cimbri did not hurry, and the victors of Aquae Sextiae had the time to arrive with reinforcements. At the [[Battle of Vercellae]], at the confluence of the [[Sesia River]] with the [[Po River]], in 101 BC, the long voyage of the Cimbri also came to an end.

It was a devastating defeat and both the chieftains [[Lugius]] and [[Boiorix]] died. The women killed both themselves and their children in order to avoid slavery. The Cimbri were annihilated, although some may have survived to return to the homeland where a population with this name was residing in northern [[Jutland]] in the 1st century AD, according to the sources quoted above.

==Culture==
[[Image:Gundestrup E.jpg|thumb|Gundestrup cauldron, Plate E]] 

Strabo gives this vivid description of the Cimbric folklore (''Geogr.'' 7.2.3, trans. H.L. Jones):

{{quote|Their wives, who would accompany them on their expeditions, were attended by priestesses who were seers; these were grey-haired, clad in white, with flaxen cloaks fastened on with clasps, girt with girdles of bronze, and bare-footed; now sword in hand these priestesses would meet with the prisoners of war throughout the camp, and having first crowned them with wreaths would lead them to a brazen vessel of about twenty amphorae; and they had a raised platform which the priestess would mount, and then, bending over the kettle, would cut the throat of each prisoner after he had been lifted up; and from the blood that poured forth into the vessel some of the priestesses would draw a prophecy, while still others would split open the body and from an inspection of the entrails would utter a prophecy of victory for their own people; and during the battles they would beat on the hides that were stretched over the wicker-bodies of the wagons and in this way produce an unearthly noise.}}

The Cimbri are depicted as ferocious warriors who did not fear death. The host was followed by women and children on carts. Aged women, [[priestesses]], dressed in white sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood, the nature of which allowed them to see what was to come.

If the Cimbri did in fact come from Jutland, evidence that the they practised ritualistic sacrifice may be found in the [[Haraldskær Woman]] discovered in Jutland in the year 1835.  Noosemarks and skin piercing were evident and she had been thrown into a bog rather than buried or cremated. Furthermore, the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], found in Himmerland, may be a sacrificial vessel like the one described in Strabo's text. The work itself was of Thracian origin.

==Physical Appearance==

[[Plutarch]] wrote that the Cimbri were light-blue eyed:&lt;/br&gt;

‘‘The most prevalent conjecture was that they were some of the German peoples which extended as far as the northern ocean,&lt;/br&gt; 
a conjecture based on their great stature, their light-blue eyes, and the fact that the Germans call robbers Cimbri.’’&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Marius'', XI. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants==
According to [[Julius Caesar]], the Belgian tribe of the Atuatuci &quot;was descended from the Cimbri and Teutoni, who, upon their march into our province and Italy, set down such of their stock and stuff as they could not drive or carry with them on the near (''i.e.'' west) side of the Rhine, and left six thousand men of their company therewith as guard and garrison&quot; (''Gall.'' 2.29, trans. Edwards). They founded the city of Atuatuca in the land of the [[Belgae|Belgic]] [[Eburones]], whom they dominated. Thus [[Ambiorix]] king of the Eburones paid tribute and gave his son and nephew as hostages to the Atuatuci (''Gall.'' 6.27). In the first century AD, the Eburones were replaced or absorbed by the Germanic [[Tungri]], and the city was known as Atuatuca Tungrorum, i.e. the modern city of [[Tongeren]]. The [[Sicambri]] might have their name derived from Cimbri{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

The population of modern-day [[Himmerland]] claims to be the heirs of the ancient Cimbri. The adventures of the Cimbri are described by the Danish nobel-prize-winning author, [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen|Johannes V. Jensen]], himself born in Himmerland, in the novel ''Cimbrernes Tog'' (1922), included in the epic cycle ''Den lange Rejse'' (English ''[[The Long Journey]]'', 1923). The so-called Cimbrian bull (&quot;Cimbrertyren&quot;), a sculpture by [[Anders Jensen Bundgaard|Anders Bundgaard]], was erected 14 April 1937 on a central town square in [[Aalborg]], the capital of the [[Region Nordjylland|region of North Jutland]].

The '''Cleveland Browns''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. They are currently members of the [[AFC North|North Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team began play in 1946 as a charter member of the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC) and joined the NFL in 1950 when the leagues merged.

The Browns were the AAFC's most successful franchise, and were one of only three teams to join the NFL following the merger.
In 1995, after nearly 50 years in Cleveland, then owner [[Art Modell]] announced his intention to move the team to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], initiating [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|a relocation controversy]] that led to legal action. The legal action resulted in a unique compromise: Modell would keep the Browns' existing player and staff contracts, but his team officially would be a new franchise; this team is now known as the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The Browns name, history, and archives would remain in Cleveland, and a new Browns team began play in 1999 after a three-year period of &quot;deactivation&quot;.

The Browns have won a total of eight league championships. They won all four AAFC titles (including a 15-0 undefeated season in 1948), and after joining the NFL won four additional championships prior to the league's [[AFL–NFL merger|merger]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970. Following the merger, the Browns were one of three NFL teams which joined the ten former AFL teams to form the new American Football Conference.  Despite having the sixth-highest winning percentage of all NFL franchises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ |title=Team Encyclopedias and Records |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Browns have not played in a league championship game since the merger; however, they have competed for the AFC Championship three times. Having lost all three games, along with two NFL Championship Games of the [[Super Bowl]] era prior to the merger (in 1968 and 1969), Cleveland is one of four NFL teams that has yet to reach the Super Bowl. Furthermore, Cleveland has never hosted a Super Bowl, making it the only NFL city to have neither hosted nor sent a team to the Super Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Dave |title=Five Stories With No Super Bowl Chapters |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/sports/football/01anderson.html |publisher=New York Times |date=January 31, 2009 |accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Doerschuk |first=Steve |title=Browns now one of only four teams to never reach Super Bowl |url=http://www.cantonrep.com/browns/x867963033/Browns-now-one-of-only-four-teams-to-never-reach-Super-Bowl |publisher=[[Canton Repository]] |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Cleveland Browns}}
{{details|List of Cleveland Browns seasons}}

===1946–1949: founding in the AAFC===
The Cleveland Browns were founded in 1946 as a charter member of the [[All-America Football Conference]], under businessman [[Arthur B. McBride|Arthur B &quot;Mickey&quot; McBride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;returntoglorythestoryoftheclevelandbrowns&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy|first=Bill |title=Return to Glory: the Story of the Cleveland Browns|publisher=The World Publishing Co|year=1965 |location=[[Cleveland, OH]]|id=LCN 65-23356, p.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after gaining the franchise, McBride named [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] coach [[Paul Brown]] as vice president, general manager and head coach. The franchise conducted a team naming contest in 1945. The most popular submission was &quot;Browns&quot; in recognition of Paul Brown, already an established and popular figure in Ohio sports. Brown at first objected to the name and the team selected from the contest entries the name &quot;Panthers&quot;. However, after an area businessman informed the team that he owned the rights to the name Cleveland Panthers from [[Cleveland Panthers|an earlier failed football team]], the name was finally changed to Browns. How they decided on the name Browns in the end remains an occasional subject of debate. The Cleveland Plain Dealer and The Official NFL Encyclopedia of Pro Football both credit Paul Brown himself. On the other hand, the franchise's media relations office credits the nickname as a shortened version of Brown Bombers (the plural of boxer Joe Louis' nickname), the result of a naming contest in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/keyword/joe-louis/featured/2 |title=Articles about Joe Louis - Page 2 - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Baltimore Sun |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown parlayed his ties to the Buckeyes and the [[United States Navy|Navy]] (where he had coached a base football team during [[World War II]]) into the most extensive recruitment network that had ever been seen at the time in pro football.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He used it to assemble a team that, in terms of talent, would have been more than a match for any NFL team—including [[quarterback]] [[Otto Graham]], [[placekicker|kicker]]/[[offensive tackle]] [[Lou Groza]], [[wide receivers]] Dante Lavelli and [[Mac Speedie]], [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Marion Motley]] and [[nose guard]] [[Bill Willis]]. 

The Browns dominated the AAFC, winning all four of its championships. This included the 1948 season, in which they became the first unbeaten and untied team in professional football history, 24 years before the 1972 [[Miami Dolphins]] became the NFL's first and only team to date to have a perfect season. Cleveland's undefeated streak (including two ties) reached 29 games, and included 18 straight wins and the 1947 and 1948 AAFC championship games. During the AAFC's four-year run, the Browns lost only four games. They issued occasional challenges to NFL teams, only to be turned down almost out of hand each time.

Thanks in large part to McBride's promotional efforts, the Cleveland area showed terrific support for the Browns from the moment they were created. The team saw a record-setting average attendance of 57,000 per game in its first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Neft |first=David S. |last2=Cohen |first2=Richard M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Korch |first3=Rick |title=The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football from 1892 to the Present |edition=Second |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1994 |page=194 |isbn=0312114354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns unexpectedly had Cleveland to themselves; the NFL's [[St. Louis Rams|Cleveland Rams]], who had continually lost money while in Cleveland despite winning the 1945 NFL championship, moved to the booming area of [[Los Angeles]] after the [[1945 NFL season|1945 season]] (the team is now located in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]).

===1950–1956: joining the NFL===
The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and the NFL agreed to take in three of the AAFC's teams for the [[1950 NFL season|1950 season]]: the [[San Francisco 49ers]], the [[Baltimore Colts (1947-50)|Baltimore Colts]] (an earlier incarnation, not the team which would later move to Indianapolis), and the Browns.

The Browns' first NFL game was against the two-time defending champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The overwhelming consensus at the time was that the Eagles would blow the Browns off the field; there were still many who thought the Browns were merely the dominant team in a minor league. However, the Browns were determined to prove they belonged. They shredded the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 yards of total offense en route to a 35–10 blowout.

Behind a potent offense that included future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] Graham, Motley and [[Dante Lavelli]], the Browns picked up right where they left off in the AAFC. After going 10–2 in the regular season, they defeated the [[New York Giants]] 8–3 in a playoff game and then beat Cleveland's previous NFL tenants, the Rams (who were now in Los Angeles), 30–28, in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1950|NFL Championship Game]]. Since the NFL does not recognize the AAFC's records, this technically makes the Browns the most successful expansion team in league history. However, the 1950 Browns were not an expansion team in any sense of the term.

During the next season, the Browns went 11–1, facing the Rams in a [[NFL Championship Game, 1951|rematch]] of the previous year's title game. A 73-yard touchdown pass by Rams quarterback [[Norm van Brocklin]] to wide receiver [[Tom Fears]] in the fourth quarter gave Los Angeles the lead for good. The 24–17 loss was the Browns' first in a championship game.

In 1952, Cleveland finished 8–4 to again advance to the [[NFL Championship Game, 1952|NFL Championship Game]], this time facing the [[Detroit Lions]]. A muffed punt, several defensive stands, and a 67-yard [[touchdown]] run by [[Doak Walker]] combined to help the Lions win 17–7, frustrating the Browns for the second consecutive year. On the upside, [[Ray Renfro]] became a star with 722 yards receiving and 322 yards rushing.

The Browns then started the 1953 season winning 11 straight games, but finished with a loss to the Eagles in the final week, and then lost the [[NFL Championship Game, 1953|1953 Championship Game]] in a rematch with the Lions. The game was, however, closer than the year before. With the score tied at 10 going into the final quarter, [[Lou Groza]] kicked two field goals to put Cleveland up 16–10. But Detroit quarterback [[Bobby Layne]] threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to [[Jim Doran]] with less than two minutes left and the Lions won 17–16.

By 1954, the Browns were established as the most powerful team in the NFL. They finished 9–3 and met up with Detroit in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1954|Championship Game]] for a third consecutive year. This time, however, the Browns were relentless on both sides of the ball, intercepting Bobby Layne six times and forcing three fumbles. Otto Graham threw three touchdowns and ran for three more, en route to a 56–10 thrashing and the Browns' second NFL crown.

The Browns kept rolling along in 1955. [[Chuck Noll]] had a productive season at linebacker with five interceptions, Graham passed for 15 touchdowns and ran for six more, and the team, who finished 9–2–1, won their third [[NFL Championship Game, 1955|NFL Championship Game]] in six seasons 38–14 over the Los Angeles Rams. In 10 years of existence, the Browns reached the title game every year (four in the AAFC, six in the NFL) and won seven of them.

Graham retired before the 1956 season because of injuries, and the Browns floundered without him behind center. Three quarterbacks ([[George Ratterman]], [[Babe Parilli]], and [[Tommy O'Connell]]) were used, none of them throwing more touchdowns than interceptions. The team's 5–7 record was the team's first losing season ever.

===1957–1965: the Jim Brown era===
The Browns responded in 1957 when they drafted fullback [[Jim Brown]] out of [[Syracuse University]], who easily became the NFL's leading rusher (and [[NFL Rookie of the Year]]) with 942 yards in a 12-game regular season. Once again at the top of the division at 9–2–1, they advanced back to the [[NFL Championship Game, 1957|Championship Game]] against Detroit. But the Lions dominated from start to finish, causing six turnovers and allowing the Browns' two quarterbacks (Tommy O'Connell and [[Milt Plum]]) only 95 yards passing in a 59–14 rout, the Lions' last league championship to date.

In 1958 Jim Brown ran for 1,527 yards, almost twice as much as any other running back. In his nine seasons in the league, he crossed the 1,000-yard barrier seven times. The only snag in the Browns' getting back to another championship was the New York Giants. They lost to New York on the last week of the season after a spirited fourth-quarter comeback; then, due to their equal 9–3 records, faced the Giants again in a tiebreaker game with the winner going to the finals. However, the Giants limited Jim Brown to eight yards and the team committed four turnovers as they were shut out 10–0.

In 1959 the Browns started 6–2 but finished 7–5, out of championship contention, despite Brown once again leading the league in rushing with 1,329 yards. In 1960, Plum threw for 21 touchdowns and Brown's 1,257 yards was still best in the NFL, but the team still finished second at 8–3–1.

====Art Modell assumes ownership (1961)====
[[Art Modell]] purchased the team from David Jones (who had bought the team from McBride in 1953) in 1961. The beginnings of a power struggle between Paul Brown and Art Modell took its toll. Journalist D.L. Stewart recounted in Jeff Miller's book on the AFL, ''Going Long'', &quot;As you well can imagine, Jimmy Brown and Paul were not thick. The buzz was that Jimmy had Modell working for him, and Paul took exception to that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Long&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller|first=Jeff|title=Going Long|publisher=Contemporary Books, McGraw Hill| page=268|year=2003 |location=New York|isbn=0-07-141849-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season otherwise was typical: a fifth consecutive league-leading season from Jim Brown and a half-decent performance in the standings, but again, at 8–5–1, they were two games out of a berth in the championship.

After a 7–6–1 record in 1962, Modell fired Paul Brown and replaced him with longtime assistant [[Blanton Collier]]. Many of the Browns' younger players, such as Jim Brown and [[Frank Ryan (American football)|Frank Ryan]], had chafed under Brown's autocratic coaching style; in contrast, Collier ran the club with a much looser grip. He installed a much more open offense and allowed Ryan to call his own plays. In Collier's first season, the Browns went 10–4 and finished a game out of the conference title, led by Jim Brown's record 1,863 yards rushing.

===Blanton Collier becomes head coach (1964-1970)===
====Browns win another NFL championship (1964)====
In 1964, the Browns went 10–3–1 and reached their first [[NFL championship game, 1964|title game]] in seven years. They throttled the heavily favored [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] 27–0, with receiver [[Gary Collins (American football)|Gary Collins]] catching three touchdown passes to earn the MVP award. (As of 2010, this was the most recent sports championship for the city of [[Greater Cleveland|Cleveland]].) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/team/history/results/1964_stats.php |title=Cleveland Browns |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns would go to three more NFL title games in Collier's eight-year tenure, including {{nfly|1968}} and {{nfly|1969}}, after Jim Brown retired. After the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]], Collier retired due to increasing deafness and was replaced by [[offensive coordinator]] [[Nick Skorich]]; that same year the Browns finished 7–7.

===1971–1984: the &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot;===
Skorich led the Browns to a division title in {{nfly|1971}} and a wild-card berth in {{nfly|1972}}. In the latter year, the Browns nearly defeated the Miami Dolphins, 20-14. Miami went on to finish 17-0 that season. The Browns barely missed the playoffs in {{nfly|1973}}.

However, the team's era of success came to a crashing halt as it dropped to 4–10 in 1974. Neither quarterback [[Mike Phipps]] nor rookie pivot [[Brian Sipe]] was effective; they threw 24 combined interceptions to only 10 touchdowns. The Browns allowed 344 points, most in the league. It was only the second losing season in franchise history, and it cost Skorich his job.

Assistant coach [[Forrest Gregg]] took over in {{nfly|1975}}, but the Browns stumbled out of the gate with an 0–9 start that finally came to an end on November 23 in a 35–23 comeback victory over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. Three weeks later, third-year running back [[Greg Pruitt]] paced the team with 214 yards rushing in a rout over the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], helping the team finish the season 3–11.

Cleveland showed marked improvement with a 9–5 record in {{nfly|1976}} as Brian Sipe firmly took control at quarterback. Sipe had been inserted into the lineup after a Phipps injury in the season-opening win against the [[New York Jets]] on September 12. After a 1–3 start brought visions of another disastrous year, the Browns jolted the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Steelers with an 18–16 victory on October 10. Third-string quarterback Dave Mays helped lead the team to that victory, while defensive end [[Joe Jones (American football)|Joe &quot;Turkey&quot; Jones]]'s pile-driving sack of Pittsburgh quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] fueled the heated [[Browns–Steelers rivalry|rivalry]] between the two teams. That win was the first of eight in the next nine weeks, helping put the Browns in contention for the AFC playoffs. A loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the regular season finale cost them a share of the division title, but running back Pruitt continued his outstanding play by rushing for exactly 1,000 yards, his second-straight four-digit season.

The Browns continued to roll in the first half of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], but an injury to Sipe by Steelers linebacker [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]] on November 13 proved to be disastrous. Cleveland won only one of their last five games to finish at 6–8, a collapse that led to Forrest Gregg's dismissal before the final game of the season. [[Dick Modzelewski]] served as interim coach in the team's 20–19 loss to the [[Seattle Seahawks]].

[[File:Sam-Rutigliano-1979.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Coach [[Sam Rutigliano]] around 1979 at the Browns practice facility]]
On December 27, 1977, [[Sam Rutigliano]] was named head coach, and he aided a healthy Sipe in throwing 21 touchdowns and garnering 2,900 yards during the [[1978 NFL season]]. Greg Pruitt and [[Mike Pruitt]] (no relation) led a rushing attack that gained almost 2,500 yards, but problems with the team's dismal pass defense resulted in the Browns finishing 8–8 on the year.

The [[1979 NFL season|1979 campaign]] started with four consecutive wins, three of which were in the final minute or overtime. Four more games were won by less than a touchdown. This penchant for playing close games would later earn them the nickname &quot;[[Kardiac Kids]]&quot;. Sipe threw 28 touchdown passes, tying him with [[Steve Grogan]] of [[New England Patriots|New England]] for most in the league, but his 26 interceptions were the worst in the league. Mike Pruitt had a [[Pro Bowl]] season with his 1,294 rushing yards, while the defense was still shaky, ranking near the bottom in rushing defense. The team finished 9–7, behind division rivals [[Houston Oilers|Houston]] and Pittsburgh in a tough AFC Central.

The 1980 season is still fondly remembered by Browns fans. After going 3–3 in the first six games, the Browns won three straight games with fourth-quarter comebacks, and stopped a late comeback by the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] to win a fourth. The Browns won two more games in that fashion by the end of the season, and even lost a game to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on the last play when a [[Hail Mary pass]] was tipped into the waiting hands of [[Ahmad Rashad]]. Sipe passed for 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions (enough for him to be named the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL MVP]]), behind an offensive line that sent three members to the [[Pro Bowl]]: [[Doug Dieken]], [[Tom DeLeone]] and [[Joe DeLamielleure]]. The &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot; name stuck. A fourth-quarter field goal by [[Don Cockroft]] in the final game against the Bengals helped the Browns capture the division with an 11–5 mark, with the [[Oakland Raiders]] their opponent in the team's first playoff game in eight years. However, a heartbreaking end to this dramatic season came in the closing seconds when Rutigliano called what became known as &quot;[[Red Right 88]]&quot; and had Sipe pass toward the end zone, only to watch Oakland's [[Mike Davis (American football)|Mike Davis]] intercept the ball. The Raiders went on to win the [[Super Bowl]], and &quot;Red Right 88&quot; has numbered among the list of [[Sports-related curses#Cleveland sports curse|Cleveland sports curses]] ever since.

If 1980 was a dream season, then {{nfly|1981}} was a nightmare. Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns while being picked off 25 times. The Browns went 5–11, and few of their games were particularly close. Tight end [[Ozzie Newsome]], their only Pro Bowler, had 1,004 yards receiving for six touchdowns.

In {{nfly|1982}} Sipe split quarterbacking duties with [[Paul McDonald (American football)|Paul McDonald]], and both put up similar numbers. The Browns had little success rushing or defending against it, finishing in the bottom five teams in both yardage categories. Despite going 4–5, Cleveland was able to make the playoffs due to an expanded playoff system in the strike-shortened year. They were matched up again with the Raiders in the playoffs, but were easily defeated 27–10.

Sipe and the Browns got some of their spark back in {{nfly|1983}}. Sipe had 26 touchdown passes and 3,566 yards, while Mike Pruitt ran for 10 scores on 1,184 yards. Cleveland even won two games in overtime and another in the fourth quarter. A fourth-quarter loss to the Oilers in their second-to-last game dashed their playoff hopes. At 9–7 the Browns finished one game behind the Steelers, and lost out on a wild-card spot due to a tiebreaker.

1984 was a rebuilding year. Brian Sipe defected to the upstart [[United States Football League]] after the 1983 season, and Paul McDonald was named the starting quarterback. Mike Pruitt missed much of the season and later ended up with the [[Buffalo Bills]]. Coach Sam Rutigliano lost his job after a 1–7 start as [[Marty Schottenheimer]] took over. The Browns coasted to a 5–11 record.

===1985–1990: Bernie Kosar and the Broncos rivalry===
In [[1985 Cleveland Browns season|1985]], the Browns selected [[University of Miami]] quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]] in the Supplemental Draft. As a rookie, Kosar learned through trial by fire as he took over for [[Gary Danielson]] midway through the 1985 season. Progressing a bit more each Sunday, the young quarterback helped turn the struggling season around, as the Browns won four of the six games Kosar started. Two young rushers, [[Earnest Byner]] and [[Kevin Mack]], played a large part in the team's success as well; each ran for 1,000+ yards, a feat that would not be repeated until the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]], when [[Brandon Jacobs]] and [[Derrick Ward]] of the [[New York Giants]] each broke the 1,000-yard barrier. The Browns' 8–8 record gave the team the top spot in a weak AFC Central, and they looked poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in the 1986 Divisional Playoff game with a 21–3 lead at halftime. It took [[Dan Marino]]'s spirited second-half comeback to win the game for Miami 24–21. While the Browns faithful may have felt the initial sting of disappointment, there was tremendous upside in the loss: Schottenheimer's team, with Kosar at quarterback, reached the playoffs each of the next five seasons, advancing to the AFC Championship Game in three of those years.

[[File:Bruce-and-Clay-Matthews-80s.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clay Matthews (right) with brother [[Bruce Matthews]] during a game between the Browns and [[Houston Oilers]], 1984]]
The Browns broke into the ranks of the NFL's elite—particularly on defense—with a 12–4 showing in {{nfly|1986}}. Behind Kosar's 3,854 yards passing and one of the league's stingiest defenses featuring five Pro Bowlers ([[Chip Banks]], [[Hanford Dixon]], [[Bob Golic]], [[Clay Matthews, Jr.|Clay Matthews]] and [[Frank Minnifield]]), the Browns dominated the AFC Central with the best record in the AFC and clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In the 1986 Divisional Playoffs, the Browns needed some serious heroics (and a bit of luck) to overcome the [[New York Jets]]. The Jets were leading 20–10 with less than four minutes to play, with the Browns in a dire 3rd and 24 situation. As fate would have it, [[Mark Gastineau]] was called for roughing the passer, which gave Cleveland a first down. The drive ended with Kevin Mack running into the end zone for a touchdown. After going [[three-and-out]] the Jets went back on defense, but allowed the rejuvenated Browns to again drive the ball deep into their end of the field. With 11 seconds remaining in regulation, [[Mark Moseley]] kicked a field goal to tie the game. In the first of two ensuing overtime periods, Moseley missed his next attempt, but later redeemed himself by ending what had become the second longest game in NFL history, a 23-20 victory for the Browns.

The 1986 AFC Championship Game saw the [[Denver Broncos]] arrive in the windswept, hostile confines of [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]. No one knew at the time, but the Broncos would become Cleveland's arch-nemesis of the Kosar era, having only lost once to the Browns in a span that still continues to this day. As with the Divisional Playoffs of the previous week, the AFC title game would also prove to be an overtime heart-stopper. But this time, it was [[John Elway]] and the Broncos who came away the victors. Pinned in on the Denver two-yard line with 5:11 left to play and the wind in his face, Elway embarked on his now-famous 98-yard march downfield, which is now known by NFL historians as simply &quot;[[The Drive]]&quot;. With 37 seconds on the clock, Elway's 5-yard touchdown pass to [[Mark Jackson (American football player)|Mark Jackson]] tied the game at 20 apiece. The 79,973 Browns fans in attendance were silenced when [[Rich Karlis]]' field goal attempt just made it inside the right-side upright to win the game 23-20 for Denver early into overtime.

The Browns' success was replicated in {{nfly|1987}}, with 22 touchdown passes and 3,000 yards for Kosar and eight Pro Bowlers (Kosar, Mack, Dixon, Golic, Minnifield, [[linebacker]] Clay Matthews, [[wide receiver]] [[Gerald McNeil]], and [[offensive line]]man [[Cody Risien]]). Cleveland won another AFC Central crown with a 10-5 record and easily defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 38–21 in the divisional playoff to set up a rematch with the Broncos in the AFC Championship Game in Denver. With the score 21–3 in favor of the Broncos at halftime, Kosar led a third-quarter comeback with two touchdowns by Earnest Byner and another by [[Reggie Langhorne]]. Early in the fourth quarter, [[Webster Slaughter]]'s 4-yard touchdown catch tied the game at 31–31. The Broncos regained the lead with a 20-yard [[Sammy Winder]] touchdown with less than five minutes to go, setting the stage for another Browns comeback...or so they thought. Kosar drove the Browns to the Broncos' 8-yard line with 1:12 to go, and handed off to Byner. Just when it looked like he had an open route to the end zone, Broncos defensive back [[Jeremiah Castille]] stripped him of the ball. The Broncos recovered what became known as &quot;[[The Fumble]]&quot;. After taking an intentional safety, the Broncos had shocked the Browns again, 38–33.

Injuries to Kosar and two of his backups sidelined them for much of the {{nfly|1988}} season, but the Browns still finished 10–6. A final-week comeback victory in a snowstorm at Cleveland Municipal Stadium over the Houston Oilers clinched them a wild-card playoff spot and a home game rematch against the Oilers in the first round. After [[Mike Pagel]], in for an injured [[Don Strock]] (the recently signed ex-Dolphins quarterback), threw a touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter late in the fourth quarter to pull the Browns within a point at 24–23, the Browns had three chances to recover an [[onside kick]] (due to penalties), but the Oilers recovered and stopped the Cleveland comeback.

Schottenheimer left the Browns by mutual agreement with Modell shortly after the loss to the Oilers. Modell was tired of losing in the playoffs, and Schottenheimer was tired of what he perceived as Modell's interference with his coaching personnel and game strategy. The Kansas City Chiefs quickly hired Schottenheimer for the {{nfly|1989}} season. [[Bud Carson]] was his replacement in Cleveland, but his tenure was short—only one and a half years.

The 1989 season opened with the Browns defeating the [[Browns–Steelers rivalry|rival]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]] 51-0, which as of [[2010 NFL season|2010]] remains the most lopsided game in the rivalry as well as the all-time worst loss for the Steelers. The rest of the season was headlined by Slaughter's Pro Bowl-worthy 1,236 yards receiving, and was a success at 7–3 until a 10–10 tie with Schottenheimer's Chiefs in November led to a 3-game losing streak. Two comeback wins over the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and Houston Oilers in the season's final two weeks kept them in the playoff race. The tie ended up being the Browns' saving grace, with their 9–6–1 record winning them the AFC Central title and first-round bye over the Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers at 9–7. The Browns narrowly survived a scare from the Buffalo Bills in their divisional playoff game, when [[Scott Norwood]] missed an extra point that would have pulled Buffalo within three points and, later, when [[Jim Kelly]]'s desperation pass to the [[end zone]] on the final play of the game was intercepted by [[Clay Matthews, Jr.|Clay Matthews]].

Cleveland's 34–30 win set them up for another tilt with the Broncos in Denver for the AFC Championship. While their two previous matchups went down to the wire, the result of this particular game was never in doubt. The Broncos led from start to finish, and a long Elway touchdown pass to Sammy Winder put the game away in the fourth quarter. Denver easily won 37–21.

In {{nfly|1990}} things began to unravel. Kosar threw more interceptions (15) than touchdowns (10) for the first time in his career; and the team finished last in the league in rushing offense, and near the bottom in rushing defense. Carson was fired after a 2–7 start, and the team finished 3–13, second-worst in the league. After the season [[Bill Belichick]], defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.

===1991–1995: Bill Belichick and Modell's move===
{{Main|Cleveland Browns relocation controversy}}
The Browns saw only a slight improvement under Belichick in {{nfly|1991}}, finishing 6–10. Kosar was markedly better, with a ratio of 18 touchdowns to 9 interceptions, and [[Leroy Hoard]] had a breakout season. [[1992 NFL season|The next season]], with Kosar sitting out much of the season and [[Mike Tomczak]] in under center, Cleveland was in the thick of the AFC Central race before dropping their final three games to finish 7–9.

The {{nfly|1993}} season saw Belichick make the controversial decision of cutting Kosar while back-up Vinny Testaverde, who had been signed from the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], was injured. The Browns were in first place at the time and the Browns faltered as Todd Philcox became the starter. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys and a few days later led the Cowboys to a win in place of an injured Troy Aikman. Kosar would win a ring that season as the Cowboys won the Super Bowl with a healthy Aikman. Cleveland won only two of its final nine games finishing 7–9 once again.
[[File:1980-modell-browns crop.jpg||thumb|right|220px|Art Modell at a press conference, 1983]]

Cleveland managed to right the ship in {{nfly|1994}}, although the quarterback situation hadn't quite improved. A solid defense led the league for fewest yards allowed per attempt, sending four players ([[Rob Burnett]], [[Pepper Johnson]], [[Michael Dean Perry]], and [[Eric Turner]]) to the Pro Bowl. The Browns finished 11–5, making the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. In the AFC Wild Card game against the New England Patriots, the Browns' defense picked off [[Drew Bledsoe]] three times, with Testaverde completing two-thirds of his passes, to win 20–13. Arch-rival Pittsburgh ended the Browns' season the following week, however, with a 29–9 blowout in the AFC Divisional game.

Modell announced on November 6, 1995, that he had signed a deal to relocate the Browns to [[Baltimore]] in {{nfly|1996}}—a move which would return the NFL to Baltimore for the first time since the Colts relocated to [[Indianapolis]] after the 1983 season. The very next day, on November 7, 1995, Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved an issue that had been placed on the ballot at Modell's request, before he made his decision to move the franchise, which provided $175 million in tax dollars to refurbish the outmoded and declining [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sandomir&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/sports/pro-football-a-city-fights-to-save-the-browns.html?ref=art_modell&amp;pagewanted=all|title=A City Fights To Save The Browns |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2010-08-07 | date=1995-11-12 | first=Richard | last=Sandomir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modell's plan was later scrapped and taxpayers ultimately paid close to $300 million to demolish the old stadium and construct a new stadium for the Browns on the site of Municipal Stadium.

Browns fans reacted angrily to the news. Over 100 lawsuits were filed by fans, the city of Cleveland, and a host of others. Congress held hearings on the matter. Actor/comedian [[Drew Carey]] returned to his hometown of Cleveland on November 26, 1995, to host &quot;Fan Jam&quot; in protest of the proposed move. A protest was held in Pittsburgh during the Browns' game there but ABC, the network broadcasting the game, declined to cover or mention the protest.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It was one of the few instances that Steelers fans and Browns fans were supporting each other, as fans in Pittsburgh felt that Modell was robbing their team of their rivalry with the Browns.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandomir&quot;/&gt;  Virtually all of the team's sponsors immediately pulled their support, leaving Municipal Stadium devoid of advertising during the team's final weeks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The {{nfly|1995}} season was a disaster on the field as well. After starting 3–1, the Browns lost 3 straight before the news broke about the team's impending move cut the legs out from under the team. They finished 5–11, including a 2–7 record in the nine games after the announcement. When fans in the [[Dawg Pound]] became unruly during their final home game against the Cincinnati Bengals, action moving towards that end zone had to be moved to the opposite end of the field. Rows of empty seats were torn from the stadium and thrown on the field. Stalls and sinks in the restrooms were torn from the walls. Several fans set fires in the stands, especially in the &quot;Dawg Pound&quot; section, and assaulted security officials and police officers who tried to quell the growing fires. The Browns won their final home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1995.htm |title=1995 Cleveland Browns Statistics &amp; Players |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Belichick resigned early in February 1996.

===1996–1999: inactivity===
After extensive talks between the NFL, the Browns, and officials of the two cities, Cleveland accepted a legal settlement that would keep the Browns legacy in Cleveland.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAL-CLE_Deal&quot;&gt;Morgan, Jon. [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-modell020996,1,1050941.story Deal clears NFL path to Baltimore], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', February 9, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, the NFL announced that the Browns would be 'deactivated' for three years, and that [[Cleveland Browns Stadium|a new stadium]] would be built for a new Browns team, as either an [[expansion team]] or a team moved from another city, that would begin play in 1999. Modell would in turn be granted a new franchise, the NFL's 31st, for Baltimore, the [[Baltimore Ravens]], retaining the current contracts of players and personnel. The Browns ceased play at the end of the 1995 season when Modell relocated the organization to Baltimore.  The Browns franchise was then reactivated, and its roster restocked via an expansion draft before resuming play in the 1999 season. There would be a new team, but the Browns' name, colors, history, records, awards and archives would remain in Cleveland.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAL-CLE_Deal&quot;/&gt; Coincidentally, the only other current NFL team to suspend operations without merging with another, the [[St. Louis Rams]], had once played in Cleveland (they suspended during the 1943 season, at the height of [[World War II]], during their time in Cleveland).&lt;ref name=henkel111&gt;{{harvnb|Henkel|2005|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move also fueled a proliferation of 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL. Using the NFL–City of Cleveland agreement's promise to supply a team to Cleveland by 1999, several NFL franchises used the threat of relocation to coerce their respective cities to build new stadiums with public funds. Such franchises include the Broncos, Patriots, Eagles, Seahawks, Buccaneers, Bengals, Steelers, Lions, Cardinals, and Colts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Katherine C. |last=Leone |title=No Team, No Peace: Franchise Free Agency in the National Football League |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=473–523 |year=1997 |doi=10.2307/1123368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland NFL Football LLC (Cleveland Browns Trust) was formed by the NFL. President of the Trust was Bill Futterer, and NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was the Trustee. The Trust represented the NFL in the stadium design and construction, managed the sale of suites and club seats, and sold Permanent Seat Licenses and season tickets. Additionally, the Trust reorganized the Browns Backers fan clubs across the United States, resumed coaches shows on television and radio throughout the state of Ohio, and conducted a dramatic one-year countdown celebration that incorporated the first live Internet broadcast in NFL history. The Trust operated its campaign under a Countdown to '99 theme, utilizing Hall of Famers such as Lou Groza and Jim Brown extensively, and sold nearly 53,000 season tickets—a team record in 1998. It remains the only time in professional American football history that a league operated a team &quot;in absentia&quot; in order to preserve the history of the franchise and to build value in that franchise for the future owner. The NFL sold the Browns as an expansion team in 1998 for a North American record $530 million for a professional franchise, more than double any previous selling price for a pro sports team. Commissioner Tagliabue announced that the Browns would be an expansion team, rather than a relocated team, at the owners meeting in March 1998.&lt;ref name=henkel111 /&gt;

Officially, the National Football League, Pro Football Hall of Fame, Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens all recognize the current Browns team as a continuation of the team founded in 1946.&lt;ref name=henkel111 /&gt;  The Ravens ''1998 Fan and Media Guide'' referred to longtime staffers as having worked for &quot;The Modell organization&quot; before the Ravens were created in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=8519 |title=Baltimore City Paper - Columns:8 Upper |publisher=Citypaper.com |date=1998-09-23 |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999–2004: rejoining the NFL===
[[Image:Cleveland Browns October 2004.jpg|thumb|The Browns on the field in 2004 against the [[Washington Redskins]].]]
Cleveland returned to the NFL in 1999 with high hopes and expectations, featuring deep-pocketed ownership in [[Al Lerner]]. The team's football operations appeared to be in solid hands in the form of president and CEO [[Carmen Policy]] and general manager [[Dwight Clark]], both of whom had come from the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. [[Chris Palmer (American football)|Chris Palmer]], former offensive coordinator of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], was hired as head coach. The team was [[1999 Cleveland Browns season#Draft|rebuilt]] from a special expansion draft and the regular NFL draft; the latter included the number one selection, QB [[Tim Couch]].

It was to be expected that the resurrected Browns would struggle at first, as for all practical purposes they were an expansion team. However, the Browns' first two seasons were awful even by expansion standards. [[1999 Cleveland Browns season|1999]] started with a home game against the [[Browns–Steelers rivalry|rival]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football]]'', with Cleveland native [[Drew Carey]] participating in the opening-game [[Coin flipping|coin toss]]. However, it would be the only highlight for the Browns that night. The Steelers got revenge on the 51-0 loss to the Browns ten years earlier (though Steelers [[All-Pro]] center [[Dermontti Dawson]] was the only player remaining from either team from the 1989 game) by beating the Browns 43-0 in their first game back. Though it is not the team's worst loss ever, it is their second worst loss since the team returned to the NFL, behind a 48-0 loss to Jacksonville on December 3, 2000.

The 1999 season saw the Browns start 0–7 en route to a 2–14 finish, the worst in franchise history. {{nfly|2000}} was slightly better, with a 3–13 finish—the lone highlight being the Browns' first home win in five years, against the Steelers on September 17. Compounding the fans' frustration was the [[Baltimore Ravens]]' win over the [[New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XXXV]] that season. Though the Ravens were considered a &quot;new franchise&quot;, the team still had players such as [[Matt Stover]] and [[Rob Burnett]] who had played for the Browns before the Modell move. Palmer was fired after the season and replaced by [[University of Miami]] coach [[Butch Davis]].

Under Davis the Browns became more competitive, finishing 7–9 in {{nfly|2001}}, three games out of the playoffs. With the team apparently close to being a contender again, Clark was forced to resign after the season, and Davis was named general manager as well as coach. In {{nfly|2002}}, the Browns finished 9–7, and thanks to multiple tiebreakers they made the playoffs for the first time since 1994. Facing Pittsburgh in the first round, the Browns led 33–21 with five minutes to go, but ultimately lost 36–33. Their largest lead in the game was actually 17 points—they led 24–7 in the third quarter; after that point the Steelers outscored them 29–9—eerily the very score the Browns had lost by in the 1994 playoff meeting.

The Browns did not sustain the momentum, finishing with double-digit losing records in {{nfly|2003}} and {{nfly|2004}}. Davis resigned in December 2004 with the team shouldering a 3–8 record; Policy had resigned earlier in the year. Offensive Coordinator [[Terry Robiskie]] was named interim head coach for the remainder of the 2004 season.

===2005–2008: the Savage/Crennel era===
[[Image:CB 07-04-2008 01;22;59PM.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Close-up look at Cleveland Browns Stadium]]
[[Image:Dorseycle.jpg|thumb|Browns' quarterback [[Ken Dorsey]], 2007]]
Before the 2005 season began, [[Romeo Crennel]], a one-time Browns assistant coach under [[Chris Palmer (American football)|Chris Palmer]] and, at the time, defensive coordinator for the [[New England Patriots]], was named the Browns head coach. The team also hired Phil Savage as a new general manager. But despite the changes, the 2005 and 2006 seasons saw the Browns losing trend continue, with records of 6–10 and 4–12. Prior to the Browns' final game of the [[2005 NFL season]], ESPN reported that team president [[John Collins (American Football executive)|John Collins]] was going to fire Savage. However, the resulting uproar from fans and local media was strong, and on January 3, 2006 Collins resigned instead. The role of team &quot;President and CEO&quot; was vacated until 2008, with owner Randy Lerner filling in as de facto CEO until Michael Keenan was hired.

In the [[2007 Cleveland Browns season|2007 season]], the team saw a remarkable turnaround on the field. After opening the season with a 34–7 defeat by the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Browns traded starting quarterback [[Charlie Frye]] to the [[Seattle Seahawks]], with backup [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] assuming the starting role. In his first start, Anderson led the Browns to a 51–45 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, tying the franchise record of five touchdown passes in a single game.  The Browns finished the 2007 season  a surprising 10–6, barely missing the playoffs due to tie-breaker rules. Nevertheless, the record was the team's best since 1994. Six players earned Pro Bowl recognition, with Anderson starting for the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] in place of [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Tom Brady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2008-01-28-3488501906_x.htm |title=Browns long snapper Pontbriand named to Pro Bowl - USATODAY.com |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=January 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coach Crennel agreed to a two-year contract extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBSSports.com wire reports |url=http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/story/10605249 |title=After breakthrough season, Browns' Crennel to sign two-year extension - NFL - CBSSports.com Football |publisher=Sportsline.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns entered the [[2008 Cleveland Browns season|2008 season]] with high expectations, and many pundits predicted that the team would win the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2008-09-03-preseason-picks_N.htm |title=USA Today's NFL preseason picks 2008 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highlight of the season was an upset of the defending Super Bowl champion [[New York Giants]] on Monday Night Football. However, inconsistent play and key injuries led to a disappointing 4–12 record. The Browns ended up using four starting quarterbacks during the season: [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]], [[Brady Quinn]] and [[Ken Dorsey]] were lost to injury; the fourth, [[Bruce Gradkowski]], was hired mid-season. Ending with six straight losses, the Browns finished with a franchise first two consecutive shutouts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/schedule?team=CLE&amp;season=2008&amp;seasonType=REG |title=NFL.com 2008 Schedule |work=[[NFL]] |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage and Crennel were subsequently fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.myfoxcleveland.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=8155939&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1 |title=Browns Fire GM Phil Savage |date=December 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Withers |first=Tom |url=http://www.myfoxcleveland.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=8158822&amp;version=10&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1 |title=Browns Fire Coach Romeo Crennel |agency=Associated Press |date=December 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009–present:  The Mike Holmgren era ===
On January 5, 2009, the Browns hired former [[New York Jets]] coach [[Eric Mangini]] as head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=9357 Browns, Mangini reach agreement - ClevelandBrowns.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Mangini, who started his career as a ballboy in Cleveland, worked as an assistant under former Browns coach Bill Belichick until becoming head coach of the Jets in 2006. On January 25, the team hired [[George Kokinis]] as the team's general manager.  The Browns continued to struggle as they became accustomed to a completely new coaching staff. Throughout the preseason, [[Brady Quinn]] and [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] competed for the starting quarterback position. Quinn ended up winning the job, but after three games marked by team inconsistency (and an 0-3 record), he was benched in favor of Anderson. On November 1, the team announced the firing of GM Kokinis after only 8 regular season games (and a 1-7 record), with his duties essentially being assumed by Mangini. Soon afterwards, Mangini decided that a quarterback switch was to be made again, and Quinn given the starting job back. After being 1-11 at the three-quarters point in the season (12 games), the team went on a four-game winning streak and finished with a record of 5–11, highlighted by the team beating the Steelers after twelve consecutive losses against their bitter rival.

On December 21, 2009, as Mangini's first season was coming to a close, former [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]] head coach [[Mike Holmgren]] was hired as team President and was given authority over the team's football operations. This hire was made after Browns owner Randy Lerner announced that he wished to bring in a &quot;serious, credible leader&quot; to steer the team in the right direction.  After much public speculation by the media that Holmgren and Mangini would not be able to co-exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/12/16/holmgrens-arrival-would-likely-mean-end-for-mangini/ | publisher=NFL.com | last=La Canfora | first=Jason | title=Holmgren’s arrival likely would mean end for Mangini | date= 2009-12-16 | accessdate=2010-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmgren announced the retaining of Mangini and the entire coaching staff for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Cleveland Browns' Eric Mangini will coach team in 2010 | last=Grossi | first=Tony | publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]] | url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2010/01/post_17.html | date=2010-01-07 | accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, Holmgren hired former Philadelphia Eagles general manager Tom Heckert to become the new GM for the Browns.

After taking control as President, Holmgren decided to release Anderson and trade away Quinn (getting back eventual 1,100+ yard rusher and fan favorite RB [[Peyton Hillis]] in return). He signed veteran quarterback [[Jake Delhomme]], who had led the Carolina Panthers to the Super Bowl in 2003, along with veteran backup [[Seneca Wallace]] from the Seattle Seahawks. During the 2010 draft, the team of Holmgren, Heckert and Mangini focused mostly on improving the teams defensive secondary, although they also managed to acquire the University of Texas's [[Colt McCoy]] in the third round; McCoy has the most recorded wins in NCAA history.

Despite heading into the 2010 season with an overall sense of optimism, the Browns started off poorly. They set an NFL record when they lost their first three games after leading in the fourth quarter. They finally won their first game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 4. However, both Delhomme and Wallace injured their ankles over the first five games, forcing Colt McCoy to start in Week 6 against the Steelers even though Mike Holmgren stated that he would sit and learn the entire season. Though McCoy lost his first NFL start against the Steelers, he was able to win the following week when the Browns upset the defending Super Bowl Champions, the New Orleans Saints. With this victory, the Browns defeated the defending Super Bowl Champions three years in a row, becoming the seventh NFL team to achieve this feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/10495/browns-stun-super-bowl-champs-again |title=Browns stun Super Bowl champs again |date=October 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Browns continued this positive streak by outplaying the New England Patriots for a 34-14 victory in their next game. However, they lost to the New York Jets in overtime the following week, despite a late 4th quarter game tying touchdown drive by McCoy.  On January 3, 2011, after losing four games in a row to end the season, Holmgren and the Browns decided to fire head coach Eric Mangini, who posted a record of 10-22 in his two seasons as head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Browns fire coach Eric Mangini | last=AP | publisher=[[ESPN]] | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5984058 | date=2011-01-03 | accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eleven days later, Holmgren signed [[St. Louis Rams]] [[offensive coordinator]] [[Pat Shurmur]] to become the new head coach.  Most recently the Cleveland Browns added former [[Buffalo Bills]] head coach and [[Chicago Bears]] defensive coordinator [[Dick Jauron]] as their Defensive Coordinator.

===Logos===
The Browns are the only team in the NFL that does not have a logo on their helmets. However, the team has had various promotional logos throughout the years, such as the &quot;[[Brownie Elf]]&quot; mascot or a Brown &quot;B&quot; in a white football.  While Art Modell did away with the Brownie Elf in the mid-1960s, believing it to be too childish, its use has been revived under the current ownership. In 1965, NFL Creative Services designed a brown '''&quot;CB&quot;''' logo for the Browns' helmet. It was never used in any games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.clevescene.com/64-and-counting/archives/2010/02/09/the-hunt-for-the-great-orange-brown-and-white-whale-unraveling-the-mystery-of-the-1965-cb-cleveland-browns-helmet-logo|title=&quot;the-hunt-for-the-great-orange-brown-and-white-whale-unraveling-the-mystery-of-the-1965-cb-cleveland-browns-helmet-logo&quot;
|publisher=clevescene.com|date= |accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the popularity of the Dawg Pound section at Cleveland Browns Stadium has led to a brown and orange dog being used for various Browns functions. But overall, the orange, logo-less helmet continues to remain as the primary trademark of the Cleveland Browns.

===Uniforms===
The original designs of the jerseys, pants, and socks have remained mostly the same, but the helmets have gone through many significant revisions throughout the years.

'''Jerseys:''' 1. Home Uniforms: brown (officially &quot;[[seal brown]]&quot;) with white numerals and a white-orange-white-orange-white stripe sequence on the sleeves. 2. Away Uniforms: white with brown numerals and a brown-orange-brown-orange-brown stripe sequence on the sleeves. The three white or brown stripes are approximately twice the width of the two orange stripes. (The original 1946 jerseys featured block-shadow numerals.) 3. A third orange jersey was used for night games in the 1954 season, as well as from 2002-2005 when the NFL encouraged teams to create a third jersey.

'''Pants:''' 1. White - white with an orange-brown-orange stripe sequence on the sides (the stripes are of equal width).  &lt;!-- Even though they are not wearing the brown pants this season, they are still an official part of the uniform and can be brought back in future years --&gt;2. Brown - solid brown (no stripes). Orange pants with a wider brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975–1983 and become symbolic of the &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot; era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.

'''Socks:''' Brown or white with matching stripe pattern to jerseys (1946–1983; 1985–1995; 1999–2002 mid-season); solid brown with brown jerseys and solid orange with white jerseys (1984); solid brown when worn with white pants (2002 mid-season–2008); white striped socks with brown pants (2009)  Exceptions: White striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003–2005 and again in 2007. Brown striped socks appeared with 1957-style throwback uniforms in 2006-2008.

'''Helmet:''' Solid white (1946–1949); solid white for day games and solid orange for night games (1950–1951); orange with a single white stripe (1952–1956); orange with a single white stripe and brown numerals on the sides (1957–1959); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence and brown numerals on the sides (1960); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence (1961–1995 and 1999–present).

Over the years, the Browns have had on-again / off-again periods of wearing white for their home games, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as in the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until recently, when more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-[[subtropical]] team north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to wear white at home on a regular basis.

Numerals first appeared on the jersey sleeves in 1961. Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent color bleeding. However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with the exception of the 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials &quot;AL&quot; to honor team owner [[Al Lerner]] who died in 2002.

Orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975–1983 and become symbolic of the &quot;Kardiac Kids&quot; era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.

Other than the helmet, the uniform was completely redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns appeared on the white jerseys, brown jerseys and pants. Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFlAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v1YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1066,2673152 |title=Browns' Home Jerseys Will Be Modified |newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator |date=1984-08-08 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.

In 1999, the expansion Browns adopted the traditional design with two exceptions: 1.) Jersey-sleeve numbers were moved to the shoulders, and 2.) The orange-brown-orange pants stripes were significantly widened. 

Experimentation with the uniform design began in 2002. An alternate orange jersey was introduced that season as the NFL encouraged teams to adopt a third jersey, and a major design change was made when solid brown socks appeared for the first time since 1984 and were used with white, brown and orange jerseys. Other than 1984, striped socks (matching the jersey stripes) had been a signature design element in the team's traditional uniform. The white striped socks would appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003–2005 and 2007.

Experimentation continued in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes on the white pants were replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, one in which the stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005. In 2006, the traditional orange-brown-orange sequence returned.

Additionally in 2006, the team reverted to an older uniform style, featuring gray face masks; the original stripe pattern on the brown jersey sleeves (The white jersey has had that sleeve stripe pattern on a consistent basis since the 1985 season.) and the older, darker shade of brown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/browns/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1143967223212420.xml&amp;coll=2&amp;thispage=3{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns wore brown pants for the first time in team history on August 18, 2008, preseason game against the [[New York Giants]]. The pants contain no stripes or markings. The team had the brown pants created as an option for their away uniform when they integrated the gray facemask in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699 |title=Cleveland Browns &amp;#124; Brown out |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822033723/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were not worn again until the Browns &quot;family&quot; scrimmage on August 9, 2009 with white-striped socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/scrimmage_shows_offense_still.html |title=Scrimmage shows Cleveland Browns' offense still needs work |publisher=Cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns have continued to wear the brown pants throughout the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nfl/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1248597145139770.xml&amp;coll=2 |title=Cleveland Browns might wear brown pants for all road games during 2009 NFL season |publisher=Cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browns quarterback [[Brady Quinn]] supported the team's move to wearing the brown pants full time, claiming that the striped pattern on the white pants &quot;prohibit[ed] mobility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/cleveland_browns_scrimmage_ans.html |title=Cleveland Browns' scrimmage answers some Brady Quinn concerns; WR Leggett impresses|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the fans generally did not like the brown pants, and after being used for only one season, the team returned to their white shirt-on-white pants in 2010. Coach [[Eric Mangini]] told ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' the Browns won't use the brown pants anymore. &quot;It wasn't very well-received,&quot; Mangini said. &quot;I hope we can get to the point where we can wear fruit on our heads and people wouldn't notice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/08/eric-mangini-cleveland-browns-will-abandon-the-brown-pants-look/1 |title=Eric Mangini: Cleveland Browns will abandon the brown-pants look |publisher=USA Today|date= 2010-08-17|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivals==
The Cleveland Browns has rivalries with all three of its [[AFC North]] opponents. In addition, the team has had historical rivalries with the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], [[Denver Broncos]], and [[Detroit Lions]].

The team's biggest rival in the AAFC was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], though this has cooled and in some cases turned into a friendly relationship, as many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999 as well as current team President [[Mike Holmgren]] having started his NFL career in San Francisco. In addition, 49ers owners [[John York]] &amp; [[Denise DeBartolo York]] reside in the [[Youngstown, Ohio]], 76 miles southeast of Cleveland.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
{{main|Browns–Steelers rivalry}}
Often called the &quot;Turnpike Rivalry&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html kdka.com - Steelers To Take On Browns For First Place In The AFC North]&lt;/ref&gt; the Browns' main rival has long been the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Though the Browns dominated this rivalry early in the series (winning the first eight matchups), the Steelers currently have the all-time edge 61-56, making it the oldest rivalry in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] and also the most even. Former Browns owner [[Art Modell]] scheduled home games against the Steelers on Saturday night from 1964-1970 to help fuel the rivalry. The rivalry has been fueled by the proximity of the two teams, number of championships both teams have won, players and personnel having played and/or coached for both sides, and personal bitterness. Though the rivalry has cooled in Pittsburgh due to the Modell move (as well as the Browns having a 4-20 record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999), the Steelers remain the top rival for Cleveland.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
{{main|Battle of Ohio (NFL)}}
Originally conceived due to the personal animosity between [[Paul Brown]] and [[Art Modell]], the &quot;Battle of Ohio&quot; between the Browns and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] have been fueled by the sociocultural differences between [[Cincinnati]] and Cleveland, a shared history between the two teams, and even similar team colors, since Brown used the exact shade of orange for the Bengals that he used for the Browns. (Though this has changed since then, as the Bengals now use a brighter shade of orange.) Modell, in fact, moved the Browns to the AFC after the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in order to have a rivalry with the Bengals. The rivalry has also produced two of the eight highest-scoring games in NFL history. Cincinnati has the all-time edge 38-36.

===Baltimore Ravens===
Created as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]], the rivalry between the Browns and the Ravens is more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. The Ravens still have many personnel that were in Cleveland at the time of the move, and won [[Super Bowl XXXV]] only five years after the move to the dismay of Browns fans. Unlike the other two rivalries, this one is more lopsided: Baltimore leads it 16-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/ |title=Baltimore Ravens Team Encyclopedia |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fans==
{{main|Dawg Pound}}
Perhaps the most visible Browns fans are those that can be found in the [[Dawg Pound]]. Originally the name for the bleacher section located in the open (east) end of old [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]], the current incarnation of is likewise located in the east end of [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] and still features hundreds of orange and brown clad fans sporting various canine-related paraphernalia. The fans adopted that name in 1984 after members of the Browns defense used it to describe the team's defense.&lt;ref name = &quot;pfojix&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/browns/2006-02-16-dawg-pound_x.htm |title=Judge finds nobody beats out Cleveland for 'Dawg Pound' |work=Usatoday.com |publisher=Gannett Company|date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=2008-12-13 | first=Larry | last=Newmeister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retired cornerback [[Hanford Dixon]], who played his entire career for the Browns (1981–1989), is credited with naming the Cleveland Browns defense 'The Dawgs' in the mid-80's. Dixon and fellow teammates Frank Minnifield, and Eddie Johnson would bark at each other and to the fans in the bleachers at the Cleveland Stadium to fire them up. It was from Dixon's naming that the ''Dawg Pound'' subsequently took its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6887 |title=Cleveland Browns &amp;#124; Rookies get a history lesson |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fans adopted that name in the years after.&lt;ref name = &quot;pfojix&quot;/&gt;

[[File:CleBBW.png|right|thumb|150px|The logo of the Browns Backers Worldwide.]]The most prominent organization of Browns fans is the ''Browns Backers Worldwide'' (BBW). The organization has approximately 94,208 members&lt;ref name = &quot;zprxmw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/fans/backers/ |title=Cleveland Browns |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered the largest sports-fan organization in the USA.&lt;ref name = &quot;zprxmw&quot;/&gt; Browns Backers clubs can be found in every major city in the United States, and in a number of military bases throughout the world, with the largest club being in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. In addition, the organization has a sizable foreign presence in places as far away as [[Egypt]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. According to The Official Fan Club of the Cleveland Browns, the two largest international fan clubs are in [[Alon Shvut]], [[Israel]] and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara]], [[Canada]], with Alon Shvut having 129 members and Niagara having 310.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/fans/backers/results.php?id=INT |title=Cleveland Browns |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study conducted by ''Bizjournal'' determined that Browns [[fan (person)|fans]] are the most loyal fans in the NFL. The study, while not [[scientific]], was largely based on fan loyalty during winning and losing seasons, attendance at games, and challenges confronting fans (such as inclement weather or long-term poor performance of their team).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14686579/ |title=Cleveland No. 1 in NFL fan loyalty - NFL- nbcsports.msnbc.com |publisher=Msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that Browns fans filled 99.8% of the seats at Cleveland Browns Stadium during the last seven seasons, despite a combined record of 36 wins and 76 losses over that span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/specials/slideshow/13.html |title=NFL Fan Support Rankings |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Browns owner Randy Lerner's acquisition of [[England|English]] [[Association football|football]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], official Villa outlets have started selling Cleveland Browns goods such as jerseys and NFL balls. This has raised interest in England and strengthened the link between the two sporting clubs. Aston Villa supporters have set up an organization known as the [[Aston]] (Villa) Browns Backers of [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=5656 ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and TV==
{{Main|Cleveland Browns broadcasters}}
Since 2001, the Browns' flagship radio stations are [[WMMS]] FM 100.7 and [[WTAM]] AM 1100. [[Jim Donovan (sportscaster)|Jim Donovan]]--sports director of [[WKYC]] channel 3 ([[NBC]])--is the play-by-play announcer, former Browns offensive tackle [[Doug Dieken]] is the color analyst, with Clevelandbrowns.com and [[SportsTime Ohio]] personality Jamir Howerton serving as sideline reporter. WTAM morning co-host/sports director Mike Snyder, and former Browns quarterback [[Mike Pagel]] host the pregame, halftime, and postgame shows. During the preseason and early September games, [[WTAM]] will broadcast the [[Cleveland Indians]] games while [[WMMS]] will broadcast Browns games when both teams play at the same time.

Preseason telecasts air on WKYC, with Jim Donovan and [[Bernie Kosar]] in the booth, and WKYC weekend sports anchor Dave Chudowski as sideline reporter.  When Donovan does TV, Mike Snyder moves to radio play-by-play, and WTAM evening host [[Bob Frantz]] handles pregame/halftime/postgame duties.

[[SportsTime Ohio]] is the official cable home of the team, and airs numerous weekly Browns related programs.

When a game is broadcast on either [[ESPN]] or [[NFL Network]], a local over-the-air station will simulcast the game (as per NFL policy). [[WJW-TV]] channel 8 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) has been airing the bulk of these games in recent years, though Browns TV partner WKYC has occasionally picked up the games as well.

==Pop culture==
Cleveland native [[Arsenio Hall]]'s television program, ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', was known for the audience's shouting &quot;Woof, woof, woof!&quot; while pumping their fists—a chant that was used by fans of the Cleveland Browns football team. He would refer to a section of the live audience as his &quot;dawg pound.&quot;

[[Cleveland Brown]] is the name of a character originally featured on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV show ''[[Family Guy]]'', and the central character of the spin-off series ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.

[[File:Muskets carbines musketoons blunderbuss.gif|thumb|right|Various muzzle loading arms, to scale; numbers 1, 10, and 11 are identified as carbines. (Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910)]]

A '''carbine''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɑr|b|iː|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|b|aɪ|n}},
&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.Com: [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=carbine Carbine] definition &lt;/ref&gt;) from French ''carabine'' &lt;ref&gt;&quot;carbine.&quot; Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 2010. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbine&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[long_gun|longarm]] similar to but shorter than a [[rifle]] or [[musket]]. Many carbines are shortened versions of full rifles firing the same [[ammunition]] at a lower [[velocity]] due to a shorter barrel length. 

The smaller size and lighter weight of carbines makes them easier to handle in close-quarter combat situations such as [[urban warfare|urban]] or [[jungle warfare]], or when deploying from military vehicles. The disadvantages of carbines relative to rifles include inferior long-range accuracy and effective range. Being larger than a [[submachinegun]] they are harder to maneuver in close quarters where superior range and stopping power at distance are not as great considerations. Firing the same ammunition as rifles gives them the advantage of standardization over [[personal defense weapon]]s requiring proprietary [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]]; however, they lack the higher penetration capabilities of many PDW rounds.

Carbines are issued to high mobility personnel such as special operations and paratroops, as well as mounted, supply, or other non-infantry whose roles do not require full-sized rifles.

== History ==
=== Early history: before the 1900s ===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header_align = left/right/center | header=| footer = '''Left image''': [[Jean Lepage]] [[silex]] carbine said &quot;du [[Premier Consul]]&quot;, circa 1800.&lt;br&gt; '''Right image''': Rifling of Lepage carbine.| footer_align = left | image1 =Lepage silex gun dite du Premier Consul circa 1800.jpg| width1 = 350| caption1 = | image2 =Rifling of Lepage carbine circa 1800.jpg| width2 = 69 | caption2 = }}

The carbine was originally a lighter, shortened weapon developed for the cavalry. Carbines were short enough to be loaded and fired from horseback but this was rarely done - a moving horse is a very unsteady platform, and once halted a soldier can load and fire more easily if dismounted, which also makes him a smaller target. The principal advantage of the carbine's length was portability. Troops could carry full length muskets comfortably enough on horseback provided they were just riding from A to B (the practice of the original [[dragoons]] and later mounted infantry); a Regiment of Horse, however, had to ride with some agility and engage in sword-wielding melees with opposing cavalry so carrying anything long was a dangerous encumbrance. The carbine would typically be no longer than the sheathed sabre, both arranged to hang with their tops clear of the rider’s elbows and bottoms clear of the horse’s legs.

Some sources derive the name of the weapon from the name of its first users—cavalry troopers called &quot;[[carabinier]]s&quot;, from the French ''carabine'', from the Old French ''carabin'' (soldier armed with a musket), perhaps from ''escarrabin'', gravedigger, perhaps from ''scarabee'', [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/carbine The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbines were usually less accurate and less powerful than the longer muskets (and later rifles) of the infantry, due to a shorter [[Sight (device)|sight]] plane and lower velocity of bullets fired from the shortened barrel. With the advent of fast-burning [[smokeless powder]], the velocity disadvantages of the shorter barrels became less of an issue (see [[internal ballistics]]). Eventually, the use of horse-mounted cavalry would decline, but carbines continued to be issued and used by many who preferred a lighter, more compact weapon even at the cost of reduced long-range accuracy and power. 

During the 19th century, carbines were often developed separately from the infantry rifles, and in many cases did not even use the same ammunition, which made for supply difficulties. A notable weapon developed towards the end of the [[American Civil War]] by the Union was the [[Spencer carbine]]. It had a spring-powered [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]] in the stock which held seven rounds. In the late 19th century it became common for a number of nations to make [[bolt-action]] rifles in both full-length and carbine versions. One of the most popular and recognizable carbines was the Winchester [[lever-action]] carbine, with several versions using [[revolver]] cartridges. This made it an ideal choice for [[cowboys]] and explorers, who could carry a revolver and a carbine, both using the same ammunition.

=== Shorter rifles, shorter carbines: World War I and World War II ===
[[Image:81mm-mortar-camp-carson.gif|thumb|right|The [[M1 carbine]] was developed as a smaller alternative to the M1 Garand rifle for issue to support and specialist personnel (e.g. mortar crews).]]

In the decades following [[World War I]], the standard battle rifle used by armies around the world had been growing shorter, either by redesign or by the general issue of carbine versions instead of full-length rifles. For example, the Russian Model 1891 rifle with an 800&amp;nbsp;mm (31.5&amp;nbsp;inch) barrel was shortened to 730&amp;nbsp;mm (28.75 in.) in 1930, and to 510&amp;nbsp;mm (20 in.) in 1938; the German [[Mauser]] 98 rifles went from 740&amp;nbsp;mm (29 in.) in 1898 to 600&amp;nbsp;mm (23.6 in.) in 1935 as the ''Karabiner Kurz'' (K98k or [[Kar98k]]), or &quot;short carbine&quot;. The barrel lengths in rifles used by the [[United States]] did not change between the [[bolt-action]] [[M1903 Springfield rifle|M1903]] rifle of [[World War I]] and the [[World War II]] [[M1 Garand rifle]], but then the 610&amp;nbsp;mm (24 in.) barrel on the M1903 was short for its day. The US [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] was more of a traditional carbine in that it was significantly shorter and lighter, with a 457.2&amp;nbsp;mm (18 in. barrel), than the M1 Garand rifle. The M1 Carbine was not a shorter version of the [[M1 Garand rifle|M1 Garand]], as was typical for rifles vs. carbines in the 19th century, but a wholly different design firing a smaller, less-powerful cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Jungle Carbine.jpg|thumb|left|A Lee-Enfield No. 5 Mk I &quot;[[Jungle Carbine]]&quot; rifle, which fired a full-size .303 calibre rifle cartridge.]]
The [[United Kingdom]] also developed a &quot;[[Jungle Carbine]]&quot; version of their [[Lee-Enfield]] service rifle, featuring a shorter barrel, flash hider, and manufacturing modifications designed to decrease the rifle's weight. Officially titled ''Rifle, No. 5 Mk I'', it was introduced in the closing months of World War II, but did not see widespread service until the [[Korean War]], the [[Mau Mau uprising]], and the [[Malayan Emergency]].

=== After World War II ===
[[File:Karabiner 98k.jpg|thumb|right|Mauser ''[[Karabiner 98k|Karabiner 98 Kurz]]''. Translate as '''Carbine 98 Short''' or a shortened carbine of the [[Gewehr 98]]]]
A shorter weapon was more convenient when riding in a truck, [[armored personnel carrier]], [[helicopter]] or aircraft, and also when engaged in close-range combat. Based on the combat experience of World War II, the criteria used for selecting infantry weapons began to change. Unlike previous wars, which were often fought mainly from fixed lines and trenches, World War II was a highly mobile war, often fought in cities, forests, or other areas where mobility and visibility were restricted. In addition, improvements in [[artillery]] made moving infantry in open areas even less practical than it had been. 

The majority of enemy contacts were at ranges of less than 300 meters (325 yards), and the enemy was exposed to fire for only short periods of time as they moved from cover to cover. Most rounds fired were not aimed at an enemy combatant, but instead fired in the enemy's direction to keep them from moving and firing back (see [[suppressive fire]]). These situations did not require a heavy rifle, firing full-power rifle bullets with long-range accuracy. A less-powerful weapon would still produce casualties at the shorter ranges encountered in actual combat, and the reduced recoil would allow more shots to be fired in the short amount of time an enemy was visible. The lower-powered round would also weigh less, allowing a soldier to carry more ammunition. With no need of a long barrel to fire full-power ammunition, a shorter barrel could be used. A shorter barrel made the weapon weigh less and was easier to handle in tight spaces, and was easier to shoulder quickly to fire a shot at an unexpected target. [[Automatic firearm|Full-automatic]] fire was also considered a desirable feature, allowing the soldier to fire short bursts of three to five rounds, increasing the probability of a hit on a moving target.

The Germans had experimented with [[selective-fire]] carbines firing rifle cartridges during the early years of World War II. These were determined to be less than ideal, as the recoil of full-power rifle cartridges caused the weapon to be uncontrollable in full-automatic fire. They then developed an intermediate-power cartridge round, which was accomplished by reducing the power and the length of the standard 7.92x57 Mauser rifle cartridge to create the 7.92x33 ''Kurz'' (Short) cartridge. A selective-fire weapon was developed to fire this shorter cartridge, eventually resulting in the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], later translated as &quot;[[assault rifle]]&quot;. After World War II, the USSR would adopt a similar weapon, the [[AK-47]], which became the standard Soviet infantry weapon. The United States during World War II also had the [[M1 carbine|M2 Carbine]], a selective-fire version of the [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] firing a 7.62x33mm cartridge. However, the semi-automatic M1 carbine was produced in a 10-to-1 ratio to the M2.

Although the [[NATO]] countries did not adopt an intermediate-power round, they continued the trend toward shorter and lighter [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]]-fed [[battle rifles]]. NATO adopted the [[7.62x51 NATO]] round (which in reality is only slightly different ballistically to the [[.308 Winchester]] and [[.303 British]] cartridges), along with several rifles such as the [[FN FAL]] and [[M14 rifle|M14]].

[[File:M855 drop during 25-meter zeroing trajectory M16A2 M4.jpg|thumb|right|Bullet drop of the M16A2 rifle (yellow) vs M4 carbiine (red)]]
By the 1960s NATO had adopted the [[5.56 NATO]] cartridge. This round was even lighter and smaller than the Soviet AK-47 cartridge, but possessed higher velocity. In U.S. service, the [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle replaced the M14 as the standard [[infantry]] weapon, although the M14 continued to be used by [[designated marksmen]].

Lighter carbines came to be adopted as the standard infantry long rifle. What changed was that only a certain number of soldiers now needed to retain longer range weapons, serving as designated marksmen. Development of lighter assault rifles continued, matched by developments in even lighter carbines. At the same time the infantry switched to 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm weapons, carbines like the [[AKS-74U]] (which fired a Warsaw pact [[5.45x39]] round) and [[CAR-15]] were being developed.

== Modern history ==
=== Contemporary military forces ===
By the 1990s, the US had adopted the [[M4 carbine]], a derivative of the M16 family which fired the same [[5.56]]mm cartridge but was lighter and shorter (in overall length and barrel length), resulting in marginally reduced range and power. 
[[Image:AUG A1 508mm 04.jpg|thumb|right|Steyr AUG ''rifle'' ({{convert|508|mm|in|1|sp=us|abbr=on}} barrel).]]
[[Image:AUG A1 407mm 03.jpg|thumb|right|Steyr AUG ''carbine'' ({{convert|407|mm|in|1|sp=us|abbr=on}} barrel). Carbine conversion is achieved by changing to a shorter barrel.]]

Meanwhile, many armies are experiencing a backlash against carbines and lighter rifles in general, and are equipping selected soldiers, usually called [[Designated marksman|Designated Marksmen]], or DM, with higher power rifles. While firing a higher quantity of smaller bullets makes it easier to hit a target (and is therefore good for beginner marksmen), it offers very little to more advanced marksmen. Furthermore, the additional range of the heavier weapons has proven to be necessary in open environments such as deserts. As a result, the focus on more highly trained soldiers equipped with, for example, 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm NATO firing rifles, such as the [[U.S. Marine Corps Designated Marksman Rifle]] variant of the [[M14 rifle|M14]], has increased somewhat. A squad of soldiers armed with assault rifles would have a single soldier assigned as DM who would carry a battle rifle for selectively engaging long range targets. The DM differs from the sniper in that the DM moves with his unit, and engages targets at ranges beyond the 500 meter (550 yd) effective range of modern assault rifles, but less than the 600 meter (650 yd) range which is the optimal engagement range for snipers.

=== Special operations forces ===
One bastion of the carbine which is unlikely to be unseated is the special operations forces of the world which need to perform fast, decisive operations. A pistol, though light and quick to operate, is viewed as not having enough power. Consequently, carbines have gained wide acceptance among [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] and other communities.

=== Personal defense weapons ===
In both civilian use and among the military's lighter armored soldiers, it is common to use a carbine. However, due to some of the reasons mentioned elsewhere in this article, such as muzzle blast and recoil, these carbines generally chamber lighter rounds than some of their heavier (or shorter) counterparts. Due to the low wounding power of a single round, personal defense weapons depend on high volumes of fire for effectiveness. This may make such carbines successful in military use. However, firing a pistol effectively at any significant range requires good training, since the absence of a buttstock makes precise ranged aim difficult.

In addition, due to the development of [[body armor]], support personnel required a compact weapon with more penetration than the traditional submachine gun, leading to the development of the [[personal defense weapon]], or PDW, which uses rounds that have better [[ballistics]] than simple pistol rounds but less power and range than full rifle rounds. Examples include the [[FN P90]] and [[HK MP7]]. Whether these ultra-light weapons will be widely adopted has yet to be seen. The cartridge used by the FN P90, the [[5.7x28mm|5.7 × 28 mm]], for example, fires a 2.0 g (31 grain) armor-piercing bullet at velocities of around 700&amp;nbsp;m/s (2300&amp;nbsp;ft/s). The H&amp;K MP7 fires an even smaller 4.6&amp;nbsp;mm round with ballistics similar to the .22 WMR derived [[.17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire]]. The small diameter rounds enable the projectile to travel at the high velocity needed to penetrate [[Kevlar]] armor, as a light weapon with sufficient energy to push a large caliber bullet through the armor would have prohibitive recoil. The small bullets are generally designed to tumble after penetration.

Some weapons designed for personal defense do still use full-power ammunition, for example the carbine version of the [[L85A2]] issued to British tank crews.

=== Future acceptance and use ===
[[File:M4A1-CQBR.jpg|thumb|right|Top: M4 carbine. Bottom: [[Close Quarters Battle Receiver]] a 'sub-carbine'.]]
To what extent armies will adopt even lighter carbines, and to what extent they will be avoided, has yet to be seen entirely. It is likely that harder hitting, or at least higher penetrating, weapons will become more common, due to a rise in use of body armor, making weaker weapons ineffective. Stacked against this is mainly the amount of urban warfare that is required, which favors lighter carbine weapons.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The modern usage of the term carbine covers much the same scope as it always had, namely lighter weapons (generally rifles) with barrels less than 457.2&amp;nbsp;mm (18&amp;nbsp;inches). These weapons can be considered carbines, while rifles with barrels of 508&amp;nbsp;mm (20&amp;nbsp;inches) or more are generally not considered carbines unless specifically named so, and depending on the weapon's power. Modern carbines use ammunition ranging from that used in light pistols up to powerful rifle cartridges, with the usual exception of high velocity magnum cartridges. In the more powerful cartridges, the short barrel of a carbine has significant disadvantages in velocity, and the high residual pressure when the bullet exits the barrel results in substantially greater [[Wiktionary:muzzle blast|muzzle blast]]. [[Flash suppressor]]s and [[muzzle brake]]s are common solutions to this problem, which may ease their acceptance.

== Usage ==
=== Pistol-caliber carbines ===
[[File:Marlin Model 1894C .357 Magnum.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Marlin Model 1894]]C &amp;mdash; .357 Magnum carbine]]

One of the more unusual classes of carbine is the pistol caliber carbine. These first appeared soon after metallic cartridges became common. These were developed as &quot;companions&quot; to the popular [[revolvers]] of the day, firing the same cartridge but allowing more velocity and accuracy than the revolver. These were carried by [[cowboys]], lawmen, and others in the [[Old West]]. The classic combination would be a [[Winchester rifle|Winchester]] lever action carbine and a [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] revolver in .44-40 or .38-40. During the 20th century, this trend continued with more modern and powerful revolver cartridges, in the form of [[Winchester Model 1894|Winchester]] and [[Marlin Model 1894|Marlin]] lever action carbines chambered in [[.38 Special]]/[[.357 Magnum]] and [[.44 Special]]/[[.44 Magnum]]. Another example is the [[DeLisle carbine]], a [[Suppressor|suppressed]] [[special operations]] carbine that was chambered for .45 ACP.

[[File:44-357-cartridges.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[.44 Magnum]] (left) and [[.357 Magnum]] cartridges]]

Modern equivalents also exist, such as the discontinued [[Ruger Police Carbine]], which uses the same magazine as the Ruger [[pistols]] of the same caliber, as well as the (also discontinued) [[Marlin Camp Carbine]] (which, in .45ACP, used 1911 magazines). The [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]] shares magazines with many [[Beretta]] pistols, and is designed to be complementary to the [[Beretta Px4 Storm]] pistol. The Hi-Point [[Hi-Point 995 Carbine|995 carbine]] is a cheaper alternative to other pistol caliber carbines in the [[United States]] and shares magazines with the [[Hi-Point C-9 and C-9 Comp|Hi-Point C-9]] pistol (although many owners report that early Hi-Point C-9 magazines are too short to function in the Model 995 Carbine). Other examples are the [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]] series which accepts Glock, Beretta and S&amp;W pistol magazines chambered in either 9&amp;nbsp;mm Luger or .40S&amp;W. The recent introduction of such products may indicate that there is a growing demand for these companion carbines.

[[File:Kel-Tec SUB-2000.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]] carbine in [[9x19mm Parabellum|9mm]].]]

The primary advantages of a pistol caliber carbine are increased accuracy due to the buttstock and longer barrel (and with it, sight radius), relatively low muzzle blast/flash/recoil, higher muzzle velocity and energy of a longer barrel for increased wounding potential and penetration (depending on the particular load used), and (sometimes, but not always) greater adaptability for easily accepting accessories such as optics, weaponlights, and lasers. Furthermore, PCCs may not be as legally restricted as comparable handguns, depending on the jurisdiction (for example, you need only be 18 in the US to purchase a rifle, but you must be at least 21 to purchase a handgun).

One less-noted advantage of PCCs is their lower muzzle report compared to more powerful rifles; because they are less noisy when fired, they are less likely to cause permanent hearing damage when fired indoor without hearing protection - this can be an important consideration during home defense situations.

Compared to &quot;regular&quot; carbines/rifles (such as those in .223 and 7.62x39mm), pistol-caliber carbines may suffer from a shorter effective range, more pronounced trajectory, less power, and less effectiveness against body armor.

Recently, kits have appeared on the market which consist of a carbine length barrel, bolt (usually [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]] operated), and stock that attach to a pistol frame. Attaching the pistol frame provides the feed mechanism (through the pistol's magazine) and trigger mechanism, and produces a completed carbine. Kits of this type are available for Colt [[M1911 Colt pistol|M1911]] pattern and [[Glock]] pistols.

=== Short barrelled rifles ===
[[File:Browning HP (Finnish) with stock.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Browning Hi-Power, made for the Finnish military, with attached shoulder stock to turn it into a short carbine]]
Firearms with shoulder stocks and barrels less than 406&amp;nbsp;mm (16&amp;nbsp;in) in length are classified as &quot;[[short barreled rifles]]&quot; (under the US [[National Firearms Act]] or '''NFA'''), and are sometimes restricted in the same way that [[Sawn-off shotgun|short barrel shotguns]] and [[machine gun]]s are. Because of this, rifles with barrels of less than 406&amp;nbsp;mm (16&amp;nbsp;in), or pistols with shoulder stocks, are rare. A list of firearms not covered by the NFA due to their antique status may be found here [http://www.atf.gov/firearms/curios/sec3a.htm] or due to their ''Curio and Relic'' status may be found here [http://www.atf.gov/firearms/curios/sec3.htm]; these lists includes a number of carbines with barrels less than the minimum legal length and firearms that are &quot;primarily collector's items and are not likely to be used as weapons and, therefore, are excluded from the provisions of the National Firearms Act. &quot; Firearms classified as [[machine gun]]s are also not subject to the barrel length restriction.

Kits exist which will convert many pistols into carbines by the addition of a shoulder stock; notable examples are the long barrelled [[Colt Buntline]] [[revolver]] stock, the [[Mauser C96]] &quot;Broomhandle&quot; holster/stock, and various others for models such as the [[Browning Hi-Power]], [[Luger pistol|Luger]], Colt [[M1911 Colt pistol|M1911]], and the [[Heckler &amp; Koch VP70]]. Since these stock additions retain the short pistol barrel (as short as 100&amp;nbsp;mm (4&amp;nbsp;inches)) they are highly restricted under the NFA unless the shoulder stocks are of original manufacture for the gun and the gun has been &quot;delisted&quot; as outlined in links 1 &amp; 2 in the paragraph above, as is the case with so-equipped &quot;Broomhandle&quot; Mausers and Lugers. Many pistols which had attachments for the stocks, including rare wartime models, were altered to remove the attachment point.

=== Other carbines ===
Another class of carbine is a semi-automatic version of a [[submachine gun]], with an extended barrel, usually just over 406&amp;nbsp;mm (16&amp;nbsp;inches) long, which will escape ban by some &quot;assault weapon&quot; legislation. While functionally identical to other carbines, these are banned in some places as &quot;assault weapons&quot; based on their cosmetic similarity to submachine guns. However, they may not accept certain parts (such as magazines or collapsing stocks) from the submachine guns they resemble. These are a popular compromise for (American) shooters who would like to own a submachine gun but cannot due to local restrictions or the prohibitive cost of buying a civilian legal submachine gun (full automatics or semi-automatics with barrels shorter than 16&amp;nbsp;inches are restricted under Title II of the [[National Firearms Act]]). Many owners may choose to shorten the barrels down to NFA-lengths, and register them as &quot;short barrel rifles&quot; [[National Firearms Act#Categories of Weapons Regulated|SBRs]].

Examples of PCCs that are derivatives of submachine guns but are rifles under Title I ([[Gun Control Act of 1968|Gun Control Act]]) include the [[HK USC]] (derived from the HK .45ACP UMP submachine gun), the HK94 (derived from the [[MP5]]), pistol-caliber AR-15s (such as the Bushmaster Carbon 15 9&amp;nbsp;mm Carbine), semi-automatic only versions of the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson]] by Auto-Ordnance and the FN PS90 (derived from the [[FN P90]] SMG). Unlike the above-mentioned PCCs, these carbines utilize either magazines from their SMG derivatives, or proprietary magazines (as in the case of the USC).

In some historical cases the term ''machine carbine'' was the official title for sub-machine guns, such as the British [[Sten]] and Australian [[Owen gun]]s. The semi-automatic only version of the [[Sterling submachine gun]] was also officially called a &quot;carbine&quot;. While the original Sterling semi-auto would be classed a &quot;short barrel rifle&quot; under the U.S. [[National Firearms Act]], fully legal long-barrel versions of the Sterling have been made for the U.S. collector market.

'''Chinese cuisine''' is any of several styles originating in the regions of [[China]], some of which have become highly popular in other parts of the world&amp;nbsp;– from [[Asia]] to the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[Western Europe]] and [[Southern Africa]].

==Staples==
===Rice===
In general, rice is the major food source for people from rice farming areas in southern China. It is most commonly eaten in the form of [[steamed rice]]. Rice is also used to produce [[beers]], [[baijiu|wine]]s and vinegars. In wheat farming areas in Northern China, people largely rely on flour based food such as [[noodles]], [[breads]], [[jiaozi|dumpling]]s and [[mantou|steamed buns]].&lt;ref name=Yao&gt;Yao, Zhang. ''China Everyday!''. Page One Pub. 2007. ISBN 9279812453303&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noodles===
Noodles come dry or fresh in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and are often served in soups and fried as toppings and some varieties such as [[Shou Mien]] (壽麵, literally noodles of longevity) are symbolic of long life and good health according to Chinese tradition.&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; [[Tofu]], made of [[soy beans]] is another popular product to supply protein.&lt;ref name=Hsieh&gt;J.

===Seasonings===
When comes to sauces, China is home to soy sauce which is made from fermented soya beans and wheat. Oyster sauce, transparent rice vinegar, Chinkiang black rice vinegar, fish sauce, [[furu|fermented tofu]](furu) are also widely used.

Spices and seasonings such as fresh root [[ginger]], [[garlic]], [[spring onion]], [[white pepper]], [[sesame oil]] are widely used in many regional cuisines. [[Sichuan peppercorn]]s, [[star anise]], [[cinnamon]], [[fennel]], [[clove]]s.&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/real_food/article4262148.ece Times Online Ching He Huang 10 basic ingredients for Chinese cooking]&lt;/ref&gt;

To give extra flavors to dishes, many Chinese cuisines also contain dried Chinese mushrooms, dried baby shrimps, dried tangerine peel,&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/02/garden/chinese-restaurants-are-adding-herbs-for-flavor-and-health.html Chinese Restaurants Are Adding Herbs for Flavor and Health] – ''[[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; dried Sichuan chillies as well.

a number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine, but perhaps the best known and most influential are [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuan cuisine]], [[Shandong cuisine]], [[Jiangsu cuisine]] and [[Guangdong cuisine|Guangdong (Cantonese) cuisine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yao&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.ku.edu/archived-site/chinese_food/regional_cuisine.html Regional chinese cuisines, edu site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/cuisine_drink/cuisine/eight_cuisines.htm Chinese Eight Cuisines]&lt;/ref&gt; These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as available resources, climate, [[Geography of China|geography]], [[History of China|history]], cooking techniques and lifestyle. One style may favour the use of lots of garlic and [[shallots]] over lots of chilli and spices, while another may favour preparing [[seafood]] over other meats and [[fowl]]. Jiangsu cuisine favours cooking techniques such as [[braising]] and stewing, while Sichuan cuisine employs baking, scalding, and wrapping, just to name a few.&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; Hairy [[crab]] is a highly sought after local delicacy in [[Shanghai]], as it can be found in lakes within the region. [[Beijing]] [[Peking Duck|Roast Duck]] (otherwise known as 'Peking Duck') is another popular dish which is well known outside China.&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; Based on the raw materials and ingredients used, the method of preparation, and cultural differences, a variety of foods with different flavours and textures are prepared in different regions of the country. Many traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of preservation such as drying, salting, [[pickling]] and [[fermentation]].&lt;ref name=Hsieh&gt;J. Li &amp; Y. Hsieh.

[[Dim Sum]], literally &quot;touch your heart&quot;,  is a [[Cantonese]] term for small hearty dishes.&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; These bite-sized portions are prepared using traditional cooking methods such as frying, steaming, stewing and baking. It is designed so that one person may taste a variety of different dishes. Some of these may include [[Rice noodle roll|rice rolls]], [[Lo mai gai|lotus leaf rice]], [[turnip cake]]s, buns, shui [[jiaozi|jiao]]-style dumplings, [[stir-fry|stir-fried]] green vegetables, [[congee]] [[porridge]], soups, etc. The Cantonese style of dining, [[yum cha]], combines the variety of dim sum dishes with the drinking of [[tea]].

As well as with dim sum, many Chinese drink their tea with snacks such as nuts, plums, dried fruit, small sweets, melon seeds, and [[waxberry]].&lt;ref name=Yao /&gt; China was the earliest country to cultivate and drink tea and it is enjoyed by people from all social classes.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;Q.

Some of these are [[green tea]], [[oolong tea]], black tea, scented tea, [[white tea]], and [[compressed tea]]. There are four major [[tea plantation]] regions in China. They are [[Jiangbei]], [[Jiangnan]], [[Huanan]] and the southwestern region.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; Well known types of green tea include [[Longjing]], [[Huangshan]], [[Mao Feng]], [[Bilochun]], [[Putuofeng Cha]], and [[Liu'an Guapian]].&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;Zonglin Chang Xukui Li.

In most dishes in Chinese cuisine, food is prepared in bite-sized pieces, ready for direct picking up and eating. In traditional Chinese cultures, [[chopsticks]] are used at the table.

Traditional Chinese cuisine is also based on [[Yin and yang|opposites]], whereby hot balances cold, pickled balances fresh and spicy balances mild.

According to [[United Nations|the United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] estimates for 2001–2003, 12% of the population of the People’s Republic of China was undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Country Profiles|work=Statistical yearbook|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2008-04-25
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of undernourished people in the country has fallen from 386.6 million in 1969–1971 to 150.0 million in 2001–2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the increased industrialization and modernization following the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 (and the [[Great Chinese Famine|late 1950s famine]]), a typical Chinese peasant would have eaten meat or animal products (including eggs) rarely and most meals would have consisted of rice accompanied with [[green vegetables]], with protein coming from foods like [[peanut]]s and [[soy]] products. Fats and sugar were luxuries not eaten on a regular basis by most of the population. With increasing wealth, Chinese diets have become richer over time, consuming more meats, fats, and sugar.

==Variations==
Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. 

This has resulted in a number of forms of [[fusion cuisine]], often very popular in the country in question, and some of these, such as [[ramen]] (Japanese Chinese) have become popular internationally. These include:
* [[American Chinese cuisine]]
* [[Canadian Chinese cuisine]]
* [[Indian Chinese cuisine]]
* [[Japanese Chinese cuisine]]
* [[Korean Chinese cuisine]]
* [[Pakistani Chinese cuisine]]

'''Constantin Brâncuşi''' or '''Brâncuş''' ({{IPA-ro|konstanˈtin brɨnˈkuʃʲ}}; February 19, 1876 &amp;ndash; March 16, 1957) was a [[Romania]]n-born [[sculpture|sculptor]] who made his career in [[France]]. As a child he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden [[farm tool]]s. Formal studies took him first to [[Bucharest]], then to [[Munich]], then to the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. His [[abstract art|abstract style]] emphasizes clean [[geometry|geometrical lines]] that balance forms inherent in his materials with the [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic allusions]] of [[representational art]]. Famous Brâncuşi works include the ''Sleeping Muse'' (1908), ''[[The Kiss (Brancusi)|The Kiss]]'' (1908), ''Prometheus'' (1911), ''Mademoiselle Pogany'' (1913), ''The Newborn'' (1915), ''[[Bird in Space]]'' (1919) and ''[[Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuşi at Târgu Jiu|The Column of the Infinite (Coloana infinitului)]]'', popularly known as ''The Endless Column'' (1938). Considered the pioneer of [[modernism]] Brâncuşi is called the ''Patriarch of Modern Sculpture''.

==Early years==
Brâncuşi grew up in the village of [[Peştişani|Hobiţa]] Romania, [[Gorj County|Gorj]], near [[Târgu Jiu]], close to Romania's [[Carpathian Mountains]], an area known for its rich tradition of [[folk art|folk crafts]], particularly woodcarving. Geometric patterns of the region are seen in his later works.

His parents Nicolae and Maria Brâncuşi were poor peasants who earned a meager living through back-breaking labor; from the age of seven, Constantin herded the family's flock of sheep. He showed talent for carving objects out of wood, and often ran away from home to escape the bullying of his father and older brothers.

At the age of nine, Brâncuşi left the village to work in the nearest large town. At 11 he went into the service of a grocer in Slatina; and then he became a domestic in a public house in Craiova where he remained for several years. When he was 18, impressed by Brâncuşi's talent for carving, an industrialist entered him in the Craiova School of Arts and Crafts (Şcoala de meserii), where he pursued his love for woodworking, graduating with honors in 1898.&lt;ref name=brainjuice&gt;[http://www.brain-juice.com/cgi-bin/show_bio.cgi?p_id=108 &quot;Constantin Brâncuşi&quot;] at brainjuice.com. (Accessed March 27, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;

He then enrolled in the Bucharest School of Fine Arts, where he received academic training in sculpture. He worked hard, and quickly distinguished himself as talented. One of his earliest surviving works, under the guidance of his anatomy teacher, [[Dimitrie Gerota]], is a masterfully rendered [[écorché]] (statue of a man with skin removed to reveal the muscles underneath) which was exhibited at the [[Romanian Athenaeum]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brezianu&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.2307/774863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though just an anatomical study, it foreshadowed the sculptor's later efforts to reveal essence rather than merely copy outward appearance.

==Working in Paris==
[[File:Atelier-brancusi.jpg|thumb|Atelier Brâncuşi in [[Paris]]]]
[[File:Atelier-brancusi-2.jpg|thumb|Brâncuşi works in Atelier Brâncuşi, Paris]]
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Brancusi.jpg|thumb|&quot;Newborn&quot;, 1915]] --&gt;

In 1903 Brâncuşi traveled to [[Munich]], and from there to [[Paris]]. In Paris, he was welcomed by the community of artists and intellectuals brimming with new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/euwf/hod_1996.403.7ab.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art website]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for two years in the workshop of [[Antonin Mercié]] of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and was invited to enter the workshop of [[Auguste Rodin]]. Even though he admired the eminent Rodin he left the Rodin studio after only two months, saying, &quot;Nothing can grow under big trees.&quot;&lt;ref name=brainjuice/&gt;

After leaving Rodin's workshop, Brâncuşi began developing the revolutionary style for which he is known. His first commissioned work, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, was part of a gravestone memorial. It depicts a young woman crossing herself as she kneels, and marks the first step toward abstracted, non-literal representation, and shows his drive to depict &quot;not the outer form but the idea, the essence of things.&quot; He also began doing more carving, rather than the method popular with his contemporaries, that of modeling in clay or plaster which would be cast in metal, and by 1908 he worked almost exclusively by carving.

[[Image:Romania 20060512 - Tirgu Jiu - Coloana fara sfarsit.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&quot;[[The Endless Column]]&quot; in Târgu Jiu, Romania, as restored after 2000]]

In the following few years he made many versions of &quot;Sleeping Muse&quot; and &quot;[[The Kiss (Brâncuşi sculpture)|The Kiss]]&quot;, further simplifying forms to geometrical and sparse objects.

His works became popular in France, Romania and the United States. Collectors, notably [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], bought his pieces, and reviewers praised his works. In 1913 Brâncuşi's work was displayed at both the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and the first exhibition in the U.S. of modern art, the [[Armory Show]].

In 1920 he developed a notorious reputation with the entry of &quot;Princess X&quot; [http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html] in the [[Salon des Indépendants|Salon]]. The phallic shape of the piece scandalized the Salon, and despite Brâncuşi's explanation that it was an anonymous portrait, removed it from the exhibition. &quot;Princess X&quot; was revealed to be [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], direct descendant of the younger brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Brâncuşi represented or caricatured her life as a large gleaming bronze [[phallus]]. This phallus symbolizes the model's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm, with the help of [[Sigmund Freud]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Around this time he began crafting the bases for his sculptures with much care and originality because he considered them important to the works themselves.

He began working on the group of sculptures that are known as &quot;Bird in Space&quot; — simple shapes representing a bird in flight. The works are based on his earlier &quot;Măiastra&quot; [http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/dettagli/brancusi_maiastra.html] series. In Romanian folklore the Măiastra is a beautiful golden bird who foretells the future and cures the blind. Over the following 20 years, Brâncuşi would make 20-some versions of &quot;Bird in Space&quot; out of marble or bronze.
Photographer [[Edward Steichen]] purchased one of the &quot;birds&quot; in 1926 and shipped it to the [[United States]]. However, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|customs]] officers did not accept the &quot;bird&quot; as a work of art and placed a duty upon its import as an industrial item. They charged the high tax placed upon raw metals instead of the no tax on art. A trial the next year overturned the assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubmoral.com/forcemental/16/page.php?sid=139 Force Metal ezine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin: ''Duchamp: A Biography'', pages 272, 275, 318. Henry Holt and Company, Inc, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athena Tacha]] Spear's book, ''Brâncuşi's Birds,'' (CAA monographs XXI, NYU Press, New York, 1969), first sorted out the 36 versions and their development, from the early ''Măiastra'', to the ''Golden Bird'' of the late teens, to the ''Bird in Space'', which emerged in the early '20s and which Brâncuşi perfected throughout his life.

His work became popular in the U.S., however, and he visited several times during his life. Worldwide fame in 1933 brought him the commission of building a meditation temple in India for Maharajah of Indore, but when Brâncuşi went to India in 1937 to complete the plans and begin construction, the Mahrajah was away and lost interest in the project when he returned.

In 1938, he finished the [[World War I]] monument in [[Târgu-Jiu]] where he had spent much of his childhood. &quot;Table of Silence&quot;, &quot;The Gate of the Kiss&quot;, and &quot;[[Endless Column]]&quot; commemorate the courage and sacrifice of Romanian civilians who in 1916 fought off a German invasion. The restoration of this ensemble was spearheaded by the [[World Monuments Fund]] and was completed in 2004.

The [[Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuşi at Târgu Jiu|Târgu Jiu ensemble]] marks the apex of his artistic career. In his remaining 19 years he created less than 15 pieces, mostly reworking earlier themes, and while his fame grew he withdrew. In 1956 [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]] reported, &quot;Wearing white pajamas and a yellow gnomelike cap, Brâncuşi today hobbles about his studio tenderly caring for and communing with the silent host of fish birds, heads, and endless columns which he created.&quot;

Brâncuşi was cared for in his later years by a Romanian refugee couple. He became a French citizen in 1952 in order to make the caregivers his heirs, and to bequeath his studio and its contents to the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris

==Personal life==
[[Image:'Sleeping Muse', bronze sculpture by Constantin Brancusi, 1910, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|''Sleeping Muse,'' 1910, bronze, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
&lt;!-- [[Image:Brancusi-Torso.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Brâncuşi's &quot;Torso of Young Man&quot;, 1924, Gift of [[Joseph H. Hirshhorn]], 1966, [[Hirshhorn Museum]], (66.611) Washington, D.C..]] --&gt;
Brâncuşi always dressed in the simple ways the Romanian peasants did. His studio was reminiscent of the houses of the peasants from his native region: there was a big slab of rock as a table and a primitive fireplace, similar to those found in traditional houses in his native [[Oltenia]], while the rest of the furniture was made by him out of wood. Brâncuși would cook his own food, [[Romanian cuisine|traditional Romanian dishes]], with which he would treat his guests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandqvist, p. 249&quot;&gt;Sandqvist, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncuşi held a large spectrum of interests, from science to music. He was a good [[violin]]ist and he would sing old Romanian folk songs, often expressing by them his feelings of homesickness. Nevertheless, he never considered moving back to his native Romania, but he did visit it eight times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandqvist, p. 249&quot;/&gt;

His circle of friends included artists and intellectuals in Paris such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[Henri Pierre Roché]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Man Ray]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Henri Rousseau]], and [[Fernand Léger]]. He was an old friend of [[Romany Marie]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;&gt;Robert Shulman. ''[[Romany Marie]]: The Queen of [[Greenwich Village]]'' (pp. 85-86, 109).  [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]: Butler Books, 2006.  ISBN 1-88453-274-8.&lt;/ref&gt; who was also [[Romania]]n, and referred [[Isamu Noguchi]] to her [[café]] in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haber&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haberarts.com/fuller.htm |title= Before Buckyballs |author= [[John Haber]] |publisher= Review of [[Noguchi Museum]]'s ''Best of Friends'' exhibition (2006) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although surrounded by the Parisian avant-garde, Brâncuși never lost the contact with Romania and had friends from the community of Romanian artists and intellectuals living in Paris, including [[Benjamin Fondane]], [[George Enescu]], [[Theodor Pallady]], [[Camil Ressu]], [[Nicolae Dărăscu]], [[Panait Istrati]], [[Traian Vuia]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Paul Celan]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p. 249-250&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncuşi held a particular interest in mythology, especially Romanian mythology, folk tales, and traditional art (which also had a strong influence on his works), but he became interested in African and Mediterranean art as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

A talented handyman, he built his own phonograph, and made most of his furniture, utensils, and doorways. His worldview valued &quot;differentiating the essential from the ephemeral,&quot; with [[Plato]], [[Lao-Tzu]], and [[Milarepa]] as influences. He was a saint-like idealist and near ascetic, turning his workshop into a place where visitors noted the deep spiritual atmosphere. However, particularly through the 10s and 20s, he was known as a pleasure seeker and merrymaker in his [[bohemianism|bohemian]] circle. He enjoyed cigarettes, good wine, and the company of women. He had one child, John Moore, whom he never acknowledged.&lt;ref name=brainjuice/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1686039 |title= Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) |publisher= [[Christie's]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Le Baiser de Brâncuşi.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[The Kiss (Brancusi)|The Kiss]]'' on a grave in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]
[[File:ROL 500 1991 reverse.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Constantin Brâncuşion the 500 [[Romanian leu|leu]] Romanian banknote (1991–1992 issue)]]
He died on March 16, 1957 at the age of 81 leaving 1200 photographs and 215 sculptures. He was buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris. Also located in that cemetery are statues carved by Brâncuşi for several fellow artists who died; the best-known of these is &quot;Le Baiser&quot; (&quot;The Kiss&quot;).

His works are housed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] ([[New York City|New York]]), the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] ([[Bucharest]]), and the [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]]), as well as in other major museums around the world. The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] currently has the largest collection of Brâncuşi sculptures in the United States.

A reconstruction of Brâncuşi's onetime studio in Paris is open to the public. It is close to the [[Pompidou Centre]], in the rue Rambuteau. After being refused by the Romanian Communist government, he bequeathed part of his collection to the [[France|French state]] on condition that his workshop be rebuilt as it was on the day he died.

Brâncuşi was elected posthumously to the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanian Academy member&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 2002, a sculpture by Brâncuşi named &quot;[[Danaide]]&quot; was sold for [[United States dollar|$]]18.1 million, the highest that a sculpture piece had ever sold for at auction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danaide auction&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In the [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]]/Pierre Bergé sale on February 23, 2009, another sculpture of Brâncuşi, &quot;Madame L.R.&quot;, was sold for €29.185 million ($37.2 million), setting a new historical record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Madame L R auction&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Both ''[[Bird in Space]]'' and ''Sleeping Muse I'' are sculptures of animate objects; however, unlike ones from Ancient Greece or Rome, or those from the High Renaissance period, these works of art are more abstract in style.

''Bird in Space'' is a series from the 1920s. One of these, constructed in 1925 using wood, stone, and marble (Richler 178) stands around 72&amp;nbsp;inches tall and consists of a narrow feather standing erect on a wooden base. Similar models, but made from materials such as bronze, were also produced by Brâncuşi and placed in exhibitions.

''Sleeping Muse I'' has different versions as well; one, from 1909–10, is made of marble and measures 6 ¾ in. in height (Adams 549). This is a model of a head, without a body, with markings to show features such as hair, nose, lips, and closed eyes. In ''A History of Western Art'', Adams says that the sculpture has “an abstract, curvilinear quality and a smooth contour that create an impression of elegance” (549). The qualities which produce the effect can particularly be seen in the shape of the eyes and in the set of the mouth.

'''Claus Sluter''' (born 1340s in [[Haarlem]] &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&amp;database=ChoiceArtists&amp;search=priref=203655] Netherlands Institute for Art History &lt;/ref&gt;; died in 1405 or 1406, [[Dijon]]) was a sculptor of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Murray, P. &amp; L. | year = 1997 | title = Penguin dictionary of art and artists | edition = 7th edition | pages = 492 | location = London | publisher = Penguin Books | isbn = 0-14-051300-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the most important northern European sculptor of his age and is considered a pioneer of the &quot;northern realism&quot; of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] that came into full flower with the work of [[Jan van Eyck]] and others in the next generation.

Sluter probably worked in [[Brussels]] before moving to the Burgundian capital of [[Dijon]], where from 1385 to 1389 he was the assistant of [[Jean de Marville]], Court Sculptor to [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. From 1389 to his death he was Court Sculptor himself, with the rank of ''[[valet de chambre]]''. He was succeeded by his nephew [[Claus de Werve]].

He restored the monumental scale and naturalism of the classical era to figural sculpture.  His later work is highly emotional, using facial expressions, figural stance, and drapery; this can be particularly seen in the heavy folds of cloth that so many later imitators draped around their figures. His most famous surviving work is the ''[[Well of Moses]]'' (1395–1403), created for the [[Carthusian]] [[monastery]] of [[Champmol]] built by Philip the Bold just outside Dijon (at the time - now part of the city). Sluter was also responsible for the main part of the work on [[Champmol#Tombs_of_the_Dukes|Philip's tomb]], which (restored and partly reconstructed) has been moved to the former ducal palace in Dijon.

'''Cadillac''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|d|əl|æ|k}}) is a city in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]] and is the [[county seat]] of [[Wexford County, Michigan|Wexford County]].{{GR|6}} As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], the city population was 10,000. The city is situated at the junction of [[U.S. Route 131|US 131]], [[M-55 (Michigan highway)|M-55]] and [[M-115 (Michigan highway)|M-115]]. Approximately five miles north-northwest of Cadillac lies the geographic center of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/mi_geography.htm Michigan Geography from NETSTATE]. ''[http://www.netstate.com/ NETSTATE].'' Retrieved on January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadillac became the county seat after the so-called &quot;Battle of Manton,&quot; in which a show of force was involved in enforcing a controversial decision to move the county seat from [[Manton, Michigan]].

==History==
===Village of Clam Lake===
Although [[European colonization of the Americas|European explorers]] and traders visited the area since the 18th century, permanent white communities were not established until some time later.{{When|date=March 2009}} Initial settlements were connected with the logging industry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In 1871, Cadillac's first [[sawmill]] began operations. Originally called the Pioneer Mill, it was built by John R. Yale.{{Failed verification|date=July 2008}} That same year, George A. Mitchell, a prominent Cadillac banker and railroad entrepreneur, and Adam Gallinger, a local carpenter, formed the Clam Lake Canal Improvement and Construction Company. Two years later, the Clam Lake Canal was constructed between Big and Little Clam lakes, present-day Lakes Mitchell and [[Lake Cadillac|Cadillac]]. Sawmill owners used the canal to transport timber from Big Clam Lake to the mills and railroad sites—{{Failed verification|date=July 2008}}the [[Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad|G.R. &amp; I. Railroad]] had reached the area in 1872—on Little Clam Lake, in Cadillac.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;&gt;Schindler, Kurt H.

Cadillac was originally named '''Clam Lake''' and was incorporated as a village in 1874. George Mitchell was elected the first mayor.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; The village was incorporated as a city in 1877 and renamed Cadillac, after [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]], a Frenchman who made the first permanent settlement at [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1701.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadillac-mi.net/profile_history.php City of Cadillac, History].

===Battle of Manton===
The Wexford County seat of government, originally located in Sherman, was moved to [[Manton, Michigan|Manton]] in 1881, as the result of a compromise between the feuding residents of Cadillac and Sherman. Cadillac partisans, however, won the county seat by county-wide vote in April 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; The day following the election a sheriff's posse left the city for Manton by special train to seize the county records. After arriving and collecting a portion of the materials, however, an angry crowd confronted the Cadillac men and drove them from the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle&quot;&gt;[http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/battling-for-the-county-seat/ Battling for the County Seat]. ''[http://www.absolutemichigan.com/ Absolute Michigan].'' Retrieved on January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the sheriff returned to Cadillac, a force consisting of several hundred armed men was assembled; this group reportedly included a brass band. The Sheriff's force, some of whom may have been intoxicated, traveled back to Manton to seize the remaining records. Although Manton residents confronted the Cadillac men and barricaded the courthouse, the posse successfully seized the documents and returned to Cadillac.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle&quot;/&gt;

In October 1975 the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] visited Cadillac and performed at the Cadillac High School gymnasium. They played the concert to honor the [[Cadillac High School]] football team. In previous years, the team had compiled a record of sixteen consecutive victories, but the 1974 squad opened the season with two losses. The assistant coach, Jim Neff, an English teacher and [[rock'n'roll]] fan, thought to inspire the team by playing Kiss music in the locker room. He also connected the team's game plan, K-I-S-S or &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid&quot;, with the band. The team went on to win seven straight games and their conference co-championship. After learning of their association with the team's success, the band decided to visit the school and play for the homecoming game.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Fannie (1996).

===Historic Landmarks===
Cadillac maintains a number of state historic landmarks. Most are marked with a green &quot;Michigan Historical Marker&quot; sign that includes a description of the landmark. There are six markers within the city limits: 'Cadillac [[Carnegie Library]],' 'Charles T. Mitchell House,' 'Clam Lake Canal,' 'Cobbs &amp; Mitchell Building,' 'Cobbs &amp; Mitchell No. 1' and the 'Shay Locomotive,' which is pictured at the right. Two more are in the near Cadillac area ('Caberfae Ski Resort' and 'Greenwood Disciples of Christ Church') and another two are dispersed in surrounding Wexford County ('Battle of Manton' and '1st Wexford County Court House').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michmarkers.com/Frameset.htm Michigan Historical Markers] See &quot;Wexford County.&quot; Retrieved on January 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 8.6 square miles (22.3&amp;nbsp;km²), of which 6.8 square miles (17.7&amp;nbsp;km²) is land and 1.8 square miles (4.6&amp;nbsp;km²) (20.70%) is water.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The lakes were connected by a stream which was replaced in 1873 by the [[Clam Lake Canal]]. The canal was featured on [[Ripley's Believe It or Not]] in the 1970s due to the phenomenon that in winter the canal freezes before the lakes and then after the lakes freeze, the canal thaws and remains unfrozen for the rest of the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadillacmichigan.com/pages.php?tabid=9&amp;pageid=37&amp;title=Frequently+Asked+Questions#4 Cadillac Area Visitors Bureau, FAQ].

Cadillac sits on the eastern edge of the [[Manistee National Forest]] and the surrounding area is heavily wooded with mixed hardwood and conifer forests. A main agricultural industry in the area is [[Christmas tree]] [[tree farm|farming]]. In fact, Cadillac was chosen in 1988 to donate the Holiday tree to sit on the lawn of the [[U.S. Capitol building]] in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=cadillacyesterday/&gt;

The area surrounding Cadillac is primarily rural, and is considered to be part of [[Northern Michigan]].

The city center is in fact only one block from Lake Cadillac and, by docking at the public docks, is as nearly accessible by boat as it is by car. The city’s immediate proximity to two lakes, as well as [[Manistee National Forest]], [[Pere Marquette State Forest]], [[Mitchell State Park]] and a number of major highways ensures that tourism occupies a significant sector of the local economy.&lt;ref name=cadillacyesterday/&gt;

During the winter months Lake Cadillac and Lake Mitchell freeze over and the city becomes covered with snow.

Cadillac is also known as '''Chestnut Town, USA'''. The local area is home to a relatively large number of [[American chestnut]] trees, planted by pioneers from New York and Pennsylvania who settled in western Michigan. A [[chestnut blight|blight]] in the early 20th century wiped out nearly every American Chestnut tree, but those in western Michigan developed a mysterious resistance and survived. The Cadillac '''Chestnut Harvest Festival''' is held every year, on the second Saturday of October.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbright, Dennis (2003) [http://www.icserv.com/nnga/chstfest.htm Cadillac Chestnut Harvest Festival.] [http://www.icserv.com/nnga/ Northern Nut Growers Association, Inc.] Retrieved on January 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lou Gehrig's Disease==
Based on a single, limited study involving twenty people, some people have labelled Cadillac as one of three &quot;hot spots&quot; for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's Disease]] in the US.

The study was designed to examine the possible occurrence of the disease due to genetic influences. The occurrence of the disease within the city limits of Cadillac is reportedly over 100 times the normal rate. The cause of the abnormally large occurrence of the disease in Cadillac is as of yet unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, Frank (March 14, 2003).

'''COINTELPRO''' (an acronym for '''Co'''unter '''Intel'''ligence '''Pro'''gram) was a series of [[Covert operation|covert]], and often illegal&lt;ref name=&quot;church-final-report&quot;&gt;Church Committee Report: INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND THE RIGHTS OF AMERICANS, BOOK II FINAL REPORT Section A. VIOLATING AND IGNORING THE LAW, http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIca.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, projects conducted by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic [[political organizations]].

COINTELPRO tactics included discrediting targets through psychological warfare, planting false reports in the media, smearing through forged letters, harassment, wrongful imprisonment, extralegal violence and [[assassination]]. Covert operations under COINTELPRO took place between 1956 and 1971; however, the FBI has used covert operations against domestic political groups since its inception.&lt;ref name=&quot;churchill-vanderwall-1990a&quot;&gt;Churchill, Ward, and Jim Vander Wall, (1990), ''The COINTELPRO Papers: Documents from the FBI’s Secret Wars Against Domestic Dissent,'' Boston: South End Press, pp. xii, 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI's stated motivation at the time was &quot;protecting [[national security]], preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social and political order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIa.htm COINTELPRO: The FBI's Covert Action Programs Against American Citizens, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Acti...]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
COINTELPRO began in 1956 and was designed to &quot;increase factionalism, cause disruption and win defections&quot; inside the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party U.S.A.]] (CPUSA). However, the program was soon enlarged to include disruption of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (1961), the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (1964), the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[Black Panther Party]] (1967), and the entire [[New Left]] social/political movement, which included antiwar, community, and religious groups (1968). A later investigation by the Senate's [[Church Committee]] (see below) stated that &quot;COINTELPRO began in 1956, in part because of frustration with Supreme Court rulings limiting the Government's power to proceed overtly against dissident groups...&quot;&lt;ref name= cfr3a&gt;{{cite web

737&amp;nbsp;F.2d 1 (1984); ''[[Rugiero v. U.S. Dept. of Justice]]'', 257&amp;nbsp;F.3d 534, 546 (2001).{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; later {{When|date=April 2010}}concluded that the COINTELPRO operations against communist and socialist groups exceeded statutory limits on FBI activity and violated constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and association.

===Program exposed===
The program was successfully kept secret until 1971, when a group of left-wing radicals calling themselves the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]] burgled an FBI field office in [[Media, Pennsylvania|Media]], [[Pennsylvania]], took several dossiers and exposed the program by passing this information to [[news]] agencies. Many news organizations initially refused to publish the information. Within the year, Director [[J. Edgar Hoover|Hoover]] declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over, and that all future [[counterintelligence]] operations would be handled on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO]. Retrieved July 13, 2007. {{Wayback|url=http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html|date =20070928104133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further documents were revealed in the course of separate lawsuits filed against the FBI by [[NBC]] correspondent Carl Stern, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], and a number of other groups. A major investigation was launched in 1976 by the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate, commonly referred to as the &quot;[[Church Committee]]&quot; for its chairman, Senator [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]]. However, millions of pages of documents remain unreleased, and many released documents have been partly, or entirely, redacted.

In the Final Report of the Select Committee, COINTELPRO was castigated in no uncertain terms:

:Many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity, but COINTELPRO went far beyond that...the Bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of First Amendment rights of speech and association, on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence.&lt;ref name= cfr3a/&gt;

The Church Committee documented a history of use of the agency for purposes of [[political repression]] as far back as [[World War I]], through the 1920s, when agents were charged with rounding up &quot;anarchists and revolutionaries&quot; for deportation, and then building from 1936 through 1976.

==Range of targets==
In an interview with the [[BBC]]'s [[Andrew Marr]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor of linguistics and political activist [[Noam Chomsky]] spoke about the purpose and the targets of COINTELPRO saying, &quot;COINTELPRO was a program of subversion carried out not by a couple of petty crooks but by the national political police, the FBI, under four administrations... by the time it got through, I won't run through the whole story, it was aimed at the entire new left, at the women's movement, at the whole black movement, it was extremely broad. Its actions went as far as political assassination.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG24vg8js4o Video] at [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Church Committee:

:While the declared purposes of these programs were to protect the &quot;national security&quot; or prevent violence, Bureau witnesses admit that many of the targets were nonviolent and most had no connections with a foreign power. Indeed, nonviolent organizations and individuals were targeted because the Bureau believed they represented a &quot;potential&quot; for violence -- and nonviolent citizens who were against the war in Vietnam were targeted because they gave &quot;aid and comfort&quot; to violent demonstrators by lending respectability to their cause.

:The imprecision of the targeting is demonstrated by the inability of the Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included &quot;a great number of organizations that you might not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black.&quot; Thus, the nonviolent Southern Christian Leadership Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-&quot;Hate Group.&quot;

:Furthermore, the actual targets were chosen from a far broader group than the titles of the programs would imply. The CPUSA program targeted not only Communist Party members but also sponsors of the [[National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee]] and civil rights leaders allegedly under Communist influence or deemed to be not sufficiently &quot;anti-Communist&quot;. The Socialist Workers Party program included non-SWP sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance, its youth group. The Black Nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the Panthers to SNCC to the peaceful Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and included every Black Student Union and many other black student groups. New Left targets ranged from the SDS to the InterUniversity Committee for Debate on Foreign Policy, from [[Antioch College]] (&quot;vanguard of the New Left&quot;) to the New Mexico Free University and other &quot;alternate&quot; schools, and from underground newspapers to students' protesting university censorship of a student publication by carrying signs with four-letter words on them.

Examples of surveillance, spanning all Presidents from FDR to Nixon, both legal and illegal, contained in the Church Committee report:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] asked the FBI to put in its files the names of citizens sending telegrams to the White House opposing his &quot;national defense&quot; policy and supporting Col. [[Charles Lindbergh]].

* [[Harry S Truman|President Truman]] received inside information on a former Roosevelt aide's efforts to influence his appointments, labor union negotiating plans, and the publishing plans of journalists.

* [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] received reports on purely political and social contacts with foreign officials by Bernard Baruch, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.

* The [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] had the FBI wiretap a congressional staff member, three executive officials, a lobbyist, and a Washington law firm. [[US Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] received the fruits of an FBI &quot;tap&quot; on [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and a &quot;bug&quot; on a Congressman, both of which yielded information of a political nature.

* [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson]] asked the FBI to conduct &quot;name checks&quot; of his critics and members of the staff of his 1964 opponent, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]. He also requested purely political intelligence on his critics in the Senate, and received extensive intelligence reports on political activity at the [[1964 Democratic Convention]] from FBI electronic surveillance.

* [[Richard M. Nixon|President Nixon]] authorized a program of wiretaps which produced for the White House purely political or personal information unrelated to national security, including information about a Supreme Court justice.

The COINTELPRO documents disclose numerous cases of the FBI's intentions to stop the mass protest against the Vietnam War. Many techniques were used to accomplish the assignment. &quot;These included promoting splits among antiwar forces, encouraging [[red-baiting]] of socialists, and pushing violent confrontations as an alternative to massive, peaceful demonstrations.&quot; One 1966 Cointelpro operation attempted to redirect the Socialist Workers Party from their pledge of support for the antiwar movement.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, Nelson. ''COINTELPRO: The FBI's Secret War on Political Freedom'', Pathfinder, New York. 1975. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI claims that it no longer undertakes COINTELPRO or COINTELPRO-like operations. However, critics claim that agency programs in the spirit of COINTELPRO targeted groups such as the [[Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador]],&lt;ref&gt;Gelbspan, Ross.

According to attorney Brian Glick in his book ''War at Home'', the FBI used four main methods during COINTELPRO:
# Infiltration: Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit and disrupt. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.
# Psychological Warfare From the Outside: The FBI and police used a myriad of other &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to undermine progressive movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials and others to cause trouble for activists.
# Harassment Through the Legal System: The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, &quot;investigative&quot; interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIc.htm The FBI'S Covert Action Program to Destroy the Black Panther Party]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Extralegal Force and Violence: The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Secrets 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;itsabouttimebpp.com&quot;/&gt; The object was to frighten, or eliminate, dissidents and disrupt their movements.

The FBI specifically developed tactics intended to heighten tension and hostility between various factions in the black militancy movement, for example between the Black Panthers, the US Organization and the Blackstone Rangers. This resulted in numerous deaths, among which were the US Organization assassinations of San Diego Black Panther Party members John Huggins, Bunchy Carter and Sylvester Bell.&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot;/&gt;

The FBI also conspired with the police departments of many U.S. cities (San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago) to encourage repeated raids on Black Panther homes—often with little or no evidence of violations of federal, state, or local laws—which resulted directly in the police killing of many members of the Black Panther Party, most notably the assassination of Chicago Black Panther Party Chairman [[Fred Hampton]] on December 4, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;icdc.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Secrets 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;itsabouttimebpp.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Elaine. ''A Taste of Power: A Black Woman’s Story.'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992, pp204-06&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to eliminate black militant leaders whom they considered dangerous, the FBI conspired with local police departments to target specific individuals,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/doc156.gif&lt;/ref&gt; accuse them of crimes they did not commit, suppress exculpatory evidence and falsely incarcerate them. One Black Panther Party leader, [[Elmer Pratt|Elmer &quot;Geronimo&quot; Pratt]], was incarcerated for 27 years before a California Superior Court vacated his murder conviction, ultimately freeing him. Appearing before the court, an FBI agent testified that he believed Pratt had been framed because both the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department knew he had been out of the area at the time the murder occurred.

In 1969 the FBI special agent in San Francisco wrote Hoover that his investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) revealed that in his city, at least, the Black nationalists were primarily feeding breakfast to children. Hoover fired back a memo implying the career ambitions of the agent were directly related to his supplying evidence to support Hoover's view that the BPP was &quot;a violence-prone organization seeking to overthrow the Government by revolutionary means&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;FBI document, 27 May 1969, Director FBI to SAC San Francisco. Available at the FBI reading room.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover was willing to use false claims to attack his political enemies. In one memo he wrote: &quot;Purpose of counterintelligence action is to disrupt the [[Black Panther Party|BPP]] and it is immaterial whether facts exist to substantiate the charge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;FBI document, 16 September 1970, Director FBI to SAC's in Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, New Haven, San Francisco, and Washington Field Office.

In one particularly controversial 1965 incident, civil rights worker [[Viola Liuzzo]] was murdered by [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen who gave chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was acknowledged FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Informant&quot;&gt;Gary May, The Informant: The FBI, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Luzzo, Yale University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063001422_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Jonathan Yardley | accessdate=April 30, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKqS0VOK |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward COINTELPRO spread false rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the [[Communist Party]] and abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with [[African Americans]] involved in the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uua&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |title=Viola Liuzzo |author=Joanne Giannino |work=Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography |accessdate=2008-09-29|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKqSe8XJ |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urlRearview Mirror&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/history/viola/viola.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990427180231/http://www.detroitnews.com/history/viola/viola.htm |archivedate=1999-04-27 |title=The Detroit housewife who moved a nation toward racial justice |author=Kay Houston |work= [[The Detroit News]], Rearview Mirror |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Stanton, FROM SELMA TO SORROW: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo, University of Georgia Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantingseedsmedia.com/violaliuzzo.html planting media cash advance debt at plantingseedsmedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; FBI informant Rowe has also been implicated in some of the most violent crimes of the 1960s civil rights era, including attacks on the [[Freedom Riders]] and the 1963 Birmingham, Alabama [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Informant&quot; /&gt; In another instance in [[San Diego]] the FBI financed, armed, and controlled an extreme right-wing group of former [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|Minutemen]], transforming it into a group called the Secret Army Organization which targeted groups, activists, and leaders involved in the Anti-War Movement for both intimidation and violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/books/responsibility01.htm Triumphs of Democracy, by Noam Chomsky (Excerpted from Language and Responsibility)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://osdir.com/ml/culture.discuss.cia-drugs/2005-10/msg00404.html Watergate and the Secret Army Organization - msg#00404 - culture.discuss.cia-drugs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crca.ucsd.edu/~esisco/friendlyfire/A1972.html 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.start.umd.edu/data/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=4258 {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal surveillance==

The final report of the [[Church Committee]] concluded:

:Too many people have been spied upon by too many Government agencies and too much information has been collected. The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power. The Government, operating primarily through secret informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone &quot;bugs&quot;, surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of [[American citizen]]s. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous -- and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations -- have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.

:Groups and individuals have been harassed and disrupted because of their political views and their lifestyles. Investigations have been based upon vague standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable. Unsavory and vicious tactics have been employed -- including anonymous attempts to break up marriages, disrupt meetings, ostracize persons from their professions, and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result in deaths. Intelligence agencies have served the political and personal objectives of presidents and other high officials. While the agencies often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in the Executive branch and Congress, they also occasionally initiated improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had a duty to inform.

:Governmental officials -- including those whose principal duty is to enforce the law --have violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law.

:The Constitutional system of checks and balances has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put. Most domestic intelligence issues have not reached the courts, and in those cases when they have reached the courts, the judiciary has been reluctant to grapple with them.&lt;ref name = &quot;Church&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==COINTELPRO tactics continue==
While COINTELPRO was officially terminated in April 1971, continuing FBI actions indicate that post-COINTELPRO reforms did not succeed in ending COINTELPRO tactics.&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham. ''There's Something Happening Here: The New Left, the Klan, and FBI.'' University of California Press, 2005: &quot;However, strong suspicions lingered that the program's tactics were sustained on a less formal basis—suspicions sometimes furthered by agents themselves, who periodically claimed that counterintelligence activities were continuing, though in a manner undocumented within Bureau files.&quot;; Hobson v.

University of California Press, 2001: &quot;Although the FBI officially discontinued COINTELPRO immediately after the Pennsylvania disclosures &quot;for security reasons,&quot; when pressed by the Senate committee, the bureau acknowledged two new instances of &quot;Cointelpro-type&quot; operations.

Disclosures of the 1970s that FBI agents continued to conduct break-ins, and of the 1980s that the FBI targeted CISPES, again brought forth accusations of FBI abuses of power — and raised questions of whether reforms of the 1970s had successfully exorcised the ghost of FBI Director Hoover.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Documents released under the [[FOIA]] show that the FBI tracked the late [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist and author [[David Halberstam]] for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;SEE: Associated Press.

“Counterterrorism” guidelines implemented during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] have been described as allowing a return to COINTELPRO tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Bud Schultz, Ruth Schultz. ''The Price of Dissent: Testimonies to Political Repression in America''. University of California Press, 2001: : &quot;The problem persists after Hoover….&quot;The record before this court,&quot; Federal Magistrate Joan Lefkow stated in 1991, &quot;shows that despite regulations, orders and consent decrees prohibiting such activities, the FBI had continued to collect information concerning only the exercise of free speech.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Some radical groups accuse factional opponents of being FBI informants or assume the FBI is infiltrating the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Mosedale, &quot;Bury My Heart,&quot; City Pages, Volume 21 - Issue 1002 - Cover Story - February 16, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI improperly opened investigations of American activist groups, even though they were planning nothing more than peaceful civil disobedience, according to a report by the [[inspector general]] (IG) of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. The review by the inspector general was launched in response to complaints by civil liberties groups and members of Congress. The FBI improperly monitored groups including the [[Thomas Merton Center]], a [[Pittsburgh]]-based peace group, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), and [[Greenpeace USA]], an [[environmental activism]] organization. Also, activists affiliated with Greenpeace were improperly put on a [[terrorist watch list]], even though they were planning no violence or illegal acitivities. The IG report found the &quot;troubling&quot; FBI practices between 2001 and 2006. In some cases, the FBI conducted investigations of people affiliated with activist groups for &quot;factually weak&quot; reasons. Also, the FBI extended investigations of some of the groups &quot;without adequate basis&quot; and improperly kept information about activist groups in its files. The IG report also found that FBI Director [[Robert Mueller III]] provided inaccurate congressional testimony about one of the investigations, but this inaccuracy may have been due to his relying on what FBI officials told him.&lt;ref&gt;The San Jose Mercury News, 2010 Sept. 20, &quot;FBI Probes of Groups Were Improper, Justice Department Says,&quot; http://www.mercurynews.com/california/ci_16128591?nclick_check=1 also reported at: http://www.democracynow.org/2010/9/21/headlines#2&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have accused the FBI of continuing to deploy COINTELPRO-like tactics against radical groups after the official COINTELPRO operations were ended. Several authors have suggested the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) has been a target of such operations.

A few authors go further and allege that the federal government intended to acquire [[uranium]] deposits on the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe's reservation land, and that this motivated a larger government conspiracy against [[American Indian Movement|AIM]] activists on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]] reservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;churchill-vanderwall-1990a&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;churchill-vanderwall-1988a&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weyler, Rex. ''Blood of the Land: The Government and Corporate War Against First Nations''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, Peter, ''In the Spirit of Crazy Horse'', 1980, Viking.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;conculture&quot;&gt;Woidat, Caroline M. ''The Truth Is on the Reservation: American Indians and Conspiracy Culture'', ''The Journal of American Culture'' 29 (4), 2006. Pages 454–467&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe COINTELPRO continues and similar actions are being taken against [[activist]] groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;conculture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason McQuinn|McQuinn, Jason]]. &quot;Conspiracy Theory vs Alternative Journalism&quot;, ''[[Alternative Press Review]]'', Vol. 2, No. 3, Winter 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, David. &quot;Johnnie's Other O.J.&quot;, FrontPageMagazine.com. September 1, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caroline Woidat argued that with respect to Native Americans, COINTELPRO should be understood within a historical context in which &quot;Native Americans have been viewed and have viewed the world themselves through the lens of [[conspiracy theory]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woidat, Caroline M. &quot;The Truth Is on the Reservation: American Indians and Conspiracy Culture&quot;, ''The Journal of American Culture'' 29 (4), 2006. pp. 454–467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors note that while some conspiracy theories related to COINTELPRO are unfounded, the issue of ongoing government surveillance and repression is nonetheless real.&lt;ref&gt;Berlet, Chip.

A '''cruise missile''' is a [[guided missile]] that carries an explosive payload and is propelled, usually by a [[jet engine]], towards a land-based or sea-based target. Cruise missiles are designed to deliver a large warhead over long distances with high accuracy. Modern cruise missiles can travel at [[supersonic]] or high [[subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds, are self-navigating, and can fly on a [[Ballistics|non-ballistic]], extremely low altitude trajectory. They are distinct from [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAV) in that they are used only as weapons and not for [[reconnaissance]]. In a cruise missile, the [[warhead]] is integrated into the vehicle and the vehicle is always sacrificed in the mission.

Cruise missile designs fundamentally derive from the German [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] of World War II. Advances in transistor and computer technology allowed self-correcting avionic and aeronautical designs that allowed missiles to be guided in flight, as opposed to only at launch. These advances developed into [[guided missiles]] and guided bombs, and later into the modern cruise missile.

In 2011, it was estimated that a single cruise missile costs £500,000 (US$830,000)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12806709 According to Prof Malcolm Charmers of defence [[think-tank]] the [[Royal United Services Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[Image:Fieseler Fi-103.jpg|thumb|A Fieseler Fi-103, the German [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]].]]
In 1916, [[Lawrence Sperry]] patented and built an &quot;aerial torpedo&quot;, a small biplane carrying a TNT charge, a Sperry [[autopilot]] and a barometric altitude control. Inspired by these experiments, the US Army developed a similar flying bomb called the [[Kettering Bug]]. In the period between the World Wars [[the United Kingdom]] developed the [[Larynx (unmanned aircraft)|Larynx (Long Range Gun with Lynx Engine)]] which underwent a few flight tests in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sergey Korolev]] headed the [[GIRD]]-06 cruise missile project from 1932–1939, which used a rocket-powered boost-glide design.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The 06/III (RP-216) and 06/IV (RP-212) contained gyroscopic guidance systems.

[[Germany]] first deployed cruise style missiles, during [[World War II]]. The [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] contained a gyroscopic guidance system and was propelled by a simple [[pulse jet engine|pulse-jet]] engine, the sound of which gave it the nickname of &quot;buzz bomb&quot;. Accuracy was sufficient only for use against very large targets (the general area of a city). The V-1 and similar early weapons are often referred to as [[flying bomb]]s.

Immediately after the war the [[United States Air Force]] had 21 different guided missile projects including would-be cruise missiles. All were cancelled by 1948 except four: the [[Air Material Command BANSHEE]], the [[SM-62 Snark]], the [[SM-64 Navaho]], and the [[MGM-1 Matador]]. The BANSHEE design was similar to [[Operation Aphrodite]]; like Aphrodite it failed, and was canceled in April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.] see PDF page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]] period both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] experimented further with the concept, deploying early cruise missiles from land, submarines and aircraft. The main outcome of the U.S. Navy submarine missile project was the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] missile, based upon the V-1.

The U.S. Air Force's first operational surface-to-surface missile was the winged, mobile, nuclear-capable [[MGM-1 Matador]], also similar in concept to the V-1. Deployment overseas began in 1954, first to West Germany and later to the Republic of China (Taiwan) and South Korea. On November 7, 1956 U. S. Air Force Matador units in West Germany, whose missiles were capable of striking targets in the Warsaw Pact, deployed from their fixed day-to-day sites to unannounced dispersed launch locations. This alert was in response to the crisis posed by the Soviet attack on Hungary which suppressed the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]].

Between 1957 and 1961 the United States followed an ambitious and well-funded program to develop a nuclear-powered cruise missile, [[Project Pluto]]. It was designed to fly below the enemy's radar at speeds above [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 and carry a number of [[hydrogen bomb]]s that it would drop on its path over enemy territory. Although the concept was proven sound and the 500 [[megawatt]] engine finished a successful test run in 1961, no airworthy device was ever completed. The project was finally abandoned in favor of [[ICBM]] development.

While [[ballistic missile]]s were the preferred weapons for land targets, heavy nuclear and conventional tipped cruise missiles were seen by the USSR as a primary weapon to destroy U.S. naval [[carrier battle group]]s. Large submarines (for example, [[Echo class submarine|Echo]] and [[Oscar class submarine|Oscar]] classes) were developed to carry these weapons and shadow U.S. battle groups at sea, and large bombers (for example, [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Backfire]], [[Tupolev Tu-95|Bear]], and [[Tupolev Tu-160|Blackjack]] models) were equipped with the weapons in their air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) configuration.

==General design==
Cruise missiles generally consist of a guidance system, payload, and propulsion system, housed in an airframe with small wings and [[empennage]] for flight control. Payloads usually consist of a conventional warhead or a [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear warhead]]. Cruise missiles tend to be propelled by a [[jet engine]], [[turbofan]] engines being preferred due to their greater efficiency at low altitude and sub-sonic speed.

===Guidance systems===
Guidance systems also vary greatly. Low-cost systems use a [[radar altimeter]], barometric altimeter and [[clock]] to navigate a [[digital]] strip [[map]]. More advanced systems use [[inertial guidance]], [[satellite navigation]] and [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching (TERCOM)]]. Use of an [[automatic target recognition|automatic target recognition (ATR)]] algorithm/device in the guidance system increases accuracy of the missile. The [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] features an ATR unit from [[General Electric]].

==Categories==
Cruise missiles can be categorized by size, speed (subsonic or supersonic), and range, and whether launched from land, air, surface ship, or submarine. Often versions of the same missile are produced for different launch platforms; sometimes air- and submarine-launched versions are a little lighter and smaller than land- and ship-launched versions.

Guidance systems can vary across missiles. Some missiles can be fitted with any of a variety of navigation systems ([[Inertial navigation]], [[TERCOM]], or [[satellite navigation]]). Larger cruise missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, while smaller ones carry only conventional warheads.

===Hypersonic===
A [[hypersonic]] cruise missile would travel at least 5 times the speed of sound.

===Long-range subsonic===
[[File:ALCMCruiseMissile.JPG|thumb|right|A [[United States Air Force]] [[AGM-86]]]]
The US, USSR, UK, China and India have developed several long-range subsonic cruise missiles. These missiles have a range of over {{convert|1000|km|mi}} and fly at about {{convert|800|km/h|mph}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} They typically have a launch weight of about {{convert|1500|kg|lb}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. Earlier versions of these missiles used [[inertial navigation]]; later versions use much more accurate [[TERCOM]] and [[TERCOM|DSMAC]] systems. Most recent versions can use [[satellite navigation]].

==Deployment==
[[File:AGM-129A - 2006 0306 b52 2lg.jpg|thumb|right|[[AGM-129 ACM]] being secured on a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H bomber]]]]
The most common mission for cruise missiles is to attack relatively high-value targets such as ships, command bunkers, bridges and dams{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Modern guidance systems permit precise attacks. 

(As of 2001) the BGM-109 [[Tomahawk missile]] model has become a significant part of the U.S. naval arsenal. It gives ships and submarines an extremely accurate, long-range, conventional land attack weapon. Each costs about $600,000 U.S.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=2200&amp;tid=1300&amp;ct=2 The US Navy - Fact File&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] deploys an air launched cruise missile, the [[AGM-86]]. It can be launched from bombers like the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. Both the Tomahawk and the AGM-86 were used extensively during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]. 

Both [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] (as BGM-109) and ALCM (AGM-86) were competing designs for the U.S.A.F. ALCM nuclear tipped cruise missile to be carried by the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] heavy bomber. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
The U.S.AF adopted the AGM-86 for its bomber fleet while AGM-109 was adapted to launch from trucks and ships and adopted by the U.S.A.F and Navy. 
The truck-launched versions, and also the Pershing II and SS-20 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles, were later destroyed under the bilateral INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) treaty with the U.S.S.R.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] (RN) also operates cruise missiles, specifically the U.S.-made Tomahawk, used by the RN's nuclear submarine fleet. Conventional warhead versions were first fired in combat by the RN in 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]]. The [[Royal Air Force]] uses the [[Storm Shadow]] cruise missile on its [[Tornado GR4]] aircraft. It is also used by France, where it is known as SCALP EG, and carried by the [[Armée de l'Air]]'s [[Mirage 2000]] and [[Rafale]] aircraft.

[[India]] and [[Russia]] have jointly developed the supersonic cruise missile [[BrahMos]]. There are three versions of the Brahmos: ship/land-launched, air-launched and sub-launched. The ship/land-launched version were operational as of late 2007. The Brahmos has the capability to attack targets on land. Russia also continues to operate other cruise missiles: the [[SS-N-12 Sandbox]], [[SS-N-19 Shipwreck]], [[SS-N-22 Sunburn]] and [[Kh-35|SS-N-25 Switchblade]]. [[Germany]] and [[Spain]] operate the [[Taurus missile]] while [[Pakistan]] has developed its own cruise missile somewhat similar to Tomahawk cruise missile, named the [[Babur missile]]. Both the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) have designed several cruise missile variants, such as the well-known [[C-802]], some of which are capable of carrying biological, chemical, nuclear, and conventional warheads.

===Nuclear warhead versions===
[[File:Agm-129 acm.jpg|thumb|right|[[AGM-129 ACM]]]] 
The U.S. has 460 [[AGM-129 ACM|AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile]]s (ACMs) with a [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]] nuclear warhead (5 [[kilotonne|kt]] or 150 kt selectable [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]]) for [[B-52 Stratofortress]] (B-52H) external carriage. Also there are approximately 350 sea-launched cruise missiles with the same nuclear warhead. The range of the missile is 3000&amp;nbsp;km. These missiles have been &quot;mothballed&quot; and placed in storage.

The [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] was also designed for a nuclear warhead.

*[[United States and weapons of mass destruction|The United States and weapons of mass destruction]]
*[[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]]
*[[Woensdrecht]]

Russia has [[Raduga Kh-55|Kh-55SM]] cruise missiles, with similar to U.S. [[AGM-129 ACM|AGM-129]] range of 3000&amp;nbsp;km, but are able to carry more powerful warhead of 200 kt. They are equipped with a [[TERCOM]] system which allows them to cruise at an altitude lower than 110 meters at subsonic speeds while obtaining a [[Circular Error Probable|CEP]] accuracy of 15 meters with an [[Inertial navigation system]]. They are air-launched from either [[Tupolev Tu-95]]s, [[Tupolev Tu-22M]]s, or [[Tupolev Tu-160]]s, each able to carry 16 for the Tu-95, 12 for the Tu-160, and 4 for the Tu-22M. A [[Stealth]] version of the missile, the Kh-101 is in development. It has similar qualities as the Kh-55, except that it's range has been extended to 5,000&amp;nbsp;km, equipped with a 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg conventional warhead, and has stealth features which reduces it's probability of intercept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/bomber/kh-101.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Efficiency in modern warfare===
Currently cruise missiles are among the most expensive of single-use weapons, up to several million dollars apiece. One consequence of this is that its users face difficult choices in targeting, to avoid expending the missiles on targets of low value. For instance during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] the United States attacked targets of very low monetary value with cruise missiles, which led many to question the efficiency of the weapon. However, proponents of the cruise missile counter that the same argument applies to other types of [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s: they are cheaper than human pilots when total training and infrastructure costs are taken into account, not to mention the risk of loss of personnel. As demonstrated in the ongoing [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] and prior conflicts, cruise missiles are much more difficult to detect and intercept than other aerial assets, making them particularly suited to attacks against static air defense systems.

'''Crete''' ({{lang-el|Κρήτη}}) is the largest and most populous of the [[Greek islands]] and the [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|fifth]] largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Cretan dialect|dialect]], [[Mantinada|poetry]], and [[Cretan music|music]]). Crete was the centre of the [[Minoan civilization]] ({{nowrap|c. 2700–1420 BC}}), the first [[civilization]] in [[Europe]] and the first European country with a palace (at [[Knossos]]).

==Other names for the island==
Under [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]], in [[Classical Latin]], the island was called '''Creta'''. Under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian rule]], it was known as '''Candia''' (sometimes anglicized as 'Candy'), a Venetian adaptation of the earlier Greek name '''Chandax''' ({{lang-el|Χάνδαξ}}, &quot;moat&quot;) or '''Chandakas''' ({{lang-el|Χάνδακας}}), which in turn came from the [[Arabic]] ''rabḍ al-ḫandaq'' 'castle of the moat'. Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], it was called '''Girit'''.

{{main|Geography of Greece}}

Crete is the largest island in Greece and the second largest in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] (after [[Cyprus]]). It is located in the southern part of the [[Aegean Sea]] separating the Aegean from the [[Libyan Sea]].

===Island morphology===
The island has an elongated shape: it spans {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west, is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} at its widest point, and narrows to as little as {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} (close to [[Ierapetra]]). Crete covers an area of {{convert|8336|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, with a coastline of {{convert|1046|km|mi|abbr=on}}; to the north, it broaches the [[Sea of Crete]] (Greek: Κρητικό Πέλαγος); to the south, the [[Libyan Sea]] (Greek: Λιβυκό Πέλαγος); in the west, the [[Myrtoan Sea]], and toward the east the Karpathion Sea. It lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland.

===Mountains and valleys===
Crete is extremely mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by three different groups of mountains:
*The White Mountains or [[Lefka Ori]] ({{convert|2452|m|ft|abbr=on}})
*The Idi Range ([[Psiloritis]] ({{Coord|35.18|N|24.82|E|}}) {{convert|2456|m|ft|abbr=on}})
*The [[Dikti|Dikti Mountains]] ({{convert|2148|m|ft|abbr=on}})
*[[Mount Kedros|Kedros]] ({{convert|1777|m|ft|abbr=on}})
*Thripti ({{convert|1489|m|ft|abbr=on}})

These mountains gifted Crete with valleys, such as [[Amari Valley|Amari valley]], fertile plateaus, such as [[Lasithi Plateau|Lasithi plateau]], [[Omalos]] and [[Nidha]]; caves, such as [[Diktaion]] and [[Idaion]] (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god [[Zeus]]); and a number of gorges.

===Gorges, rivers, and lakes===
The island has a number of gorges such as the famous [[Samariá Gorge|gorge of Samaria]], the [[Imbros Gorge]], the [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], the [[Ha Gorge]], the [[Platania Gorge]], and the gorge of the dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Lasithi]]).

The rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes including Lake [[Kournas]] and Lake Agia which are both in Chania prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crete.tournet.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1155&amp;lang=en Photos of Agia Lake] Crete TOURnet.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Voulismeni]] at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a sweetwater lake but is now connected with the sea, in Lasithi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aghiosnikolaos.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=35 Lake Voulismeni] aghiosnikolaos.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrounding islands===
{{main|List of Greek islands}}
A large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are visited only by archaeologists and biologists. Some are environmentally protected. A small sample of the islands include [[Gramvousa]] the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon, [[Elafonisi]] which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre, the [[Paximadia]] where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born, the [[Dionysades]] which are in an environmentally protected region together with the Forest of Vai, the Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]].

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Greece}}
Crete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[North African]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[temperate]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low lying areas.  While mountain tops remain snow-capped year long, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s (above {{convert|110|F|1|disp=/}}).

The south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[Date Palm|date palms]] bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]]. The fertile region around [[Ierapetra]], on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in [[greenhouse]]s throughout the winter.

==Human geography==
[[File:Periferia Kritis.png|200px|right|thumb|Crete Periphery within Greece]]
Crete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=KVYFI9NzLz0C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=population+statistics+Crete&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Crete, p.44], by Victoria Kyriakopoulos.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
Crete with its nearby islands form the '''Crete Periphery''' ({{lang-el|Περιφέρεια Κρήτης}}), one of the 13 [[peripheries of Greece]] which were established in the 1987 administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Π.Δ. 51/87 &quot;Καθορισμός των Περιφερειών της Χώρας για το σχεδιασμό κ.λ.π. της Περιφερειακής Ανάπτυξης&quot; (''Determination of the Peripheries of the Country for the planning etc. of the development of the Region, [[Efimeris tis Kyverniseos|ΦΕΚ]] A 26/06.03.1987&lt;/ref&gt; With the 2010 [[Kallikratis plan]], the powers and authority of the peripheries were redefined and extended. The periphery is based at [[Heraklion]] and is divided into four [[peripheral units of Greece|peripheral units]] (pre-Kallikratis [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]). From west to east these are: [[Chania (peripheral unit)|Chania]], [[Rethymno (peripheral unit)|Rethymno]], [[Heraklion (peripheral unit)|Heraklion]] and [[Lasithi]]. These are further subdivided into 24 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]].

The periphery's governor is, since 1 January 2011, [[Stavros Arnaoutakis]], who was elected in the [[Greek local elections, 2010|November 2010 local administration elections]] for the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]].

===Cities===
{{Main|Cities of Greece}}
[[File:Agios Nikolaos R02.jpg|thumb|200px|View of [[Agios Nikolaos]]' port]]

[[Heraklion]] is the largest city and capital of Crete. The principal cities are:
*[[Heraklion]] (''Iraklion'' or ''Candia'') (130,914 inhabitants)&lt;ref name=census&gt;2001 Census&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chania]] (''Haniá'') (53,373 inhabitants)&lt;ref name=census/&gt;
*[[Rethymno]] (27,868 inhabitants)&lt;ref name=census/&gt;
*[[Ierapetra]] (23,707 inhabitants)
*[[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] (19,462 inhabitants)
*[[Sitia]] (14,338 inhabitants)

===Culture===
{{Main|Culture of Greece}}
[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|200px|Dancers from Sfakia]]
[[File:Vamos - Kafenion 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Old man from Crete dressed in the typical black shirt]]

The Greek language spoken on the island has a distinct [[Cretan Greek]] dialect with an extended vocabulary that is Crete-specific. Crete has its own distinctive [[Mantinada|Mantinades]] poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]].

Cretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th century epic romance [[Erotokritos]] (Greek Ερωτόκριτος), and in the 20th century [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the [[Cretan School]] of icon painting, which influenced [[El Greco]] and through him subsequent European painting.

Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots, [[Breeches#Types_of_breeches|''vráka'' breeches]] tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirts and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders.  Black is the color of mourning, and since Cretan families are notionally considered so extended as to include great-grandparents or second cousins (although they may have little actual contact) as well as all their respective in-laws, one is theoretically justified to be in continuous mourning for some relative or other, however distant.  On festive occasions those who are not in mourning wear white, most notably white boots and headdress. In the small villages in the mountains some men unabashedly carry weapons including knives and guns which also appear at special occasions such as weddings.

===Economy===
{{Main|Economy of Greece}}
The economy of Crete is predominantly based on agriculture and is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=economy+Crete&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=economy%20Crete&amp;f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.&lt;/ref&gt; The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. While an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, due to the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income close to 100% of the Greek average, while unemployment is at approximately 4%, {{frac|1|2}} of that of the country overall.

As in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[Greek citron|citrons]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].

===Transport infrastructure===
The island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, &quot;Nikos Kazantzakis&quot;|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a smaller one in [[Sitia]]. The first two serve international routes, as the main gateways to the island for travellers.

The island is served by ferries mostly from [[Athens]] by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Greece}}
Crete is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. Fifteen percent of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of [[Heraklion]] (port and airport), while charter journeys to [[Heraklion]] last year made up 20% of all charter flights in Greece. Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete last year, and this increase in tourism is reflected on the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991, when the rest of Greece saw increases of only 25%. Today, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and [[Chania]], or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, [[Rethimno]] and [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]]. Popular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of [[Chania]], the Venetian castle at [[Rethymno]], the gorge of Samaria, the islands of [[Chrysi]], [[Elafonisi]], [[Gramvousa]], and [[Spinalonga]].

===Archaeological sites and museums===
{{Main|List of museums in Greece#Crete}}
{{double image|right|Moni Gouvernetou - Kloster - Kirche.jpg|150|MoniArkadiou2.JPG|140|There ate a significal number of [[monasteries]] in the island: [[Gouverneto Monastery]] (left) and the historical [[Arkadi Monastery|Monastery of Arkadi]] (right).}}
There are a large number of archaeological sites which include the Minoan sites of [[Knossos]] and [[Phaistos]], the classical site of [[Gortys]], and the diverse archaeology of the island of [[Koufonisi]] which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II ruins.

There are a number of museums throughout Crete. The [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]] displays most of the archaeological finds of the Minoan era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explorecrete.com/archaeology/antiquities-crete.html Archaeological sites and Museums in Crete] ExploreCrete.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentally protected areas===

There are a number of environmentally protected areas. One such area is located at the island of [[Elafonisi]] on the coast of southwestern Crete. Also, the palm forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] and the [[Dionysades]] islands, close to the coast of northwestern Crete, have diverse animal and plant life. Vai has a palm beach and the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of [[Chrysi]], 15&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Ierapetra]], has the largest naturally grown [[Lebanon Cedar]] forest in Europe.

===Development===
Newspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, [[South Korea]], [[Dubai Ports World]] and [[China]] for the construction of a large international [[container (cargo)|container]] port and [[free trade zone]] in southern Crete near [[Tympaki]]; the plan is to expropriate 850&amp;nbsp;ha of land. The port would handle 2&amp;nbsp;million containers per year, while as of 2007, there has been no official announcement of a project not universally welcomed due to its environmental, economic and cultural impact.&lt;ref name=ncp&gt;[http://www.no-container-port-in-timbaki.net/facts_en.php No Container Transshipment Hub in Timbaki], retrieved 27 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2009, it appears the project has been canceled, in part due to the strong opposition from the local population, mostly on environmental grounds.&lt;ref name=ncp/&gt;

===Holiday homes and immigration===
Crete's mild climate attracts interest from [[northern Europe]]ans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. [[EU]] citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:229:0035:0048:EN:PDF On the Rights of Citizens of the Union'', EC Directive 2004/58 EC (2004)] Eur-lex.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British expatriates, followed by [[Germany|German]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Scandinavians|Scandinavian]] and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The [[United Kingdom|British]] expatriates are concentrated in the western prefectures of [[Chania Prefecture|Chania]] and [[Rethymno Prefecture|Rethymno]] and to a lesser extent in [[Heraklion Prefecture|Heraklion]] and [[Lasithi]].

Crete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete compared to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the Peloponnese). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;poisonous&quot; animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a Natural History Museum at the [[University of Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhmc.uoc.gr/en Natural History Museum] at the University of Crete.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals===
{{Main|Mammals of Greece}}
Mammals of Crete include the vulnerable [[Kri-kri]], that can be seen in the national parks of the Samaria Gorge and the [[Agioi Theodoroi (islands)]], the [[Cretan wildcat]] and the [[Cretan spiny mouse]].&lt;ref name=tho&gt;[http://www.explorecrete.com/crete-west/EN-Thodorou.html Thodorou Islands off Platanias] ExploreCrete.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/mammals-of-crete/624-cretan-ibex-capra-aegagrus-creticus.html Cretan Ibex, by Alexandros Roniotis] CretanBeaches.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/mammals-of-crete/929-cretan-wildcat-felis-silvestris-cretensis.html Cretan wildcat] CretanBeaches.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/mammals-of-crete/932-crete-spiny-mouse-acomys-minous.html Cretan spiny mouse] CretanBeaches.com&lt;/ref&gt; Other terrestrial mammals include subspecies of the Cretan marten, the Cretan weasel, the Cretan badger, the [[Long-eared Hedgehog|long-eared hedgehog]], the [[edible dormouse]], and the [[Cretan Shrew|Cretan shrew]], a unique endemic species of mammal in Greece, that is unfortunately threatened with extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/mammals-of-crete.html Terrestrial mammals of Crete] CretanBeaches.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Bat species include: [[Blasius's Horseshoe Bat|Blasius's horseshoe bat]], the [[lesser horseshoe bat]], the [[greater horseshoe bat]], the [[lesser mouse-eared bat]], [[Geoffroy's bat]], the [[whiskered bat]], [[Kuhl's pipistrelle]], the [[common pipistrelle]], [[Savi's pipistrelle]], the [[serotine bat]], the [[long-eared bat]], [[Schreiber's bat]], and the [[European free-tailed bat]].&lt;ref name=icw&gt;[http://www.intocrete.net/features/wildlife.asp Wildlife on Crete] IntoCrete.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
A large variety of birds includes eagles (can be seen in [[Lasithi]]), swallows (throughout Crete but throughout the year in the south of the island), pelicans (along the coast), and cranes (including [[Gavdos]] and [[Gavdopoula]]). The Cretan mountains and gorges are refuges for the endangered [[Lammergeier]] vulture. Bird species include: the [[golden eagle]], [[Bonelli's eagle]], the [[bearded vulture]] or Lammergeier, the [[griffon vulture]], [[Eleanora's falcon]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[lanner falcon]], [[European Kestrel|European kestrel]], [[tawny owl]], [[little owl]], [[hooded crow]], [[alpine chough]], [[Red-billed Chough|red-billed chough]], and the [[hoopoe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.we-love-crete.com/birds-of-crete.html Birds of Crete] We-love-crete.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretewww.com/birds/list.htm Checklist and Guide to the Birds of Crete] Cretewww.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reptiles and amphibians===
Reptiles and tortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains.

Reptiles include the [[aegean wall lizard]], [[balkan green lizard]], [[european chameleon]], [[ocellated skink]], [[snake-eyed skink]], [[moorish gecko]], [[turkish gecko]], [[Kotschy's gecko]], [[spur-thighed tortoise]], and the [[stripe-necked terrapin]].&lt;ref name=icw/&gt;&lt;ref name=natrep&gt;[http://www.aquaworld-crete.com/rep1.html Native Reptiles of Crete at Aquaworld] Aquaworld Aquarium.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the [[leopard snake]] (locally known as Ochendra), the [[Balkan whip snake]] (locally called Dendrogallia), the [[dice snake]] (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal [[cat snake]] which has evolved to deliver its venom in to geckos and small lizards and is not dangerous to humans.&lt;ref name=icw/&gt;&lt;ref name=snakes&gt;[http://www.cretegazette.com/archive/2005-11-snakes.php The Snakes of Crete by John McClaren] CreteGazette.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Turtles include the [[green turtle]] and the [[loggerhead turtle]] which are both endangered species.&lt;ref name=natrep/&gt; The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara.&lt;ref name=turtle&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=KVYFI9NzLz0C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Crete+insects&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Crete%20insects&amp;f=false Crete p. 69], by Victoria Kyriakopoulos&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphibians include the [[Green Toad|green toad]], [[American toad]], [[common tree frog]], and the Cretan [[marsh frog]].&lt;ref name=icw/&gt;&lt;ref name=natrep/&gt;

===Insects===
Crete has an unusual variety of insects. [[Xylophagidae|Xylophagous]], known locally as ''Tzitzikia'', make a distinctive repetitive ''tzi tzi'' noise that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the [[swallowtail butterfly]].&lt;ref name=icw/&gt; Moth species include the [[hummingbird moth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picturenation.co.uk/view/info/77283/hummingbird-moth-flower?s=hummingbird&amp;page=1 Feeding time for a hummingbird moth] PictureNation.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crustaceans and mollusks===
There are several species of scorpion such as [[Euscorpius]] carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite. River crabs include the semi-terrestrial [[potamon potamios]] crab.&lt;ref name=icw/&gt; Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in their hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.

===Sealife===
Apart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos, indicate that Minoans knew many things about these creatures and respected them. Apart from the famous endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]], which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts [[whales]], [[sperm whales]], [[dolphins]] and [[porpoises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/marine-mammals.html Marine mammals of Crete] CretanBeaches.com&lt;/ref&gt; These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean, or just occasional visitors. Especially the area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. [[Squid]] and [[octopus]] can be found along the coast and [[Sea turtle]]s and [[Hammerhead shark]]s swim in the sea around the coast. The [[Cretaquarium]] and the [[Aquaworld Aquarium]], are two of only three aquariums in Greece, they are located in [[Heraklion]] and [[Hersonissos]] respectively, and examples of the local sealife can be seen there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretaquarium.gr/indexen.php Cretaquarium] Cretaquarium.gr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scot&gt;[http://www.britsincrete.net/john_mclaren_aquaworld.html Great Britons in Crete, John Bryce McLaren] BritsinCrete.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the fish that can be seen in the waters around Crete include: [[scorpion fish]], [[dusky grouper]], east Atlantic peacock [[wrasse]], five-spotted wrasse, [[weever fish]], [[common stingray]], [[brown ray]], [[mediterranean black goby]], [[pearly razorfish]], [[star-gazer]], [[painted comber]], [[damselfish]], and the [[flying gurnard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaworld-crete.com/fish.html Fish from Crete at Aquaworld] Aquaworld Aquarium&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
Common wildflowers include: camomile, daisy, gladioli, hyacinth, [[Iris flower|iris]], poppy, and tulip. There are more than 200 different species of wild [[orchid]] on the island and this includes 14 varieties of [[Ophrys Cretica]].&lt;ref name=flora&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=KVYFI9NzLz0C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Crete+insects&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Crete%20insects&amp;f=false Crete p.68] by Victoria Kyriakopoulos&lt;/ref&gt; Crete has a rich variety of indigenous herbs including common [[sage]], [[rosemary]], [[thyme]], and [[oregano]].&lt;ref name=flora/&gt;&lt;ref name=expcrete&gt;[http://www.explorecrete.com/nature/flora.html The Flora of Crete] ExploreCrete.com&lt;/ref&gt; Rare herbs include [[Origanum dictamus|Cretan dittany]].&lt;ref name=flora/&gt;&lt;ref name=expcrete/&gt; Varieties of cactus include the edible [[Prickly Pear]]. Common trees on the island include the [[chestnut tree|chestnut]], [[cypress tree|cypress]], [[oak tree|oak]], [[Olea europaea|olive tree]], [[pine tree|pine]], [[plane tree|plane]], and [[tamarisk tree|tamarisk]].&lt;ref name=expcrete/&gt; Trees tend to be taller to the west of the island where water is more abundant.

{{Main|History of Crete}}
Hominids settled in Crete at least 130.000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age period, under the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Emirate of Crete]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After a brief period of autonomy (1897–1913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].

===Prehistoric Crete===
{{main|Prehistoric Crete}}
The first human settlement in Crete dates before 130,000 years ago, during the [[Paleolithic]] age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/45324652/Strasser-et-al-2010-Stone-Age-Seafaring-in-the-Mediterranean-Plakias-Region-for-Lower-Palaeolithic-and-Mesolithic-Habitation-of-Crete-Hesperia-79 Strasser F.

Settlements dating to the [[aceramic]] Neolithic in the 7th Millenium B.C., used [[cattle]], [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], [[Domestic goat|goat]]s, [[pig]]s and [[dog]]s as well as domesticated [[cereal]]s and [[legume]]s; ancient [[Knossos]] was the site of one of these major Neolithic (then later [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]) sites.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2007 [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes Knossos fieldnotes] The Modern Antiquarian&lt;/ref&gt; Other neolithic settlements include those at [[Kephala]], [[Magasa, Crete|Magasa]], and [[Trapeza, Crete|Trapeza]].

===Minoan civilization===
{{Main|Minoan civilization}}
Crete was the center of [[Europe]]'s first advanced civilization, the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoan]] ({{nowrap|c. 2700–1420 BC}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 Ancient Crete] Oxford Bibliographies Online: Classics&lt;/ref&gt; This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as [[Linear A]]. Early [[Cretan]] history is replete with legends such as those of [[Minos|King Minos]], [[Theseus]], [[Minotaur]], [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]] passed on orally via poets such as [[Homer]]. The [[Minoan eruption]] of [[Thera]] devastated the Minoan civilization.

===Mycenean civilization===
{{Main|Mycenean Greece}}
Beginning in 1420&amp;nbsp;BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean civilization]] from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by [[Michael Ventris]], is the [[Linear B]] archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425–1375&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cynthia|last=Shelmerdine|title=Where Do We Go From Here?

===Roman rule===
{{Main|Creta et Cyrenaica}}
Crete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&amp;nbsp;BCE. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&amp;nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&amp;nbsp;BCE, earning for Metellus the title &quot;''Creticus''&quot;. [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]].

===Byzantine Empire – first period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}
Crete came under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and Crete was separated from Cyrenaica ca. 297. During the first Byzantine period Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of 365 and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. Circa 732, the Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the [[Pope]] to that of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB546&quot;&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 546&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emirate of Crete===
{{Main|Emirate of Crete}}
In the 820s when Crete was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], it was captured by [[Andalus]]ian [[Muslims]] led by [[Abu Hafs (pirate)|Abu Hafs]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Iberia&quot;&gt;Reinhart Dozy, ''Histoire des Mussulmans d'Espagne: jusqu'à la conquéte de l'Andalousie par les Almoravides'' (French) pg. 711–1110, Leiden, 1861 &amp; 1881, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt; who established the [[Emirate of Crete]]. Byzantium launched a campaign to liberate the island in 842 and 843 under [[Theoktistos]] with some success. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1 [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]' campaign successfully restored Crete to Byzantium.

===Byzantine Empire – second period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}
In 961, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]] liberated the island, for the Byzantine Empire, by expelling the Arabs.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Panagiotakis, Introduction, p. XVI.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Fourth Crusade]] Crete was granted to [[Boniface of Montferrat]]&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; as a [[pronoia]] by the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios IV Angelos]]. However, Boniface sold his rights cheaply to the [[Republic of Venice]]&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; but the island was seized by Venice's rival the [[Republic of Genoa]] and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.

===Venetian rule===
{{main|Kingdom of Candia}}
[[File:Chania - Venetian harbor 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The venetian port of [[Chania]]]]

From 1212, during [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]'s rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a [[Renaissance]] swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter [[El Greco]] and the writers [[Nicholas Kalliakis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiepolo, Maria Francesca; Tonetti, Eurigio|title=I greci a Venezia| publisher=Istituto veneto di scienze|year=2002|page=201|isbn=8888143076, 9788888143071|quote= Cretese Nikolaos Kalliakis}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1645–1707) and [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]].

Under the rule of the [[Catholic]] [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the city of [[Candia]] was reputed to be the best fortified city of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;&gt;M. Greene. 2001. Ruling an island without a navy. A comparative view of Venetian and Ottoman Crete. ''Oriente moderno'', 20(81), 193–207&lt;/ref&gt; The three main forts were located at [[Gramvousa]], [[Spinalonga]], and [[Fortezza Castle|Fortezza]]. Other fortifications include the [[Kazarma fortress]]. In 1492, Jews expelled from Spain settled on the island.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Schoenfeld. 2007. Immigration and Assimilation in the Jewish Community of Late Venetian Crete (15th–17th Centuries). ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'', 25(1), 1–15&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1574–77, Crete was under the rule of Giacomo Foscarini as Proveditor General, Sindace and Inquistor. According to Starr (1942), the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a dark age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of [[Herakleion|Candia]], about seven percent of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;Starr,J. (1942), Jewish Life in Crete Under The Rule Of Venice, ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research'', Vol. 12, pp. 59–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman rule===

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] [[Cretan War (1645–1669)‎|conquered Crete]] in 1669, after the [[siege of Candia]]. [[Islamic]] presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the [[Emirate of Crete|Arab occupation]], was cemented by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman conquest]]. Most [[Cretan Muslims]] were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan [[Greek language|Greek]], but in the island's 19th century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Demetres Tziovas, ''Greece and the Balkans: Identities, Perceptions and Cultural Encounters Since the Enlightenment''; William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence, as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' by  (Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan Press, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Sufi]] orders were widespread throughout the island, the [[Bektashi]] order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five [[tekkes]]. Many amongst them were [[crypto-Christians]] who converted back to Christianity in subsequent years, while many others fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].

Uprisings by Christians were met with a fierce response from the Ottoman authorities who executed bishops, regarded as [[ringleader]]s on several occasions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by [[Daskalogiannis]], a shipowner from [[Sfakia]] who was promised support by [[Orlov Revolt|Orlov's fleet]] which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities who skinned him alive. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.

Crete was left out of the modern Greek state by the [[London Protocol]] of 1830, and soon it was yielded to [[Egypt]] by the Ottoman [[sultan]]. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] on July 3, 1840.

Heraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, &quot;the deserted city&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt; The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt; The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.

Between 1833 and 1897, several more Christian uprisings took place, and in 1898, Crete, a complex autonomous [[Cretan State]] under Ottoman [[suzerainty]].

Crete was garrisoned by an international military force, with a [[High Commissioner]] (''Armostis'') appointed by the government of Greece, [[Alexandros Zaimis]]. The island was partitioned in to four quarters by the four main powers jostling for power at that time. The four quarters were divided between Italy, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, who controlled Chania, Rethymnon, Heraklion, and Lasithi respectively. Crete was joined in union with Greece on 1 December 1913.

===World War II===
{{Main|Battle of Crete|Cretan resistance}}

During [[World War II]], the island was the scene of the famous [[Battle of Crete]] where, in May 1941, [[Germany|German]] [[paratrooper]]s sustained almost 7,000 casualties, meeting fierce resistance from both locals and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] force, commanded by General Sir [[Bernard Freyberg]]. As a result, [[Adolf Hitler]] forbade further large scale airborne operations.

==Mythology==
{{main|Greek mythology}}

Crete has a rich mythology mostly connected with the ancient [[Greek Gods]] but also connected with the Minoan civilization.

The Idaion cave at [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]] was the birthplace of the god [[Zeus]]. The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god [[Zeus]] launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]]. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Sirens]] and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera]] (&quot;featherless&quot;) where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).&lt;ref&gt;Caroline M. Galt, &quot;A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera&quot;, ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hercules]], in one of his labors, took the Cretan bull to the Peloponnese. [[Europa]] and [[Zeus]] made love at [[Gortys]] and conceived the Kings of the Minoan civilization.

The [[labyrinth]] of the palace of Knossos has the myth of [[Theseus#Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]] where the [[Minotaur]] was slayed by [[Theseus]]. [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]] were captives of [[King Minos]] and crafted wings to escape. King Minos became a judge of the dead in [[Hades]].

[[Image:Aegean Sea with island groups labeled.gif|thumb|right|The '''Cyclades Islands''' encircle [[Delos]].]]
The '''Cyclades''' ({{lang-el|Κυκλάδες}}, {{IPA-el|cikˈlaðes|}}, {{IPA-en|ˈsɪklədiːz|lang}}) is a [[Greek island]] group in the [[Aegean Sea]], south-east of the mainland of Greece; and a former administrative [[prefectures of Greece|prefecture]] of Greece. They are one of the [[Greek islands|island groups]] which constitute the Aegean [[archipelago]]. The name refers to the islands ''around'' (κυκλάς) the sacred island of [[Delos]]. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the [[Aegean cat]]) first came from.

==Geography==

The Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being [[Amorgos|Amorgós]], [[Anafi|Anáfē]], [[Andros|Ándros]], [[Antiparos|Antíparos]], [[Delos|Dēlos]], [[Eschati|Eschátē]], [[Ios (island)|Íos]], [[Kea (island)|Kéa]], [[Kimolos|Kímōlos]], [[Kythnos|Kýthnos]], [[Milos|Mēlos]], [[Mykonos|Mýkonos]], [[Naxos (island)|Náxos]], [[Paros|Páros]], [[Folegandros|Folégandros]], [[Serifos|Sérifos]], [[Sifnos|Sífnos]], [[Sikinos|Síkinos]], [[Syros|Sýros]], [[Tinos|Tēnos]], and [[Santorini|Thēra or Santoríni]]. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.

[[Ermoupolis]], on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.

The islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two [[volcano|volcanic]] islands, [[Milos]] and [[Santorini]] (Thera). The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile: agricultural produce includes [[wine]], [[fruit]], [[wheat]], [[olive oil]], and [[tobacco]].  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather. 

==History==
{{main|History of the Cyclades}}
The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age '''[[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic culture]]''' is best known for its schematic flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (&quot;[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]&quot;) culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.

A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on [[emmer wheat]] and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on [[Keos]]) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.

===Archaeology===
The first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898 - 1899 and coined the term &quot;Cycladic civilization&quot;. Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by [[Jean Arp]] or [[Constantin Brâncuşi]]. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figurines]] have been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic [[frying pans]]. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from [[Asia Minor]] ''ca'' [[5th millennium BCE|5000 BCE]]. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between ''ca'' [[33rd century BCE|3300]] - [[20th century BCE|2000 BCE]], when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is termed [[Helladic culuture|Helladic]].

In recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with [[Europe]]an and other [[tourist]]s, and as a result there have been problems with [[erosion]], [[pollution]], and water shortages.

==Administration==

The '''Cyclades Prefecture''' was one of the [[prefectures of Greece]]. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into 9 [[peripheral units of Greece|peripheral units]] of the [[South Aegean Periphery]]:
* [[Andros]]
* [[Kea-Kythnos]]
* [[Milos (peripheral unit)|Milos]]
* [[Mykonos]]
* [[Naxos (peripheral unit)|Naxos]]
* [[Paros (peripheral unit)|Paros]]
* [[Santorini (peripheral unit)|Santorini]]
* [[Syros]]
* [[Tinos]]

===Municipalities and communities===

The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.

'''Computer vision''' is the science and technology of machines that see, where ''see'' in this case means that the machine is able to extract information from an image that is necessary to solve some task.  As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner.

As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:
* [[Object recognition|Recognizing objects]] in images.
* Controlling processes (e.g., an [[industrial robots|industrial robot]] or an [[autonomous vehicle]]).
* Detecting events (e.g., for visual surveillance or [[people counter|people counting]]).
* Organizing information (e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences).
* Modeling objects or environments (e.g., industrial inspection, medical image analysis or topographical modeling).
* Interaction (e.g., as the input to a device for [[computer-human interaction]]).

Computer vision is closely related to the study of [[biological vision]]. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.

Computer vision is, in some ways, the inverse of [[computer graphics]]. While computer graphics produces image data from 3D models, computer vision often produces 3D models from image data. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in [[augmented reality]].

Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, event detection, [[video tracking]], [[object recognition]], learning, indexing, [[motion estimation]], and [[image restoration]].

==State of the art==
'''Computer vision''' is a diverse and relatively new field of study. In the early days of computing, it was difficult to process even moderately large sets of image data. It was not until the late 1970s that a more focused study of the field emerged. Computer vision covers a wide range of topics which are often related to other disciplines, and consequently there is no standard formulation of &quot;the computer vision problem&quot;. Moreover, there is no standard formulation of how computer vision problems should be solved. Instead, there exists an abundance of methods for solving various well-defined computer vision tasks, where the methods often are very task specific and seldom can be generalised over a wide range of applications. Many of the methods and applications are still in the state of basic research, but more and more methods have found their way into commercial products, where they often constitute a part of a larger system which can solve complex tasks (e.g., in the area of medical images, or quality control and measurements in industrial processes). In most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.

==Related fields==
[[File:CVoverview2.svg||thumb|350px|Relation between computer vision and various other fields]]
Much of [[artificial intelligence]] deals with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotical systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot.
Artificial intelligence and computer vision share other topics such as [[pattern recognition]] and learning techniques. Consequently, computer vision is sometimes seen as a part of the artificial intelligence field or the computer science field in general.

[[Physics]] is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Computer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible or infra-red light. The sensors are designed using [[solid-state physics]]. The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using [[optics]]. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.

A third field which plays an important role is [[neurobiology]], specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how &quot;real&quot; vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision related tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have their background in biology.

Yet another field related to computer vision is [[signal processing]]. Many methods for processing of one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision which have no counterpart in the processing of one-variable signals. A distinct character of these methods is the fact that they are non-linear which, together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.

Beside the above mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on [[statistics]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] or [[geometry]]. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realised in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance.

The fields most closely related to computer vision are [[image processing]], [[image analysis]] and [[machine vision]]. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are more or less identical, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented.

The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:
* [[Image processing]] and [[image analysis]] tend to focus on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterisation implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.
* Computer vision tends to focus on the 3D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the 3D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.
* [[Machine vision]] tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., vision based autonomous robots and systems for vision based inspection or measurement. This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real-time processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.
* There is also a field called [[imaging]] which primarily focus on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, [[medical imaging]] contains lots of work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.
* Finally, [[pattern recognition]] is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.

==Applications for computer vision==
One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision or medical image processing. This area is characterized by the extraction of information from image data for the purpose of making a medical diagnosis of a patient. Generally, image data is in the form of [[microscopy|microscopy images]], [[X-ray|X-ray images]], [[angiography|angiography images]], [[ultrasonography|ultrasonic images]], and [[tomography|tomography images]]. An example of information which can be extracted from such image data is detection of [[tumour]]s, [[arteriosclerosis]] or other malign changes. It can also be measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. This application area also supports medical research by providing new information, e.g., about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments.

A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called [[machine vision]], where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a manufacturing process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called [[optical sorting]].

Military applications are probably one of the largest areas for computer vision. The obvious examples are detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and [[missile guidance]]. More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data. Modern military concepts, such as &quot;battlefield awareness&quot;, imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.

[[Image:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Artist's Concept of Rover on Mars, an example of an unmanned land-based vehicle. Notice the [[stereo cameras]] mounted on top of the Rover.]]
One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include [[submersible]]s, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles ([[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, i.e. for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment ([[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]]) and for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events, e. g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for [[Driverless car|autonomous driving of cars]], but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles, to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e. g., NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover]] and ESA's [[ExoMars]] Rover.

Other application areas include:
* Support of [[visual effects]] creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., [[camera tracking]] (matchmoving).
* [[Surveillance]].

==Typical tasks of computer vision==
Each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.

===Recognition===
The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. This task can normally be solved [[robust]]ly and without effort by a human, but is still not satisfactorily solved in computer vision for the general case: arbitrary objects in arbitrary situations. The existing methods for dealing with this problem can at best solve it only for specific objects, such as simple geometric objects (e.g., polyhedra), human faces, printed or hand-written characters, or vehicles, and in specific situations, typically described in terms of well-defined illumination, background, and [[Pose (computer vision)|pose]] of the object relative to the camera.

Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature:
* '''[[Object recognition]]''': one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene.
* '''Identification''': An individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples: identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, or identification of a specific vehicle.
* '''Detection''': the image data is scanned for a specific condition. Examples: detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analysed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.

Several specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:
* '''[[Content-based image retrieval]]''': finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image (give me all images similar to image X), or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contains many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them).
* '''[[Pose (computer vision)|Pose estimation]]''': estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an [[assembly line]] situation.
* '''[[Optical character recognition]]''' (OCR): identifying [[Character (computing)|characters]] in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or [[Search index|indexing]] (e.g. [[ASCII]]).

=== [[Motion analysis]] ===
Several tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images . Examples of such tasks are:
* '''[[Egomotion]]''': determining the 3D rigid motion (rotation and translation) of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.
* '''[[video tracking|Tracking]]''': following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (e.g., vehicles or humans) in the image sequence.
* '''[[Optical flow]]''': to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding 3D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.

===Scene reconstruction===
Given one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a [[computer model|3D model]] of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of 3D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model.

===Image restoration===
The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.
An example in this field is the [[inpainting]].

==Computer vision systems==
The organization of a computer vision system is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.
* '''Image acquisition''': A digital image is produced by one or several [[image sensor]]s, which, besides various types of light-sensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultra-sonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary 2D image, a 3D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands (gray images or colour images), but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|nuclear magnetic resonance]].
* '''Pre-processing''': Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples are
** Re-sampling in order to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.
** Noise reduction in order to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.
** Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.
** [[Scale-space]] representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.
* '''Feature extraction''': Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data. Typical examples of such features are
** Lines, [[edge detection|edges]] and [[ridge detection|ridges]].
** Localized [[interest point detection|interest points]] such as [[corner detection|corners]], [[blob detection|blobs]] or points.
:More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.
* '''Detection/segmentation''': At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing. Examples are
** Selection of a specific set of interest points
** Segmentation of one or multiple image regions which contain a specific object of interest.
* '''High-level processing''': At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object. The remaining processing deals with, for example:
** Verification that the data satisfy model-based and application specific assumptions.
** Estimation of application specific parameters, such as object pose or object size.
** [[Image recognition]]: classifying a detected object into different categories.
** [[Image registration]]: comparing and combining two different views of the same object.

'''Curry''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ʌr|i}}) is a generic description used throughout Western culture to describe a variety of spiced dishes, especially from [[Bangladeshi cuisine|Bangladeshi]], [[Indian cuisine| Indian]], [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistani]], [[Sri Lankan cuisine|Sri Lankan]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] or other [[South Asian cuisine|South]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine]]s. Three spices found in most curry powders are [[turmeric]], [[coriander]], and [[cumin]]; a wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included (meats, fish, lentils, rice, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Raghavan S. Handbook of Spices, Seasonings and Flavorings. CRC Press, 2007 ISBN 084932842X, p. 302 &lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;curry&quot; is analogous to &quot;soup&quot; or &quot;stew&quot; in that there is no particular ingredient that makes something &quot;curry.&quot;

Curry's popularity in recent decades has spread outward from the [[Indian subcontinent]] to figure prominently in international cuisine. Consequently, each culture has adopted spices in its indigenous cooking to suit its own unique tastes and cultural sensibilities. Curry can therefore be called a [[pan-Asian]] or [[globalization|global]] phenomenon with immense popularity in [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[British cuisine|British]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] and [[Jamaican cuisine|Jamaican]] cuisines.

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary}}
The word &quot;curry&quot; is an anglicised version of the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''{{IAST|ka&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;i}}'' (கறி),&lt;ref&gt;This is the generally accepted origin for Engl. ''curry'' in the modern sense. The spelling however appears to allude to an older form &quot;cury&quot; 'cooking' (from French ''cuire''), which was first attested in [[Forme of Cury]], a culinary cookbook from 1390.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:705.hobson |title=University of Chicago |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date=2001-09-01 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning 'sauce,' which is usually understood to mean vegetables/meat cooked with spices with or without a gravy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookeryonline.com/India/INDIA4.html#K |title=Indian Cookery Terms |publisher=Cookeryonline.com |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian subcontinent==
===Andhra cuisine===
[[Andhra cuisine]] is spicy and has a unique flavour, although there are regional variations in [[Andhra Pradesh]] cuisine. [[Telangana]] in the west of Andhra Pradesh has dishes like [[Ambali]], [[jonna rotte]]/[[jowar bread]], [[sajja rotte]]/bread from sajja grains, and [[hyderabadi biryani]]. In this region, the curry is flavored with spices like [[clove]], [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[anise]], and [[bay leaf]]. The coastal Andhra Pradesh has more variety in their cuisine with a large variety of curries made from vegetables and a few curries made from meat. In this region, the curry is flavored with [[coriander]] powder, [[cumin]] seeds/powder, [[black pepper]] powder, [[red hot chili peppers]]/powder, [[asafoetida]], [[ghee]], [[fenugreek]] seeds, [[curry leaves]] and [[turmeric]]. Even though the same vegetables are used in the curry, the coastal [[Andhra]] curry tastes completely different from the [[Telangana]]curry. This is what made the curry a concept rather than a strict recipe. It can be customized to use the local spices. The curries are mainly eaten with [[rice]].

===Bengali, Bangladeshi and Oriya cuisines===
{{Main|Bangladeshi cuisine|Bengali cuisine|Oriya cuisine}}

[[Image:Beef Curry in Bangladesh.jpg|right|thumb|Beef curry served with roasted onion in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]]]
[[Bengal]]i cuisine includes a plethora of curries. Seafood and fresh fish are a great favourite with [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], and a large number of curries have been devised to accompany them. Mustard seeds and mustard oil are added to many recipes, as are poppy seeds.

The [[Oriya people]] have similar eating habits and are considered masters in preparing these types of curries. This is proven by the number of [[Oriya people|Oriya]]s employed in [[West Bengal]] as master chefs.

===Gujarati and Rajasthani cuisine===
{{Main|Gujarati cuisine}}{{main|Rajasthani cuisine}}
The typical [[Gujarat]]i and [[Rajasthan]]i cuisine is called Thali, which consists of [[Roti]] (a flat bread made from wheat flour), [[Dal|daal]] or, chaval (rice), and shaak ([[Sabji|sabzi]]) (a dish made up of different combinations of vegetables and spices, which may be stir fried, spicy or sweet). Cuisine varies in flavour and heat, depending on taste.

The curries of Karnataka are typically vegetarian and with meat and fish around mostly coastal areas. They use a wide variety of vegetables and spices and coconut and jaggery are common tastes. There are dry and sauce based curries. Some typical sauce based dishes include [[Saaru]], Gojju, Thovve, Huli, Majjige Huli; which is similar to the &quot;kadi&quot; made in the north, Sagu or Kootu, which is eaten mixed with hot rice.

===Malayali cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Kerala}}

[[Malayali]] curries of [[Kerala]] typically contain shredded [[coconut]] paste or [[coconut milk]], [[curry leaves]], and various spices.  Mustard seeds are used in almost every dish, along with onions, curry leaves, sliced red chilies fried in hot oil. Most of the non-vegetarian dishes are heavily spiced. Kerala is known for its traditional [[Sadya]], a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side-dishes, such as [[Parippu]] (Green gram), [[Papadum]], some [[ghee]], [[Sambar (dish)|Sambar]], [[Rasam]], [[Aviyal]], [[Kaalan]], [[Kichadi]], [[pachadi]], [[Injipuli]], [[Koottukari]], [[Indian pickle|pickles]] (mango, lime), [[Thoran]], one to four types of [[Payasam]], [[Boli (food)|Boli]], [[Olan (dish)|Olan]], [[Pulissery]], moru ([[buttermilk]]), [[Upperi]], [[Banana]] chips, etc. The sadya is customarily served on a banana leaf.

===North Indian cuisines===
[[Image:Vegthali.jpg|thumb|Indian vegetable curries with [[roti]].]]
[[North Indian cuisine]] includes [[Mughlai cuisine]], the [[cuisine of Kashmir]], [[Awadhi cuisine]], the [[cuisine of Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bhojpuri cuisine]]. ''[[Kadhi]]'' is a specific dish, made by stirring [[yoghurt]] into a [[roux]] of [[ghee]] and [[besan]]. The spices added vary, but usually include [[turmeric]], [[black mustard]] seed, and [[curry leaf|curry leaves]]. It is often eaten with rice. [[North India]], where dishes are classified as ''sukhi'' (dry) and ''tari'' (with liquid), the word ''curry'' is often confounded with the similar-sounding [[Hindi-Urdu]] word ''tari'' (from the [[Persian language|Persian]]-derived ''tar'' meaning ''wet'') and has no implications for the presence or absence of spice, or whether the dish is Indian or not (e.g. any stew, spicy or not, would be considered a curry dish, simply because it is wet).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC |title=India| author=Sarina Singh |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2010-05-17|quote=generally cooked sukhi (dry) or tari (in a sauce) | isbn=9781740596947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E2saAQAAIAAJ|title=Hanklyn-janklin: a stranger's rumble-tumble guide to some words, customs, and quiddities, Indian and Indo-British| author=Nigel B.

[[Image:Riceandcereal.JPG|thumb|Curried [[Common_bean#Red_or_kidney_beans|rajmah]] with rice.]]
A favourite [[Pakistan]]i curry is [[Karahi]], which is either mutton or chicken cooked in a cooking utensil called karahi, which is similar in shape to a wok.  Lahori Karahi incorporates garlic, ginger, fresh chillies, tomatoes and select spices. Peshawari karahi is a simple dish made with just meat, salt, tomatoes and coriander.

===Punjabi cuisine===
{{Main|Punjabi cuisine}}

[[Punjab region|Punjabi]] curries are mainly based upon [[masala]]s. which is either a blend of dried (and usually dry roasted) spices, or a paste made from a combination of spices and a base of garlic, ginger, onions and tomatoes. A popular cooking fat is pure [[desi]] [[ghee]], and some dishes are often enriched with liberal amounts of [[butter]] and [[cream]]. There are certain dishes that are exclusive to Punjab, such as Maha Di Dal and Saron Da Saag (Sarson Ka Saag).

===Sindhi cuisine===
{{Main|Sindhi cuisine}}

[[Sindh]]i cuisine refers to the cuisine of the [[Sindhi people]]. The daily food in most Sindhi households consists of [[wheat]]-based flat-bread ([[phulka]]) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one [[gravy]] and one dry.

===Tamil and Sinhalese cuisines===
{{Main|South Indian cuisine|Sri Lankan cuisine}}

[[Tamil cuisine]]'s distinctive flavour and aroma is achieved by a blend and combination of [[spice]]s including [[curry leaves]], [[tamarind]], [[coriander]], [[ginger]], [[garlic]], [[chili pepper|chili]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[poppy seeds]], [[mustard seeds]], [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], [[fennel]] or [[anise]] seeds, [[fenugreek seeds]], [[nutmeg]], [[coconut]], [[turmeric]] root or powder, and [[rosewater]]. [[Lentil]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[dairy]] products are essential accompaniments and are often served with rice.  Traditionally vegetarian foods dominate the menu with a range of non-vegetarian dishes including [[freshwater]] [[fish]] and [[seafood]] cooked with traditional Tamil spices and seasoning. This holds good for all the four south Indian states.

In [[Sri Lankan cuisine]] [[rice]], which is usually consumed daily, can be found at any special occasion; whilst spicy curries are favourite dishes for [[dinner]] and [[lunch]]. '[[Rice and curry]]' refers to a range of Sri Lankan dishes.

==Other South Asian cuisine==
===Afghan and Pashtun cuisine===
{{Main|Afghan cuisine|Pashtun cuisine}}
The cuisine of the Pashtun people in northwestern Pakistan is somewhat similar to the cuisine of neighbouring Afghanistan, which is largely based upon cereals like wheat, maize, barley and rice except with the addition of large South Asian influence. Accompanying these staples are dairy products (yoghurt, whey), various nuts, native vegetables, and fresh and dried fruits.

===Northeast Indian and Nepalese cuisines===
{{Main|Nepalese cuisine|Cuisine of Assam|Naga cuisine|Sikkimese cuisine|Tripuri cuisine}}

The curries of [[North-East India]] are very different from those of other parts of India. This area's cuisine has been influenced by its neighbours, namely [[Cuisine of Burma|Burma]] and [[Tibetan cuisine|Tibet]]. Well known Indian spices are used  less. [[Yak]] is a popular meat in this region of India.

[[Dahl baht]], rice and [[lentil soup]], is a staple dish of [[Nepal]]. [[Newa cuisine]] is a type of cuisine developed over centuries by the [[Newar]]s of Nepal.

==Other Asian cuisines==
===Chinese cuisine===
{{See also|Chinese cuisine}}
Chinese curries (咖哩, gā lǐ) typically consist of chicken, beef, fish, lamb, or other meats, green peppers, onions, large chunks of potatoes, and a variety of other ingredients and spices in a mildly spicy yellow curry sauce, and topped over steamed rice. White pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce, and/or hot chili oil may be applied to the sauce to enhance the flavor of the curry.

The most common Chinese variety of curry sauce is usually sold in powder form. It seems to have descended from a Singaporean and Malaysian variety, countries which also introduced the [[Satay]] sauce to the Chinese. The ethnic Cantonese (dominant in [[Kuala Lumpur]]), this yellow, [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese-Malaysian]] variety was naturally introduced to China by the Cantonese, and features typically in Hong Kong cuisine. (Interestingly, the Malay Satay seems to have been introduced to China with wider success by the ethnic [[Teochew people|Teochew]], who make up the second largest group of Chinese of [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]] and are the dominant group in [[Thai Chinese|Thailand]].)

There are many different varieties of Chinese curry, depending on each restaurant.  Unlike other Asian curries, which usually have a thicker consistency, Chinese curry is often watery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} &quot;Galimian,&quot; (from Malaysian &quot;curry mee&quot; or &quot;curry noodles,&quot;) is also a popular Chinese curry dish.

===Japanese cuisine===
[[File:Curry rice by Hyougushi in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Japanese style ''Karē-Raisu'' (Curry rice)]]
[[File:Curry-bun,curry-pan,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|''Karē-Pan'' (Curry bread)]]
{{Main|Japanese curry}}
{{Nihongo|Japanese curry|カレー|karē}} is one of the most popular dishes in Japan, where people eat it an average of 125 times a year according to a survey made in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbcurry.com/qa/number_1.html|title=Curry Q&amp;A|author=S&amp;B Foods Inc|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually eaten as ''karē raisu'' &amp;mdash; curry, rice and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish.

Curry was introduced to [[Japan]] by the British in the [[Meiji era]] (1868&amp;ndash;1912) after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation ([[Sakoku]]), and curry in [[Japan]] was categorized as a [[Western cuisine|Western dish]]. Its spread across the country is commonly attributed to its use in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own unique recipes.

The standard Japanese curry contains [[onions]], [[carrots]], [[potatoes]], and sometimes [[celery]], and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated [[apple]]s or [[honey]] are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead. For the meat, [[pork]], [[beef]] and [[chicken]] are the most popular, in order of decreasing popularity. In northern and eastern Japan including [[Tokyo]], pork is the most popular meat for curry. Beef is more common in western Japan, including [[Osaka]], and in [[Okinawa]] chicken is favoured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curryken.fc2web.com/minzoku/minzoku.htm The Curry Rice Research] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;  Curry seasoning is commonly sold in the form of a condensed brick which dissolves in the mixture of meat and vegetables.

Sometimes the curry-rice is topped with breaded pork cutlet ([[tonkatsu]]); this is called ''Katsu-karē'' (&quot;cutlet curry&quot;).  [[Korokke]] (potato croquettes) are also a common topping.

Apart from with rice, ''karē [[udon]]'' (thick [[noodles]] in curry flavoured soup) and [[curry bread|'' karē-pan'']] (&quot;[[curry bread]]&quot; &amp;mdash; deep fried battered [[bread]] with curry in the middle) are also popular.

Curry was introduced to Korea by the Japanese during their occupation in the early 20th century, and is hence nearly identical to the Japanese version.The common ingredients are rice, curry sauce, vegetables, kimchi, smoked pork, and wasabi.

===Southeast Asian cuisines===
{{See also|Cuisine of Cambodia|Cuisine of Laos|Cuisine of Singapore}}

[[South East Asia]], including countries like [[Cambodia]] Laos, Thailand and also some Southeast Asian minority groups, have their own versions of curry. Note that these countries have had many [[Greater India|influences from Indian culture]] and cuisine, owing to South Asian travellers centuries before.

====Burmese cuisine====
{{See also|Cuisine of Burma}}
Burmese cuisine has a very different basis and understanding of curries. The principle ingredient of almost all Burmese curries are fresh onion (which provides the gravy and main body of the curry), Indian spices and red chillies. Usually, meat and fish are the main ingredients for popular curries.
Burmese curries can be generalised into two types - the hot spicy dishes which exhibit north Indian or Pakistani influence, and the milder 'sweet' curries. Burmese curries almost overwhelmingly lack coconut milk, thus setting them apart from most southeast Asian curries. 
Regular ingredients include fresh onion, garlic and chili paste. Spices regularly used are [[Garam Masala]], dried chili powder, [[Cumin]] powder, tumeric and [[Cuisine of Burma#Ngapi|ngapi]], a fermented paste made from either fish or prawns. 
Burmese curries are quite oily, as the extra oil aided in helping the food last longer. A spaghetti equivalent called [[Nan gyi thohk]] exists, in which wheat or rice noodles are eaten with thick chicken curry.

====Indonesian cuisine====
[[File:Rendang plate.jpg|thumb|[[Rendang]] with rice.]]
{{See also|Cuisine of Indonesia}}
In Indonesia, gulai and kari or kare are based on curry. They are often highly localised and reflect the meat and vegetables available. They can therefore employ a variety of meats (chicken, beef, water buffalo and goat as in the flavoursome &quot;gulai kambing&quot;), seafood (prawn, crab, mussel, clam, squid, etc.), fish or vegetable dishes in a spiced sauce. They use local ingredients such as [[chili pepper]]s, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, lemon grass, [[Galangal]], Indonesian [[bay leaves]] or salam leaves, [[candlenut]]s, [[turmeric]], [[turmeric]] leaves, asam gelugur, asam kandis, [[shrimp paste]] ([[terasi]]), [[cumin]], [[coriander]] seed and [[coconut milk]]. One popular curry is [[rendang]] from West Sumatran cuisine. Authentic rendang uses water buffalo slow-cooked in thick coconut milk for a number of hours to tenderise and flavour the meat. In Aceh, curries use daun salam koja or daun kari (translated as &quot;curry leaves&quot;). [[:id:Opor ayam|Opor Ayam]] is another kind of curry, which tastes very similar to that of gulai. Some{{Who|date=October 2010}} say opor is the name widely used in [[Java]] to refer to gulai itself (gulai is the word used in [[Sumatra]]) however opor (usually) does not use cinnamon, while gulai does. Opor is also known to be part of a family meal around [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]{{dn}}, while gulai can be commonly found in West Sumatran restaurants.

====Malaysian cuisine====
{{See also|Cuisine of Malaysia}}
Being at the crossroads of ancient trade routes has left a mark on the Malaysian cuisine. While the curry may have initially found its way to Malaysian shores via the Indian population, it has since become a staple among the Malays and Chinese too. Malaysian curries differ from state to state, even within similar ethnic groupings, as they are influenced by the many factors, be it cultural, religious, agricultural or economical.

Malaysian curries typically use curry powders rich in turmeric, coconut milk, shallots, ginger, [[belacan]] (shrimp paste), chilis, and garlic. Tamarind is also often used. [[Rendang]] is another form of curry consumed in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia; although it is drier and contains mostly meat and more coconut milk than a conventional Malaysian curry. Rendang was mentioned in Malay literature [[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rahQDaE0bD8C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=rendang+hikayat |title=Hikayat Amir Hamzah |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08 | isbn=9789831921166}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1550-an)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcp.anu.edu.au/N/AHmz_bib.html |title=malay concordance project |publisher=Mcp.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is popular among Indonesians, Singaporeans and Malaysians. All sorts of things are curried in Malaysia, including mutton, chicken, shrimp, cuttlefish, fish, aubergines, eggs, and vegetables.

====Philippine cuisine====
{{See also|cuisine of the Philippines}}
In the  Philippines, mostly a linear range of curry recipes could be seen. A typical curry dish would be usually of either pork or chicken as the meat while cooked at a similar manner as to other local dishes such as [[adobo]], [[kaldereta]], and [[mechado]] with potatoes, bay leaf, and sometimes carrots to complement.

====Thai cuisine====
{{See also|Cuisine of Thailand}}
In Thai cuisine, curries are meat, fish and/or vegetable dishes in a sauce based on a paste made from of chilies, spices and herbs. They use local ingredients such as chili peppers, [[kaffir lime]] leaves, [[lemon grass]], [[galangal]] and, in central and southern Thai cuisine, also coconut milk. Northern and northeastern Thai curries generally do not contain coconut milk. Due to the use of fresh herbs, spices, and other fresh ingredients, Thai curries tend to be more aromatic than Indian curries. In the West, a few Thai curries are described by color; [[red curry|red curries]] use red chilies while [[green curry|green curries]] use green chilies. [[Yellow curry]] - called ''Kaeng kari'' (by various spellings) in [[Thai language|Thai]], of which a literal translation would be &quot;curry soup&quot; - is more similar to Indian curries, with the use of [[turmeric]], [[cumin]], and other dried spices. A few dishes also utilise an Indian style curry powder (Thai: ''pong kari'').

Thai curries:
* [[Yellow curry]]
* [[Massaman curry]]
* [[Green curry]]
* [[Red curry]]
* [[Phanaeng curry]]
* [[Khao soi]]
* Kaeng hangle
* Kaeng lueang

====Vietnamese cuisine====
{{See also|Cuisine of Vietnam}}

In [[Vietnam]], curry is called ''cà ri''. Vietnamese curry features coconut milk, potato, sweet potato, taro roots, chicken garnished with cilantro and green onion and is more soup-like than Indian curry. Goat curry also exists but only at a few specialized restaurants. The curry is usually eaten with a baguette, rice vermicelli or steamed rice. At home, people usually only make chicken curry on each Death anniversary day of a family member. Vietnamese curry is considered a Southern food.

==Other cuisines==
Other countries have their own varieties of curry, well known examples include:

* [[Cuisine of South Africa|South Africa]]: Cape Malay curries and Durban Curries
* [[Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]]: [[Curry Goat]]
* [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], and [[Tonga]]: Known generally as &quot;kare&quot; or &quot;kale,&quot; the spice is a popular ingredient in curried lamb, mutton, and chicken stew. Often prepared with coconut milk and accompanied by rice or taro.
* [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopia]]: [[Wat (food)|Wat]], a thick, heavily spiced stew
* [[German cuisine|Germany]]: [[Currywurst]]
* [[Cuisine of Africa|Central Africa]]: [[Groundnut stew]], though not technically a curry, is a similar style
* [[Central Europe]]: [[Gulash]] A spicy stew or soup usually made with paprika, garlic, potatoes, beef or pork and dill. Not served with rice.

Curry powder is used as an incidental ingredient in other cuisines, including for example a &quot;curry sauce&quot; (''sauce au curry'', sometimes even ''au cari'') variation of the classic French [[béchamel]].

===British cuisine===
{{See also|Anglo-Indian cuisine}}

In [[British cuisine]], the word &quot;curry&quot; is primarily used to denote a sauce-based dish flavoured with [[curry powder]] or a paste made from the powder and oils. However, the use of fresh spices such as ginger and [[garlic]], and preparation of an initial masala from freshly ground dried spices are sometimes used.

The first curry recipe in Britain appeared in ''[[Art of Cookery|The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy]]'' by [[Hannah Glasse]] in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= The art of cookery, made plain and easy | author=Hannah Glasse | id=OCLC 4942063 | year = 1747}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of her book used only pepper and coriander seeds for seasoning of &quot;currey&quot;. By the fourth edition of the book other relatively common ingredients of [[turmeric]] and [[ginger]] were used. The use of hot spices was not mentioned, which reflected the limited use of chili in India — [[chili pepper|chili plants]] had only been introduced into India around the late 15th century and at that time were only popular in southern India. Many curry recipes are contained in 19th century cookbooks such as those of [[Charles Elme Francatelli]] and [[Mrs Beeton]]. In ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', a recipe for curry powder is given that contains coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, mustard, ginger, allspice and fenugreek; although she notes that it is more economical to purchase the powder at &quot;any respectable shop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= Mrs. Beeton's book of household management | author=Isabella Mary Beeton | pages=215 | isbn=0-304-35726-X | year = 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, the [[British Bangladeshi|British Bengali]] entrepreneur [[Sake Dean Mahomed]] opened the first Indian curry house in [[England]]: the Hindoostanee Coffee House in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Curry house founder is honoured|date=29 September 2005|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4290124.stm|accessdate=2008-10-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, one 19th century attempt at curry resulted in the invention of [[Worcestershire sauce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= Curry: A tale of cooks and conquerors | author=Lizzie Collingham | isbn=0 09 943786 4 | year = 2006 | publisher = Vintage | chapter = Curry Powder| pages=149–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curry grew increasingly popular in Britain as a result of importation from the [[British Raj]] and with immigration from South Asia from the 1950s onwards.

Until the early 1970s more than three quarters of Indian restaurants in Britain were identified as being owned and run by people of [[Bengal]]i origin.  Most were run by migrants from [[East Pakistan]], which became [[Bangladesh]] in 1971. Bangladeshi restaurateurs overwhelmingly come from the northeastern division of [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]].  Until 1998, as many as 85% of curry restaurants in the UK were [[British Bangladeshi]] restaurants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curryhouse.co.uk/scene/ethnshow.htm|title=UK Curry Scene|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2003 this figure declined to just over 65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/177_food/page5.shtml|title=Indian Curry in London|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently the dominance of Bangladeshi restaurants is generally declining in some parts of [[London]] and the further north one travels.  In [[Glasgow]] there are more restaurants of [[Punjab region|Punjabi]] origin than any other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.menumagazine.co.uk/book/restauranthistory.html|title=The history of the &quot;ethnic&quot; restaurant in Britain|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the ethnic origin of a restaurant's ownership, the menu will often be influenced by the wider [[Indian subcontinent]] (sometimes including [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese dishes]]), and sometimes cuisines from further afield (such as [[Cuisine of Iran|Persian dishes]]).  Some British variations on Indian food are now being exported from the UK to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8635456.stm|title=Can the British curry take off in India?|accessdate=2010-04-23 | work=BBC News | date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British-style curry restaurants are also popular in [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

Curry has become an integral part of [[British cuisine]], so much so that, since the late 1990s, [[Chicken Tikka Masala]] has been referred to as &quot;a true British national dish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,,657407,00.html|title=Robin Cook's chicken tikka masala speech|accessdate=2006-12-12 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2001-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now available on [[InterCity (British Rail)|Intercity]] rail trains, as a flavour for [[crisps]], and even as a [[pizza]] topping.

Other British curry derivatives include &quot;[[Coronation chicken]]&quot;, a cold dish invented to commemorate the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953 - and '''curry sauce''' (or '''curry gravy'''), usually served warm with traditional British fast food dishes such as [[French fried potatoes|chips]]. Curry sauce occasionally includes [[Sultana (grape)|sultana]]s.

====British curry house====
Curry is eaten in almost all parts of the Indian subcontinent and outside, namely India, Bangladesh and [[Pakistan]], it has its varying degrees of style, taste and aroma, depending on local ingredients used.

Bengalis in the UK settled in big cities with industrial employment. In London Bengalis settled in the East End. For centuries the East End has been the first port of call for many immigrants working in the docks and shipping from east Bengal. Their regular stopover paved the way for food/curry outlets to be opened up catering for an all male workforce as family migration and settlement took place some decades later.

This cuisine is characterized by the use of a common base for all the sauces to which spices are added when individual dishes are prepared. The standard &quot;feedstock&quot; is usually a sautéed mixture of onion, garlic and fresh ginger, to which various spices are added, depending on the recipe, but which may include: cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, chilies, peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. Ground [[coriander]] seed is widely used as a thickening agent, and [[turmeric]] is added for colour and its digestive qualities. Fresh or canned tomatoes and Bell Peppers are a common addition.

Better-quality restaurants will normally make up new sauces on a daily basis, using fresh ingredients wherever possible and grinding their own spices. More modest establishments are more likely to resort to frozen or dried ingredients and pre-packaged spice mixtures.

Although the names may be similar to traditional dishes, the recipes generally are not.

* [[Korma]]/kurma - mild, yellow in colour, with almond and coconut powder.
* Curry - medium, brown, gravy-like sauce.
* [[Biryani]] - Spiced rice and meat cooked together and usually served with vegetable curry sauce.
* [[Dupiaza]]/dopiaza - medium curry the word means &quot;double onion&quot; referring to the boiled and fried onions used as its primary ingredient.
* [[Pasanda]] - a mild curry sauce made with [[cream]], [[coconut milk]], and [[almonds]] or [[cashews]].
* [[Rogan josh|Roghan josh]] (from &quot;roghan&quot; (fat) and &quot;josh&quot; (energy/heat - which as in English may refer to either &quot;spiciness&quot; or temperature)) - medium, with tomatoes and paprika.
* Bhuna - medium, thick sauce, some vegetables.
* [[Dhansak]] - medium/hot, sweet and sour sauce with lentils (originally a [[Parsi people|Parsi]] dish). This dish often also contains [[pineapple]].
* [[Madras (curry)|Madras]] - fairly hot curry, red in colour and with heavy use of chili powder.
* [[Pathia]] - hot, generally similar to a madras with lemon juice and tomato purée.
* [[Jalfrezi]] - onion, green chili and a thick sauce.
* [[Sambar (dish)|Sambar]] - medium heat, sour curry made with lentils and lemons.
* [[Vindaloo]] - this is generally regarded as the classic &quot;hot&quot; restaurant curry, although a true vindaloo does not specify any particular level of spiciness. The name has European origins, derived from the Portuguese term &quot;vinha d'alhos&quot;, a marinade containing [[wine]] (&quot;vinho&quot;), or sometimes vinegar, and [[garlic]] (&quot;alho&quot;), used to prevent the pork from going off in hot weather.
* [[Phall|Phaal]] - extremely hot dish using ground chilies, ginger and fennel.

The [[tandoor]] was introduced into Britain in the 1960s and [[tandoori]] and tikka chicken became popular dishes; [[chicken tikka masala]] was said to have been invented in Glasgow.

Other dishes may be featured with varying strengths, with those of north Indian origin, such as [[butter chicken]], tending to be mild, and recipes from the south of India tending to be hotter.

====Balti curries====
{{Main|Balti (food)}}
[[File:Balti gosht.jpg|thumb|right|A Pakistani-style Balti curry]]
Baltis are a style of curry thought to have been developed in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oed.com/bbcwordhunt/list.html#balti |title=Wordhunt appeal list - Balderdash Wordhunt - Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have spread to other western countries and are traditionally cooked and served in the same, typically cast iron pot. It is believed that their origin lies in the Pakistani region of [[Baltistan]], from where they were brought and pioneered by South Asian migrants to the UK. 

====Curry house cuisine at home====
The popularity of curry houses in Britain has encouraged a number of publications aiming to show how the curry house cuisine, as opposed to authentic Indian cuisine, can be recreated at home. Notable publications are Kris Dhillon's book ''The Curry Secret'' which was first published in 1989 but has been reprinted as recently as 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dhillon | first = Kris | title = The Curry Secret | publisher = Right Way | isbn = 978-0716021919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhillon reports having had experience working in her own Indian-style restaurant before publishing the book.&lt;ref&gt;

===West Indies===
In the [[West Indies]], curry is a very popular dish.  The Indian [[indentured servant]]s that were brought over from India by different European powers, brought this dish, as well as their culture, to the West Indies. In [[Jamaica]] and Trinidad, curried goat is prominently featured. Curry can be found at both inexpensive and upscale Caribbean restaurants, and ingredients can range from chicken or vegetables to shellfish such as shrimp and scallops. Examples of curries in the West Indies include:

* [[Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]]: Especially curried chicken, goat, fish and shrimp
* [[Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]]: Most notably curried chicken, goat, shrimp, and curry aloo
* [[Cuisine of Guyana|Guyana]]: Chicken Curry, Goat Curry, Duck Curry, Shrimp Curry, Beef Curry (eaten by Muslims), Aloo Curry, Fish (different varieties of fish) Curry, etc.

==Curry powder==
{{Main| Curry powder}}
Curry powder is a spice mixture of widely varying composition developed by the British during the days of the ''[[British Raj|Raj]]'' as a means of approximating the taste of Indian cuisine at home. [[Masala]] refers to spices, and this is the name given to the thick and pasty sauce based on a combination of spices with ghee (clarified butter), butter, palm oil or coconut milk.  Most commercial curry powders available in Britain, the U.S. and Canada, rely heavily on ground [[turmeric]], in turn producing a very yellow sauce.  Lesser ingredients in these Western yellow curry powders are often [[coriander]], cumin, [[fenugreek]], mustard, chili, black pepper and salt.  It should be reiterated that curry powders and pastes produced and consumed in India are extremely diverse; some red, some yellow, some brown; some with five spices and some with as many as 20 or more.  Besides the previously mentioned spices, other commonly found spices in different curry powders in India are allspice, white pepper, ground mustard, ground ginger, cinnamon, roasted cumin, cloves, nutmeg, mace, green cardamom seeds or black cardamom pods, bay leaves and coriander seeds.

==Health benefits==
Some studies have shown that ingredients in curry may help to prevent certain diseases, including colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/597525.stm |title=HEALTH &amp;#124; &quot;Curry is cancer fighter&quot; |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-01-10 |accessdate=2009-06-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1668932.stm |title=HEALTH &amp;#124; Curry &quot;may slow Alzheimer's&quot; |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of studies have claimed that the reaction of pain receptors to the hotter ingredients in curries leads to the body's release of [[endorphin]]s, indeed, curry is one of the most powerful [[aphrodisiacs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/808411-chocolate-curry-launched-for-valentine-s-day|title=Chocolate curry launched for Valentine’s Day|publisher=Metro.co.uk|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;With the complex sensory reaction to the variety of spices and flavours, a natural high is achieved that causes subsequent cravings, often followed by a desire to move on to hotter curries. Some refer to this as [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], but other researchers contest the use of the word &quot;addiction&quot; in this instance.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

A '''camel''' is an [[even-toed ungulate]] within the genus '''''Camelus''''', bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as humps on its back. There are two species of camels: the [[dromedary]] or [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] camel has a single hump, and the [[bactrian camel|bactrian]] has two humps. Dromedaries are native to the dry [[desert]] areas of [[West Asia]], and Bactrian camels are native to [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[East Asia]]. Both species are domesticated; they provide [[camel milk|milk]] and [[meat]], and are [[working animal]]s.

The term ''camel'', (from the Arabic جمل, ''ǧml'', derived from the [[triconsonantal root]] signifying &quot;beauty&quot;), is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like creatures in the family [[camelid]]ae: the two true camels, and the four [[South America]]n camelids: the [[llama]], [[alpaca]], [[guanaco]], and [[vicuña]].

The average [[life expectancy]] of a camel is 40 to 50 [[year]]s. A fully grown adult camel stands {{convert|1.85|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at the shoulder and {{convert|2.15|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at the hump. The hump rises about {{convert|30|in|cm|2|abbr=on}} out of its body. Camels can run at up to {{convert|65|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to {{convert|40|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.

Fossil evidence indicates that the ancestors of modern camels evolved in [[North America]] during the [[Palaeogene]] period (see also ''[[Camelops]]''), and later spread to most parts of Asia. The people of ancient [[Somalia]] or the [[Kingdom of Punt]] first domesticated camels well before 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smithsonian Timelines of the Ancient World|first=Chris|last=Scarre|date=1993-09-15|isbn=978-1564583055|page=176|quote=Both the dromedary (the seven-humped camel of Arabia) and the Bactrian camel (the two-humped camel of Central Asia) had been domesticated since before 2000 BC.|publisher=D.

== Distribution and number ==
The 14 million [[Dromedary|dromedaries]] alive today are [[List of domesticated animals|domesticated animals]] (mostly living in [[Somalia]], the [[Sahel]], [[Maghreb]], [[Middle East]] and [[Indian subcontinent]]). An estimated quarter of the world's camel population is found in Somalia and in the [[Somali Region]] of Ethiopia, where the camel is an important part of nomadic Somali life. They provide the [[Somali people]] with milk, food and transportation.
[[File:800px-2003camel.PNG|thumb|left|300px|Commercial camel market headcount in 2003]]
The [[Bactrian camel]] is now reduced to an estimated 1.4&amp;nbsp;million animals, mostly domesticated. It is thought that there are about 1000 wild Bactrian camels in the [[Gobi Desert]] in China and Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalinfo.org/species/artiperi/camebact.htm Wild Bactrian Camel], Animal Info{{Verify credibility|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a substantial [[feral]] population of dromedaries estimated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Edwards GP, Zeng B, Saalfeld WK, Vaarzon-Morel P and McGregor M |year=2008 |title=Managing the impacts of feral camels in Australia: a new way of doing business |type=DKCRC Report 47 |publisher=Desert Knowledge Cooperative Research Centre |location=Alice Springs |isbn=1-74158-094-3 |url=http://www.feralcamels.com.au/assets/files/publications/DKCRC%20Report%2047%20Managing%20the%20impacts%20of%20feral%20camels%20in%20Australia_A%20new%20way%20of%20doing%20businessLR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; at up to 1,000,000 in central parts of [[Australia]], descended from individuals introduced as transport animals in the 19th century and early 20th century. This population is growing at approximately 18% per year. The government of [[South Australia]] has decided to cull the animals using aerial marksmen, because the camels use too much of the limited resources needed by [[sheep]] farmers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} For more information, see [[Australian feral camel]].

A small population of introduced camels, dromedaries and Bactrians survived in the [[Southwest United States]] until the second half of the 20th Century. These animals, imported from Turkey, were part of the [[U.S. Camel Corps]] experiment and used as draft animals in mines and escaped or were released after the project was terminated. A descendant of one of these was seen by a backpacker in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in 1972. Twenty-three Bactrian camels were brought to Canada during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].

== Eco-behavioural adaptations ==
Camels do not store water in their humps as is commonly believed. The humps are actually a reservoir of fatty tissue. Concentrating [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] in their humps minimizes heat-trapping insulation throughout the rest of their body, which may be an adaptation to living in hot climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Jocelyn |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/jan/05-20-things-you-didnt-know-about-fat |title=20 Things You Didn't Know About... Fat &amp;#124; Obesity |publisher=DISCOVER Magazine |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this tissue is metabolized, it acts as a source of energy, and yields more than 1&amp;nbsp;g of water for each 1&amp;nbsp;g of fat converted through reaction with oxygen from air. This [[lipolysis|process of fat metabolization]] generates a net loss of water through respiration for the oxygen required to convert the fat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biol.lu.se/zoofysiol/Djurartiklar/Kamel.html What secrets lie within the camel's hump?], [[Lund University]], [[Sweden]].

[[File:Camel portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|A camel's thick coat is one of their many adaptations that aid them in desert-like conditions.&lt;!---Don't move this image up or it causes a break in the text on wide screens---&gt;]]
Their ability to withstand long periods without water is due to a series of physiological adaptations. Their [[red blood cell]]s have an oval shape, unlike those of other [[mammals]], which are circular. This facilitates their flow in a [[dehydration|dehydrated]] state. These cells are also more stable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eitan |first1=A |last2=Aloni |first2=B |last3=Livne |first3=A |title=Unique properties of the camel erythrocyte membraneII.

Retrieved 8 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oval red corpuscles are not found in any other mammal, but are present in reptiles, birds, and fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kidsmicroscope.com/examining-your-blood-under-a-compound-microscope.html Examining your blood under a compound microscope], Kidsmicroscope.com. Accessed June 7, 2009.{{Verify credibility|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camels are able to withstand changes in [[body temperature]] and water consumption that would kill most other animals. Their temperature ranges from {{convert|34|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} at night and up to {{convert|41|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} during the day, and only above this threshold will they begin to sweat. The upper body temperature range is often not reached during the day in milder climatic conditions, and therefore, the camel may not sweat at all during the day. Evaporation of their sweat takes place at the skin level, not at the surface of their coat, thereby being very efficient at cooling the body compared to the amount of water lost through [[perspiration]].

[[File:Camel cart.JPG|left|thumb|Camels are used as draft animals in [[Pakistan]]]]
[[File:Camels at Giza.JPG|left|thumb|Domesticated camels at the Pyramids of Giza]]
A feature of their nostrils is that a large amount of [[water vapor]] in their exhalations is trapped and returned to their body fluids, thereby reducing the amount of water lost through respiration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9E02E4DE1F38F931A25754C0A967948260 |title=A Pilgrimage To A Mystic's Hermitage In Algeria - The |publisher=New York Times |date=1981-07-12 |accessdate=2009-03-07 | first=Paul | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can withstand at least 20-25% weight loss due to sweating (most mammals can only withstand about 15% dehydration before [[Congestive heart failure|cardiac failure]] results from circulatory disturbance).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A camel's blood remains hydrated, even though the body fluids are lost, until this 25% limit is reached.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies' hydrated state without the need for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0690e/t0690e09.htm FAO Camels], Camel information from The Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N.&lt;/ref&gt;

A camel's thick coat reflects sunlight, and also insulates it from the intense heat radiated from desert sand. A shorn camel has to sweat 50% more to avoid overheating. Their long legs help by keeping them further from the hot ground. Camels have been known to swim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1838/is-the-camel-the-only-animal-that-cant-swim The Straight Dope], Answering the question Is the Camel the Only Animal that can't Swim?&lt;/ref&gt;

Their mouth is very sturdy, able to chew thorny desert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with sealable nostrils, form a barrier against sand. Their gait and their widened feet help them move without sinking into the sand.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The [[kidney]]s and [[intestines]] of a camel are very efficient at retaining water. Urine comes out as a thick syrup, and their feces are so dry that they can fuel fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BBC Science &amp; Nature - Wildfacts | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/3036.shtml | accessdate=2010-02-02 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All camelids have an unusual [[immune system]]. In all mammals, the Y-shaped [[antibody]] molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length of the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels also have antibody molecules that have only two heavy chains, which makes them smaller and more durable. These ''heavy chain-only'' antibodies, which were discovered in 1993, probably developed 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, after camelids split from ruminants and pigs, according to biochemist Serge Muyldermans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koenig |first1=R. |title=VETERINARY MEDICINE: 'Camelized' Antibodies Make Waves |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5855 |pages=1373 |year=2007 |pmid=18048665 |doi=10.1126/science.318.5855.1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camel is the only animal to have replaced the wheel (mainly in [[North Africa]]) where the wheel had already been established. The camel did not lose that distinction until the wheel was combined with the internal combustion engine in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bulliet |first=Richard |year=1990 |origyear=1975 |title=The Camel and the Wheel |series=Morningside Book Series |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=023107235X}}{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cama (animal)|cama]] is a camel/[[llama]] hybrid bred by scientists who wanted to see how closely related the parent species were. The dromedary is six times the weight of a llama, hence artificial insemination was required to impregnate the llama female (llama male to dromedary female attempts have proven unsuccessful). Though born even smaller than a llama cria, the cama had the short ears and long tail of a camel, no hump and llama-like [[cloven-hoof|cloven hooves]] rather than the dromedary-like pads. At four years old, the cama became sexually mature and attracted to llama and guanaco females. A second cama (female) has since been produced using artificial insemination. Because camels and llamas both have 74 [[chromosome]]s, scientists hope that the cama will be fertile. If so, there is potential for increasing size, meat/wool yield and pack/draft ability in South American camels. The cama apparently inherited the poor temperament of both parents as well as demonstrating the relatedness of the New World and Old World camelids.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Dromedary-Bactrian hybrids are called bukhts, are larger than either parent, have a single hump and are good draft camels. The females can be mated back to a Bactrian to produce ¾-bred riding camels. These hybrids are found in Kazakhstan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Military uses==
[[File:Camel corps at Magdhaba.jpg|thumb|British Imperial Camel Corps Brigade in Egypt]]
{{Main|Camel cavalry}}
Since at least 1200 BC, the first camel saddles appeared, and Bactrian camels could be ridden. The first Arabian saddle was put way to the back of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel happened by means of a stick. However it wasn't until between 500-100 BC that Bactrian camels finally attained a military use. These new saddles were put over the humps of the animal, and they were also inflexible and bent, dividing the weight sufficiently over the animal. In the seventh century D.C., the military Arabian saddle then appeared, which improved the saddle design again slightly.&lt;ref&gt;The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World by Brian M. Fagan{{Page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camel cavalry]] have been used in wars throughout Africa, the Middle East and into modern-day India. Armies have also used camels as freight animals instead of horses and mules.

&lt;!-- until the first century BC, the Romans didn't use bactrian camels as they didn't know any appropriate saddles, they used them only as a beast of burden and to form a perimeter around the camp (protecting circle &lt;ref&gt;The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World by Brian M. Fagan&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
In the [[East Roman Empire]] the Romans used [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] forces known as [[Dromedarii]], whom they recruited in desert provinces. The camels were mostly used in combat because of their ability to scare off horses in close ranges, a quality famously employed by the [[Achaemenid]] Persians when fighting [[Lydia]], although the Persians usually used camels as baggage trains for arrows and equipment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===19th and 20th Centuries===
*The [[United States Army]] established the [[U.S. Camel Corps]], which was stationed in [[California]] in the 19th century. One may still see brick stables at the [[Benicia Arsenal]] in [[Benicia, California]], where they serve as artists' and artisans' studio spaces. During the [[American Civil War]], camels were used at an experimental stage, but were not used any further, as they were unpopular with the men.  Some escaped and their descendants roamed the arid parts of the American West until as late as the early 20th century.
*France created a [[méhariste]] camel corps as part of the Armée d'Afrique in the Sahara from 1902, replacing regular units of Algerian [[spahis]] and [[tirailleurs]] earlier used to patrol the desert boundaries. The camel-mounted units remained in service until the end of French rule in 1962. The French transferred the French personnel to other units and disbanded the locally recruited méharistes.
*In 1916, during [[World War I]], the British created the [[Imperial Camel Corps]], which was a [[brigade]]-sized military formation that fought in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. It comprised infantry mounted on camels for movement across desert. In May 1918 the Corps was reduced in strength to a single [[battalion]] and was formally disbanded in May  1919. Also during World War I, the British Army created the [[Egyptian Camel Transport Corps]], which consisted of a group of Egyptian camel drivers and their camels. The Corps supported British war operations in the Sinai desert, Palestine and Syria by transporting supplies to the troops.
*The [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] was a unit of the British Army based in [[British Somaliland]] from the early 20th century until the 1960s.
*The [[Bikaner Camel Corps]] was a military unit from India that fought for the Allies in World War I and World War II.
*The [[Tropas Nómadas]] (Nomad Troops) were an auxiliary regiment of Sahrawi tribesmen serving in the colonial army in Spanish Sahara (today Western Sahara). Operational from the 1930s until the end of the Spanish presence in the territory in 1975, the Tropas Nómadas were equipped with small arms and led by Spanish officers. The unit guarded outposts and sometimes conducted patrols on camelback.

== Cuisine ==
===Dairy===
[[File:Camelcalf-feeding.jpg|right|thumb|Camel calf feeding on her mother's milk]]

[[Camel milk]] is a [[staple food]] of desert nomad tribes and is considered a whole food, nomads requiring nothing but camel milk for up to six months. Camel milk is rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins and immunoglobins. It is lower in fat and cholesterol fat than cow milk. It is said{{by whom|date=December 2010}} to have many healthful properties and is used as a medicinal product in [[India]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Africa and the Middle East. It is also used as an  [[aphrodisiac]] in these countries, an example being [[Ethiopia]]. [[Bedouin]]s believe that the curative powers of camel milk are enhanced if the camel's diet consists of certain desert plants. Camel milk can readily be made into a drinkable [[yogurt]], but does not set due to lesser milk solids than cow or goat's milk. Camel milk cream can be separated and made into butter or cheese but the yields will be low in comparison to buffalo or cow cream, again due to the low fat and solids content. 

Camel milk cannot be made into [[butter]] by the traditional churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent added, or if it is churned at {{convert|24|–|25|C|F}}, but times vary greatly in achieving results. Until recently, camel milk could not be made into [[camel milk|camel cheese]] because [[rennet]] was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of [[curd]]s. Under the commission of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], Professor J.P. Ramet of the [[École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires]] (ENSAIA) was able to produce curdling by the addition of [[calcium phosphate]] and vegetable rennet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/news/2001/010701-e.htm Fresh from your local drome'dairy'?] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], July 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant.. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the single dairy currently producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in most camel cultures. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions. 

===Meat===
[[File:Camels in Dubai 2.jpg|right|thumb|Domesticated camel calves in [[Dubai]]]]
A camel [[Body|carcass]] can provide a substantial amount of meat. The male dromedary carcass can weigh {{convert|400|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or more, while the carcass of a male Bactrian can weigh up to {{convert|650|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. The carcass of a female camel (or she-camel) weighs less than the male, ranging between {{convert|250|and|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The brisket, ribs and loin are among the preferred parts, but the hump is considered a delicacy and is most favored.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It is reported that camel meat tastes like coarse beef, but older camels can prove to be very tough and less flavorful. The meat from older camels is best prepared by slow cooking. Camel meat is low in fat, and can thus taste dry. The [[Abu Dhabi]] Officers' Club serves a camel burger, as this allows the meat to be mixed with beef or lamb fat, improving both the texture and taste. In [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] the exclusive [[Nihari]] restaurants prepare this dish from camel meat, while the general restaurants prepare it with either [[beef]] or [[water buffalo]] meat.

Camel meat has been eaten for centuries. It has been recorded by [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writers as an available dish in ancient [[Persia]] at banquets, usually roasted whole. The ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] emperor [[Elagabalus|Heliogabalus]] enjoyed camel's heel. Camel meat is still eaten in certain regions including [[Somalia]], where it is called ''Hilib geel'', [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Sudan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and other arid regions where alternative forms of protein may be limited or where camel meat has had a long cultural history. In the Middle East, camel meat is the rarest and most prized source of [[pastırma]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Not just the meat, but also blood is a consumable item as is the case in northern [[Kenya]], where camel blood is a source of [[iron]], [[vitamin D]], salts and minerals. Camel meat is also occasionally found in [[Australian cuisine]], for example, a camel [[lasagne]] is available in [[Alice Springs]].

===Health issues===
A 2005 report issued jointly by the Saudi Ministry of Health and the United States Center for Disease Control details cases of human [[bubonic plague]] resulting from the ingestion of raw camel liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Abdulaziz A. |last1=Bin Saeed |first2=Nasser A. |last2=Al-Hamdan |first3=Robert E. |last3=Fontaine |title=Plague from eating raw camel liver. |pmid=16229781 |year=2005 |pages=1456–7 |issue=9 |volume=11 |journal=Emerging infectious diseases |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no09/05-0081.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Islam===
Camel meat is [[halal]] for [[Islam|Muslims]], however according to the some [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools of thought]] a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it. Consequently, they hold that Muslims must perform [[wudhu]] before [[salah|praying]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/001.sat.html#001.0184&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are Islamic traditions allow the drinking urine for medicinal purposes. However, these traditions have varying levels of authentication within Islamic scholarship.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bukhari 7:71:590&quot;&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]] [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/071.sbt.html#007.071.590 7:71:590]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]] [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/082.sbt.html#008.082.796 8:82:796]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools of thought]] consider it [[haraam]] for a [[Muslim]] give [[salah]] in places where camels lie as it is said to be a dwelling place of [[shaytan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/001.sat.html#001.0184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
According to [[Jewish]] tradition, camel meat and milk are not [[kosher]]. Camels possess only one of the two [[kosher foods|Kosher criteria]]; although they [[Ruminant|chew their cuds]], they do not possess [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] (See: [[Taboo food and drink]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0311.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Leviticus 11:4}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

{{Ancient Mesopotamia}}

'''Chaldea''' or '''Chaldaea''' (pronounced &quot;KalDĒa&quot;, from Greek {{lang|grc|Χαλδαία}}, ''Chaldaia''; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] {{lang|akk|māt Kaldu}}; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] כשדים, ''Kaśdim''&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: ܟܐܠܕܘ, ''Kaldo'') was a marshy land located in modern-day southern Iraq which came to briefly rule Babylon. Tribes of settlers who arrived in the region from the 8th Century BC became known as the Chaldeans or the Chaldees.
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] Bible uses the term כשדים (''Kaśdim'') and this is translated as Chaldaeans in the [[Septuagint]].

The short lived 11th dynasty of the [[Kings of Babylon]] (6th century BC) is conventionally known to historians as the [[Chaldean Dynasty]], although only the first four rulers of this dynasty were known to be Chaldeans, and the last ruler was known not to be. Their kingdom in the southern portion of [[Babylonia]] lay chiefly on the right bank of the Euphrates. Though the name came to be commonly used to refer to the whole of southern  Mesopotamia, Chaldea proper was in fact the vast plain in the far south east formed by the deposits of the [[Euphrates]] and the [[Tigris]], extending to about four hundred miles along the course of these rivers, and about a hundred miles in average width.

==The land==
Chaldea as the name of a country is used in two different senses. In the early period it was the name of a small territory in southern [[Babylonia]] extending along the northern and probably also the western shores of the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name=JE&gt;

{{cite web|title=Chaldea|work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=336&amp;letter=C&amp;search=chaldea|accessdate=2008-02-02}}

&lt;/ref&gt; It is called in Assyrian &quot;mat Kaldi&quot;—that is, &quot;land of Chaldea&quot;—but there is also used, apparently synonymously, the expression &quot;mat Bit Yakin.&quot; It would appear that [[Bit Yakin]] was the chief or capital city of the land; and the king of Chaldea is also called the king of Bit Yakin, just as the kings of Babylonia are regularly styled simply king of [[Babylon]], the capital city. In the same way, the Persian Gulf was sometimes called &quot;the Sea of Bit Yakin, instead of &quot;the Sea of the Land of Chaldea.&quot;

It is impossible to define narrowly the boundaries of this early land of Chaldea, and one may only locate it generally in the low, marshy, alluvial land about the estuaries of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], which then discharged their waters through separate mouths into the sea. In a later time, when the Chaldean tribe had burst their narrow bonds and obtained the ascendency over all Babylonia, they gave their name to the whole land of Babylonia, which then was called Chaldea for a short time.

In 627 BC a series of wars broke out in the [[Assyrian Empire]] over who should rule. These wars greatly weakened the empire. Sensing this weakness, the Chaldeans, the [[Medes]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] formed a coalition and attacked the Assyrian Empire. In 612 BC they destroyed [[Nineveh]] and the last Assyrian army in 605 BC . In its place, Babylon under its Chaldean rulers and the Medes set up a new empires of their own.

In the [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]] [[Old Testament]] book of the prophet Habbakuk Ch 1, v6 describes the Chaldeans as &quot;that bitter and hasty nation&quot;.

==The people==
The homeland of the Chaldean race was in the far south east of Mesopotamia. It is not certain whence they migrated at an unknown period into the country of the sea-lands about the head of the Persian Gulf. They seem to have appeared there at about the same time that the [[Aramean]]s and the [[Sutu]] appeared in Babylonia. Though belonging to the same &quot;[[Semitic]]&quot; ethnic group, they are to be differentiated from the Aramean stock; and [[Sennacherib]], for example, is careful in his inscriptions to distinguish them. When they came to possess the whole land, the name &quot;Chaldean&quot; became synonymous with &quot;Babylonian&quot;, particularly to the Greeks and Jews. In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the prophet [[Abraham]] is stated to have originally been from &quot;[[Ur of the Chaldees]]&quot; ([[Ur Kasdim]]); if this city is to be identified with the [[Sumer]]ian [[Ur]], it would be within the original Chaldean homeland south of the Euphrates. On the other hand, the traditional identification with a site in northern Mesopotamia would then imply the later sense of &quot;Babylonia&quot;, and a few interpreters have additionally confused Abraham's birthplace with [[Chaldia]], a distinct region on the [[Black Sea]]. According to the ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'', Ur Kasdim (and Chaldea) took their name from Ura and Kesed, descendants of [[Arpachshad]].

Though conquerors, the Chaldeans were rapidly and completely assimilated into the dominant Babylonian culture, as the [[Amorites]] before them had been, and after the fall of Babylon in 539 BC the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; was no longer used to describe a specific race of people, but rather a &quot;socio-Economic&quot; class, regardless of ethnicity.

The language used by the Chaldeans was the [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] dialect of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the same language, save for slight peculiarities in sound and in characters, as [[Assyrian language|Assyrian]] Akkadian. In late periods both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian ceased to be spoken, and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] took its place across Mesopotamia. One form of this widespread language is used in Daniel and Ezra, but the use of the name &quot;Chaldee&quot; to describe it, first introduced by Jerome, is incorrect and a misnomer.

==History==
{{See|Neo-Babylonian Empire}}
Important Kaldu cities were [[Bit-Yâkin]] (the original homeland at the Persian Gulf), [[Bit-Dakuri]], [[Bit-Adini]], [[Bit-Amukkani]], and [[Bit-Shilani]].

The Chaldean's homeland was in the relatively poor country in the far south of Mesopotamia, at the head of the [[Persian Gulf]]. The Chaldeans first came to prominence in the late 8th Century BC. [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]] (the Biblical [[Merodach-Baladan]]) of Bit-Yâkin, allied himself with the powerful [[Elamite]] kingdom and  seized control of Babylon in 721 BC after the death of the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser V]] who had ruled Babylon directly from [[Nineveh]]. The new king of Assyria [[Sargon II]] attacked and deposed Marduk-apla-iddina II in 710 BC. After defeat by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] he fled to his protectors in [[Elam]]. In 703 he briefly regained the throne from a native Babylonian ruler [[Marduk-zakir-shumi II]] who had ascended the throne after a revolt in Babylon against the Assyrian king, [[Sennacherib]]. He was once more defeated at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and again fled to Elam where he died in exile after one final attempt to raise a revolt against Assyria in his homeland, Bit-Yâkin in 700BC.

Babylon was then ruled by a native Babylonian puppet of the Assyrians [[Bel-ibni]], he was replaced by [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] an Assyrian prince who was murdered by the [[Elamites]] and replaced with a native Babylonian Elamite puppet [[Nergal-ushezib]].
The Chaldeans briefly regained control of Babylon in 693 BC when the populace deposed Nergal-ushezib, and chose [[Mushezib-Marduk]], a Chaldean prince to replace him. However, this was short lived, and Sennacherib sacked Babylon, destroying the city in [[689 BC]] routing the Babylonians, the Chaldeans of Bit-Yâkin and their Elamite backers in the process. Sennacheribs successor as king of Assyria, [[Esarhaddon]] rebuilt Babylon, but for the next 73 years Babylon remained under Assyrian control.

It was only in 620 BC under [[Nabopolassar]] that the Chaldeans finally gained control over Babylon, founding the [[Chaldean Dynasty]]. After the death of [[Ashurbanipal]], the last great Assyrian king in 627 BC, Assyria descended into a period of bitter civil war. A rebellious Assyrian general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] briefly  set himself up as king in Babylon, but was ousted by [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] the legitimate king of Assyria. Further civil war erupted with [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] seizing the throne of Assyria from his brother Ashur-etil-ilani .  Nabopolassar took advantage of all this to seize a rebellious Babylon. Bitter fighting continued in the region from 627 to 620 BC, the final straw was another massive rebellion in Assyria while its king [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] was marching on Babylon in an attempt to regain control. Nabopolassar seized [[Nippur]] and thus Babylonia as a whole.
Nabopolassar's position, and the fate of Assyria was sealed when he entered into an alliance with another of Assyria's former vassals, the [[Mede]]s, the now dominant people of what was to become [[Persia]]. The Medes, and Chaldean ruled Babylonians, together with the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] attacked Assyria in 616 BC, and by 612 BC the alliance had sacked [[Nineveh]], killing Sinsharishkun in the process. Nabopolassar and his allies were now in possession of the huge [[Neo Assyrian Empire]]. An Assyrian king [[Ashuruballit II]] held out at [[Harran]], resisting until 605 BC, when the remnants of the [[Assyria]]n Army and an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] force were defeated at [[Karchemish]].

The Chaldeans now ruled all of [[Mesopotamia]], and the former Assyrian possessions of [[Aram]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Israel]], [[Edom]] and parts of [[Arabia]], while the [[Medes]] took control of the former Assyrian colonies in [[Iran]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus]].

Nabopolassar was succeeded by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who became king after the death of his father in 604 BC.

Nebuchadnezzar was a patron of the cities and a spectacular builder. He rebuilt all of Babylonia's major cities on a lavish scale. His building activity at Babylon was what turned it into the immense and beautiful city of legend. His city of Babylon covered more than three square miles, surrounded by moats and ringed by a double circuit of walls. The Euphrates flowed through the center of the city, spanned by a beautiful stone bridge. At the center of the city rose the giant ziggurat called Etemenanki, &quot;House of the Frontier Between Heaven and Earth,&quot; which lay next to the Temple of Marduk.
A capable leader, Nabuchadnezzar II, conducted successful military campaigns in Aramea (Syria) and Phoenicia, forcing tribute from Damascus, Tyre and Sidon. He conducted numerous campaigns in Asia Minor, in the &quot;land of the Hatti&quot;. Like the Assyrians, the Babylonians had to campaign yearly in order to control their colonies.

In 601 BC Nebuchadnezzar II was involved in a major, but inconclusive battle, against the [[Egyptians]]. In 599 BC he invaded [[Arabia]] and routed the [[Arabs]] at [[Qedar]]. In 597 BC he invaded [[Judah]] and captured [[Jerusalem]] and deposed its king [[Jehoiachin]]. Egyptian and Babylonian armies fought each other for control of the near east throughout much of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and this encouraged king [[Zedekiah]] of Israel to revolt. After an 18 month siege Jerusalem was captured in 587 BC, thousands of Jews were deported to Babylon and Solomon's Temple was razed to the ground.

Nebuchadnezzar fought the Pharaohs [[Psammetichus II]] and [[Apries]] throughout his reign, and during the reign of Pharaoh [[Amasis]] in 568 BC it is rumoured that he may have set foot in Egypt itself.

By 572 Nebuchadnezzar was in full control of Mesopotamia, Syria, Phonecia, Israel, Philistinia, northern Arabia and parts of Asia Minor. Nebuchadnezzar died of illness in 562 BC.

He was succeeded by [[Amel-Marduk]], who was deposed after only 2 years on 560 BC.

===The End of the Chaldean Dynasty===

[[Neriglissar]] succeeded Amel-Marduk. It is unclear as to whether he was in fact a Chaldean or a native Babylonian nobleman, as he was not related by blood to Nabopolassar's descendants. He conducted successful military campaigns against Cilicia, which had threatened Babylonian interests. Neriglissar however reigned for only four years, being succeeded by the youthful [[Labashi-Marduk]] in 560 BC. Again it is unclear as to whether he was a Chaldean or a native Babylonian.

Labashi-Marduk reigned only for a matter of months, being deposed by [[Nabonidus]] in late 560 BC. Nabonidus, was certainly not a Chaldean, ironically he was an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] from [[Harran]]. Nabonidus proved to be the last king of Babylon, he and his son, the regent [[Belshazzar]] being deposed by the [[Persia|Persians]] in 539 BC.

When the Babylonian Empire empire was absorbed into the [[Persia|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]], the name &quot;Chaldean&quot; lost its meaning as the name of a race of men, and came to be applied only to a '''social class'''. The Persians found the Chaldeans masters of reading and writing, and especially versed in all forms of incantation, in sorcery, witchcraft, and the magical arts. They quite naturally spoke of astrologists and astronomers as Chaldeans. It therefore resulted that Chaldean came to mean astrologist. In this sense it is used in the [[Book of Daniel]] (Dan. i. 4, ii. 2 et seq.), and with the same meaning it is used by the classical writers (for example, by [[Strabo]]).

===Modern Chaldean Identity===

A small minority of followers of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] who are mainly based in the [[United States]] advocate a Chaldean ethnic identity. This is mainly a '''denominational rather than ethnic term''', as most are regarded as, and regard themselves as ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and are from the north of Iraq where Assyria was located rather from the far south where Chaldea was situated. The modern term &quot;Chaldean&quot; came into being when some Assyrian followers of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] entered communion with Rome in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Rome named the new church the &quot;Chaldean Catholic Church&quot;, after initially calling it the &quot;Church of Assyria and Mosul&quot;. Other than the fact that the Semitic, Aramaic speaking Christians of Iraq are pre Arab people of Mesopotamian stock, there has been no serious historical evidence produced thus far to support a &quot;specific&quot; link between the Chaldean Catholics (who were originally members of the &quot;Assyrian&quot; Church) and the ancient long disappeared Chaldean tribe. Conversely, there are strong arguments for Assyrian continuity.
Another term used is [[Chaldo-Assyrians]], a term used by many Assyrians and the [[Iraq]]i government to designate the indigenous Aramaic-speaking Christians of Iraq. It intrinsically acknowledges that both the term &quot;Assyrian&quot; and &quot;Chaldean&quot; refer to exactly the same ethnic group, and recognizes them as a distinct ethnic group. Some Assyrians also use this term in order to defuse arguments over naming along denominational lines.

{{Dablink|This article is about the function transformation technique. For the general variety of spicy dishes, see [[Curry]].}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], '''currying''' is the technique of transforming a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that takes multiple [[parameter (computer science)|arguments]] (or an n-[[tuple]] of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions each with a single argument ([[partial application]]). It was invented by [[Moses Schönfinkel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Christopher|last=Strachey|authorlink=Christopher Strachey|title=Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages|journal=[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]|volume=13|pages=11–49|year=2000|quote=There is a device originated by Schönfinkel, for reducing operators with several operands to the successive application of single operand operators.}} (Reprinted lecture notes from 1967.)&lt;/ref&gt; and later re-invented by [[Haskell Curry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Barendregt|2000|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=February 2010}}; because of this, some say it would be [[Stigler's law of eponymy|more accurate to name it]] ''schönfinkeling''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John C.|last=Reynolds|authorlink=John C. Reynolds|title=Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages |journal=[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]|volume=11|issue=4|page=374|doi=10.1023/A:1010027404223|quote=In the last line we have used a trick called Currying (after the logician H. Curry) to solve the problem of introducing a binary operation into a language where all functions must accept a single argument. (The referee comments that although “Currying” is tastier, “Schönfinkeling” might be more accurate.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Slonneger and Barry L. Kurtz. ''Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages''. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uncurrying''' (also known as counter-currying) is the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] transformation to currying, and can be seen as a form of [[defunctionalization]].  It takes a function ''f''('''''x''''') which returns another function ''g''('''''y''''') as a result, and yields a new function ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;('''''x''''', '''''y''''') which takes a number of additional parameters and applies them to the function returned by ''f''.  The process can be iterated if necessary.

==Motivation==
Currying is similar to the process of calculating a function of multiple variables for some given values on paper. For example, given the function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = y / x&lt;/math&gt;:

:To evaluate &lt;math&gt;f(2,3)&lt;/math&gt;, first replace &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with 2. 

:Since the result is a function of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, this function &lt;math&gt;g(y)&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;g(y) = f(2,y) = y/2&lt;/math&gt;.

:Next, replace the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; argument with 3, producing &lt;math&gt;g(3) = f(2,3) = 3/2&lt;/math&gt;.

On paper, using classical notation, this is usually done all in one step. However, each argument can be replaced sequentially as well. Each replacement results in a function taking exactly one argument. This produces a chain of functions as in [[lambda calculus]], and multi-argument functions are usually represented in curried form.

Some [[programming language]]s almost always use curried functions to achieve multiple arguments; notable examples are [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], where in both cases all functions have exactly one argument.

This is similar in computer code:
If we let &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; be a function
&lt;source lang=&quot;Haskell&quot;&gt;f(x,y) = y / x&lt;/source&gt;
then the function &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;Haskell&quot;&gt;g x = \y -&gt; f(x,y)&lt;/source&gt;
is a curried version of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;. In particular,
&lt;source lang=&quot;Haskell&quot;&gt;g 2 = \y -&gt; f(2,y)&lt;/source&gt;
is the curried equivalent of the example above.
Though note that currying, while similar, is not the same operation as [[#Contrast with partial function application|partial function application]].

== Definition ==
Given a function ''f'' of type &lt;math&gt; f \colon (X \times Y) \to Z &lt;/math&gt;, '''currying''' it makes a function &lt;math&gt; \text{curry}(f) \colon X \to (Y \to Z) &lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt; \text{curry}(f) &lt;/math&gt; takes an argument of type &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; and returns a function of type &lt;math&gt; Y \to Z &lt;/math&gt;. '''Uncurrying''' is the reverse transformation, and is most easily understood in terms of its right adjoint, [[apply]].

The → operator is often considered [[right-associative]], so the curried function type &lt;math&gt;X \to (Y \to Z)&lt;/math&gt; is often written as &lt;math&gt;X \to Y \to Z&lt;/math&gt;.  Conversely,  [[function application]] is considered to be left-associative, so that &lt;math&gt;f \; \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\text{curry}(f) \; x \; y&lt;/math&gt;.

Curried functions may be used in any language that supports [[closure (computer science)|closure]]s; however, uncurried functions are generally preferred for efficiency reasons, since the overhead of partial application and closure creation can then be avoided for most function calls.

== Mathematical view ==
In [[theoretical computer science]], currying provides a way to study functions with multiple arguments in very simple theoretical models such as the [[lambda calculus]] in which functions only take a single argument.

In a set-theoretic paradigm, currying is the natural correspondence between the set
&lt;math&gt;A^{B\times C}&lt;/math&gt; of functions from
&lt;math&gt;B\times C&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and the set &lt;math&gt;(A^B)^C&lt;/math&gt; of functions from
&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to the set of functions from &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  
In [[category theory]], currying can be found in the [[universal property]] of an [[exponential object]], which gives rise to the following [[adjunction]] in [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed categories]]: There is a [[Natural transformation|natural]] [[isomorphism]] between the [[morphism (category theory)|morphism]]s from a [[product (category theory)|binary product]] &lt;math&gt; f \colon (X \times Y) \to Z &lt;/math&gt; and the morphisms to an exponential object &lt;math&gt; g \colon X \to Z^Y &lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, currying is the statement that [[Product (category theory)|product]] and [[Hom functor|Hom]] are [[adjoint functors]]; that is there is a [[natural transformation]]: 
:&lt;math&gt; \hom(A\times B, C) \cong \hom(A, C^B) .&lt;/math&gt;
This is the key property of being a [[Cartesian closed category]].

Under the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], the existence of currying and uncurrying is equivalent to the logical theorem &lt;math&gt;(A \and B) \to C \Leftrightarrow A \to (B \to C)&lt;/math&gt;, as [[tuple]]s ([[product type]]) corresponds to conjunction in logic, and function type corresponds to implication.

Curry is a [[continuous function]] in the [[Scott topology]].

== Naming ==
The name &quot;currying&quot;, coined by [[Christopher Strachey]] in 1967, is a reference to logician [[Haskell Curry]].  The alternative name &quot;Schönfinkelisation&quot;, has been proposed as a reference to [[Moses Schönfinkel]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Heim and A. Kratzer (1998). ''Semantics in Generative Grammar''. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrast with partial function application ==
{{main|Partial application}}
Currying and partial function application are often conflated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncarved.com/blog/not_currying.mrk Partial Function Application is not Currying]&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between the two is clearest for functions taking more than two arguments.

Given a function of type &lt;math&gt; f \colon (X \times Y \times Z) \to N &lt;/math&gt;, currying produces &lt;math&gt; \text{curry}(f) \colon X \to (Y \to (Z \to N)) &lt;/math&gt;.  That is, while an evaluation of the first function might be represented as &lt;math&gt;f(1, 2, 3)&lt;/math&gt;, evaluation of the curried function would be represented as &lt;math&gt;f_{curried}(1)(2)(3)&lt;/math&gt;, applying each argument in turn to a single-argument function returned by the previous invocation.  Note that after calling &lt;math&gt;f_{curried}(1)&lt;/math&gt;, we are left with a function that takes a single argument and returns another function, not a function that takes two arguments.

In contrast, '''partial function application''' refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.  Given the definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; above, we might fix (or 'bind') the first argument, producing a function of type &lt;math&gt; \text{partial}(f) \colon (Y \times Z) \to N &lt;/math&gt;.  Evaluation of this function might be represented as &lt;math&gt;f_{partial}(2, 3)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the result of partial function application in this case is a function that takes two arguments.

Intuitively, partial function application says &quot;if you fix the first [[parameter (computer science)|argument]]s of the function, you get a function of the remaining arguments&quot;. For example, if function ''div'' stands for the division operation ''x'' /  ''y'', then ''div'' with the parameter ''x'' fixed at 1 (i.e. ''div'' 1) is another function: the same as the function ''inv'' that returns the multiplicative inverse of its argument, defined by ''inv''(''y'') = 1 / ''y''.

The practical motivation for partial application is that very often the functions obtained by supplying some but not all of the arguments to a function are useful; for example, many languages have a function or operator similar to &lt;code&gt;plus_one&lt;/code&gt;. Partial application makes it easy to define these functions, for example by creating a function that represents the addition operator with 1 bound as its first argument.

[[Image:Glasses 800 edit.png|thumb|right|300px|An image created by using [[POV-Ray]] 3.6.]]

'''Rendering''' is the process of generating an image from a [[3D model|model]] (or models in what collectively could be called a ''scene'' file), by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] image file. The term &quot;rendering&quot; may be by analogy with an &quot;artist's rendering&quot; of a scene. Though the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the [[graphics pipeline]] along a rendering device, such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. A GPU is a purpose-built device able to assist a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] in performing complex rendering calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the [[rendering equation]]. The rendering equation doesn't account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output. 

Rendering is one of the major sub-topics of [[3D computer graphics]], and in practice always connected to the others. In the [[graphics pipeline]], it is the last major step, giving the final appearance to the models and animation. With the increasing sophistication of computer graphics since the 1970s onward, it has become a more distinct subject.

Rendering has uses in [[Architectural rendering|architecture]], [[video game]]s, [[simulation|simulators]], [[film|movie]] or TV [[Visual effects|visual effects]], and design visualization, each employing a different balance of features and techniques. As a product, a wide variety of renderers are available. Some are integrated into larger modeling and animation packages, some are stand-alone, some are free open-source projects. On the inside, a renderer is a carefully engineered program, based on a selective mixture of disciplines related to: [[optics|light physics]], [[visual system|visual perception]], [[mathematics]] and [[software engineering|software development]].

In the case of 3D graphics, rendering may be done slowly, as in [[pre-rendered|pre-rendering]], or in real time.  Pre-rendering is a computationally intensive process that is typically used for movie creation, while real-time rendering is often done for 3D video games which rely on the use of graphics cards with 3D hardware accelerators.

== Usage ==
When the pre-image (a [[wireframe model|wireframe]] sketch usually) is complete, rendering is used, which adds in [[bitmap textures]] or [[procedural textures]], lights, [[bump mapping]] and relative position to other objects. The result is a completed image the consumer or intended viewer sees.

For movie animations, several images (frames) must be rendered, and stitched together in a program capable of making an animation of this sort. Most 3D image editing programs can do this.

== Features ==
[[Image:Cg-jewelry-design.jpg|right|thumb|Image rendered with computer aided design.]]
A rendered image can be understood in terms of a number of visible features. Rendering research and development has been largely motivated by finding ways to simulate these efficiently. Some relate directly to particular algorithms and techniques, while others are produced together.

* [[shading]] &amp;mdash; how the color and brightness of a surface varies with lighting
* [[texture mapping|texture-mapping]] &amp;mdash; a method of applying detail to surfaces
* [[bump mapping|bump-mapping]] &amp;mdash; a method of simulating small-scale bumpiness on surfaces
* [[distance fog|fogging/participating medium]] &amp;mdash; how light dims when passing through non-clear atmosphere or air
* [[shadow]]s &amp;mdash; the effect of obstructing light
* [[soft shadows]] &amp;mdash; varying darkness caused by partially obscured light sources
* [[Reflection (computer graphics)|reflection]] &amp;mdash; mirror-like or highly glossy reflection
* [[transparency (optics)]], [[transparency (graphic)]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] &amp;mdash; sharp transmission of light through solid objects
* [[translucency]] &amp;mdash; highly scattered transmission of light through solid objects
* [[refraction]] &amp;mdash; bending of light associated with transparency
* [[diffraction]] &amp;mdash; bending, spreading and interference of light passing by an object or aperture that disrupts the ray
* [[global illumination|indirect illumination]] &amp;mdash; surfaces illuminated by light reflected off other surfaces, rather than directly from a light source (also known as global illumination)
* [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] (a form of indirect illumination) &amp;mdash; reflection of light off a shiny object, or focusing of light through a transparent object, to produce bright highlights on another object
* [[depth of field]] &amp;mdash; objects appear blurry or out of focus when too far in front of or behind the object in focus
* [[motion blur]] &amp;mdash; objects appear blurry due to high-speed motion, or the motion of the camera
* [[non-photorealistic rendering]] &amp;mdash; rendering of scenes in an artistic style, intended to look like a painting or drawing

== Techniques ==
Many rendering algorithms have been researched, and software used for rendering may employ a number of different techniques to obtain a final image.

Tracing every [[photon|particle of light]] in a scene is nearly always completely impractical and would take a stupendous amount of time. Even tracing a portion large enough to produce an image takes an inordinate amount of time if the sampling is not intelligently restricted.

Therefore, four loose families of more-efficient light transport modelling techniques have emerged: [[rasterization]], including [[scanline rendering]], geometrically projects objects in the scene to an image plane, without advanced optical effects; [[ray casting]] considers the scene as observed from a specific point-of-view, calculating the observed image based only on geometry and very basic optical laws of reflection intensity, and perhaps using [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] techniques to reduce artifacts; and [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] is similar to ray casting, but employs more advanced optical simulation, and usually uses Monte Carlo techniques to obtain more realistic results at a speed that is often orders of magnitude slower. The fourth type of light transport techique, [[radiosity]] is not usually implemented as a rendering technique, but instead calculates the passage of light as it leaves the light source and illuminates surfaces. These surfaces are usually rendered to the display using one of the other three techniques.

Most advanced software combines two or more of the techniques to obtain good-enough results at reasonable cost.

Another distinction is between [[Image and object order rendering|image order]] algorithms, which iterate over pixels of the image plane, and [[Image and object order rendering|object order]] algorithms, which iterate over objects in the scene. Generally object order is more efficient, as there are usually fewer objects in a scene than pixels.

=== Scanline rendering and rasterisation ===
[[File:Latest Rendering of the E-ELT.jpg|thumb|Rendering of the [[European Extremely Large Telescope]].]]

A high-level representation of an image necessarily contains elements in a different domain from pixels.  These elements are referred to as primitives.  In a schematic drawing, for instance, line segments and curves might be primitives.  In a graphical user interface, windows and buttons might be the primitives.  In 3D rendering, triangles and polygons in space might be primitives.

If a pixel-by-pixel (image order) approach to rendering is impractical or too slow for some task, then a primitive-by-primitive (object order) approach to rendering may prove useful.  Here, one loops through each of the primitives, determines which pixels in the image it affects, and modifies those pixels accordingly.  This is called '''rasterization''', and is the rendering method used by all current [[graphics card]]s.

Rasterization is frequently faster than pixel-by-pixel rendering.  First, large areas of the image may be empty of primitives; rasterization will ignore these areas, but pixel-by-pixel rendering must pass through them.  Second, rasterization can improve [[cache coherency]] and reduce redundant work by taking advantage of the fact that the pixels occupied by a single primitive tend to be contiguous in the image.  For these reasons, rasterization is usually the approach of choice when [[interactivity|interactive]] rendering is required; however, the pixel-by-pixel approach can often produce higher-quality images and is more versatile because it does not depend on as many assumptions about the image as rasterization.

The older form of rasterization is characterized by rendering an entire face (primitive) as a single color.  Alternatively, rasterization can be done in a more complicated manner by first rendering the vertices of a face and then rendering the pixels of that face as a blending of the vertex colors.  This version of rasterization has overtaken the old method as it allows the graphics to flow without complicated textures (a rasterized image when used face by face tends to have a very block-like effect if not covered in complex textures; the faces aren't smooth because there is no gradual color change from one primitive to the next).  This newer method of rasterization utilizes the graphics card's more taxing shading functions and still achieves better performance because the simpler textures stored in memory use less space. Sometimes designers will use one rasterization method on some faces and the other method on others based on the angle at which that face meets other joined faces, thus increasing speed and not hurting the overall effect.

=== Ray casting ===
{{Main|Ray casting}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
In '''ray casting''' the geometry which has been modeled is parsed pixel by pixel, line by line, from the point of view outward, as if casting rays out from the point of view. Where an object is intersected, the color value at the point may be evaluated using several methods. In the simplest, the color value of the object at the point of intersection becomes the value of that pixel. The color may be determined from a [[texture mapping|texture-map]]. A more sophisticated method is to modify the colour value by an illumination factor, but without calculating the relationship to a simulated light source. To reduce artifacts, a number of rays in slightly different directions may be averaged.

Rough simulations of optical properties may be additionally employed: a simple calculation of the ray from the object to the point of view is made. Another calculation is made of the angle of incidence of light rays from the light source(s), and from these as well as the specified intensities of the light sources, the value of the pixel is calculated. Another simulation uses illumination plotted from a radiosity algorithm, or a combination of these two.

Raycasting is primarily used for realtime simulations, such as those used in 3D computer games and cartoon animations, where detail is not important, or where it is more efficient to manually fake the details in order to obtain better performance in the computational stage. This is usually the case when a large number of frames need to be animated. The resulting surfaces have a characteristic 'flat' appearance when no additional tricks are used, as if objects in the scene were all painted with matte finish.

=== Ray tracing ===
[[Image:SpiralSphereAndJuliaDetail1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Spiral Sphere and Julia, Detail'', a computer-generated image created by visual artist Robert W. McGregor using only [[POV-Ray]] 3.6 and its built-in scene description language.]]
{{Main|Ray tracing (graphics)}}
'''Ray tracing''' aims to simulate the natural flow of light, interpreted as particles. Often, ray tracing methods are utilized to approximate the solution to the [[rendering equation]] by applying [[Monte Carlo methods]] to it. Some of the most used methods are [[Path Tracing]], [[Bidirectional Path Tracing]], or [[Metropolis light transport]], but also semi realistic methods are in use, like [[Whitted Style Ray Tracing]], or hybrids. While most implementations let light propagate on straight lines, applications exist to simulate relativistic spacetime effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.56.830&lt;/ref&gt;

In a final, production quality rendering of a ray traced work, multiple rays are generally shot for each pixel, and traced not just to the first object of intersection, but rather, through a number of sequential 'bounces', using the known laws of optics such as &quot;angle of incidence equals angle of reflection&quot; and more advanced laws that deal with refraction and surface roughness.

Once the ray either encounters a light source, or more probably once a set limiting number of bounces has been evaluated, then the surface illumination at that final point is evaluated using techniques described above, and the changes along the way through the various bounces evaluated to estimate a value observed at the point of view. This is all repeated for each sample, for each pixel.

In [[distribution ray tracing]], at each point of intersection, multiple rays may be spawned. In [[path tracing]], however, only a single ray or none is fired at each intersection, utilizing the statistical nature of [[Monte Carlo]] experiments.

As a brute-force method, ray tracing has been too slow to consider for real-time, and until recently too slow even to consider for short films of any degree of quality, although it has been used for special effects sequences, and in advertising, where a short portion of high quality (perhaps even [[photorealism|photorealistic]]) footage is required.

However, efforts at optimizing to reduce the number of calculations needed in portions of a work where detail is not high or does not depend on ray tracing features have led to a realistic possibility of wider use of ray tracing. There is now some hardware accelerated ray tracing equipment, at least in prototype phase, and some game demos which show use of real-time software or hardware ray tracing.

== Radiosity ==
{{Main|Radiosity (3D computer graphics)}}
'''Radiosity''' is a method which attempts to simulate the way in which directly illuminated surfaces act as indirect light sources that illuminate other surfaces.  This produces more realistic shading and seems to better capture the '[[ambient light|ambience]]' of an indoor scene. A classic example is the way that shadows 'hug' the corners of rooms.

The optical basis of the simulation is that some diffused light from a given point on a given surface is reflected in a large spectrum of directions and illuminates the area around it.

The simulation technique may vary in complexity. Many renderings have a very rough estimate of radiosity, simply illuminating an entire scene very slightly with a factor known as ambiance. However, when advanced radiosity estimation is coupled with a high quality ray tracing algorithim, images may exhibit convincing realism, particularly for indoor scenes.

In advanced radiosity simulation, recursive, finite-element algorithms 'bounce' light back and forth between surfaces in the model, until some recursion limit is reached. The colouring of one surface in this way influences the colouring of a neighbouring surface, and vice versa. The resulting values of illumination throughout the model (sometimes including for empty spaces) are stored and used as additional inputs  when performing calculations in a ray-casting or ray-tracing model.

Due to the iterative/recursive nature of the technique, complex objects are particularly slow to emulate. Prior to the standardization of rapid radiosity calculation, some graphic artists used a technique referred to loosely as [[false radiosity]] by darkening areas of texture maps corresponding to corners, joints and recesses, and applying them via self-illumination or diffuse mapping for scanline rendering. Even now, advanced radiosity calculations may be reserved for calculating the ambiance of the room, from the light reflecting off walls, floor and ceiling, without examining the contribution that complex objects make to the radiosity—or complex objects may be replaced in the radiosity calculation with simpler objects of similar size and texture.

Radiosity calculations are viewpoint independent which increases the computations involved, but makes them useful for all viewpoints. If there is little rearrangement of radiosity objects in the scene, the same radiosity data may be reused for a number of frames, making radiosity an effective way to improve on the flatness of ray casting, without seriously impacting the overall rendering time-per-frame.

Because of this, radiosity is a prime component of leading real-time rendering methods, and has been used from beginning-to-end to create a large number of well-known recent feature-length animated 3D-cartoon films.

== Sampling and filtering ==
One problem that any rendering system must deal with, no matter which approach it takes, is the '''sampling problem'''.  Essentially, the rendering process tries to depict a [[continuous function]] from image space to colors by using a finite number of pixels.  As a consequence of the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]], any spatial waveform that can be displayed must consist of at least two pixels, which is proportional to [[image resolution]].  In simpler terms, this expresses the idea that an image cannot display details, peaks or troughs in color or intensity, that are smaller than one pixel.

If a naive rendering algorithm is used without any filtering, high frequencies in the image function will cause ugly [[aliasing]] to be present in the final image.  Aliasing typically manifests itself as [[jaggies]], or jagged edges on objects where the pixel grid is visible.  In order to remove aliasing, all rendering algorithms (if they are to produce good-looking images) must use some kind of [[low-pass filter]] on the image function to remove high frequencies, a process called [[antialiasing]].

== Optimization ==
=== Optimizations used by an artist when a scene is being developed ===
Due to the large number of calculations, a work in progress is usually only rendered in detail appropriate to the portion of the work being developed at a given time, so in the initial stages of modeling, wireframe and ray casting may be used, even where the target output is ray tracing with radiosity. It is also common to render only parts of the scene at high detail, and to remove objects that are not important to what is currently being developed.

=== Common optimizations for real time rendering ===
For real-time, it is appropriate to simplify one or more common approximations, and tune to the exact parameters of the scenery in question, which is also tuned to the agreed parameters to get the most 'bang for the buck'.

== Academic core ==
The implementation of a realistic renderer always has some basic element of physical simulation or emulation &amp;mdash; some computation which resembles or abstracts a real physical process.

The term &quot;''physically based''&quot; indicates the use of physical models and approximations that are more general and widely accepted outside rendering. A particular set of related techniques have gradually become established in the rendering community.

The basic concepts are moderately straightforward, but intractable to calculate; and a single elegant algorithm or approach has been elusive for more general purpose renderers. In order to meet demands of robustness, accuracy and practicality, an implementation will be a complex combination of different techniques.

Rendering research is concerned with both the adaptation of scientific models and their efficient application.

=== The rendering equation ===
{{Main|Rendering equation}}

This is the key academic/theoretical concept in rendering. It serves as the most abstract formal expression of the non-perceptual aspect of rendering. All more complete algorithms can be seen as solutions to particular formulations of this equation.

: &lt;math&gt;L_o(x, \vec w) = L_e(x, \vec w) + \int_\Omega f_r(x, \vec w', \vec w) L_i(x, \vec w') (\vec w' \cdot \vec n) d\vec w'&lt;/math&gt;
Meaning: at a particular position and direction, the outgoing light (L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) is the sum of the emitted light (L&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and the reflected light. The reflected light being the sum of the incoming light (L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) from all directions, multiplied by the surface reflection and incoming angle. By connecting outward light to inward light, via an interaction point, this equation stands for the whole 'light transport' &amp;mdash; all the movement of light — in a scene.

=== The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function ===
The '''[[Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function]]''' (BRDF) expresses a simple model of light interaction with a surface as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;f_r(x, \vec w', \vec w) = \frac{dL_r(x, \vec w)}{L_i(x, \vec w')(\vec w' \cdot \vec n) d\vec w'}&lt;/math&gt;

Light interaction is often approximated by the even simpler models: diffuse reflection and specular reflection, although both can be BRDFs.

=== Geometric optics ===
Rendering is practically exclusively concerned with the particle aspect of light physics &amp;mdash; known as [[geometric optics]]. Treating light, at its basic level, as particles bouncing around is a simplification, but appropriate: the wave aspects of light are negligible in most scenes, and are significantly more difficult to simulate. Notable wave aspect phenomena include diffraction (as seen in the colours of [[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s) and polarisation (as seen in [[Liquid crystal display|LCDs]]). Both types of effect, if needed, are made by appearance-oriented adjustment of the reflection model.

=== Visual perception ===
Though it receives less attention, an understanding of human visual perception is valuable to rendering. This is mainly because image displays and human perception have restricted ranges. A renderer can simulate an almost infinite range of light brightness and color, but current displays &amp;mdash; movie screen, computer monitor, etc. &amp;mdash; cannot handle so much, and something must be discarded or compressed. Human perception also has limits, and so does not need to be given large-range images to create realism. This can help solve the problem of fitting images into displays, and, furthermore, suggest what short-cuts could be used in the rendering simulation, since certain subtleties won't be noticeable. This related subject is [[tone mapping]].

Mathematics used in rendering includes: [[linear algebra]], [[calculus]], [[numerical analysis|numerical mathematics]], [[digital signal processing|signal processing]], and [[Monte Carlo methods]].

Rendering for movies often takes place on a network of tightly connected computers known as a [[render farm]].

The current [[state of the art]] in 3-D image description for movie creation is the [[Mental Ray]] [[scene description language]] designed at [[mental images]] and the [[RenderMan]] [[shading language]] designed at [[Pixar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1185817&amp;jmp=abstract&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&lt;/ref&gt; (compare with simpler 3D fileformats such as [[VRML]] or [[application programming interface|APIs]] such as [[OpenGL]] and [[DirectX]] tailored for 3D hardware accelerators).

Other renderers (including proprietary ones) can and are sometimes used, but most other renderers tend to miss one or more of the often needed features like good texture filtering, texture caching, programmable shaders, highend geometry types like hair, subdivision or nurbs surfaces with tesselation on demand, geometry caching, raytracing with geometry caching, high quality shadow mapping, speed or patent-free implementations.  Other highly sought features these days may include [[Interactive Photorealistic Rendering|IPR]] and hardware rendering/shading.

'''Chaosium''' is one of the longer lived publishers of [[role-playing game]]s still in existence.  Founded by [[Greg Stafford]], its first game was actually a wargame, ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'', which later mutated into ''[[Dragon Pass]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nomad Gods]]''.  ''White Bear and Red Moon'' is notable for containing the first published material about [[Glorantha]], later used as the primary setting for the role-playing games ''[[RuneQuest]]'', ''[[Hero Wars]]'' and ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]''.

== Background ==

The rules of ''RuneQuest'', Chaosium's first role-playing game, were distilled down into a generic, genre-neutral format known as ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (''BRP'').  These generic rules formed the basis of many of Chaosium's later RPGs, such as ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'', ''[[Nephilim (RPG)|Nephilim]]'', and ''[[RingworldRPG|Ringworld]]''.

Chaosium and [[Greg Stafford]] are also responsible for ''[[Pendragon RPG|Pendragon]]'', an Arthurian RPG now published by [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf, Inc.'s]] ArtHaus imprint after a spell with [[Green Knight Publishing]]. Other games of note include ''[[Mythos (role-playing game)|Mythos]]'', ''[[Elfquest]]'', ''[[Worlds of Wonder]]'', ''[[Superworld]]'', ''[[Hawkmoon]]'', ''[[Stormbringer]]'', and the frequently forgotten ''[[Prince Valiant (role-playing game)|Prince Valiant]]''.

Several notable RPG authors have written material for Chaosium, including [[Steve Perrin]], [[Sandy Petersen]], [[Lynn Willis]], [[Keith Herber]], [[David Conyers]], [[Ken St. Andre]], and [[Arduin]] creator [[David A. Hargrave]].

== Magazines ==

Three [[magazine]]s, all of them defunct, had been published by Chaosium to promote its products:

* ''[[Wyrm's Footnotes]]'' ran for fourteen issues from 1976 to 1995. Initially it was a supporting material publication for ''White Bear and Red Moon'' but for its 11th issue, in 1981, it had become the official ''RuneQuest'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erzo.org/shannon/gaming/indices/glorantha-index.shtml#wyrms ''Wyrm's Footnotes'' review, by Shannon Appelcline]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Different Worlds]]''. Forty-seven bimonthly issues from ''Different Worlds'' were published. Chaosium, from 1979 to 1985, published the thirty-eight first ones and [[Sleuth Publications]], from 1985 to 1987, the nine last ones. In spite of being an old Chaosium's and Stafford's collaborator, [[Tadashi Ehara]] was the editor of the magazine during the periods concerned by both publishing houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.rpg.net/display-search.phtml?key=magazine&amp;value=Different+Worlds&amp;type=pictures Main ''Different Worlds'' issues, every one of them listed and linked to its own description page]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Starry Wisdom]]'', a [[H.P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]] themed magazine, three issues of which Chaosium published in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chaosium.com/chaosium/starry-wisdom/index.shtml ''Starry Wisdom'' description page in Chaosium's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==

Some Chaosium products have been translated into [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], and were available in [[France]] from [[Jeux Descartes]], in [[Germany]] from [[Pegasus Press]], in [[Spain]] from [[Joc Internacional]] and [[La factoría de ideas]] and in [[Italy]] from ''Stratelibri'' and ''Grifo Edizioni''.

In the mid-1980s, Chaosium entered into a complex arrangement with [[Avalon Hill]] to publish ''RuneQuest'' material while Chaosium maintained editorial control over Glorantha-based material for the game (which Avalon Hill would publish).  While this agreement reportedly kept the company in existence, it also left ''RuneQuest'' moribund, leading to products of questionable quality, long gaps with no products published at all, and, eventually, the death of the game altogether.

== Failed ventures/new directions ==

In response to the [[collectible card game]] craze, Chaosium released the ''[[Mythos (card game)|Mythos]]'' CCG. Initially it was a great success, but the crash hit hard. 

In the late 1990s, Chaosium effectively split up into various successor companies, each maintaining its focus on a few of the company's products. [[Green Knight Publishing]] formed to focus on ''Pendragon'', Chaosium &quot;proper&quot; retained ''Call of Cthulhu'', ''Stormbringer'', and ''Mythos'', while Greg Stafford founded [[Issaries, Inc.]] to publish ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'' and focus on bringing new ''[[Glorantha]]'' related material into print. Also, [[Wizard's Attic]] (no longer in business) was formed in order to act as a [[fulfillment house]]. [[Charlie Krank]] became president when Stafford left.

Traditionally, the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Ciconiiformes''' has included a variety of large, long-legged wading birds with large bills: [[stork]]s, [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s, and several others. Ciconiiformes are known from the Late [[Eocene]]. At present the only family retained in the order is the storks, [[Ciconiidae]].

== Taxonomic issues with Ciconiiformes ==

Following the development of research techniques in [[molecular biology]] in the late 20th century, in particular methods for studying [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]], a great deal of new information has surfaced, much of it suggesting that many birds, although looking very different from one another, are in fact more closely related than was previously thought. Accordingly, the radical and influential [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]] greatly enlarged the Ciconiiformes, adding many more families, including most of those usually regarded as belonging to the Sphenisciformes ([[penguin]]s), Gaviiformes ([[diver (bird)|diver]]s), Podicipediformes ([[grebe]]s), Procellariiformes ([[tubenose|tubenosed seabirds]]), [[Charadriiformes]], ([[wader]]s, [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s and [[auk]]s), [[Pelecaniformes]] ([[pelican]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[gannet]]s and allies), and the [[Falconiformes]] ([[bird of prey|diurnal birds of prey]]). The [[flamingo]] family, Phoenicopteridae, is related, and is sometimes classed as part of the Ciconiiformes.

However, morphological evidence suggests that the traditional Ciconiiformes should be split between two lineages, rather than expanded, although some non-traditional Ciconiiformes may be included in these two lineages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The exact [[taxonomic]] placement of [[New World Vulture]]s remains unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;SACC&quot;/&gt; Though both are similar in appearance and have similar [[Ecological niche|ecological roles]], the New World and [[Old World Vultures]] evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures belong in Ciconiiformes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SibleyMonroe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Charles | title = Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1990 | isbn = 0300049692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order [[Falconiformes]] along with the Old World Vultures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Charles | title = Phylogeny and Classification of Birds | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1990 | isbn = 0300040857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South American Classification Committee]] has removed the New World Vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in ''[[Incertae sedis]]'', but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;SACC&quot;&gt;Remsen, J. V., Jr.; C. D. Cadena; A. Jaramillo; M. Nores; J. F. Pacheco; M. B. Robbins; T. S. Schulenberg; F. G. Stiles; D. F. Stotz &amp; K. J. Zimmer. 2007. [http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.html  ''A classification of the bird species of South America.''] South American Classification Committee. Retrieved on 2007-10-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Some official bodies have adopted the proposed Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy almost entirely, however a more common approach worldwide has been to retain the traditional groupings, and modify rather than replace them in the light of new evidence as it comes to hand. The family listing here follows this more conservative practice. Bird taxonomy has been in a state of flux for some years, and it is reasonable to expect that the large differences between different classification schemes will continue to gradually resolve themselves as more evidence becomes available.

The '''Carolina Panthers''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. They are currently members of the [[NFC South|South Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Panthers, along with the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], joined the NFL as [[expansion team]]s in [[1995 NFL Season|1995]]. In their [[History of the Carolina Panthers|existence]], the Panthers have compiled a record of 125–141, and appeared in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

==Franchise history==
{{details|History of the Carolina Panthers}}

===Origins (1987–1994)===
In 1987, shortly after it was decided that Charlotte would receive an expansion [[National Basketball Association]] franchise (the Charlotte Hornets, now known as the [[New Orleans Hornets]]), former [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] player [[Jerry Richardson]] met with a group of potential backers to discuss the possibility of bringing an NFL expansion team to the Carolina region. 

In 1992, the NFL released the list of five areas open to a potential NFL team: [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; and the Carolinas, represented by [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. After the vote was delayed because of a dispute between the players and the league, the race began again in 1993. In June of that year, Richardson Sports announced that they would finance the stadium through the sale of [[Permanent Seat Licenses]], club seats, and luxury boxes. In a stunning show of fan support, all seats were sold out by the end of the first day.

On October 26, 1993, the league announced that the owners had unanimously voted for the Carolinas to receive the 29th franchise, the first new NFL team since 1976 (Jacksonville was named the 30th team a month later). Fans all over the region celebrated with fireworks. In a memorable moment during the expansion announcement conference, Richardson spoke directly into the camera to thank the 40,000 people who had purchased the PSLs and allowing the stadium to be built without a burden to the taxpayers.

===Dom Capers era (1995–1998)===
The Panthers signed [[Dom Capers]], former defensive coordinator for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], as their inaugural head coach.  In [[1995 Carolina Panthers season|their inaugural season]], he led the Panthers to a 7–9 record, setting a record for the most victories by an expansion team.  The [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|following season]], Capers led the team to a record of 12–4 and a division title; they advanced to the Conference Championship, but fell to the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] 30–13, who went on to win the Super Bowl.  After the Panthers success in 1996, Capers led the Panthers through two disappointing seasons: a 7–9 season in [[1997 Carolina Panthers season|1997]], and a 4–12 season in [[1998 Carolina Panthers season|1998]]; this resulted in Capers being fired after four seasons with the team.  During his career with the Panthers, Capers finished with an overall record of 31–35 (including the playoffs) and one division title.

===George Seifert era (1999–2001)===
After Dom Capers was let go following the previous season, [[George Seifert]] was hired as the second head coach in Panthers history.  In [[1999 Carolina Panthers season|his first season with the team]], Seifert helped the Panthers improve four games to finish the season with a record of 8–8.  He then led the team to a 7–9 record [[2000 Carolina Panthers season|the following year]], before leading the Panthers to their worst record in franchise history.  In [[2001 Carolina Panthers season|2001]], the Panthers won their season opener 24–13 over the Vikings, but set an NFL record by losing 15 consecutive games to finish the season 1–15.  Seifert was fired shortly after the season ended, finishing with an overall record of 16–32 as head coach of the Panthers.

===John Fox era (2002–2010)===
After Seifert was fired following the disastrous 2001 season, the Panthers hired [[New York Giants]] defensive coordinator [[John Fox (NFL)|John Fox]] as the team's third head coach. Fox was known for defensive discipline and it would be needed to improve a team that had finished in the bottom of the defensive rankings the previous year.

In [[2002 Carolina Panthers season|2002]], Fox's defense-first philosophy worked well as the Panthers improved to 7–9 (a six-game improvement over the previous year) and posted the second-best overall defense in the league after having the second-worst the previous season.  In the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Panthers were losing 17–0.  [[Jake Delhomme]] replaced [[Rodney Peete]] at quarterback by halftime, then led the Panthers to a fourth quarter comeback, thus winning the starting job. Delhomme eventually led the team to an 11–5 record, the NFC South Division title and a playoff berth.

In the playoffs, they easily defeated the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] in the wild-card round before facing the [[St. Louis Rams]] in the divisional round. Carolina had an 11-point lead in the last 3 minutes of play, but a the Rams tied the game and sent it to [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]].  In the first play of the 2nd overtime, Jake Delhomme hit Wide receiver [[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] with a 69-yard touchdown pass to win the game 29–23.  In the NFC Championship game, the Panthers faced off against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  The Panthers shut down the Eagles offense and, with a victory, headed to their first Super Bowl against the [[New England Patriots]].  The multiple close games, won either in overtime or with a slim margin, gave way to a new nickname for the Panthers: the &quot;[[Cardiac Cats]].&quot; In the end the Panthers fell 32–29 to the Patriots in the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]

In [[2004 Carolina Panthers season|2004]], the Panthers suffered major injuries early on, and the Panthers finished the season 7–9.  In [[2005 Carolina Panthers season|2005]], however, the Panthers finished 11–5, securing themselves the NFC's #5 seed.  They began their post-season play by shutting out the Giants 23–0.  They then defeated the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] 29–21 in the Divisional playoffs, before falling to the [[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]] in the NFC Championship, losing 34–14.

After finishing the [[2006 Carolina Panthers season|2006]] and [[2007 Carolina Panthers season|2007]] seasons with records of 8–8 and 7–9, respectively, the Panthers rebounded in the [[2008 Carolina Panthers season|2008 season]], finishing the season with a 12–4 record, claiming the [[NFC South]] title and a first round bye in the playoffs. However, on the Panthers' season came to a disappointing end, as they lost to the [[Arizona Cardinals]] 33–13 at Bank of America Stadium in the NFC Divisional playoff game. The Panthers' offense was plagued by Quarterback Jake Delhomme's six turnovers (five interceptions and a fumble).

In [[2009 Carolina Panthers season|2009]], the Panthers finished with an 8–8 record, before finishing [[2010 Carolina Panthers season|2010]] with a disappointing record of 2–14; following the 2010 season, Jerry Richardson decided not to re-sign John Fox, whose contract had expired.  After nine seasons with the Panthers, Fox finished with a record of 78–74 (including the playoffs), two division titles, and one Conference Championship.

===Ron Rivera era (2011–present)===
After a disappointing 2010 season, John Fox's contract was not renewed and most of his coaching staff were let go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/31/sports/la-sp-nfl-report-20110101 &quot;Carolina Panthers fire Coach John Fox&quot;], LA Times. December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the Panthers hired [[Ron Rivera]] as the fourth head coach in Panther history. Rivera was previously the defensive coordinator for the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[San Diego Chargers]] before being hired by the Panthers. Fans and commentators have playfully dubbed this the 'Rivera Era.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2011/03/06/2114495/start-of-rivera-era-could-get.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Carolina Panthers selected quarterback [[Cam Newton]] with their first pick in the 2011 NFL Draft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansas-city-news.pro/2011/04/carolina-panthers-select-cam-newton-1st.html Official NFL 2011 Draft News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos and uniforms==
The Panthers logo consists of the head of a black snarling [[Black panther|panther]] outlined in blue. It is shaped to resemble the combined borders of North and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/carolina/panthers.html Carolina Panthers (1995-Present)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The helmets are silver, and in 2003, they changed the helmet color slightly to a more metallic shade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misterhabs.com/helmets.htm Helmets, Helmets, Helmets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The team normally wears silver pants with their black jerseys, and white pants with their white jerseys. Both the black and the white jerseys have blue stripes over the shoulders. The team introduced an alternate jersey in 2002 that is blue with black shoulder stripes. Carolina debuted the alternate light blue jersey for one game at home against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002. The alternate jersey has been worn twice a season beginning in 2003. The Panthers have worn the light blue jersey a few times on the road when the home team has chosen to wear white due to the heat, as the light blue uniforms are more comfortable in the heat than black. Carolina prefers to not wear black when the temperature is hot or not mild enough. With the league rules permitting teams to wear their third jersey twice in the regular season and once in the preseason, the Panthers reserve the use of their alternate light blue jersey for a home game when there is one or two games that they don't wear them on the road.

Like many other NFL teams located in [[temperate climate]]s, the Panthers traditionally wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season &amp;mdash; forcing opponents to wear their dark ones under the warm [[autumn]]s in Charlotte. When it gets to the second half of the season the Panthers will start to wear their colored jerseys for home games as temperatures will be more mild.

The team's uniforms prompted a 2003 lawsuit by the [[Oakland Raiders]], who claimed that the NFL and the Panthers had infringed upon key [[trademark]] elements of the Raiders' brand, specifically the silver and black colors. In the same suit, the Raiders challenged the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 1997 uniform design, including the pirate logo. The Raiders wanted the courts to bar the Buccaneers and Panthers from wearing their uniforms while playing in California. However, since the lawsuit was filed in a state California court, the lawsuit was tossed out because only federal courts have jurisdiction over [[intellectual property]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/22/Sports/Bucs_free_to_use_pira.shtml Sports: Bucs free to use pirate logo after Raiders suit is tossed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Raiders have yet to appeal the ruling.

The Panthers have played in ten postseason games, wearing the white jerseys in all but their most recent playoff game. Two of those games were at home against the Dallas Cowboys, making the Cowboys wear their &quot;unlucky&quot; road navy-blue jerseys, as the Cowboys are one of three teams who routinely wear their white uniforms at home.

==Rivals==
===Atlanta Falcons===
{{Main|I-85 Rivalry}}
The rivalry with Atlanta began in the first season of the franchise when both teams were members of the NFC West. Carolina played Atlanta in its first ever game, losing 23-20 in overtime. From 1998 to 2002, Atlanta dominated the series, winning 9 out of 10 games, including 6 straight from 2000 to 2002. As both teams are located on [[I-85]], travel is relatively easy between home and away games. Atlanta currently leads the series 20-12.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Although Carolina first played Tampa Bay in 1995, their rivalry did not start until 2003, when [[Brentson Buckner]] claimed [[Kris Jenkins]] was the best defensive tackle in football, angering Tampa Bay defensive tackle [[Warren Sapp]]. Since then, the rivalry is known for its [[trash talking]] and occasional fights. Notably, Carolina defensive lineman [[Kavika Pittman]] essentially had his career ended after getting leveled by a block from the Bucs' [[Kenyatta Walker]],. Also, in 2006, Tampa quarterback [[Chris Simms]] lost his spleen on a hit, and in 2009 Carolina cornerback [[Dante Wesley]] laid into punt returner [[Clifton Smith (running back)|Clifton Smith]] before he had caught the ball, knocking Smith out and getting Wesley ejected. There were some disputes also between Bucs former kicker [[Martin Gramatica]] and Panthers former punter [[Todd Sauerbrun]]. Carolina currently leads the series 12-9, with the Bucs having won the last two meetings.

===New Orleans Saints===
Carolina also maintains a rivalry with New Orleans, with both teams playing in the [[NFC South]] division. Carolina currently leads the series 17-15. Former Panthers quarterback [[Jake Delhomme]] was a backup in New Orleans before signing with Carolina in 2003.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Outside the division, the Panthers biggest rivals are the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. In both 1996 and 2003, the Panthers were responsible for eliminating the Cowboys in the playoffs. In a key game late in the 2005 season, Steve Smith was ejected for touching an official. Late in the game, a blocked field-goal was reversed by a suspicious penalty {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and Dallas scored the winning touchdown two plays later. This late-season loss kept Carolina from winning the division and forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild card team. Dallas leads the series 8-3, with Carolina being  2-0 in the playoffs but only 1-8 in regular-season games against the [[Dallas Cowboys]].

===Arizona Cardinals===
A recent rivalry has developed between the Panthers and [[Arizona Cardinals]]. During the 2008 regular season, the Cardinals traveled to play the Panthers and took a 17-3 lead at halftime, but the Panthers rallied in the 3rd and 4th quarters to win. Following the regular season, in which the 12-4 Panthers won their third NFC South division title, they hosted the Cardinals at [[Bank of America Stadium]] in the Panthers first home playoff game since January of 2004. Though the Panthers were heavy favorites, the Cardinals won 33-13, intercepting Panthers quarterback [[Jake Delhomme]] five times. The following season, the Panthers traveled to face the Cardinals and won 34-21 in a game in which the Panthers defense intercepted the Cardinals' [[Kurt Warner]] five times as well. The Panthers and Cardinals have played each other every season since 2001 with the lone exception of the 2006 season and are scheduled to play again during the 2011 regular season.

==Former Rivalries==
Carolina had several rivalries within the [[NFC West]] from 1995 to 2001, before Carolina moved to the [[NFC South]] in 2002. Due to current scheduling, Carolina has infrequently played many of their former division rivals, and the rivalries have thus dulled.

===St. Louis Rams===
Carolina had a rivalry with [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]] during their time in the [[NFC West]], but since moving to the NFC South in 2002 the rivalry has faded. It is most known perhaps, for the 2003 Divisional Playoff matchup between the two teams, which Carolina won 29-23 in double overtime. Carolina leads the series 11-8, with a 1-0 lead in the playoffs.

===San Francisco 49ers===
Carolina was a rival of San Francisco when they were in the [[NFC West]] together.  Former San Francisco coach George Seifert also coached the team from 1999-2001.  They no longer maintain a rivalry, as Carolina was moved to the NFC South in 2002, and the two have played rarely since then. Carolina currently leads the series 10-7.

==Franchise traditions==
===Fight song===
When the Panthers started in 1995, fans would sing the official Carolina Panther Fight Song &quot;Stand and Cheer&quot; (composed by Duane Evans) every time the team would score. As the first season was played at [[Clemson University]], many fans felt that the song was reminiscent of the collegiate atmosphere those games had.

The fight song only lasted a few years before being officially retired. Officials with the Panthers organization said that they received a large number of fan complaints regarding the fight song. The fight song was revived, although in an abbreviated version, during the first preseason game of 2006. It was used throughout the remainder of the season. Currently, &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; by Neil Diamond is played and sung by fans after every home victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panthers.com/Multimedia Panthers.com - Multimedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growl Towel===
'''Growl Towel''' (called the &quot;Prowl Towel&quot; from 1996–1997) is the nickname adopted by fans that refers to small, terry-cloth towels that are waved or spun in the air during Panthers home games. The towels are similar to the Pittsburgh Steelers' [[Terrible Towel]], but are in Panthers team colors (also white in more recent years).&lt;ref&gt;http://shop.panthers.com/officialgrowltowel.aspx Carolina Panthers Official Growl Towl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and television==
The Panthers' flagship radio stations are [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] in Charlotte and [[WBT-FM]] in [[Chester, South Carolina|Chester, S.C.]] The announcing team consists of [[Mick Mixon]], [[Eugene Robinson]] and Jim Szoke. Most preseason and regular season games are locally broadcast by Charlotte's Fox affiliate, [[WCCB]] channel 18. The exceptions are when one of their preseason games gets nationally televised on a network other than Fox, in the regular season when they host an AFC team in the afternoon (in which case the game would be on [[WBTV]], the CBS affiliate), or when one of their regular season games is in primetime.

The '''Chicago Bears''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. They are members of the [[NFC North|North Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team is legally and corporately registered as '''Chicago Bears Football Club, Incorporated'''. 

The Bears have won nine (9) [[National Football League championships history|NFL Championships]] (eight [[AFL–NFL merger|pre-merger]], and one [[Super Bowl XX|Super Bowl]]). The Bears hold the NFL records for the most enshrinees in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], with 27 members, and the most [[Squad_number#Retired_numbers|retired jersey]] numbers (13). The Bears have also recorded more regular season and overall victories than any other NFL franchise. The franchise recorded its 700th win on November 18, 2010.&lt;ref name=CBFE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/ |title=Chicago Bears Franchise Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/ |title=Green Bay Packers Franchise Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/stats/win-loss_records.jsp|title=All-Time Win-Loss Records By Team |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |last= |first= |coauthors= |year=2008 |work= |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was founded in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]], [[Illinois]], in 1919,&lt;ref name=Halas&gt;Halas By Halas, by George Halas, Gwen Morgan &amp; Arthur Veysey, McGraw Hill, 1979, p.53-54&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to Chicago in 1921. Along with the [[Arizona Cardinals]] (originally from Chicago), it is one of only two remaining franchises from the NFL's founding. The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago's North Side through the 1970 season. With the exception of the 2002 season, they have played their home games at Chicago's [[Soldier Field]] every year since 1971. The stadium is located next to [[Lake Michigan]], and was recently remodeled in a modernization intended to update stadium amenities while preserving a historic Chicago structure. The team has a storied, [[Bears–Packers rivalry|long-standing rivalry]] with the [[Green Bay Packers]], whom they have played 182 times. The Bears currently hold the edge in head-to-head matchups with a record of 92–84–6.  The two teams have met each other twice in the postseason.  The Bears won in 1941 and the Packers won in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/#headtohead |title=Chicago Bears Team Encyclopedia |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team headquarters, [[Halas Hall]], is in the Chicago suburb of [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Illinois]]. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities there during the season. They hold their annual training camp from late July to mid-August at [[Ward Field (Bourbonnais)|Ward Field]] on the campus of [[Olivet Nazarene University]] in [[Bourbonnais, Illinois|Bourbonnais]], [[Illinois]].

===1920–1970===
Originally named the '''Decatur Staleys''', the club was established by the [[A. E. Staley]] food starch company of [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]], [[Illinois]] in 1919 as a company team. This was the typical start for several early professional football franchises. The company hired [[George Halas]] and [[Edward Sternaman|Edward &quot;Dutch&quot; Sternaman]] in 1920 to run the team, and turned over full control of the team to them in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Decatur Staleys | work = Local Website | url = http://home.comcast.net/~esterneman/sternaman/football.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2006 }} Information on Dutch Sternaman&lt;/ref&gt; However, official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = George Halas: Hall of Fame Member | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=85 | accessdate = May 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team relocated to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the '''Chicago Staleys'''. Under an agreement reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, Halas purchased the rights to the club from Staley for [[United States dollar|$]]100, whereupon they were renamed the Chicago Bears.

The Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rivalry from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4–4–2 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.

The Bears' rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921. In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bears-Packers: Love-Hate Relationship | work = Packers.com | url = http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ | accessdate = September 28, 2000 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears. The team moved into Wrigley Field, which was home to the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[baseball]] franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city's baseball team (some directly, some indirectly – like the Bears, whose young are called &quot;cubs&quot;). Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is a [[navy blue]], and the orange is [[Pantone]] 1665, similar to burnt orange).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[File:1924bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in {{nfly|1921}} and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the [[Cleveland Bulldogs]] on December 7, even putting the title &quot;World's Champions&quot; on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =1924: THE THIRD TIME IS CHARMED |work = PFRA
  | publisher =  | date =  | url =http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b | accessdate = February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their only losing season came in {{nfly|1929}}.

During the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player [[Red Grange]] within a day of his final game as a collegian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Galloping Ghost scared opponents | work = ESPN.com | url = http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html | accessdate = December 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the financial losses of the {{nfly|1932}} Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932 &quot;Unofficial&quot; NFL Championship]], the Bears defeated the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] in the first indoor American football game at [[Chicago Stadium]].

The success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the very first [[History of NFL Championships|NFL Championship]], the Bears played against the [[New York Giants]], defeating them 23–21. The teams met again in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1934|1934 NFL Championship]] where the [[1933 New York Giants season|Giants]], wearing sneakers&lt;ref&gt;See [[NFL Championship Game, 1934]] for more information on how the Giants wore sneakers and defeated the Bears&lt;/ref&gt; defeated the Bears 30–13 on a cold, icy day at the [[Polo Grounds]].

[[Image:1946Bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1946 NFL Championship team photo]]From 1940–1947, [[quarterback]] [[Sid Luckman]] led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the [[University of Chicago]]'s discarded nickname &quot;[[Monsters of the Midway]]&quot; and their now-famous helmet &quot;C&quot;, as well as a newly penned [[Bear Down, Chicago Bears|theme song]] that declared them &quot;The Pride and Joy of Illinois&quot;. One famous victory during that period was their 73–0 victory over the favored [[1939 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] at [[Griffith Stadium]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1940|1940 NFL Championship Game]]; the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = General History — Chronology (1940 to 1959) | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/chronology/1940-1959.jsp |accessdate = January 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The [[T-formation]], as Halas named it, involved two [[running back]]s instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman's success at the quarterback position for the Bears has not been matched, as he still holds club records for passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sid Luckman  | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=135| accessdate = July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in {{nfly|1963}} to capture their eighth NFL Championship, which would be their last until 1985. The late 1960s and early 1970s produced notable players like [[Dick Butkus]], [[Gale Sayers]], and [[Brian Piccolo]],&lt;ref&gt;the subject of the film ''[[Brian's Song]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who died of [[embryonal carcinoma]] in 1970. The American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled ''[[Brian's Song]]'', starring [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; [[Jack Warden]] won an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television.

Halas retired as coach in [[1967 Chicago Bears season|1967]] and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 [[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] between the NFL and the [[American Football League]], the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the [[National Football Conference]], a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the NFC Championship trophy as the [[NFC Championship|George Halas Memorial Trophy]].

===1970–2003===
After the merger, the Bears finished the [[1970 Chicago Bears season|1970 season]] last place in their division, a repeat of their placing in the [[1969 Chicago Bears season|1969 season]]. In [[1975 Chicago Bears season|1975]], the Bears [[1975 NFL Draft|drafted]] [[Walter Payton]] from [[Jackson State University]] with their first pick. He won the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] in the [[1977 NFL season|1977–78 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Walter Payton's Statistics | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=174 | accessdate = June 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Remembering Walter Payton | work = Daily Herald | url = http://www.dailyherald.com/special/payton/timeline.htm|accessdate = June 11, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060813132908/http://www.dailyherald.com/special/payton/timeline.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payton would go on to eclipse [[Jim Brown]]'s NFL career [[rush (American football)|rushing]] record in 1984 before retiring in 1987, and would hold the mark until {{nfly|2002}}, when [[Emmitt Smith]] of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] surpassed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Smith passes Payton as NFL's career rushing leader  | work = Sports Illustrated | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/10/27/smith_record_ap/| accessdate = June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Payton's career and personality would capture the hearts of Bear fans, who called him &quot;Sweetness&quot;. He died from a rare form of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.

On November 1, 1983, a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team. Her husband, Ed McCaskey, succeeded her father as the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ed McCaskey | work = Cook County Clerk| url =  http://www.cookctyclerk.com/html/041503resdoc.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060901175938/http://www.cookctyclerk.com/html/041503resdoc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Michael became the third president in team history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mike McCaskey | work = ChicagoBears Official Website| url = http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/history_80s.asp | accessdate = December 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. McCaskey holds the honorary title of &quot;secretary of the board of directors&quot;, but the 82-year–old [[matriarch]] has been called the glue that holds the franchise together.&lt;ref name = &quot;luvhsr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = McCaskey | work = Cranes Chicago Business| url = http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/mag/article.pl?article_id=24665 | accessdate = July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. McCaskey's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, [[George Halas, Jr.|George &quot;Mugs&quot; Halas, Jr.]] as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a massive heart attack in 1979. Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her &quot;The First Lady of Sports&quot;, and the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' has listed her as one of Chicago's most powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chicago's Most Powerful Women | work = Chicago Sun-Times| url = http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/powerful_women/sports_mccaskey.html | accessdate = April 16, 2004 }} {{Dead link|date=May 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Ditka]], a [[tight end]] for the Bears from [[1961 Chicago Bears season|1961]] to [[1966 Chicago Bears season|1966]], was hired to coach the team by George Halas in [[1982 Chicago Bears season|1982]]. In the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]] season the fire in the Bears–Packers rivalry was relit when Ditka used 350–plus pound [[Offensive line|lineman]] [[William Perry (football)|&quot;Refrigerator&quot; Perry]] as a truly [[wide receiver|&quot;wide&quot; receiver]] in a [[touchdown]] play at [[Lambeau Field]], flagrantly taunting the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary [[46 defense]] and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song &quot;[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]&quot;. The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the &quot;unlucky 13th&quot; game of the season, a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] affair in which they were defeated by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. At the time, much was made of the fact that the {{nfly|1972}} [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] were the only franchise in history to have had an [[perfect season|undefeated season and post-season]]. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC title game]]. &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot; was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in [[LandShark Stadium|Miami]].

After the 1985 Championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the [[Super Bowl]] under [[Mike Ditka]]. Since the firing of Ditka at the end of the 1992 season, the Bears have made the playoffs five times under three different head coaches: [[Dave Wannstedt]] from 1993 through 1998, [[Dick Jauron]] from 1999 through 2003, and current head coach, [[Lovie Smith]]. Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, [[Dave McGinnis]] (Arizona's defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dave McGinnis | work = Bears History | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/seasons/1999chicagobears.aspx |accessdate = December 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Jauron's hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with [[Ted Phillips]] and promoting Michael to [[chairman of the board]]. McCaskey's reign as president has been viewed as a &quot;disaster&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Michael McCaskey | work = Cranes Chicago Business| url = http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/mag/article.pl?article_id=24665 | accessdate = July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips, the current Bears president, became the first man outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ted Phillips | work = Chicago Bears.com | url = http://www.chicagobears.com/team/frontofficeBio.jsp?id=29 |accessdate = July 12, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060626100503/http://www.chicagobears.com/team/frontofficeBio.jsp?id=29 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–present: Lovie Smith era===
[[Image:Packvbears.jpg|thumb|[[Lovie Smith]] accomplished his first objective as the team's head coach by sweeping the Green Bay Packers during the [[2005 Chicago Bears season|2005 season]].]]
[[Lovie Smith]], hired on January 15, 2004, is the third and current (as of 2010) post-Ditka head coach. Joining the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful [[Tampa 2]] defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the Bears, the team rehired their former offensive coordinator and then [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Illinois]] head coach [[Ron Turner (football coach)|Ron Turner]] to improve the Bears' struggling offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Chicago Bears  | work = Vividseats.com | url = http://www.vividseats.com/nfl/chicago-bears-tickets.html |accessdate = October 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{nfly|2005}}, the Bears won their division and reached the [[NFL playoffs, 2005-06|playoffs]] for the first time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning the NFC Central in {{nfly|2001}}. The Bears improved upon their success the following season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during Week 13 of the {{nfly|2006}} season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and earning a trip to [[Super Bowl XLI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GameCenter: Recap — Superbowl.com | work=Superbowl.com | url=http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20070121_NO@CHI | accessdate = January 21, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070125134400/http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20070121_NO@CHI &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they fell short of the championship, losing 29–17 to the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. Following the 2006 season, the club decided to give Lovie Smith a contract extension through 2011, at roughly $5 million per year. This comes a season after being the lowest paid head coach in the National Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2783609 |title=ESPN – Bears coach Smith, GM Angelo ink contract extensions – NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has played in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in {{nfly|1920}}. Through the 2010 season, they led the NFL in overall franchise wins with 704 and had an overall record of 704–512–42 (going 687–494–42 during the regular season and 17–18 in the playoffs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = All-Time Chicago Bears Record | work = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=6 | accessdate = June 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 18, 2010 the Bears recorded franchise win number 700 in a win against the [[Miami Dolphins]].

On April 2, 2009, the Bears made one of the biggest trades in franchise history, acquiring [[Pro Bowl]] quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] and a 5th round selection in the [[2009 NFL Draft]] from the [[Denver Broncos]] in exchange for quarterback [[Kyle Orton]], the Bears' 1st and 3rd round selections in the [[2009 NFL Draft]] and the Bears' 1st round selection in the [[2010 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mike | last=Mulligan | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Bears get Cutler for two first-round picks, Orton | date=April 3, 2009 Many didn't know if this was the right way to go for the bears.

With a 38–34 win against the [[New York Jets]], the Bears clinched the No. 2 seed and a first-round [[Bye (sports)|bye]] for the [[2010–11 NFL playoffs]].  They reached the NFC Championship Game following the defeat of the [[Seattle Seahawks]], where they played [[Green Bay Packers]] at [[Soldier Field]] – only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals, the only other game played in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bears defeat Seahawks to set up NFC Title showdown  | work = chicagobears.com | url = http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=7496 |accessdate = January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bears lost the game, 21–14.

Rob Rang of CBS Sports predicted that the team would pick consensus All American [[left tackle]] [[Gabe Carimi]], winner of the 2010 [[Outland Trophy]] as the nation's top collegiate interior lineman, with its No. 29 pick in the first round of the April [[2011 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/mock]&lt;/ref&gt; After a botched attempt at trading down to the 26th spot, the Bears ended up proving Rang's prediction correct by selecting Carimi.

The NFL is investigating the failed transaction between the Bears and Ravens, and Chicago GM Jerry Angelo has taken full responsibility for the gaffe.

==Logos, uniforms, and mascots==
{{Main|Chicago Bears logos, uniforms, and mascots}}

===Logo===
[[Image:ChicagoBears1962.png|thumb|One of the original logos (1962–1973)]]The club's first logo was introduced in the early 1950s as a black bear on top of a football. They kept this until 1962, when the Bears trademark 'C' logo was first introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the Chicago Bears Logo | work = Chicago Bears | url = http://www.chicagobears.com/history/uniform.jsp | accessdate = August 1, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050520013751/http://www.chicagobears.com/history/uniform.jsp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in their logo from the black bear was due to the addition of logos on [[football helmet|helmets]], which pro football teams started adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Unlike some NFL franchises that have had many different looks over time, the Bears have kept the wishbone 'C' for over 40 years.

In [[1974 Chicago Bears season|1974]], the team decided to keep the same white 'C' logo but to change the color of it from white to orange with a white trim. This is the current logo; however, the club has since introduced alternative logos, including a black bear inside of the orange wishbone 'C', introduced in 1995, and an orange bear head, introduced in 1999.

===Uniforms===

In 1920 the team introduced uniforms containing brown and blue stripes. In the 1930s, the franchise's uniform underwent substantial alterations. By 1933 the Bears donned all-orange jerseys with navy numbers and matching black helmets. In 1936, they modified this design into &quot;an early version of [[psychedelic art|psychedelia]]&quot; by adding three orange stripes to their helmets, changing the color of the jerseys from orange to white, complementing the new white jerseys with fourteen navy and orange alternating stripes on the sleeves, and introducing socks with a similar striped pattern extending from ankle to knee. Because of poor response from the fans and the media, this design lasted only one season.&lt;ref name=&quot;chibearsunihist&quot;/&gt;

[[File:NFCN-Uniform-jersey pants combination-CHI.png|thumb|left|300px|Chicago Bears uniform combinations]]
By [[1949 Chicago Bears season|1949]], the team was wearing the familiar navy blue shirts with white, rounded numbers. In [[1956 Chicago Bears season|1956]], the team added &quot;TV numbers&quot; to the sleeves. The Bears 'C' logo first appeared on the helmets in [[1962 Chicago Bears season|1962]]. The logo changed from white to a white-bordered orange logo 11 years later, and has remained unchanged ever since. The Bears added the initials ''GSH'' to the left sleeve of their jerseys in [[1984 Chicago Bears season|1984]] in memory of [[George Halas]].
[[Image:NFCN-Throwback-Uniform-CHI.PNG|thumb|Chicago Bears uniform: 1962–1972]]
For decades, the team was known as the only NFL team to wear jersey numbers that were not the traditional block-style numbers (though during the 1971 season, the Bears road jerseys used the block-style numbers). Although a handful of other NFL teams and the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] during their early [[American Football League|AFL]] days experimented with rounder jersey numbers, by the mid-1960s the Bears were the only team left to continue wearing rounded jersey numbers. Since the mid-1990s, however, several teams have shifted away from the block numbers in favor of numbers that match a specific team font (e.g. [[Denver Broncos]], [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], etc.) or in the case of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], match the jersey number font with the helmet numbers while otherwise leaving the jersey design alone.

Other variations to the Bears uniforms over the years include the addition of navy blue pants as a part of the road kit in 1984. During the [[1994 Chicago Bears season|1994 season]], the Bears – with most of the other NFL franchises – introduced [[throwback uniform]]s to be worn in the honor of the NFL's 75th anniversary. These uniforms with brown and blue stripes resemble the original Bears uniforms worn in the 1920s. On October 7, 2002 the Bears wore navy blue pants with their navy blue home jerseys for the first time, and lost at home to Green Bay before a national ''Monday Night Football'' audience. The Bears did not wear the all-blue combination again until the 2006 regular season finale against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], also a loss, on December 31.

[[Image:NFLClock-Bears-Large.jpg|thumb|left|Chicago Bears Uniform History (1920–2005)]]
On November 13, 2005 and October 29, 2006 (both times in games against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]), the Bears introduced an orange alternate home jersey. The orange swaps roles with the navy blue on this alternate jersey, as it becomes the dominant color while the navy complements. The orange jerseys were worn again on October 19, 2008 at home against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in a 48–41 victory.&lt;ref&gt;''Yahoo! Sports'' [http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/recap;_ylt=AsDNEqEd50XnkkvLlrU1_eAdsLYF?gid=20081019003 Bears hang on against Minnesota]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Bears also wore the orange jerseys against the Detroit Lions on October 28, 2007 and most recently in a November 1, 2009 game vs. the [[Cleveland Browns]] (Bears won 30–6). The Bears previously wore orange jerseys as part of a throwback uniform in a [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] game at the Dallas Cowboys in 2004. Their uniforms, especially for their classic look, have been cited as one of the best in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jay Mohr: Breaking down the best and worst NFL uniforms | work = Sports Illustrated | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/jay_mohr/11/09/mohr.sports/ | accessdate = November 9, 2005 | date=November 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the Bears have worn their alternate orange jerseys for one home game a season that is near [[Halloween]]. For the 2005–07 and 2010 home openers, the team wore the white jerseys with the navy blue pants. The team is 4–0 in these games, beating the Lions in 2005, 2006, and 2010, and beating the Chiefs in 2007.

The Bears will honor the original Monsters of the Midway during the 2010 season by wearing throwback uniforms of the era for selected games. The uniforms are a nod to the 1940s when the Bears won four NFL titles with Hall of Famers Danny Fortman, Sid Luckman, George McAfee, George Musso, Bronko Nagurski, Joe Stydahar and Clyde &quot;Bulldog&quot; Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bears unveil new throwback uniforms | work = Chicago Breaking Sports| url = http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/04/bears-unveil-new-throwback-uniforms.html | accessdate = April 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mascots===
Before the introduction of [[Staley Da Bear]], the club had two unofficial mascots named &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Bearman&quot;. &quot;Rocky&quot; was a man who donned a &quot;1&quot; Bears jersey, carried a [[megaphone]], and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. There is no known source of who &quot;Rocky&quot; was, except that he disappeared from Soldier Field in the early 1990s and presumably lived in [[Northwest Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rocky | work = Bearshistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx |accessdate = May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Wachter, also known as &quot;Bearman&quot;, is a [[season ticket]] holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the team by cheerleading. The club allowed him to run across the field with a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score. In 1996, he donned his &quot;costume&quot; of face paint, bear head and arms, and a number 46 jersey. &quot;Bearman&quot; was forced to stop wearing his costume with the introduction of [[Staley Da Bear]] in 2003; however, in 2005 Wachter was allowed in costume again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bearman | work = Bearshistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | accessdate = May 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium==
{{Main|Wrigley Field|Soldier Field}}

Soldier Field, located on [[Lake Shore Drive]] in Chicago, is the current home to the Bears. The Bears moved into Soldier Field in 1971 after outgrowing [[Wrigley Field]], the team's home for 50 years, and [[Northwestern University]]'s residential neighbors objected to their playing at Dyche Stadium, now called [[Ryan Field (stadium)|Ryan Field]]. After the [[AFL-NFL Merger]], the newly merged league wanted their teams to play in stadiums that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with the portable bleachers that the team brought into Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wrigley Field&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = BearsHistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/soldierfieldhistory.aspx |accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier Field's playing turf was changed from [[AstroTurf|astroturf]] to natural grass in time for the start of the 1988 season. The stadium was the site of the infamous [[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]] playoff game between the Bears and [[Philadelphia Eagles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Flashback: Eagles fly into fog| work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/7730971| accessdate = September 28, 2004 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041010040609/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/7730971 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2002 Chicago Bears season|2002]], the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall of the stadium being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, a day after the Bears lost in the [[NFL playoffs, 2001-02|playoffs]]. It reopened on September 27, 2003 after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/soldierfieldhistory.aspx | accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as &quot;New Soldier Field&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = ChicagoBears.com | url = http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp | accessdate = July 16, 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the {{nfly|2002}} season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], where they went 3–5.

Many critics have negative views of the new stadium. They believe that its current structure has made it more of an eyesore than a landmark; some have dubbed it the &quot;Mistake on the Lake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mistake on the Lake | work = The Times of Northwest Indiana | url = http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2003/09/30/news/top_news/965adf222a1ac3af86256db100030920.prt | accessdate = September 1, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier Field was stripped of its [[National Historic Landmark]] designation on February 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties, 4/17/06 through 4/21/06 | work = National Register of Historic Places Listings | url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20060428.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the Bears won the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted (and lost) their divisional round match on January 15, 2006 against the [[2005 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. This was the first playoff game at Soldier Field since the stadium reopened.

The stadium's [[end zone]]s and midfield were not painted until the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bears History &quot;Bits&quot;| work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagobearshistorybits.aspx | accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The design sported on the field included the bolded word &quot;Chicago&quot; in both end zones. In 1983, the end zone design returned, with the addition of a large wishbone &quot;C&quot; Bears logo painted at midfield. These field markings remained unchanged until the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bears Midfield Logo| work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagobearshistorybits.aspx |accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the midfield wishbone &quot;C&quot; was changed to a large blue Bears head, and the end zone design were painted with &quot;Bears&quot; in cursive. This new design remained until the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]], at which point the artwork was returned to the classic &quot;Chicago&quot; and the &quot;C&quot;. In the new Soldier Field, the artwork was tweaked to where one end zone had the word &quot;Chicago&quot; bolded and the other had &quot;Bears&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New Soldier Field Art| work = Bears History.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagobearshistorybits.aspx | accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bears in popular culture==
While the Super Bowl XX Champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American pop culture in the 1980s, the Bears made a prior mark with the 1971 American TV movie ''[[Brian's Song]]'' starring [[Billy Dee Williams]] as Gale Sayers and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] as Brian Piccolo. The film told of how Piccolo helped Sayers recover from a devastating knee injury to return to his status as one of the league's best players, and how Sayers in turn helped the Piccolo family through Brian's fatal illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Brian's Song (1971)| work = IMDb | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068315/| accessdate = July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Reel Life: Brian's Song| work = ESPN | url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/021004.html|accessdate = July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 remake of the movie for ABC starred [[Sean Maher]] as Piccolo and [[Mekhi Phifer]] as Sayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Brian's Song (2001)| work = IMDb | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289873/| accessdate = July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song &quot;[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]&quot;, which reached number forty-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Top 10 Greatest NFL Team's of All-Time |work = WatchMojo.com | url = http://www.watchmojo.com/sports/football/010.php| accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = These records were meant to be broken|work = Floridan | url = http://www.sptimes.com/News/012801/news_pf/Floridian/These_records_were_ma.shtml|accessdate = January 28, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for the song depicts the team [[rapping]] that they are &quot;not here to start no trouble&quot; but instead &quot;just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;. The team took a risk by recording and releasing the song before the playoffs had even begun, but were able to avoid embarrassment by going on to win Super Bowl XX by a then-record margin of 46–10. That game was one of the most watched television events in history according to the [[Nielsen ratings]] system; the game had a rating of 48.3, ranking it seventh in all-time television history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nielsen's Top 10 | work = Nielsen Ratings | url = http://www.nielsenmedia.com/ratings/topnetworktelecasts.htm| accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the &quot;Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Remembering the Super Bowl Shuffle | work = ESPN | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=katcher/040825 | accessdate = August 1, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rap song, the Bears' success in the 1980s – and especially the personality of head coach Mike Ditka – inspired a recurring sketch on the [[Television in the United States|American]] [[sketch comedy]] [[Television program|program]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', called &quot;[[Bill Swerski's Superfans]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bill Swerski's Super Fans | work = SNL Transcripts | url = http://snltranscripts.jt.org/90/90jsuperfans.phtml| accessdate = July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch featured ''[[Cheers]]'' co-star [[George Wendt]], a Chicago native, as host of a radio talk-show (similar in tone to [[WGN (AM)|WGN radio]]'s &quot;The Sportswriters&quot;), with co-panelists Carl Wollarski ([[Robert Smigel]]), Pat Arnold ([[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]) and Todd O'Connor ([[Chris Farley]]). To hear them tell it, &quot;Da Bears&quot; and Coach Ditka could do no wrong. The sketch stopped after Ditka was fired in 1993. The sketch usually showed the panelists drinking lots of beer and eating lots of [[Polish sausage]], and often featured Todd getting so agitated about what was happening with the Bears that he suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered (through self-administered [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]]). The sketch also features the cast predicting unrealistic blowout victories for Bears games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SNL Super Fans Transcripts | work = SNL Transcripts | url = http://snltranscripts.jt.org/90/90jsuperfans.phtml| accessdate = July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Da Super Fan sketch has not been brought back by ''SNL'', with the exception of a single appearance by [[Horatio Sanz]] as a Super Fan for the Cubs on [[Weekend Update]] in 2003. Outside of ''SNL'', George Wendt reprised his role of Swerski in the opening promo of [[Super Bowl XL]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

On TV shows based in Chicago such as ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[According to Jim]]'', ''[[Early Edition]]'' and ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'', the main characters are all Bears fans, and have worn Bears' jerseys and t-shirts on some occasions. Some episodes even show them watching Bears games. Rosanne is another TV show based outside of Chicago to feature the Bears as the consensus household favorite. That 70s Show featured several Bears references, as it was based in Wisconsin, home of the Packers. On one episode while the gang is at a Bears vs. Packers game, Eric comes to the seat in a Walter Payton jersey and is booed by the surrounding Packers fans.

Ditka's success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked for both the ''[[NFL on NBC]]'' and CBS's ''[[The NFL Today]]'', and he currently works on ESPN's ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' and provided Friday night analysis on the Bears on [[WBBM-TV|CBS 2 Chicago]], the CBS Chicago affiliate, called &quot;2 on Football&quot; with former CBS 2 Sports Director [[Mark Malone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ditka joins CBS2| work = CBS 2 Chicago (WBBM-TV) | url = http://cbs2chicago.com/pressreleases/local_story_197002133.html| accessdate = July 14, 2004 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears preseason games. Ditka also co-starred himself alongside actor [[Will Ferrell]] in the 2005 [[comedy film]] ''[[Kicking &amp; Screaming]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kicking and Screaming (2005)| work = IMDb | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384642/| accessdate = April 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Ditka, [[Dick Butkus]], [[Walter Payton]], [[Jim McMahon]], [[William Perry (American football)|William &quot;Refrigerator&quot; Perry]] and [[Brian Urlacher]] are among Bears figures known for their appearances in TV commercials. Urlacher, whose jersey was among the league's best-selling in 2002, was featured on [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercials with former [[Atlanta Falcons]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Urlacher's not going anywhere| work = USA Today | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/bears/2003-06-04-urlacher_x.htm| accessdate = June 3, 2003 | date=June 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Different Campaign for Nike | work = The New York Times | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/24/business/media/24adco.html?ex=1392958800&amp;en=7886de57c2852995&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND| accessdate = February 24, 2004 | first=Stuart | last=Elliott | date=February 24, 2004}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the popular American sit-com ''Roseanne'', Dan Conner (John Goodman) would often wear a Chicago Bears hoodie.

[[Chevy Chase]] ([[Clark Griswold]]) appears in some scenes wearing a black Chicago Bears ball cap. He wears the same Chicago Bears cap throughout all four Vacation movies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/trivia?tr0947526 &quot;Vacation (1983) – Trivia&quot;] IMDb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Urlacher made a cameo in the seventh season of the HBO series ''Entourage'' in 2010.

In the Disney Channel Show ''Shake It Up'' based in Chicago had a Bears reference in the episode Match it Up by Dina Garcia (Ainsley Bailey) by selling scalped Chicago Bears tickets.

===Local radio and television===

==Statistics and records==
{{details|Chicago Bears statistics}}
[[Bill George]] and [[Doug Buffone]] hold the record for the most seasons in a Bears uniform with 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;records&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Chicago Bears Team Records | work = Chicago Bears | url = http://org-www.chicagobears.com/history/records.jsp |accessdate = August 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; George did it between the 1952 and 1965 seasons and Buffone during the 1966 through 1979 seasons. On the other hand, [[Steve McMichael]] holds the record for most consecutive games played by a Bear with 191;&lt;ref name=&quot;records&quot; /&gt; he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one game in a span of 13 seasons.

[[Placekicker]] [[Kevin Butler (American football)|Kevin Butler]] holds the club record&lt;ref name=&quot;records&quot; /&gt; for scoring the most points in his ten-year Bear career. He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker from 1985 to 1995. He is followed in distant second place by Payton, with 750 points. Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726.&lt;ref name=&quot;records&quot; /&gt; That was an NFL record until [[Emmitt Smith]] of the Dallas Cowboys broke it in {{nfly|2002}}. [[Neal Anderson]], who played from 1986 to 1993, is the closest to Payton's record with 6,166 yards. [[Mark Bortz]] holds the record for most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed by Kevin Butler, [[Dennis Gentry]], [[Dan Hampton]], [[Jay Hilgenberg]], Steve McMichael, [[Ron Rivera]], [[Mike Singletary]], and [[Keith Van Horne]], who have each played in 12 playoff games.

The 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in an NFL game ([[NFL playoffs|playoff]] or regular season) with a 73–0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1940|1940 NFL Championship Game]]. The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61–7 result against the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 52–0 loss against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The club recorded undefeated regular seasons in 1934 and 1942, but (unlike the 1972 Dolphins) did not win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed a 13–0 record but were defeated by the New York Giants, and in 1942 the club completed an 11–0 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship three-peat – a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no team has done it since the AFL-NFL merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NFL History | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/standings | accessdate = August 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Halas holds the team record for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories of 324. Halas' victories record stood until [[Don Shula]] surpassed Halas in {{nfly|1993}}. Ditka is the closest Bears coach to Halas, with 112 career victories. No other Bears coach has recorded over 100 victories with the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;records&quot; /&gt;

During the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|2006 season]], return specialist [[Devin Hester]] set several kick return records.  He currently holds the franchise record for most return yards with 1,449.&lt;ref&gt;Chicagobears.com [http://www.chicagobears.com/team/player40.html Devin Hester's NFL Career] Received on September 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He had six touchdown returns, setting a record for most returns in a single season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hester-SB&quot;&gt;Super Bowl.com, [http://www.superbowl.com/news/story/9968501 Hester is Chicago's not-so-secret weapon] Retrieved on February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he recorded another six touchdown season from returns. One of the most notable of these returns came on November 12, 2006, when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261112019 Hester's record return pushes Bears past sleeping Giants] Retrieved on March 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The record tied former teammate [[Nathan Vasher]]'s previous record, which was set almost a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN.com Page 2, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=nfl/week10/damn-moment The Damn!

The '''Cincinnati Bengals''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. They are members of the [[AFC North|AFC's North Division]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Bengals began play in 1968 as an [[expansion team]] in the [[American Football League]] (AFL), and joined the NFL in 1970 in the [[AFL-NFL Merger]].

The Bengals are named after an [[Cincinnati Bengals (1937-41)|earlier team]] that played from 1937–1941. They play their home games at [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[Cityscape of Cincinnati|Downtown Cincinnati]] and currently{{when|date=February 2011}} conduct summer training camp at [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]] in [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]], [[Kentucky]]. The Bengals played in [[Super Bowl XVI]] and [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] and have won seven division championships and made nine playoff appearances. The Bengals are now in their forty-third season. Of those forty three seasons, the Bengals have posted winning records only twelve times and only twice in the past twenty seasons.

==Franchise history==
{{main|History of the Cincinnati Bengals}}
The franchise takes its name from an earlier [[Cincinnati Bengals (1937-41)|Cincinnati Bengals]] team, which played from 1937–1941.

In [[1967 AFL season|1967]] an ownership group led by [[Paul Brown]] was granted a franchise in the [[American Football League]]. Brown named the team the Bengals in order &quot;to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cincinnatibengals.com/team/history.asp History - Cincinnati Bengals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues&lt;ref&gt;[[AFL II]] 1937, [[American Football League (1938)|AFL/APFA]] 1939, [[AFL III]] 1940-1941&lt;/ref&gt; from [[1937 American Football League season|1937]] to [[1942 in sports|1942]]. The city's world-renowned [[Cincinnati Zoo|zoo]] was also home to a rare white [[Bengal Tiger]]. However, possibly as an insult to [[Art Modell]], Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word &quot;BENGALS&quot; in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in [[1981 in sports|1981]] and which is still in use to this day; however, that design featured orange stripes on a black helmet which were more uniform in width.

Brown was not a supporter of the rival American Football League, stating that &quot;I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conigliofamily.com/PaulBrown.htm Paul Brown&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He only acquiesced to joining the AFL when he was guaranteed that the team would become an NFL franchise after the impending [[AFL-NFL merger|merger of the two leagues]].

There was also a complication: [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] were in need of a facility to replace the antiquated, obsolete [[Crosley Field]], which they had used since [[1912 Major League Baseball season|1912]]. Parking nightmares had plagued the city as far back as the 1950s, the little park lacked modern amenities, and [[New York City]], which in [[1957 Major League Baseball season|1957]] had lost both its [[National League]] teams (the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]) to [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], respectively, was actively courting Reds owner [[Powel Crosley]]. However, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated worsening problems with the Crosley Field location, which were exacerbated by the [[Millcreek Expressway]] ([[I-75]]) project that ran alongside the park.

With assistance from Ohio governor James A. Rhodes, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. The new facility had to be ready by the opening of the [[1970 NFL season]] and was officially named [[Riverfront Stadium]], which was its working title.

With the completion of the merger in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Cleveland Browns were moved to the AFL-based American Football Conference and placed in the [[AFC Central]], the same division as the Bengals. An instant [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|rivalry was born]], fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell. The teams have since met on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' twice, the Bengals winning each time.

For their inaugural season, the Bengals played at [[Nippert Stadium]] which is the current home of the [[University of Cincinnati]] [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Bearcats]]. The team finished its first season with a 3&amp;ndash;11 record, although one bright spot was running back [[Paul Robinson (American football player)|Paul Robinson]]. Robinson rushed for 1,023 yards and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.

Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons. One of Brown’s college draft strategies was to draft players with above-average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver [[Pat McInally]] attended [[Harvard University]] and linebacker Reggie Williams attended [[Dartmouth College]] and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals’ roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate and went on to have successful careers in [[Play-by-play|commentary]] and [[broadcasting]] as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.

In 1970 the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] until the team moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]]. The team would reach the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In [[1975 NFL season|1975]], the [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|team]] posted an 11&amp;ndash;3 record, giving them what is to this day the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a Wild Card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12&amp;ndash;2 [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], who went on to win the Super Bowl, and Bengals lost to the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 31&amp;ndash;28 in the divisional playoffs.

The Bengals would reach the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s, but lost both times to the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Then, after the team appeared in the playoffs in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], Paul Brown died. He had already transferred control to his son, [[Mike Brown (football team owner)|Mike Brown]], but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.  The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team would post 14 consecutive non-winning seasons. They began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after hiring [[Marvin Lewis]] as head coach in 2003. [[Carson Palmer]], the future star quarterback, was drafted in [[2003 NFL Draft|2003]], but did not play a snap that whole season, as [[Jon Kitna]] had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the [[2004 NFL season|following season]]. Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 in the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], which marked the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.  

The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] in a season that included the franchise's first ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals (the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens) had both made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.

Meanwhile, Paul Brown Stadium was built for the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]] using private and public money. In tribute to his father, Mike Brown refused corporate offers to have the stadium renamed for their company which became a trend in the NFL and other sports teams around that time.

In 2010, the Bengals posted a 4-12 record.

==Logos and uniforms==
[[File:AFC-Throwback2-Uniform-CIN.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Cincinnati Bengals uniform: 1968-1980]]
When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the [[Cleveland Browns]]. When Paul Brown was fired by [[Art Modell]], Brown still had ownership of the equipment used by Cleveland. So after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were orange, brown and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.

The Bengals' team colors were orange, black and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word &quot;Bengals&quot; in block letters on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL as they did not have uniform numbers on the players sleeves until the 1980 season.

The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced. Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced orange helmets with black tiger stripes.

In 1997, the Bengals designed an alternate logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves. They also designed an alternate logo consisting of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the team's primary trademark.

In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange sleeves, while the white jerseys began to use black sleeves and orange shoulders. A new logo consisting of an orange &quot;B&quot; covered with black tiger stripes was introduced. The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey.

The Bengals have primarily worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, except during the 1970 season when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season, and most of the 1971 season. In 2001, 2002, 2005 and onwards the Bengals wore white at home for preseason games as well as September home games due to the heat.

However in 2009 the team along with the Dolphins despite being an AFL team did not wear a throwback for the season due to the team not being an original AFL franchise.

==Contributions to NFL culture==
===No Huddle Offense===
A '''[[No-Huddle Offense]]''' was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, [[Sam Wyche]], the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator [[Bruce Coslet]], made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly setting up for the next play (often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds) this hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and, some suggest, increased the defense's rate of fatigue (This is attributed to the belief that the offense dictates when a play starts so they tend to be more mentally relaxed and prepared for the start of a play where the defense must remain on a higher level of alert before the play starts). In response the NFL instituted several rules related to this tactic:
* Allowing the defense ample time for substitutions (if offensive substitutions are made);
* If a player's injury causes the play-clock to stop, the player must sit out at least one play; and
* Charging a time-out to a team when a player is injured within a certain time period of the game.

The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy  during this time was the [[Buffalo Bills]], coached by [[Marv Levy]], who also used a version of the no-huddle offense. Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules.  Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time.  This also allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers to repair an equipment defect.  

Wyche recalled that before the '88 AFC title game the Buffalo Bills had seemingly convinced league officials to penalize the Bengals for running a no-huddle offense. In a statement made to the Bengals' press in 2005, he relayed &quot;The NFL was nice enough to come to us an hour and 55 minutes before the game and tell us we would be given a 15-yard penalty every time we used it. Of course we had practiced it all week. We told them if they wanted to answer to the public for changing the competitive balance of the AFC championship game, that was up to them, but we were using it. They never dropped a flag.&quot;

===West Coast Offense/Paul Brown's Offense &amp; the Zone Blitz===
The [[West Coast Offense]], which is commonly employed by many teams (most notably, it was used by [[San Francisco 49ers]] during their dynasty), is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. This play scheme was used by Ken Anderson during the Bengals' initial Super Bowl run, which was a loss to Walsh's 49ers.

Ironically, the defense created to combat the West Coast Offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals [[defensive coordinator]] [[Dick LeBeau]] (who would later be the team's head coach from 2000–2002) created the [[zone blitz]] in the 1980s in response to the West Coast Offense. Though the Bengals ran it with some success, like the West Coast Offense the scheme became more successful elsewhere, in this case with the [[Bengals–Steelers rivalry|rival]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], where LeBeau has served two stints as defensive coordinator. LeBeau has led both Bengals Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl appearances with Pittsburgh using the zone blitz.

===Paul Brown Stadium===
Mike Brown, the current owner of the Bengals, named the new stadium after his [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r father, Paul Brown, resisting offers to sell the naming rights for the stadium.

==Radio and television==
The Bengals flagship radio stations are [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]], &quot;ESPN 1530&quot; and [[WEBN]]-FM, with [[WLW]] AM 700 joining in following the end of the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds']] season through 2013.  It was announced on May 4th by the Bengals, that beginning with the 2011 season that [[Dan Hoard]] was hired to replace [[Brad Johansen]]&lt;ref&gt;http://cincinnati.com/blogs/bengals/2011/05/04/radio-change-hoard-takes-over-on-play-by-play/&lt;/ref&gt; as the main play-by-play man. The radio broadcast crew now consists of Hoard and and former Bengals [[offensive lineman]] [[Dave Lapham]], who started in 1985.  

Most preseason and regular season games, are telecast on [[WKRC-TV]], Local 12, the [[CBS]] affiliate. with the addition of [[Dan Hoard]] to the radio broadcast crew. the new play-by-play for preseason games hasn't been announced it.  In 2010 Dan Hoard and [[Anthony Munoz]] were the TV announcers for preseason games. Games that feature an NFC opponent played at Paul Brown Stadium are televised on [[WXIX]], Fox 19

Phil Samp was the Bengals original play-by-play announcer from 1968-1990. Ken Broo (1991–1995), [[Paul Keels]] (1996) and [[Pete Arbogast]] (1997–2000) and [[Brad Johansen]] (2001-2010) have also done radio play-by-play for the Bengals.

==Chant==
&quot;Who Dey&quot; is the name of a [[chant]] of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use for over 30 years. The entire chant is: &quot;Who dey! Who dey! Who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?&quot; The answer screamed in unison, &quot;Nobody!&quot; Sometimes fans will instead shout &quot;Who Dey&quot; to represent the entire cheer. &quot;Who Dey&quot; is also the name of the team’s [[mascot]], a [[Bengal tiger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bengals.com/fanzone/whodey.html &quot;Bengals Mascot 'Who Dey'&quot;] at Bengals official website (accessed September 23, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Who Dey chant's first known use was by fans of the [[1980 Cincinnati Bengals season|1980 Cincinnati Bengals]]. While the origin of the chant is unsettled, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: “Who’s going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!” Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.&lt;ref&gt;http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/who-dey-vs-who-dat/&lt;/ref&gt;

The chant bears some similarities to the phrase &quot;[[Who Dat?]],&quot; which was officially adopted by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time.  The saying “[[Who Dat?]]&quot; originated in [[minstrel shows]] and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by [[New Orleans Jazz]] and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s.   In the late 1960s, local [[Louisiana]]  High Schools, [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] in [[New Orleans]] and  [[Patterson High School (Louisiana)|Patterson High School]] are reported to have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of [[Alcorn State University]] and [[Louisiana State University]] picked up the cheer in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Cleveland, [http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20100129/NEWS/1290347 &quot;Who Dat started diz?&quot;], ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'' (Jackson, Miss.), January 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   Southern University in New Orleans claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: &quot;Who dat talkin' 'bout beatin' dem Jags.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Morris, [http://www.2theadvocate.com/features/80308957.html &quot;Saints cheer predates team; not much more history known&quot;], ''[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]'' (Baton Rouge, La.), December 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long-standing debate between the Saints and Bengals fan bases over which one originated the chant from their culture.

It flows for {{Convert|6418|km|mi|0}} from the glaciers on the [[Tibetan Plateau]] in [[Qinghai Province|Qinghai]] eastward across [[southwest China|southwest]], [[south Central China|central]] and [[east China|eastern]] China before emptying into the [[East China Sea]] at [[Shanghai]].  It is also [[List of rivers by discharge|one of the biggest rivers by discharge volume in the world]].  The Yangtze drains one-fifth of China's land area and its river basin is home to one-third of [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|China's population]].&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.cjw.gov.cn/index/river/liuyugk-3.asp?link=1] Accessed 2010-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the [[Yellow River]], the Yangtze is the most important river in the [[history of China|history]], [[culture of China|culture]] and [[Economy of the People's Republic of China|economy]] of China.  The prosperous [[Yangtze River Delta]] generates as much as 20% of [[Historical GDP of the People's Republic of China|China's GDP]].  The river is an important physical and cultural dividing line between [[Northern and southern China|North and South China]].  Chinese living north of the Yangtze speak [[Mandarin dialects|varying dialects]] of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].  Most of the provinces south of the river have native [[Sinitic languages]] that are unintelligible to Mandarin-speakers.
The Yangtze River flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is itself habitat to several [[Endemism|endemic]] and endangered species including the [[Yangtze River dolphin]] (now extinct), [[Chinese alligator]], and the [[Yangtze sturgeon]].  For thousands of years, man has used the river for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking and war.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalrivers.org/node/356 International Rivers, Three Gorges Dam profile], Accessed August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, agricultural run-off, [[siltation]], and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding.  Some sections of the river are now protected as [[Protected areas of China|nature reserves]].  A stretch of the Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western [[Yunnan]] is part of the [[Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

'''Yangtze River''', also spelled '''Yangtse River''', '''Yangzi River''' and '''Yangtze Kiang''', is derived from ''Yangzi Jiang'' {{Audio|Chinese-YangZiJiang.ogg|listen}}, the local name for a stretch of the lower Yangtze near [[Yangzhou]].  “Yangzi” was the name of a village and site of an ancient ferry crossing, and ''Jiang'' is one of the Chinese words for river.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese)[http://www.yznews.com.cn/yzwb/html/2010-01/23/content_92703.htm An Min, &quot;夜晤扬子津&quot; ''Yangzi Wanbao''] 2010-01-23&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 13th century, the famous [[Song Dynasty]] official, [[Wen Tianxiang]] penned a poem entitled ''Yangzi Jiang.''  Later, Western missionaries heard the name and applied it to the entire river.

===Chinese names===
The Chinese use distinct official names for different stretches of the river.
* '''Chang Jiang''' (长江/長江 ''Cháng Jiāng'', lit. &quot;Long River&quot;) is the name for the last 2,884&amp;nbsp;km of the Yangtze from the confluence with the [[Min River (Sichuan)]] at [[Yibin]] to its mouth at Shanghai.  In ancient times, this river was simply known as ''Jiang'' or the ''Da Jiang'' (the great river).  Stretches of Chang Jiang have local names such as the Chuanjiang (川江, for the [[Sichuan]] portion of the river from Yibin to [[Yichang]]), Jingjiang (荆江, for the [[Jingzhou]] section of the river) and Yangzi Jiang (near Yangzhou).  The entire Chang Jiang is navigable and also known as the ''Golden Waterway.''
*'''[[Jinsha River]]''' or '''Gold Sands River''' (金沙江 ''Jīnshā Jiāng'', lit. &quot;Golden Sands River&quot;) refers to 2,308&amp;nbsp;km of the Yangtze upstream from [[Yibin]] to the confluence with the Batang River, near [[Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Yushu]].
*'''[[Tongtian River]]''' (通天河, lit. &quot;river passing through heaven&quot;) refers to the 813&amp;nbsp;km stretch of the Yangtze from Yushu upstream to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and Dangqu, which together forms the Tongtian.
*'''Tuotuo River''' (沱沱河) refers to one of the headwater streams of the Yangtze.  It arises from glaciers south of the [[Geladandong]] Mountain in [[Qinghai]] and flows west for 343&amp;nbsp;km where it meets with the Dangqu and forms the Tongtian.

===Tibetan names===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
The source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are located in ethnic Tibetan areas of Qinghai.&lt;ref&gt;Yang W, Zheng D. Tibetan Geography. China Intercontinental Press, 2004, ISBN 7508506650, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]], the headwater streams of the Tuotuo are called '''Naqinqu'''.  The Tuotuo River is known in Tibetan as '''Maqu''' (Red River).  Tuotuo is derived from the  [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] name for the river, ''Tuoketuonaiwulanmulun'' (托克托乃乌兰木伦, or the frothy red river).  The Tongtian is known in Tibetan as the '''Drichu''' ({{bo|t=འབྲི་ཆུ་ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.khoryug.org/id63.html&lt;/ref&gt;|w='bri chu}},直曲, lit. &quot;river of the female yak&quot;).  '''Dangqu''' (当曲) another leading headwater stream of the Yangtze is [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] for &quot;marsh river&quot;.

==Geography==
[[Image:Map of the Yangtze River.gif|thumb|400px||Yangtze watershed]]
The river originates from several tributaries, two of which have claims to be the source.  The Chinese government has recognized the source of the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of [[Geladandong]] Mountain in the [[Tanggula Mountains|Dangla Mountain Range]] on the eastern part of the [[Tibetan plateau]]. However, the geographical source (i.e., longest river distance from the sea) lies in wetlands at N32˚36’14” E94˚30’44 and 5170 meters above sea level at the head of the Dan Qu tributary [&lt;ref&gt;Wong How Man (2005) New and longer Yangtze source discovered. http://www.cers.org.hk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=27&amp;layout=blog&amp;Itemid=61&lt;/ref&gt;]. These tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through [[Qinghai]], turning southward down a deep valley at the border of [[Sichuan]] and [[Tibet]] to reach [[Yunnan]]. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5000 m to less than 1000 m. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. In its descent to sea level, the river falls to an altitude of {{convert|305|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} at Yibin, Sichuan Province, the head of navigation for riverboats, and to {{convert|192|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} at Chongqing. Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} and a distance of about {{convert|320|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}, it passes through the spectacular Yangtze Gorges, which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.

It enters the basin of Sichuan at [[Yibin]]. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.

After entering [[Hubei]], the Yangtze receives more water from thousands of lakes. The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].

At the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] provinces, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at [[Shanghai]].
{{Image|TroyParfitt2.JPG|thumb|right|Cruise on the Yangtze River before sunset}}

Four of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to [[Hukou County]], where [[Lake Poyang]] meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai. It is home to many thousands of people.

The Yangtze flows into the [[East China Sea]] and was navigable by ocean-going vessels up  a thousand miles from its mouth even before the Three Gorges Dam was built. As of June 2003, this dam spans the river, flooding [[Fengjie]], the first of a number of towns affected by the massive flood control and power generation project. This is the largest comprehensive [[irrigation]] project in the world and has a significant impact on [[Agriculture in China|China's agriculture]]. Its proponents argue that it will free people living along the river from floods that have repeatedly threatened them in the past and will offer them [[electricity]] and [[water transport]]—though at the expense of permanently flooding many existing towns (including numerous ancient cultural relics) and causing large-scale changes in the local [[ecology]].

Opponents of the dam point out that there are three different kinds of floods on the Yangtze River: floods which originate in the upper reaches, floods which originate in the lower reaches, and floods along the entire length of the river. They argue that the Three Gorges dam will actually make flooding in the upper reaches worse and have little or no impact on floods which originate in the lower reaches. Twelve hundred years of low water marks on the river were recorded in the inscriptions and the carvings of carp at [[Baiheliang]], now submerged.

The Yangtze is flanked with metallurgical, power, chemical, auto, building materials and machinery industrial belts and high-tech development zones. It is playing an increasingly crucial role in the river valley's economic growth and has become a vital link for international shipping to the inland provinces. The river is a major transportation artery for China, connecting the interior with the coast.

The river is one of the world's busiest waterways. Traffic includes commercial traffic transporting bulk goods such as coal as well as manufactured goods and passengers. Cargo transportation reached 795 million tons in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/23/content_4089542.htm Xinhua - English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/04/content_4133140.htm Xinhua - English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; River cruises several days long, especially through the beautiful and scenic [[Three Gorges]] area, are becoming popular as the tourism industry grows in China.

Flooding along the river has been a major problem. The rainy season in China is May and June in areas south of Yangtze River, and July and August in areas north of it. The huge river system receives water from both southern and northern flanks, which causes its flood season to extend from May to August. Meanwhile, the relatively dense population and rich cities along the river make the floods more deadly and costly. The most recent major floods were the [[1998 Yangtze River Floods]], but more disastrous were the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]], killing around 30,000 people. Other severe floods included those of 1911, which killed around 100,000, 1931 (145,000 dead), and 1935 (142,000 dead).

The Yangtze is very polluted, especially in [[Hubei]] ([[Shashi District]]).

The Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China. Human activity was found in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27 thousand years ago, initiating debate over the origin of the Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6554/abs/378275a0.html Early ''Homo'' and associated artefacts from Asia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], [[Ba (state)|Ba]] and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] were located along the western part of the river, covering modern Sichuan, Chongqing, and western Hubei; [[Chu (state)|Chu]] was located along the central part of river, corresponding to [[Hubei]], [[Hunan]], [[Jiangxi]], and southern [[Anhui]]. [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and [[Yue (state)|Yue]] were located along the eastern part of the river, now [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]], and [[Shanghai]]. Although the [[Yellow River]] region was richer and more developed at that time, the milder climate and more peaceful environment made the Yangtze River area more suitable for agriculture.

From the [[Han Dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called [[Jiangnan]] (that includes the southern part of [[Jiangsu]], the northern part of [[Zhejiang]], and the southeastern part of [[Anhui]]) provided 1/3-1/2 of the nation's revenues.

The Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way to [[Beijing]]). The less well known ancient [[Lingqu Canal]], connecting the upper [[Xiang River]] with the headwaters  of the [[Guijiang]], allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the [[Pearl River Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see [[History of China]]) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

Politically, [[Nanjing]] was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the [[Kingdom of Wu|Wu kingdom]] in the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]], and during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]  and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] periods. Only the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] occupied most parts of China from their capital at [[Nanjing]], though it later moved the capital to [[Beijing]]. The [[Republic of China|ROC]] capital was located in [[Nanjing]] in the periods 1911-1912, 1927–1937, and 1945-1949.

====Early history====
{{main|Steamboats on the Yangtze River}}
The first merchant steamer in China, the ''Jardine'', was built to order for the firm of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], [[Macao]], and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the &quot;suggestions&quot; of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the first of the [[Opium Wars]]. British warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships, laid waste to several coastal forts, indiscriminately bombarding town after town with heavy cannon fire, even pushing up north to threaten the [[Forbidden City|Imperial Palace]] in Beijing itself. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military superiority was clearly evident during the armed conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.

In 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to Queen Victoria. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.

====U.S. and French conflicts====
The US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the ''[[USS Wachusett (1861)|USS Wachusett]]'' six-hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] in about 1860, while the ''[[USS Ashuelot (1865)|USS Ashuelot]]'', a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Ichang]] in 1874. The first ''[[USS Monocacy (1864)|USS Monocacy]]'', a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first ''[[USS Palos (1865)|USS Palos]]'', an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankow]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], Europeans put more steamers on the river. The French, not to sit idle and get rice crumbs, engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of Vietnam. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.
