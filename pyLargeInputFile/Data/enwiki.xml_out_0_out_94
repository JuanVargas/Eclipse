'a + e, o + e, u + e'' in phone books, but as ''o'' elsewhere, and behind ''o'' in Austria), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (''ð'' follows ''d''), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''ij'' is sometimes ordered as ''y''; see [[IJ (digraph)#Collation|IJ: Collation]]), English (''æ'' is ordered as ''a + e''), and many other languages.

Usually the [[space (punctuation)|space]]s or [[hyphen]]s between words are ignored.

Languages that used a [[syllabary]] or [[abugida]] instead of an alphabet (for example, [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]) can use approximately the same system if there is a set ordering for the symbols.

===Radical-and-stroke sorting===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Character Palette.png|right|246px|thumbnail|The [[Character Palette]] from [[Mac OS X]] is an example of use of radical-and-stroke sorting on a computer to provide an interface to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters]] --&gt;

Another form of collation is '''radical-and-stroke sorting''', used for non-alphabetic writing systems such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[hanzi]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[kanji]], whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by convention. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] in Chinese and logographic systems derived from Chinese. Characters are then grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation. For example, the Chinese character for &quot;mother&quot; (妈) is sorted as a six-stroke character under the three-stroke primary radical (女).

The radical-and-stroke system is cumbersome compared to an alphabetical system in which there are a few characters, all unambiguous. The choice of which components of a logograph comprise separate radicals and which radical is primary is not clear-cut. As a result, logographic languages often supplement radical-and-stroke ordering with alphabetic sorting of a phonetic conversion of the logographs. For example, the kanji word ''''Tōkyō'' (東京), the Japanese name of [[Tokyo]] can be sorted as if it were spelled out in the Japanese characters of the [[hiragana]] syllabary as &quot;to-u-ki-&lt;sub&gt;yo&lt;/sub&gt;-u&quot; (とうきょう), using the conventional sorting order for these characters.

In addition, in Greater China, [[surname stroke order]]ing is a convention in some official documents where peoples' names are listed without hierarchy.

The radical-and-stroke system, or some similar pattern-matching and stroke-counting method, was traditionally the only practical method for constructing dictionaries that someone could use to look up a logograph whose pronunciation was unknown. With the advent of computers, dictionary programs are now available that allow one to draw a character using a mouse or stylus.

===Multilingual ordering===
When lists of names or words need to be ordered, but the context does not define a particular single language or alphabet, the [[Unicode Collation Algorithm]] provides a way to put them in sequence.

==Complications==
===Conventions in typography and in sorting systems===
In typography and in the writing of scientific articles etc., such things as headers, sections, lists, pages etc. might use alphabetical numbering instead of numerical numbering. However, this does not always mean that the full alphabet of a particular language is used. Often alphabetical numbering—or enumeration—only uses a subset of the full alphabet. E.g. the Russian alphabet has 33 letters, but typically only 28 are used in typographical enumeration (and for instance Ukrainian, Belarusian and Bulgarian Cyrillic enumeration shows similar features). Two Russian letters, [[Ъ]] and [[Ь]], are only used for modifying the preceding [[consonants]]—they naturally fall out. The last three could have been used, but mostly are not: [[Ы]] never begins a Russian word, [[Й]] almost never begins a word either, and it is perhaps too much like [[И]]—and also a relatively new character. [[Ё]] is also relatively new and much debated—sometimes in proper alphabetical sorting letters on Ё are listed under [[Е]]. (These &quot;rules&quot; are of course moderated, again, e.g. in phone catalogs, where foreign (non-Russian) names may frequently begin with Й or Ы.) This alludes to a simple fact: alphabets are not only tools for writing. And letters are often kept in an alphabet of a certain language even though they are not used in writing, not least because they are used in alphabetical enumeration. For instance, [[X]], [[W]], [[Z]] are not used in writing the Norwegian language, except in loanwords and names. Still they are kept in the [[Norwegian alphabet]], and used in alphabetical lists. Likewise, earlier versions of the [[Russian alphabet]] contained letters which only had two purposes: they were good for writing Greek words and for using the Greek counting system in its Cyrillic form.

===Compound words and special characters===
A complication in alphabetical sorting can arise due to disagreements over how groups of words (separated [[Compound (linguistics)|compound word]]s, [[name]]s, [[title]]s, etc.) should be ordered.  One rule is to remove spaces for purposes of ordering, another is to consider a [[space (punctuation)|space]] as a character that is ordered before numbers and letters (this method is consistent with ordering by ASCII or Unicode codepoint), and a third is to order a space after numbers and letters.  Given the following strings to alphabetize—&quot;catch&quot;, &quot;cattle&quot;, &quot;cat food&quot;—the first rule produces &quot;catch&quot; &quot;cat food&quot; &quot;cattle&quot;, the second &quot;cat food&quot; &quot;catch&quot; &quot;cattle&quot;, and the third &quot;catch&quot; &quot;cattle&quot; &quot;cat food&quot;.  The first rule is used in many (but not all) [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], the second in [[Telephone directory|telephone directories]] (so that Wilson, Jim K appears with other people named Wilson, Jim and not after Wilson, Jimbo).  The third rule is rarely used.

A similar complication arises when special characters such as [[hyphen]]s or [[apostrophe]]s appear in words or names.  Any of the same rules as above can be used in this case as well; however, the strict ASCII sorting no longer corresponds exactly to any of the rules.

===Name/surname ordering===
The telephone directory example sheds light on another complication.  In cultures where [[family name]]s are written after [[given name]]s, it is usually still desired to sort by family name first.  In this case, names need to be reordered to be sorted properly.  For example, Juan Hernandes and Brian O'Leary should be sorted as &quot;Hernandes, Juan&quot; and &quot;O'Leary, Brian&quot; even if they are not written this way.  Capturing this rule in a computer collation algorithm is difficult, and simple attempts will necessarily fail.  For example, unless the algorithm has at its disposal an extensive list of family names, there is no way to decide if &quot;Gillian Lucille van der Waal&quot; is &quot;van der Waal, Gillian Lucille&quot;, &quot;Waal, Gillian Lucille van der&quot;, or even &quot;Lucille van der Waal, Gillian&quot;.

===Abbreviations and common words===
When abbreviations are used, it is sometimes desired to expand the abbreviations for sorting.  In this case, &quot;St. Paul&quot; comes before &quot;Shanghai&quot;.  Obviously, to capture this behavior in a collation algorithm, a list of abbreviations is needed.  It may be more practical in some cases to store two sets of strings, one for sorting and one display.  A similar problem arises when letters are replaced by numbers or special symbols in an irregular manner, for example 1337 for [[leet]] or the movie ''[[Se7en (film)|Se7en]]''.  In this case, proper sorting necessitates keeping two sets of strings.

In certain contexts, very common words (such as [[article (grammar)|article]]s) at the beginning of a sequence of words are not considered for ordering, or are moved to the end.  So &quot;[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]&quot; is considered &quot;Shining&quot; or &quot;Shining, The&quot; when alphabetizing and therefore is ordered before &quot;[[Summer of Sam]]&quot;.  This rule is fairly easy to capture in an algorithm, but many programs rely instead on simple [[lexicographic order]]ing.  One fairly quaint exception to this rule is the flying of the flag of [[Republic of Macedonia#Macedonia naming dispute|The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] at the [[United Nations]] between those of [[Thailand]] and [[East Timor|Timor Leste]].

==Sorting of numbers==
Ascending order of numbers differs from alphabetical order, e.g. 11 comes alphabetically before 2. This can be fixed with [[leading zero]]s: 02 comes alphabetically before 11. See e.g. [[ISO 8601]].

Also -13 comes alphabetically after -12 although it is less. With negative numbers, to make ascending order correspond with alphabetical sorting, more drastic measures are needed such as adding a constant to all numbers to make them all positive.

===Numerical sorting of strings===
Sometimes, it is desired to order text with embedded numbers using proper numerical order.  For example, &quot;Figure 7b&quot; goes before &quot;Figure 11a&quot;, even though '7' comes after '1' in Unicode.  This can be extended to [[Roman numeral]]s. This behavior is not particularly difficult to produce as long as only integers are to be sorted, although it can slow down sorting significantly. For example, [[Windows XP]] does this when sorting [[file name]]s.

Sorting decimals properly is a bit more difficult, because different locales use different symbols for a [[decimal separator|decimal point]], and sometimes the same character used as a decimal point is also used as a separator, for example &quot;Section 3.2.5&quot;.  There is no universal answer for how to sort such strings; any rules are application dependent.

===Alphabetical sorting of numbers===
When numbers are used as names, rather than for their numerical properties, it is common{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} to sort them alphabetically as they would be spelled.  For example, the movie ''[[1776 (film)|1776]]'' would be between [[Seve Ballesteros]] and [[Severus Snape]].  If a number is in a foreign term, it is alphabetized as it would be spelled in that language; for example, [[24 heures du Mans]] would be between [[Vinge's Singularity]] and [[Vinh Airport]], reflecting the [[French (language)|French]] &quot;vingt-quatre&quot;.

'''Cola''' ('''Kola''') is a [[Soft drink|carbonated beverage]] that was historically flavored by the [[kola nut]], however many colas are now commonly flavored artificially. It became popular worldwide after druggist [[John Pemberton]] invented [[Coca-Cola]] in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;cocaine&quot;&gt;http://www.cocaine.org/cocawine.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His non-alcoholic version of the recipe was inspired by the [[Coca Wine]] of [[pharmacist]] [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]], created in 1863; it still contained [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cocaine&quot;/&gt; [[Coca-Cola]] is a major international brand, and is associated with the United States. It usually contains [[caramel color]], [[caffeine]] and sweeteners such as sugar or [[high fructose corn syrup]].

==Flavorings==
Despite the name, the primary flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are sugar, citrus oils (from oranges, limes, or lemon fruit peel), [[tamarind]], [[cinnamon]], [[vanilla]], and an acidic flavorant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/13/the-exotic-romance-tamarind.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sparror.cubecinema.com/cube/cola/chemistry/cola2.htm Sparror.cubecinema.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace ingredients to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include [[nutmeg]], [[lavender]], and a wide variety of ingredients, but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by [[phosphoric acid]], sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids. Many cola drink recipes are secret,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} notably [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola]].

A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, with the common sweetener often being dependent on local agricultural policy. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] is predominantly used in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]] due to the lower cost of government subsidized corn. In [[Europe]], however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=M. Ataman Aksoy, John C. Beghin |title=Global Agricultural Trade and Developing Countries |year=2005 |publisher=World Bank Publications |isbn=0821358634 |pages=329 |chapter=Sugar Policies: An Opportunity for Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[stevia]] or an [[artificial sweetener]] may be used; &quot;sugar-free&quot; or &quot;diet&quot; colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.

Some consumers prefer the taste of soda manufactured with sugar. As a result of this, there is demand in the United States for imported [[Mexican Coke|Mexican Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kosher]] for [[Passover]] Coca-Cola sold in the U.S. around the [[Jewish]] holiday also uses sucrose rather than HFCS and is also highly sought after by people who prefer the original taste.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2009-04-08-kosher-coke_N.htm USAtoday.com]
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Pepsi|PepsiCo]] occasionally markets a version of their Pepsi and [[Mountain Dew]] sodas that are sweetened with sugar instead of HFCS. These are marketed under the name ''Throwback''.

===Oceania===
* [http://www.wai-kawa.co.nz Kiwi Cola] is a cola produced under the WAI-KAWA brand in [[New Zealand]], and contains a [[Kawakawa (tree)|Kawakawa leaf]] infusion.

==Etymology==
The word '''cola''' may have been introduced into the mainstream by the major producer Coca-Cola, as they saw their trademark slipping into common use, like other [[genericized trademark]]s. They successfully{{Dubious|date=June 2010}} defended the exclusive use of their name and its diminutive form &quot;Coke&quot; by suggesting the alternative of &quot;cola drink&quot; as a generic name for similar types of carbonated soft drinks. The word cola as part of the Coca-Cola trademark may have originated from the [[kola nut]]s that were originally used as the source of caffeine, or from when the original recipe contained [[coca]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Capability Maturity Model (CMM)''' is a [[service mark]] registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU) and refers to a development model that was created after study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research.  This became the foundation from which CMU created the [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI). Like any model, it is an abstraction of an existing system.

When it is applied to an existing organization's software development processes, it allows an effective approach toward improving them. Eventually it became clear that the model could be applied to other processes. This gave rise to a more general concept that is applied to business processes and to developing people.

==Overview==
The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) was originally developed as a tool for objectively assessing the ability of government contractors' ''processes'' to perform a contracted software project. The CMM is based on the process maturity framework first described in the 1989 book ''Managing the Software Process'' by [[Watts Humphrey]]. It was later published in a report in 1993 (Technical Report CMU/SEI-93-TR-024 ESC-TR-93-177 February 1993, Capability Maturity Model for Software, Version 1.1) and as a book by the same authors in 1995.

Though the CMM comes from the field of [[software development]], it is used as a general model to aid in improving organizational business processes in diverse areas; for example in [[software engineering]], [[system engineering]], [[project management]], [[software maintenance]], [[risk management]], system acquisition, [[information technology]] (IT), services, business processes generally, and human capital management. The CMM has been used extensively worldwide in government offices, commerce, industry and software development organizations. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==History==
===Prior need for software processes===
In the 1970s, the use of computers grew more widespread, more flexible and less costly. Organizations began to adopt computerized information systems, and the demand for software development grew significantly. The processes for software development were in their infancy, with few standard or &quot;best practice&quot; approaches defined.

As a result, the growth was accompanied by growing pains: project failure was common, and the field of computer science was still in its early days, and the ambitions for project scale and complexity exceeded the market capability to deliver. Individuals such as [[Edward Yourdon]], [[Larry Constantine]], [[Gerald Weinberg]], [[Tom DeMarco]], and [[David Parnas]] began to publish articles and books with research results in an attempt to professionalize the software development process.

In the 1980s, several US military projects involving software subcontractors ran over-budget and were completed far later than planned, if at all. In an effort to determine why this was occurring, the [[United States Air Force]] funded a study at the SEI.

===Precursor===
The [[Quality Management Maturity Grid]] was developed by [[Philip B. Crosby]] in his book &quot;Quality is Free&quot;.&lt;ref name=crosby79qif/&gt;

The first application of a staged maturity model to IT was not by CMM/SEI, but rather by [[Richard L. Nolan]], who, in 1973 published the [[stages of growth model]] for IT organizations.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Watts Humphrey]] began developing his process maturity concepts during the later stages of his 27 year career at IBM. (References needed)

===Development at SEI===
Active development of the model by the US Department of Defense Software Engineering Institute (SEI) began in 1986 when Humphrey joined the [[Software Engineering Institute]] located at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] after retiring from IBM. At the request of the U.S. Air Force he began formalizing his Process Maturity Framework to aid the U.S. Department of Defense in evaluating the capability of software contractors as part of awarding contracts.

The result of the Air Force study was a model for the military to use as an objective evaluation of software subcontractors' process capability maturity. Humphrey based this framework on the earlier Quality Management Maturity Grid developed by [[Philip B. Crosby]] in his book &quot;Quality is Free&quot;.&lt;ref name=crosby79qif&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey's approach differed because of his unique insight that organizations mature their processes in stages based on solving process problems in a specific order. Humphrey based his approach on the staged evolution of a system of software development practices within an organization, rather than measuring the maturity of each separate development process independently. The CMM has thus been used by different organizations as a general and powerful tool for understanding and then improving general business process performance.

Organizations were originally assessed using a process maturity questionnaire and a Software Capability Evaluation method devised by Humphrey and his colleagues at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

The full representation of the Capability Maturity Model as a set of defined process areas and practices at each of the five maturity levels was initiated in 1991, with Version 1.1 being completed in January 1993.&lt;ref name=sei93cmm&gt;{{Cite journal

===Superseded by CMMI===
The CMM model proved useful to many organizations {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, but its application in software development has sometimes been problematic. Applying multiple models that are not integrated within and across an organization could be costly in training, appraisals, and improvement activities. The [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI) project was formed to sort out the problem of using multiple CMMs.

For software development processes, the CMM has been superseded by CMMI, though the CMM continues to be a general theoretical process capability model used in the public domain.

===Adapted to other processes===
The CMM was originally intended as a tool to evaluate the ability of government contractors to perform a contracted software project. Though it comes from the area of software development, it can be, has been, and continues to be widely applied as a general model of the maturity of ''process'' (e.g., [[IT service management]] processes) in IS/IT (and other) organizations.

==Model topics==
===Maturity model===
A maturity model can be viewed as a set of [[structure]]d levels that describe how well the behaviors, practices and processes of an organization can reliably and sustainably produce required outcomes.
A maturity model may provide, for example :
* a place to start
* the benefit of a community’s prior experiences
* a common language and a shared vision
* a framework for prioritizing actions.
* a way to define what improvement means for your organization.

A maturity model can be used as a benchmark for comparison and as an aid to understanding - for example, for comparative assessment of different organizations where there is something in common that can be used as a basis for comparison. In the case of the CMM, for example, the basis for comparison would be the organizations' software development processes.

===Structure===
The Capability Maturity Model involves the following aspects:
* ''Maturity Levels:'' a 5-level process maturity continuum - where the uppermost (5th) level is a notional ideal state where processes would be systematically managed by a combination of process optimization and continuous process improvement.
* ''Key Process Areas:'' a Key Process Area (KPA) identifies a cluster of related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of goals considered important.
* ''Goals:'' the goals of a key process area summarize the states that must exist for that key process area to have been implemented in an effective and lasting way. The extent to which the goals have been accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization has established at that maturity level. The goals signify the scope, boundaries, and intent of each key process area.
* ''Common Features:'' common features include practices that implement and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of common features: commitment to Perform, Ability to Perform, Activities Performed, Measurement and Analysis, and Verifying Implementation.
* ''Key Practices:'' The key practices describe the elements of infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the implementation and institutionalization of the KPAs.

===Levels===
There are five levels defined along the continuum of the CMM and, according to the SEI: &quot;Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the empirical evidence to date supports this belief.&quot;

# Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point for use of a new process.
# Managed - the process is managed in accordance with agreed metrics.
# Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business process, and decomposed to levels 0, 1 and 2 (the latter being Work Instructions).
# Quantitatively managed
# Optimizing - process management includes deliberate process optimization/improvement.

Within each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas (KPAs) which characterise that level, and for each KPA there are five definitions identified:
# Goals
# Commitment
# Ability
# Measurement
# Verification

The KPAs are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing — as they do — the stages that organizations must go through on the way to becoming mature.

The CMM provides a theoretical continuum along which process maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next. Skipping levels is not allowed/feasible.

N.B.: The CMM was originally intended as a tool to evaluate the ability of government contractors to perform a contracted software project. It has been used for and may be suited to that purpose, but critics pointed out that process maturity according to the CMM was not necessarily mandatory for successful software development. There were/are real-life examples where the CMM was arguably irrelevant to successful software development, and these examples include many ''shrinkwrap'' companies (also called ''commercial-off-the-shelf'' or &quot;COTS&quot; firms or ''software package'' firms). Such firms would have included, for example, Claris, Apple, Symantec, Microsoft, and Lotus. Though these companies may have successfully developed their software, they would not necessarily have considered or defined or managed their processes as the CMM described as level 3 or above, and so would have fitted level 1 or 2 of the model. This did not - on the face of it - frustrate the successful development of their software.

; Level 1 - ''Initial (Chaotic)'': It is characteristic of processes at this level that they are (typically) undocumented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ''ad hoc'', uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the processes.

; Level 2 - ''Repeatable'': It is characteristic of processes at this level that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be rigorous, but where it exists it may help to ensure that existing processes are maintained during times of stress.

; Level 3 - ''Defined'': It is characteristic of processes at this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place (i.e., they are the AS-IS processes) and used to establish consistency of process performance across the organization.

; Level 4 - ''Managed'': It is characteristic of processes at this level that, using process metrics, management can effectively control the AS-IS process (e.g., for software development ). In particular, management can identify ways to adjust and adapt the process to particular projects without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications. Process Capability is established from this level.

; Level 5 - ''Optimizing'': It is a characteristic of processes at this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological changes/improvements.

At maturity level 5, processes are concerned with addressing statistical ''common causes'' of process variation and changing the process (for example, to shift the mean of the process performance) to improve process performance. This would be done at the same time as maintaining the likelihood of achieving the established quantitative process-improvement objectives.

===Software process framework===
The software process framework documented is intended to guide those wishing to assess an organization/projects consistency with the CMM. For each maturity level there are five checklist types:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

The number '''centillion''' refers to different quantities based on locality of usage.

== North American system ==
* In [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[United States|U.S.]] usage, two centillion is 10&lt;sup&gt;303&lt;/sup&gt;+10&lt;sup&gt;303&lt;/sup&gt;.
* While [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] traditionally employed the European usage, recently they have largely switched to the U.S. version.

10&lt;sup&gt;303&lt;/sup&gt; is a thousand times more than a [[novemnonagintillion]].
10&lt;sup&gt;303&lt;/sup&gt; is a thousandth of an [[Names of large numbers#Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers|uncentillion]].

10&lt;sup&gt;303&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[quinquagintilliard]], or a thousand [[quinquagintillion]], in the European system.

It is believed to be the largest number with a conventional name, and the second largest named number after [[googolplex]], discounting such curiosities as millillion (10&lt;sup&gt;3003&lt;/sup&gt;) which, though not officially accepted, are legitimately coined and widely used in some circles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

== European system ==
* In traditional [[Europe]]an usage, one centillion is 10&lt;sup&gt;600&lt;/sup&gt;.

10&lt;sup&gt;600&lt;/sup&gt; is a thousand times more than a [[novemnonagintilliard]].
10&lt;sup&gt;600&lt;/sup&gt; is a thousandth of a [[centilliard]].

'''RDX''', an [[initialism]] for Research Department Explosive, is an [[explosive]] [[nitroamine]] widely used in military and industrial applications. It is also known less commonly as '''cyclonite''', '''hexogen''' (particularly in German and German-influenced languages), and '''T4'''.  Its chemical name is '''cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine'''; variants include '''cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine''' and '''cyclotrimethylene trinitramine'''.

In its pure, synthesized state RDX is a white, crystalline solid. As an explosive, it is usually used in mixtures with other explosives and [[plasticizer]]s, [[phlegmatized|phlegmatizer]]s or desensitizers. It is stable in storage and is considered one of the most powerful and [[brisance|brisant]] of the military high explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=TM 9-1300-214|publisher=US Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==

RDX is also known, but less commonly, as cyclonite, hexogen (particularly in German and German-influenced languages), T4 and chemically as cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine. Tenney L Davis, writing in the USA in 1943, stated it was generally known in the USA as cyclonite; the Germans called it Hexogen, the Italians T4.&lt;ref name = Davis&gt;Davis (1943) Volume II.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the [[Royal Arsenal]], Woolwich, started investigating cyclonite as an explosive to use against German [[U-boat]]s that were being built with thicker hulls. Britain wanted an explosive that was more powerful than TNT. For security reasons, Britain termed cyclonite as &quot;Research Department Explosive&quot; (R. D. X.).&lt;ref name=&quot;MM-18&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term RDX appeared in the United States in 1946, but the name RDX is given without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=27, 42, 255&amp;ndash;259}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first public reference in the United Kingdom to the name RDX, or R.D.X. to use the official title, appeared in 1948; its authors were the Managing Chemist, [[ROF Bridgwater]], the Chemical Research and Development Department, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich]], and the Director of [[Royal Ordnance Factories]], Explosives; again, it was referred to as simply RDX.&lt;ref name = sfb&gt;{{Harvtxt|Simmons|Forster|Bowden|1948|Part II and III}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

RDX was widely used during [[World War II]], often in explosive mixtures with [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] such as [[Torpex]], [[Composition B]], Cyclotols, and H6. RDX was used in one of the first [[plastic explosive]]s. RDX is believed to have been used in many bomb plots including [[terrorist]] plots. The bombs used in the &quot;[[Operation Chastise|Dambusters Raid]]&quot; contained {{convert|6,600|lb}} of Torpex.&lt;ref&gt;John Sweetman, ''The Dambusters Raid'' (London: Cassell Military Paperbacks, 2002), p. 144).&lt;/ref&gt;

RDX forms the base for a number of common military explosives:

* [[Composition A]]: Granular explosive consisting of RDX and plasticizing wax. Such as, composition A-5 (RDX coated with 1.5% [[stearic acid]]) and composition A-3 (91% RDX coated with 9% wax)
* [[Composition B]]: Castable mixtures of RDX and [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]
* [[Composition C]]: The original composition C was used in World War II, but there have been subsequent variations including C-2, C-3, and [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]].  C-4 consists of RDX (91%), a plasticizer (which can be dioctyl adipate {DOA}, diethylhexyl, or dioctyl sebacate) (5.3%), a binder, which is usually polyisobutylene (2.1%), SAE 10 non-detergent motor oil (1.6%).
* [[Composition CH-6]]: 97.5% RDX, 1.5% calcium stearate, 0.5% polyisobutylene, and 0.5% graphite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hampton|1960}} describes the development of Composition CH-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Composition D]]:
* [[Cyclotol]]:
* [[HBX]]: Castable mixtures of RDX, TNT, powdered aluminium, and D-2 [[wax]] with calcium chloride
* [[Composition H-6|H-6]]: Castable mixture of RDX, TNT, powdered aluminum, and paraffin wax
* [[Semtex]]: (Trade name): Plastic demolition explosives containing RDX and [[PETN]] as major energetic components
* [[Torpex]]: 42% RDX, 40% TNT and 18% powdered aluminium
* [[PBX]]:  RDX is also used as a major component of many [[polymer-bonded explosive]]s (PBX). RDX-based PBX's typically consist of RDX and a polymer/co-polymer binder. Examples of RDX-based PBX formulations include, but are not limited to: PBX-9007, PBX-9010, PBX-9205, PBX-9407, PBX-9604, PBXN-106, PBXN-3, PBXN-6, PBXN-10, PBXN-201, PBX-0280, PBX Type I, PBXC-116, PBXAF-108, etc.

Outside of military applications, RDX is also used in [[controlled demolition]] to raze structures.  The demolition of the [[Jamestown Bridge]] in the U.S. state of [[Rhode Island]] is one example where RDX [[shaped charge]]s were used to remove the span.

== Properties ==

The [[Explosive velocity|velocity of detonation]] of RDX at a density of 1.76 g/cm³ is 8750&amp;nbsp;m/s.

It is a colourless solid, of maximum theoretical density 1.82 g/cm³. It is obtained by reacting concentrated [[nitric acid]] with [[hexamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Luo, K.-M., Lin, S.-H., Chang, J.-G., Huang, T.-H. |title=Evaluations of kinetic parameters and critical runaway conditions in the reaction system of hexamine-nitric acid to produce RDX in a non-isothermal batch reactor |journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=119–127 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0950-4230(01)00027-4 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[heterocycle]] and has the molecular shape of a ring. It starts to decompose at about 170 °C and melts at 204 °C. Its structural formula is: hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine or (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

At [[room temperature]], it is very stable. It burns rather than explodes and detonates only with a [[detonator]], being unaffected even by [[small arms]] fire. (This is one of the properties that make it a useful military explosive.)  It is less sensitive than pentaerythritol tetranitrate ([[PETN]]). However, it is very sensitive when crystallized, below −4 °C.
Under normal conditions, RDX has a [[figure of insensitivity]] of exactly 80 (RDX defines the reference point.).

RDX [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] in [[vacuum]], which limits its use in [[pyrotechnic fastener]]s for [[spacecraft]].

RDX when exploded in air has about 1.5 times the explosive power of TNT per unit weight and about 2.0 times per unit volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Elderfield|1960|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baxter-257&amp;259&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=257 &amp; 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

RDX was used by both sides in [[World War II]]. The U.S. produced about {{convert|15000|LT|tonne}} per month during WW II and Germany about {{convert|7000|LT|tonne}} per month.&lt;ref name=Urbanski-78&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDX had the major advantages of possessing greater explosive power than [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] used in the First World War, and requiring no additional raw materials for its manufacture.&lt;ref name=Urbanski-78/&gt;

=== Germany ===

The discovery of RDX dates from 1898 when Georg Friedrich Henning obtained a [[Germany|German]] [[patent]] (patent No. 104280) for its manufacture, by [[nitration|nitrating]] hexamine nitrate (hexamethylenetetramine nitrate) with concentrated nitric acid.&lt;ref name=urbanski&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=77–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 1898 patent, its properties as a medical compound were mentioned; however, three further German patents obtained by Henning in 1916 proposed its use in [[smokeless propellant]]s.&lt;ref name=urbanski/&gt; The German military started investigating its use in 1920 and referred to it as hexogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gartz&quot;&gt;http://www.economypoint.org/h/hexogen.html apparently citing {{Harvtxt|Gartz|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research and development findings were not published further until Edmund von Herz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|p=125}} credits &quot;G. C. V. Herz&quot; for the patent, but the patentee is Edmund von Herz.&lt;/ref&gt; described as an Austrian and later a German citizen, obtained a British patent in 1921&lt;ref name=Herz-British&gt;{{Harvtxt|von Herz|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[U.S.]] patent in 1922.&lt;ref name=Herz-US&gt;{{Harvtxt|von Herz|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both patent claims were initiated in Austria; and described the manufacture of RDX by nitrating [[hexamethylenetetramine]].&lt;ref name=Herz-British/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herz-US/&gt; The British patent claims included the manufacture of RDX by nitration, its use with or without other explosives, and its use as a bursting charge and as a initiator.&lt;ref name=Herz-British/&gt; The U.S. patent claim was for the use of a hollow explosive device containing RDX and a detonator cap containing RDX.&lt;ref name=Herz-US/&gt;  In the 1930s, Germany developed improved production methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gartz&quot;/&gt;

During the Second World War, Germany used the code names W Salt, SH Salt, K-method, the E-method and the KA-method. These represented the names of the developers of the various chemical processes used to prepare RDX. The W-method was developed by Wolfram in 1934 and gave RDX the code name &quot;W-Salz&quot;. It used [[sulphamic acid]], formaldehyde and nitric acid.&lt;ref name=urbanski-W&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=107&amp;ndash;109}}&lt;/ref&gt; SH-Salz (SH salt) was from Schnurr who developed a batch-process in 1937&amp;ndash;38 based on nitrating hexamine.&lt;ref name=urbanski-SH&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=104&amp;ndash;105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The K-method was from Knõffler and was based on adding ammonium nitrate to the hexamine / nitric acid process.&lt;ref name=urbanski-K&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=105&amp;ndash;107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The E-method was developed by Ebele, in Germany, and turned out to be identical to the Ross and Schiessler process described later.&lt;ref name=urbanski-E&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=109&amp;ndash;110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KA-method was developed by Knöffler, in Germany, and turned out to be identical to the Bachmann process described later.&lt;ref name=urbanski-KA&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=111&amp;ndash;113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===
In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), RDX was manufactured from 1933 by the Research Department in a pilot plant at the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]], [[London]]; a larger pilot plant being built at the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|RGPF Waltham Abbey]] just outside London in 1939.&lt;ref name=cocroft&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cocroft|2000|pp=210&amp;ndash;211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Akhavan|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 a twin-unit industrial-scale plant was designed to be installed at a new {{convert|700|acre|ha}} site, [[ROF Bridgwater]], away from [[London]]; and production of RDX started at Bridgwater on one unit in August 1941.&lt;ref name=cocroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=hornby&gt;{{harvtxt|Hornby|1958|pages=112&amp;ndash;114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROF Bridgwater plant brought in ammonia and methanol as raw materials: the methanol was converted to formaldehyde and some of the ammonia converted to nitric acid, which was concentrated for RDX production.&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; The rest of the ammonia was reacted with formaldehyde to produce hexamine. The hexamine plant was supplied by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]]; and it incorporated some features based on data obtained from the United States (U.S.).&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; RDX was produced by continually adding hexamine and concentrated nitric acid to a cooled mixture of hexamine and nitric acid in the nitrator.&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; The RDX was purified and processed for its intended use; and recovery and reuse of some methanol and nitric acid was also carried out.&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; The hexamine-nitration and RDX purification plants were duplicated (i.e. twin-unit) to provide some insurance against loss of production due to fire, explosion or air attack.&lt;ref name=cocroft/&gt;

The United Kingdom and [[British Empire]] were fighting without allies against [[Nazi Germany]] until the middle of 1941 and had to be [[self-sufficient]]. At that time (1941), the UK had the capacity to produce {{convert|70|LT|tonne}} &lt;!-- {{convert|71000|kg|lb}} --&gt;(160,000&amp;nbsp;lb) of RDX per week; both [[Canada]], an allied country and former self-governing dominion of the British Empire, and the U.S. were looked upon to supply ammunition and explosives, including RDX.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=253–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942 the [[Royal Air Force]]'s annual requirement was forecast to be {{convert|52000|LT|tonne}} of RDX, much of which came from North America (Canada and the U.S.).&lt;ref name=hornby/&gt;

=== Canada ===

A different method of production to the Woolwich process, was found and used in Canada, possibly at the [[McGill University]] Department of Chemistry. This was based on reacting paraformaldehyde and ammonium nitrate in [[acetic anhydride]].&lt;ref name=Gilman&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gilman|1953|page=985}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK patent application was made by Robert Walter Schiessler, Pennsylvania State College and James Hamilton Ross, at McGill, Canada, in May 1942 and the UK patent was issued in December 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schiessler|Ross|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman states that the same method of production had been independently discovered by Ebele in Germany prior to Schiessler and Ross, but that this was not known by the Allies.&lt;ref name=urbanski/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilman/&gt; Urbański provides details of five methods of production: this is listed as the (German) E-method.&lt;ref name=urbanski-E/&gt;

=== UK, U.S. and Canadian production and development ===

At the beginning of the 1940s, the major U.S. explosive manufacturers, [[duPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company]] and [[Hercules Inc.|Hercules]] had several decades of experience of manufacturing [[Trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) and had no wish to experiment with new explosives; a view also held by the U.S. Army Ordnance, who proposed to continue using TNT.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-254&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDX had been tested by [[Picatinny Arsenal]] in 1929 and it was regarded as too expensive and too sensitive.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The Navy proposed to continue using [[ammonium picrate]].&lt;ref name=baxter-253-254/&gt; In contrast, the view that new explosives were unnecessary was not shared by the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC), who had visited The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich.&lt;ref name=&quot;baxter-253-254&quot;/&gt; [[James B. Conant]], chairman of Division B, wished to involve academic research into this area. Conant therefore set up an Experimental Explosives Research Laboratory at the [[Bureau of Mines]], Bruceton, Pennsylvania using direct [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD) funding.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt;

In 1941, the UK's [[Tizard Mission]] visited the U.S. Army and Navy departments and part of the information handed over included details of the &quot;Woolwich&quot; method of manufacture of RDX and its stabilisation by mixing it with [[beeswax]].&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The UK was asking that the U.S. and Canada, combined, supply {{convert|220|ST|tonne}} &lt;!-- {{convert|200000|kg|lb}} --&gt; (440,000&amp;nbsp;lb) of RDX per day.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; A decision was taken by [[William H. P. Blandy]], Chief of the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] to adopt RDX for use in mines and [[torpedoe]]s.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; Given the immediate need for RDX, the U.S. Army Ordnance, at Blandy's request,  built a plant that just copied the equipment and process used at Woolwich.  The result was the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordinance Works]] run by E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This works had the largest nitric acid plant in the world, at that time.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The Woolwich process was expensive; it needed {{convert|11|lb}} of [[nitric acid#Grades|strong nitric acid]] for every pound of RDX.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM-13&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=13}} (These pages need to be checked. Page 13 may actually be page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1941, the NDRC was researching new processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM-13&quot;/&gt; The Woolwich or direct nitration process has at least two serious disadvantages: (1) it used large amounts of nitric acid and (2) at least one-half of the formaldehyde is lost.  One mole of hexamethylenetetramine could produce at most one mole of RDX.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder-6&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Elderfield|1960|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least three laboratories with no previous explosive experience were tasked to develop better production methods for RDX; they were based at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Michigan University|Michigan]] and [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] universities.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These were not the only laboratories to work on RDX, Gilman's 1953 account of the Ross-Schiessler method was based on unpublished work from laboratories at the Universities of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Harvard, Vanderbilt, McGill (Canada), Bristol (UK), Sheffield (UK), Pennsylvania State College and the UK's Research Department.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Emmanuel Bachmann]], from Michigan, successfully developed the &quot;combination process&quot; by combining the Canadian process with direct nitration.&lt;ref name=urbanski-KA/&gt;&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The combination process required large quantities of acetic anhydride instead of nitric acid in the old British &quot;Woolwich process&quot;.  Ideally, the combination process could produce two moles of RDX from each mole of hexamethylenetetramine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder-6&quot;/&gt;

Vast increases in production of RDX could not continue to rely on the use of the beeswax, first used in the Woolwich process, to desensitize the RDX. A substitute based on petroleum was developed at the Bruceton Explosives Research Laboratory.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt;

==== Bachmann process ====

The NDRC tasked three companies to develop pilot plants. They were the Western Cartridge Company, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company and [[Eastman Chemical Company|Tennessee Eastman Company]], part of Eastman Kodak.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The Eastman Chemical Company (TEC), [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], [[Tennessee]], a leading manufacturer of acetic anhydride, [[Werner Emmanuel Bachmann]] successfully developed a continuous-flow manufacturing process for RDX. RDX was crucial to the war effort and the current batch-production process could not keep up. In February 1942, TEC built the Wexler Bend pilot plant and began producing small amounts of RDX. This led to the U.S. government authorizing TEC to design and build [[Holston Ordnance Works]] (H.O.W.) in June 1942. By April 1943, RDX was being manufactured there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bachmann|Sheehan|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1944, the Holston plant and the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordinance Works]] (which used the Woolwich process) were making {{convert|25000|ST|tonne}} (50 million pounds) of [[Composition B]] per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Bachmann process for RDX was found to be richer in [[HMX]] than the United Kingdom's RDX. This later led to a RDX plant using the Bachmann process being set up at ROF Bridgwater in 1955, to produce both RDX and HMX.

=== Military compositions ===

The United Kingdom's intention in World War II was to use &quot;desensitised&quot; RDX: in the original Woolwich process RDX coated with beeswax, but changed to a RDX coated with petroleum-based product, based on the work carried out at Bruceton. In the event the UK was unable to obtain sufficient RDX to meet its needs.&lt;ref name=hornby/&gt; Some of this shortfall was met by substituting a mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT.&lt;ref name=hornby/&gt;

[[Karl Dönitz]] was reputed to have claimed that &quot;an aircraft can no more kill a U-boat than a crow can kill a [[Mole (animal)|mole]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Baxter-42&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by May 1942 [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bombers]] began to deploy [[depth charge]]s containing [[Torpex]], a mixture of RDX, TNT and aluminium, which had up to 50 percent more destructive power than TNT-filled depth charges.&lt;ref name=Baxter-42/&gt; Considerable quantities of the RDX–TNT mixture were produced at the Holston Ordnance Works, with [[Tennessee Eastman]] developing an automated mixing and cooling process based around the use of stainless steel [[conveyor belt]]s.&lt;ref name=baxter-257&amp;259/&gt;

=== Terrorism ===

[[Ahmed Ressam]], the [[al-Qaeda]] Millennium Bomber, used a small quantity of RDX as one of the components in the explosives that he prepared to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on [[New Year's Eve]] 1999/2000; the combined explosives could have produced a blast forty times greater than that of a devastating [[car bomb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;febninth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/US_v_Ressam_9thcircuitappeals0210.pdf|title=U.S. v.

RDX was main component used for the [[11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings|2006 Mumbai train bombings]] and the [[Jaipur bombings]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2062187.cms |title=Mumbai |publisher=The Times of India |date=Oct 2, 2006 |first1=Anil |last1=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jaipur blasts: RDX used, HuJI suspected|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-05-14/india/27777786_1_serial-blasts-jaipur-blasts-sufi-shrine|accessdate=13 May 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=May 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed to be the explosive in the [[2010 Moscow Metro bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8593961.stm |title=Moscow Metro bombing masterminds 'will be destroyed' |publisher=BBC News |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christianity}}

Although '''[[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]''' share historical roots, [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|these two religions diverged in the first centuries]]. Judaism primarily places emphasis on [[Orthopraxy#Judaism|correct actions (or ''orthopraxy'')]], focusing primarily on how to respond to the [[Mosaic Covenant]] [[God in Judaism|God]] made with the [[Israelites]], as recorded in the [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;The Torah also includes instructions for [[Proselytes]] and the Talmud also includes instructions for [[Noachides]], who are not [[children of Israel]], but these are not topics of primary focus for Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity places emphasis on [[orthodoxy|correct belief (or ''orthodoxy'')]], focusing on response to the [[New Covenant]] that [[God in Christianity|God]] made through [[Jesus]], with some [[Christian denominations|denominations]] believing that salvation comes not by any human action, but by [[Sola fide|faith alone (''sola fide'')]] and [[Sola gratia|God's action]]. In other words, Jews participate in collective rituals that express their nation's covenant with God.  Christians obtain [[individual salvation]] through [[Repentance|repenting]] of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and receiving Jesus Christ as their [[God in Christianity|Lord]] and [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Savior]]. 

This article only considers the [[Rabbinic Judaism|mainstream Jewish]] views, in contrast to [[Karaite Judaism]].

==Self-identification==
Judaism's purpose is to carry out what it holds to be the only [[Covenant (biblical)#Mosaic covenant|Covenant]] between [[God in Judaism|God]] and the [[Jewish people]]. The Torah (lit. &quot;teaching&quot;), both [[Torah|written]] and [[Oral Torah|oral]], tell the story of this covenant, and provides Jews with the terms of the covenant. The Oral Torah is the primary guide for Jews to abide by these terms, as expressed in tractate Gittin 60b, &quot;the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not make His covenant with [[Israel]] except by virtue of the Oral Law&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chief Rabbi of the Commonwealth, Dr. [[Immanuel Jakobovits]] in the Forward to, Schimmel, H. Chaim, ''The Oral Law: A study of the rabbinic contribution to Torah she-be-al-peh'', 2nd rev.ed., Feldheim Publishers, New York, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to help them learn how to live a holy life, and to bring holiness, peace and love into the world and into every part of life, so that life may be elevated to a high level of [[kedushah]], originally through study and practice of the Torah, and since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]], through prayer as expressed in tractate Sotah 49a &quot;Since the destruction of the Temple, every day is more cursed than the preceding one; and the existence of the world is assured only by the kedusha...and the words spoken after the study of Torah.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Louis, God, in Arthur A. Cohen, Paul Mendes-Flohr, ''20th Century Jewish Religious Thought: Original Essays on Critical Concepts'', Jewish Publication Society, 2009, p.394 cited in Elie Munk. The World of Prayer 1 (1961), p.182.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the adoption of the [[Amidah]], the accnowledgement of God through the declaration from Yishayah 6:3 &quot;Kadosh [holy], kadosh, kadosh, is HaShem, Master of Legions; the whole world is filled with His glory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scherman Nosson &amp; Zlotowitz, Meir, eds., TANACH: The Torah, Prophets, Writings, The Twenty-Four Books of the Bible Newly Translated and Annotated, Mesorah Publications, Ltd., Brooklyn, 1996, p.963&lt;/ref&gt; as a replacement for the study of Torah, which is a daily obligation for a Jew,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Louis, God, in Arthur A. Cohen, Paul Mendes-Flohr, ''20th Century Jewish Religious Thought: Original Essays on Critical Concepts'', Jewish Publication Society, 2009, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and sanctifies God in itself. This continuous maintenance of relationship between the individual Jew and God through either study, or prayer repeated trice daily, is the confirmation of the original covenant. This allows the Jewish people as a community to strive and fulfill the prophecy &quot;I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand and keep you. And I will establish you as a Covenant of the people, for a light unto the nations.&quot; ({{bibleverse||Isa|42:6|HE}} (i.e., a [[role model]]) over the course of history, and a part of the divine intent of bringing about an [[Kingdom of God#Judaism|age of peace and sanctity]] where ideally a faithful life and good deeds should be ends in themselves, not means. See also [[Jewish principles of faith]].

The self-described purpose of Christianity is to provide people with what it holds to be the only valid path to [[salvation]] as announced by the [[apostles]] of what the [[Book of Acts]] describes as, ''The Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|9:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|19:9|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|23|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|22:4|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|24:14|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|22|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in [[gentile]] (non-Jewish) settings is The Way referred to as [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|11:26|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|26:28|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christian theologian]] [[Alister McGrath]], the [[Jewish Christians]] affirmed every aspect of then contemporary [[Second Temple Judaism]] with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the messiah,&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E., Christianity: An Introduction. Blackwell Publishing (2006). ISBN 1-4051-0899-1. Page 174: &quot;In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief—that Jesus is the Messiah. Unless males were [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]], they could not be saved ({{bibleverse||Acts|15:1}}).&quot;;see also [[Paleo-orthodoxy]]&lt;/ref&gt; with Isaiah 49:6, &quot;an explicit parallel to 42:6&quot; quoted by Paul in Acts 13:47&lt;ref&gt;Beale, Gregory K., Other Religions in New Testament Theology, in David Weston Baker, ed., ''Biblical faith and other religions: an evangelical assessment'', Kregel Academic, 2004, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; and reinterpreted by [[Justin the Martyr]].&lt;ref&gt;McKeehan, James, ''An Overview of the Old Testament and How It Relates to the New Testament'', iUniverse, 2002, p.265&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christian writers, most notably Paul, the Bible teaches that people are, in their current state, [[sin]]ful,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|3:23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Testament]] reveals that Jesus is both the [[Son of man]] and the [[Son of God]], united in the [[hypostatic union]], [[God the Son]], [[God in Christianity|God]] made [[incarnate]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|1:1}}, {{bibleverse||John|1:14}}, {{bibleverse||John|1:29}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' death by crucifixion]] was a [[Atonement in Christianity|sacrifice to atone]] for all humanity's sins, and that acceptance of Jesus as [[Christian soteriology|Savior]] and [[Hæland|Lord]] saves one from [[Divine Judgment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|5:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving [[Eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|3:16|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is the mediator of the [[New Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hebrews|8:6|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; His famous [[Sermon on the Mount]] is considered by some Christian scholars&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Expounding of the Law#Antithesis of the Law|Antithesis of the Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; to be the proclamation of the [[Ethics in religion#Christian ethics|New Covenant ethics]], in [[Typology (theology)|contrast]] to the [[Mosaic Covenant]] of [[Moses]] from [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. See also [[Christian theology]].

==National versus universal==
{{Main|Ethnic religion|Major religious groups}}
The subject of the [[Tanakh]], or Hebrew Bible, is the history of the [[Children of Israel]], especially in terms of their relationship with [[God in Judaism|God]]. Thus, Judaism has also been characterized as a culture or as a civilization. The founder of the Reconstructionist Movement, Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]] defines Judaism as an evolving religious civilization. One crucial sign of this is that one need not believe, or even do, anything to be Jewish; the historic definition of 'Jewishness' requires only that one be born of a Jewish mother, or that one [[Conversion to Judaism|convert to Judaism]] in accord with [[halakha|Jewish law]]. (Today, [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist Jews]] also include those born of Jewish fathers and Gentile mothers if the children are raised as Jews.)

To many religious [[Jew]]s, Jewish ethnicity is closely tied to their relationship with God, and thus has a strong theological component. This relationship is encapsulated in the notion that Jews are a [[chosen people]]. For strictly observant Jews, being &quot;chosen&quot; fundamentally means that it was God's wish that a group of people would exist in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]], and would be bound to obey a certain set of laws as a duty of their covenant, and that the Children of Israel ''chose'' to enter into this covenant with God. They view their divine purpose as being ideally a &quot;light upon the nations&quot; and a &quot;holy people&quot; (i.e., a people who live their lives fully in accordance with Divine will as an example to others), not &quot;the one path to God&quot;. For Jews, salvation comes from God, freely given, and observance of the Law is one way of responding to God's grace.

Jews hold that other nations and peoples are not required (nor expected) to obey the [[613 Commandments|Law of Moses]], with the notable exception that the only laws Judaism believes are automatically binding (in order to be assured of a place in the [[Olam Haba|world to come]]) on other nations are known as the [[Noahide Laws|Seven Laws of Noah]]. Thus, as an [[ethnic religion]], Judaism holds that others may have their own, different, paths to God (or holiness, or &quot;salvation&quot;), as long as they are consistent with the ''Seven Laws of Noah''.

While ethnicity and culture play a large part in Jewish identity, they are not the only way Jews define themselves as Jews. There are secular Jews, who do use ethnicity and culture as their defining criteria. And there are religious Jews, who do not. Rather, religious Jews define their Jewishness within the context of their Judaism. In this context, a religious convert could &quot;feel&quot; more Jewish than a secular ethnic Jew. While Rabbi Kaplan defines Judaism as a civilization, there are many who would not agree, citing millennia of religious tradition and observance as more than simple civilization. Most observant Jews would say that Judaism is a love story.

Judaism and Christianity share the belief that there is One, True God, who is the only one worthy to be worshipped. Judaism sees this One, True God as a singular, ineffable, undefinable being. Phrases such as &quot;Ground of All Being,&quot; &quot;Unfolding Reality&quot; and &quot;Creator and Sustainer of Life&quot; capture only portions of who God is to Jews. While God does not change, our perception of God does, and so, Jews are open to new experiences of God's presence. Christianity, with a few exceptions, sees the One, True God as having triune personhood: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus) and God the Holy Spirit. God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, so Christians generally look to the Scriptures (both Hebrew and Christian) for an understanding of who God is.

Christianity is characterized by its [[Christian Universalism|claim to universality]], which marks a significant break from current Jewish identity and thought, but has its roots in [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Christians believe that Jesus represents the fulfillment of [[Abrahamic covenant|God's promise to Abraham and the nation of Israel]], that Israel would be a blessing to all nations. Some Christians believe that the Law was &quot;completed&quot; by Jesus and has become irrelevant to [[Faith in Christianity|&quot;faith life&quot;]], for details see [[Biblical law in Christianity]]. Although Christians generally believe their religion to be very inclusive (since not only Jews but all gentiles can be Christian), Jews see Christianity as highly exclusive, because some denominations view non-Christians (such as Jews and Pagans) as having an incomplete or imperfect relationship with God, and therefore excluded from grace, salvation, or heaven. For most Christians, it is the stated or &quot;confessed&quot; belief in Jesus as Savior that makes God's grace available to an individual, and salvation can come no other way ([[Solus Christus]] in Protestantism, [[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] in Catholicism, see [[Dual covenant theology]] for a dissenting view).

This crucial difference between the two religions has other implications. For example, while in a [[conversion to Judaism]] a convert must accept basic Jewish principles of faith, and renounce all other religions, the process is more like a form of adoption, or changing national citizenship (i.e. becoming a formal member of the people, or tribe), with the convert becoming a &quot;child of Abraham and Sarah.&quot; For many reasons, some historical and some religious, Judaism does not encourage its members to convert others and in fact would require the initiative from the person who would like to convert. In contrast, most Christian denominations actively seek converts, following the [[Great Commission]], and [[conversion to Christianity]] is generally a [[credo|declaration of faith]] (although some denominations view it specifically as adoption into a community of Christ, and orthodox Christian tradition views it as being a literal joining together of the members of Christ's body).

Both Christianity and Judaism have been affected by the diverse cultures of their respective members. For example, what Jews from Eastern Europe and from North Africa consider &quot;Jewish food&quot; has more in common with the cuisines of non-Jewish Eastern Europeans and North Africans than with each other, although for religious Jews all food-preparation must conform to the same laws of [[Kashrut]]. According to non-Orthodox Jews and critical historians, Jewish law too has been affected by surrounding cultures (for example, some scholars argue that the establishment of absolute [[monotheism]] in Judaism was a reaction against the [[dualism]] of [[Zoroastrianism]] that Jews encountered when [[Yehud Medinata|living under Persian rule]]; Jews rejected [[polygamy]] during the Middle Ages, influenced by their Christian neighbors). According to Orthodox Jews too there are variations in Jewish custom from one part of the world to another. It was for this reason that [[Joseph Karo|Joseph Karo's]] [[Shulchan Aruch]] did not become established as the authoritative code of Jewish law until after [[Moshe Isserlis]] added his commentary, which documented variations in local custom.

==Sacred texts==
{{Main|Development of the Jewish Bible canon|Development of the Christian Biblical canon}}

The [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] is composed of three parts; the [[Torah]] (Instruction, the [[Septuagint]] translated the Hebrew to ''nomos'' or ''Law''), the [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets) and the [[Ketuvim]] (Writings). Collectively, these are known as the [[Tanakh]]. According to [[Rabbinic Judaism]] the Torah was revealed by God to Moses; within it, Jews find [[613 Mitzvot]] (commandments).

Rabbinic tradition asserts that God revealed two Torahs to Moses, one that was written down, and one that was transmitted orally. Whereas the written Torah has a fixed form, the [[Oral Torah]] is a living tradition that includes not only specific supplements to the written Torah (for instance, what is the proper manner of ''[[shechita]]'' and what is meant by &quot;Frontlets&quot; in the [[Shema]]), but also procedures for understanding and talking about the written Torah (thus, the Oral Torah revealed at Sinai includes debates among rabbis who lived long after Moses). The Oral Law elaborations of narratives in the Bible and stories about the rabbis are referred to as ''[[aggadah]]''. It also includes elaboration of the 613 commandments in the form of laws referred to as ''[[halakha]]''. Elements of the Oral Torah were committed to writing and edited by [[Judah HaNasi]] in the [[Mishnah]] in 200 CE; much more of the Oral Torah were committed to writing in the [[Babylonian Talmud|Babylonian]] and [[Jerusalem Talmud]]s, which were edited around 600 CE and 450 CE, respectively. The Talmuds are notable for the way they combine law and lore, for their explication of the [[midrash]]ic method of interpreting tests, and for their accounts of debates among rabbis, which preserve divergent and conflicting interpretations of the Bible and legal rulings.

Since the transcription of the Talmud, notable rabbis have compiled law codes that are generally held in high regard: the [[Mishneh Torah]], the [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]], and the [[Shulchan Aruch]]. The latter, which was based on earlier codes and supplemented by the commentary by [[Moshe Isserles]] that notes other practices and customs practiced by Jews in different communities, especially among Ashkenazim, is generally held to be authoritative by Orthodox Jews. The [[Zohar]], which was written in the 13th century, is generally held as the most important esoteric treatise of the Jews.

All contemporary Jewish movements consider the Tanakh, and the Oral Torah in the form of the Mishnah and Talmuds as sacred, although movements are divided as to claims concerning their divine revelation, and also their authority. For Jews, the Torah - written and oral - is the primary guide to the relationship between God and man, a living document that has unfolded and will continue to unfold whole new insights over the generations and millennia. A saying that captures this goes, &quot;Turn it [the Torah's words] over and over again, for everything is in it.&quot;

Christians accept the Written Torah and other books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as [[Scripture]], although they generally give readings from the [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] translation instead of the [[Biblical Hebrew]]/[[Biblical Aramaic]] [[Masoretic Text]]. Two notable examples are:
* [[Isaiah 7:14]] -- &quot;virgin&quot; instead of &quot;young woman&quot;
* [[They have pierced my hands and my feet|Psalm 22]] -- &quot;they have pierced my hands and feet&quot; instead of &quot;like a lion, (they are at) my hands and feet&quot;

Instead of the traditional Jewish order and names for the books, Christians organize and name the books closer to that found in the Septuagint. Some Christian denominations (such as Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox), include a number of books that are not in the Hebrew Bible (the [[biblical apocrypha]] or [[deuterocanonical books]] or ''Anagignoskomena'', see [[Development of the Old Testament canon]]) in their [[biblical canon]] that are not in today's Jewish canon, although they were included in the Septuagint. Christians reject the Jewish Oral Torah, which was still in oral, and therefore unwritten, form in the time of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=254&amp;letter=J&amp;search=Jesus Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus] notes: &quot;Jesus, however, does not appear to have taken into account the fact that the [[Halakah]] was at this period just becoming crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes of the [[Hillel the Elder|Bet Hillel]] and [[Shammai|Bet Shammai]] were occurring about the time of his maturity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Jesus depicted delivering the [[Sermon on the Mount]].]]
Christians believe that God has established a new covenant with people through Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, Epistles, and other books collectively called the New Testament (the word ''testament'' attributed to [[Tertullian]] is commonly interchanged with the word ''covenant'').&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the ''New Covenant'' is referred to as the [[New Testament]], on the basis of passages such as {{bibleverse||Heb|9:16|KJV}}, in its traditional ([[KJV]]) translation. This usage reflects the [[Vulgate]], in which the word &quot;covenant&quot; was translated ''testamentum''. Biblical scholars, such as O. Palmer Robertson, have argued against this translation, however, since the word ''testamentum'', in [[Latin]], expresses the concept of a &quot;last will,&quot; not an agreement between two parties sealed with a self-maledictory oath. See also [http://www.theopedia.com/Covenant Theopedia: &quot;Covenant&quot;] and [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=837&amp;letter=C&amp;search=Mosaic%20Covenant#2888 Jewish Encyclopedia: &quot;Covenant: The Old and the New Covenant&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; For some Christians, such as [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], this New Covenant includes authoritative [[Sacred Tradition]]s and [[Canon law]]. Others, especially [[Protestantism|Protestants]], reject the authority of such traditions and instead hold to the principle of ''[[sola scriptura]]'', which accepts only the Bible itself as the final rule of faith and practice. Additionally, some denominations include the &quot;oral teachings of Jesus to the Apostles&quot;, which they believe have been handed down to this day by [[Apostolic Succession]].

Christians refer to the Biblical books about Jesus as the New Testament, and to the canon of Hebrew books as the [[Old Testament]], terms associated with [[Supersessionism]]. Judaism does not accept the [[wikt:retronym|retronymic]] labeling of its [[scripture|sacred texts]] as the &quot;Old Testament,&quot; and some Jews refer to the New Testament as the Christian Testament or Christian Bible. Judaism rejects all claims that the Christian New Covenant [[supersessionism|supersedes]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogates]], fulfills, or is the unfolding or consummation of the covenant expressed in the Written and Oral Torahs. Therefore, just as Christianity does not accept that Mosaic Law has any authority over Christians, Judaism does not accept that the New Testament has any religious authority over Jews.

Many Jews view Christians as having quite an ambivalent view of the Torah, or Mosaic law: on one hand Christians speak of it as God's absolute word, but on the other, they apply its commandments with a certain selectivity (compare [[Biblical law in Christianity]]). Some Jews contend that Christians cite commandments from the Old Testament to support one point of view but then ignore other commandments of a similar class that are also of equal weight. Examples of this are certain commandments that God states explicitly shall abide &quot;for ever&quot; (for example {{bibleverse||Exo|31:16-17|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Exo|12:14-15|HE}}), or certain practices which God prohibits as [[Abomination (Bible)|abominations]], but which are not prohibited by most Christian denominations.

Christians explain that such selectivity is based on rulings made by early [[Jewish Christians]] in the [[Book of Acts]], at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], that, while believing gentiles did not need to fully convert to Judaism, they should follow some aspects of Torah like avoiding [[idolatry]] and [[fornication]] and [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|15:28-29}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, according to some interpretations, [[Homosexuality and Christianity|homosexuality]]. This view is also reflected by modern Judaism, in that [[Righteous Gentiles]] needn't convert to Judaism and need to observe only the [[Noahide Laws]], which also contain prohibitions against idolatry and fornication and blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah] states: &quot;[[Jacob Emden|R. Emden]] (), in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to &quot;Seder 'Olam&quot; (pp. 32b-34b, Hamburg, 1752), gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the gentiles to the [[Seven Laws of Noah|seven moral laws of Noah]] and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law—which explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the [[Biblical law in Christianity|laws of Moses]] and the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians agree that Jews who accept Jesus should still observe all of Torah, see for example [[Dual-covenant theology]], based on warnings by Jesus to Jews not to use him as an excuse to disregard it,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matt|5:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they support efforts of those such as Messianic Jews ([[Messianic Judaism]] is considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity&lt;ref name = &quot;Denominations&quot;&gt;

Churches that are indigenous have taken root in the soil and reflect, to some degree, the culture of their community...  The messianic congregation (is)... in this case indigenous to Jewish culture.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;) to do that, but some Protestant forms of Christianity oppose all observance to the Mosaic law, even by Jews, which [[Luther]] criticised as ''Antinomianism'', see [[Antinomianism#Antinomian Controversies in Lutheranism]] and [[Luther#Anti-Antinomianism]] for details.

A minority view in Christianity, known as [[Christian Torah-submission]], holds that the Mosaic law as it is written is binding on all followers of God under the New Covenant, even for Gentiles, because it views God’s commands as &quot;everlasting&quot; ({{bibleverse||Ps|119:152}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|119:160}}; {{bibleverse||Ex|12:24}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ex|29:9}}; {{bibleverse||Lev|16:29}}) and &quot;good&quot; ({{bibleverse||Neh|9:13}}; {{bibleverse||Ps|119:39}}; {{bibleverse||Rom|7:7-12}}).

==Concepts of God==
{{Main|God in Judaism|God in Christianity}}
Traditionally, both Judaism and Christianity believe in the [[God]] of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], for Jews the God of the [[Tanakh]], for Christians the God of the Old Testament, the [[Creator God|creator of the universe]]. Judaism and major sects of Christianity reject the view that God is entirely [[Immanence|immanent]] (although some see this as the concept of the Holy Ghost) and within the world as a physical presence, (although trinitarian Christians believe in the [[incarnation]] of God). Both religions reject the view that God is entirely [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], and thus separate from the world, as the pre-Christian Greek [[Unknown God]]. Both religions reject [[atheism]] on one hand and [[polytheism]] on the other.

Both religions agree that God shares both transcendent and immanent qualities. How these religions resolve this issue is where the religions differ. Christianity posits that God exists as a [[Trinity]]; in this view God exists as three distinct persons who share a single divine [[Ousia|essence]], or [[Consubstantiality|substance]]. In those three there is one, and in that one there are three; the one God is indivisible, while the three persons are distinct and unconfused, [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]]. It teaches that God became especially immanent in physical form through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of God the Son who was born as [[Jesus of Nazareth]], who is believed to be at once [[Hypostatic union|fully God and fully human]]. There are &quot;Christian&quot; sects that question one or more of these doctrines, however, see also [[Nontrinitarianism]]. By contrast, Judaism sees God as a [[Divine simplicity|single entity]], and views trinitarianism as both incomprehensible and a violation of the Bible's teaching that God is one. It rejects the notion that Jesus or any other object or living being could be 'God', that God could have a literal 'son' in physical form or is divisible in any way, or that God could be made to be joined to the [[Nature|material world]] in such fashion. Although Judaism provides Jews with a word to label God's transcendence (''[[Ein Sof]]'', without end) and immanence (''[[Shekhinah]]'', in-dwelling), these are merely human words to describe two ways of experiencing God; God is one and indivisible.

===Shituf===
{{Main|Shituf}}
A minority Jewish view, which appears in some codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]], is that while Christian worship is polytheistic (due to the multiplicity of the Trinity), it is permissible for them to swear in God's name, since they are referring to the one God. This theology is referred to in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as [[Shituf]] (literally &quot;partnership&quot; or &quot;association&quot;). Although worship of a trinity is considered to be not different from any other form of idolatry for Jews, it may be an acceptable belief for non-Jews (according to the ruling of some Rabbinic authorities).

==Right action==
===Faith versus good deeds===
{{See also|Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification|Biblical law in Christianity}}
Judaism teaches that the purpose of the Torah is to teach us how to act correctly. God's existence is a given in Judaism, and not something that most authorities see as a matter of required belief. Although some authorities see the Torah as commanding Jews to believe in God, Jews see belief in God as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a Jewish life. The quintessential verbal expression of Judaism is the [[Shema Yisrael]], the statement that the God of the Bible is their God, and that this God is unique and one. The quintessential physical expression of Judaism is behaving in accordance with the 613 Mitzvot (the commandments specified in the Torah), and thus live one's life in God's ways.

Thus fundamentally in Judaism, one is enjoined to bring holiness into life (with the guidance of God's laws), rather than removing oneself from life to be holy.

Much of Christianity also teaches that God wants people to perform good works, but all branches hold that good works alone will not lead to salvation, which is called [[Legalism (theology)|Legalism]]. The exception is [[Dual-covenant theology]]. Some Christian denominations hold that salvation depends upon transformational faith in Jesus, which expresses itself in good works as a testament (or witness) to ones faith for others to see (primarily Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism), while others (including most Protestants) hold that faith alone is necessary for salvation. However, the difference is not as great as it seems, because it really hinges on the [[Faith in Christianity|definition of &quot;faith&quot; used]]. The first group generally uses the term &quot;faith&quot; to mean &quot;intellectual and heartfelt assent and submission.&quot; Such a faith will not be salvific until a person has allowed it to effect a life transforming conversion (turning towards God) in their being (see [[Ontotheology]]). The Christians that hold to &quot;salvation by faith alone&quot; (also called by its Latin name &quot;[[sola fide]]&quot;) define faith as being implicitly [[ontological]]—mere intellectual assent is not termed &quot;faith&quot; by these groups. Faith, then, is life-transforming by definition.

===Sin===
{{Main|Jewish views of sin}}
In both religions, offenses against the will of God are called [[sin]]. These sins can be thoughts, words, or deeds.

Catholicism categorizes sins into various groups. A wounding of the relationship with God is often called [[venial sin]]; a complete rupture of the relationship with God is often called [[mortal sin]]. Without salvation from sin (see below), a person's separation from God is permanent, causing such a person to enter [[Hell]] in the afterlife. Both the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church define sin more or less as a &quot;macula,&quot; a spiritual stain or uncleanliness that constitutes damage to man's image and likeness of God.

Hebrew has several words for sin, each with its own specific meaning. The word ''pesha'', or &quot;trespass&quot;, means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word ''aveira'' means &quot;transgression&quot;. And the word ''avone'', or &quot;iniquity&quot;, means a sin done out of moral failing. The word most commonly translated simply as &quot;sin&quot;, ''het'', literally means &quot;to go astray.&quot; Just as Jewish law, ''halakha'' provides the proper &quot;way&quot; (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path. Judaism teaches that humans are born with [[freewill]], and morally neutral, with both a ''[[yetzer hatov]]'', (literally, &quot;the good inclination&quot;, in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a ''[[yetzer hara]]'', (literally &quot;the evil inclination&quot;, in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult. There is almost always a &quot;way back&quot; if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)

The rabbis recognize a positive value to the ''yetzer hara'': one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was &quot;very good&quot; (God's work on the preceding days was just described as &quot;good&quot;) and explain that without the yetzer ha'ra there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that yetzer ha'tov and yetzer ha'ra are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
In contrast to the Jewish view of being morally balanced, [[Original Sin]] refers to the idea that the sin of [[Adam and Eve]]'s disobedience (sin &quot;at the origin&quot;) has passed on a spiritual heritage, so to speak. Christians teach that human beings inherit a corrupted or damaged human nature in which the tendency to do bad is greater than it would have been otherwise, so much so that human nature would not be capable now of participating in the afterlife with God. This is not a matter of being &quot;guilty&quot; of anything; each person is only personally guilty of their own actual sins. However, this understanding of original sin is what lies behind the Christian emphasis on the need for spiritual salvation from a spiritual Saviour, who can forgive and set aside sin even though humans are not inherently pure and worthy of such salvation. [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] in Romans and I Corinthians placed special emphasis on this doctrine, and stressed that belief in Jesus would allow Christians to overcome death and attain salvation in the hereafter.

Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and some Protestants teach the Sacrament of [[Baptism]] is the means by which each person's damaged human nature is healed and [[Sanctifying Grace]] (capacity to enjoy and participate in the spiritual life of God) is restored. This is referred to as &quot;being born of water and the Spirit,&quot; following the terminology in the Gospel of St. John. Most Protestants believe this salvific grace comes about at the moment of personal decision to follow Jesus, and that baptism is a symbol of the grace already received.

===Love===
{{Main|Jewish theology of love}}
Although love is central to both Christianity and Judaism, literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] (in his ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'') argues that their notions of love are fundamentally different. Specifically, he links the Jewish conception of love to justice, and the Christian conception of love to [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].

As in English, the Hebrew word for &quot;love,&quot; ahavah אהבה, is used to describe intimate or romantic feelings or relationships, such as the love between parent and child in Genesis 22:2; 25: 28; 37:3; the love between close friends in I Samuel 18:2, 20:17; or the love between a young man and young woman in [[Song of Songs]]. Christians will often use the Septuigent to make distinctions between the types of love: ''filia'' for brotherly, ''eros'' for romantic and ''[[agape]]'' for self-sacrificing love.&lt;ref&gt;www.calvin.edu/~jks4/city/Oord~Defining%20Love.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many Jewish scholars and theologians, Bloom understands Judaism as fundamentally a religion of love. But he argues that one can understand the Hebrew conception of love only by looking at one of the core commandments of Judaism, Leviticus 19:18, &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself&quot;, also called the [[Great Commandment]]. Talmudic sages Hillel and [[Rabbi Akiva]] commented that this is a major element of the Jewish religion. Also, this commandment is arguably at the center of the Jewish faith. As the third book of the Torah, Leviticus is literally the central book. Historically, Jews have considered it of central importance: traditionally, children began their study of the Torah with Leviticus, and the midrashic literature on Leviticus is among the longest and most detailed of midrashic literature (see Bamberger 1981: 737). Bernard Bamberger considers Leviticus 19, beginning with God's commandment in verse 3—&quot;You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God, am holy&quot;—to be &quot;the climactic chapter of the book, the one most often read and quoted&quot; (1981:889). Leviticus 19:18 is itself the climax of this chapter.

===Abortion===
{{Main|Judaism and abortion}}
The only statements in the Tanakh about the status of a fetus state that killing an unborn infant does not have the same status as killing a born human being, and mandates a much lesser penalty (Exodus 21: 22-25).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Schiff, 2002,''Abortion in Judaism''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud states that the fetus is not yet a full human being until it has been born (either the head or the body is mostly outside of the woman), therefore killing a fetus is not murder, and [[abortion]] - in restricted circumstances - has always been legal under Jewish law. [[Rashi]], the great 12th century commentator on the Bible and Talmud, states clearly of the fetus ''lav nefesh hu''--it is not a person.' The Talmud contains the expression ''ubar yerech imo''--the fetus is as the thigh of its mother,' i.e., the fetus is deemed to be part and parcel of the pregnant woman's body.&quot; The Babylonian Talmud [[Yevamot]] 69b states that: &quot;the embryo is considered to be mere water until the fortieth day.&quot; Afterwards, it is considered subhuman until it is born. Christians who agree with these views may refer to this idea as abortion before the &quot;quickening&quot; of the fetus.

Two additional passages in the Talmud that shed some light on the Jewish belief that the fetus is considered part of the woman, and not a separate entity. One section states that if a man purchases a cow that is found to be pregnant, then he is the owner both of the cow and the calf that is born from it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Another states that if a pregnant woman converts to Judaism, that her conversion applies also to her fetus.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Judaism unilaterally supports, in fact [[Pikuach nefesh|mandates]], abortion if doctors believe that it is necessary to save the life of the woman. Many rabbinic authorities allow abortions on the grounds of gross genetic imperfections of the fetus. They also allow abortion if the woman were suicidal because of such defects. However, Judaism holds that abortion is impermissible for family planning or convenience reasons. Each case must be decided individually, however, and the decision should lie with the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her and their Rabbi.

Most branches of Christianity have historically held abortion to be generally wrong, referring to Old Testament passages such as Psalm 139 and Jeremiah 1, as well as New Testament passages concerning both Jesus and [[John the Baptist]] while they were ''in utero''. Also, the [[Didache]], an early Church document, explicitly forbids abortion along with [[infanticide]], both common practices in the [[Roman Empire]], as murder. The Catholic Church condemns abortion in all circumstances, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, &quot;Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception.&quot;(2270) Catholics who don't hold to this teaching are derided as [[Cafeteria Catholics]]. Many Protestant Christians claim that the [[Ten Commandments]] prohibit abortion under the heading of &quot;Do not murder&quot;. Others reject this view, as they hold that the context of the entire set of Biblical laws includes those laws that restrict them to already born human beings.

===War, violence and pacifism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
Jews and Christians accept as valid and binding many of the same moral principles taught in the Torah. There is a great deal of overlap between the ethical systems of these two faiths. Nonetheless, there are some highly significant doctrinal differences.

Judaism has a great many teachings about peace and compromise, and its teachings make physical violence the last possible option. Nonetheless, the Talmud teaches that &quot;If someone comes with the intention to murder you, then one is obligated to kill in self-defense [rather than be killed]&quot;. The clear implication is that to bare one's throat would be tantamount to suicide (which Jewish law forbids) and it would also be considered helping a murderer kill someone and thus would &quot;place an obstacle in front of a blind man&quot; (i.e., makes it easier for another person to falter in their ways). The tension between the laws dealing with peace, and the obligation to self-defense, has led to a set of Jewish teachings that have been described as tactical-pacifism. This is the avoidance of force and violence whenever possible, but the use of force when necessary to save the lives of one's self and one's people.

Although killing oneself is forbidden under normal Jewish law as being a denial of God's goodness in the world, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed [[suicide]] or mass suicide (see [[Masada]], [[History of the Jews in France#First persecution of the Jews|First French persecution of the Jews]], and [[York Castle]] for examples). As a grim reminder of those times, there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for &quot;when the knife is at the throat&quot;, for those dying &quot;to sanctify God's Name&quot;. (See: ''[[Martyrdom]]''). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities. Where some Jews regard them as examples of heroic martyrdom, but others saying that while Jews should always be willing to face martyrdom if necessary, it was wrong for them to take their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionfacts.com/euthanasia/judaism.htm Euthanasia and Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Judaism focuses on this life, many questions to do with survival and conflict (such as the classic [[morality|moral]] [[dilemma]] of two people in a desert with only enough water for one to survive) were analysed in great depth by the rabbis within the Talmud, in the attempt to understand the principles a godly person should draw upon in such a circumstance.

The Sermon on the Mount records that Jesus taught that if someone comes to harm you, then one must [[turn the other cheek]]. This has led four Protestant Christian denominations to develop a [[Christian pacifism|theology of pacifism]], the avoidance of force and violence at all times. They are known historically as the ''[[peace churches]]'', and have incorporated Christ's teachings on [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolence]] into their theology so as to apply it to participation in the use of violent force; those denominations are the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and the [[Church of the Brethren]]. Many other churches have people who hold to the doctrine without making it a part of their doctrines, or who apply it to individuals but not to governments, see also [[Evangelical counsels]]. The vast majority of Christian nations and groups have not adopted this theology, nor have they followed it in practice. See also [[But to bring a sword]].

===Capital punishment===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
:''This subject is discussed in more detail in [[Religion and capital punishment]].''

Although the [[List of capital crimes in the bible|Hebrew Bible has many references to capital punishment]], the Jewish sages used their authority to make it nearly impossible for a [[Sanhedrin|Jewish court]] to impose a death sentence. Even when such a sentence might have been imposed, the [[Cities of Refuge]] and other sanctuaries, were at hand for those [[manslaughter|unintentionally guilty]] of capital offences. It was said in the Talmud about the death penalty in Judaism, that if a court killed more than one person in seventy years, it was a barbarous (or &quot;bloody&quot;) court and should be condemned as such.

Christianity usually reserved the death penalty for [[Christian heresy|heresy]], the denial of the orthodox view of God's view, and [[witchcraft]] or similar non-Christian practices. For example, in Spain, unrepentant Jews were exiled, and it was only those [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] who had accepted baptism under pressure but retained Jewish customs in private, who were punished in this way. It is presently acknowledged by most of Christianity that these uses of capital punishment were deeply immoral.

===Taboo food and drink===
{{Main|Taboo food and drink|Kashrut}}
Orthodox Jews, unlike most Christians, still practice a restrictive diet that has many rules. Most Christians believe that the kosher food [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|laws do not apply to them as they are no longer under the Law of Moses]], and that, as Jesus taught in [[Mark 7]]:   what you eat doesn't make you unclean but what comes out of a man's heart makes him unclean—although Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy have their own set of dietary observances. [[Eastern Orthodoxy#Fasting|Eastern Orthodoxy, in particular has very elaborate and strict rules of fasting]], and continues to observe the [[Council of Jerusalem]]'s apostolic decree of Act 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: &quot;We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some Christian denominations observe some Biblical food laws, for example see [[Ital]].

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not eat blood products and are known for their refusal to accept [[blood transfusion]]s based on not &quot;eating blood&quot;.

==Salvation==
{{Main|Salvation}}
Judaism does not see human beings as inherently flawed or sinful and needful of being saved from it, but rather capable with a free will of being righteous, and unlike Christianity does not closely associate ideas of &quot;salvation&quot; with a New Covenant delivered by a Jewish messiah, although in Judaism Jewish people will have a renewed national commitment of observing God's commandments under the New Covenant, and the [[Jewish Messiah]] will also be ruling at a time of global peace and acceptance of God by all people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/faq/general_messiah-criteria02.html JfJ ''Messiah : The Criteria'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism holds instead that proper living is accomplished through good works and heartfelt [[prayer]], as well as a strong faith in God. Judaism also teaches that gentiles can receive a share in &quot;[[Jewish eschatology|the world to come]]&quot;. This is codified in the Mishna [[Pirkei Avot|Avot]] 4:29, the Babylonian Talmud in tractates [[Avodah Zarah]] 10b, and [[Ketubot]] 111b, and in Maimonides's 12th century law code, the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', in ''Hilkhot Melachim'' (Laws of Kings) 8.11.

The Christian view is that every human is a sinner, and being saved by God's grace, not simply by the merit of ones own actions, pardons a damnatory sentence to Hell.

===Judgment===
Both Christianity and Judaism believe in some form of judgment. Most Christians (the exception is [[Full Preterism]]) believe in the future [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, which includes the [[Resurrection of the Dead]] and the [[Last Judgment]]. Those who have accepted Jesus as their personal saviour will be saved and live in God's presence in the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], those who have not accepted Jesus as their saviour ,will be cast into the [[Lake of fire|Lake of Fire]] (eternal Hell or simply annihilated), see for example [[The Sheep and the Goats]].

In Jewish liturgy there is significant prayer and talk of a &quot;book of life&quot; that one is written into, indicating that God judges each person each year even after death. This annual judgment process begins on [[Rosh Hashanah]] and ends with [[Yom Kippur]]. Additionally, God sits daily in judgment concerning a person's daily activities. Upon the anticipated arrival of the [[Messiah]], God will judge the nations for their persecution of Israel during the exile. Later, God will also judge the Jews over their observance of the Torah.

===Heaven and Hell===
There is little Jewish literature on heaven or hell as actual places, and there are few references to the afterlife in the Hebrew Bible. One is the ghostly apparition of Samuel, called up by the [[Witch of Endor]] at King Saul's command. Another is a mention by the [[Prophet Daniel]] of those who sleep in the earth rising to either everlasting life or everlasting abhorrence.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 12:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Hebrew views were more concerned with the fate of the nation of Israel as a whole, rather than with individual immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=233&amp;letter=R&amp;search=Resurrection Resurrection]&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger belief in an afterlife for each person developed during the Second Temple period but was contested by various Jewish sects. [[Pharisees]] believed that in death, people rest in their graves until they are physically resurrected with the coming of the Messiah, and within that resurrected body the soul would exist eternally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=252&amp;letter=P Pharisees]&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides also included the concept of resurrection in his [[Jewish principles of faith|Thirteen Principles of Faith]].

Judaism's view is summed up by a biblical observation about the Torah: in the beginning God clothes the naked (Adam), and at the end God buries the dead (Moses). The Children of Israel mourned for 40&amp;nbsp;days, then got on with their lives.

In Judaism, [[Heaven]] is sometimes described as a place where God debates [[Talmuds|Talmudic law]] with the angels, and where Jews spend eternity studying the Written and Oral Torah. Jews do not believe in &quot;Hell&quot; as a place of eternal torment. [[Gehenna]] is a place or condition of [[purgatory]] where Jews spend up to twelve months purifying to get into heaven,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} depending on how sinful they have been, although some suggest that certain types of sinners can never be purified enough to go to heaven and rather than facing eternal torment, simply cease to exist. Therefore, some violations like suicide would be punished by separation from the community, such as not being buried in a Jewish cemetery (in practice, rabbis often rule suicides to be mentally incompetent and thus not responsible for their actions). Judaism also does not have a notion of hell as a place ruled by [[Satan]] since God's dominion is total and Satan is only one of God's angels.

Catholics also believe in a purgatory for those who are going to heaven, but Christians in general believe that Hell is a fiery place of torment that never ceases, called the Lake of Fire. A small minority believe this is not permanent, and that those who go there will eventually either be saved or cease to exist. Heaven for Christians is depicted in various ways. As the [[Kingdom of God]] described in the New Testament and particularly the [[Book of Revelation]], Heaven is a new or restored earth free of sin and death, with a [[New Jerusalem]] led by God, Jesus, and the most righteous of believers starting with [[144,000]] Israelites from every tribe, and all others who received salvation living peacefully and making pilgrimages to give glory to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Revelation 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity, promises of Heaven and Hell as rewards and punishments are often used to motivate good and bad behavior, as threats of disaster were used by prophets like [[Jeremiah]] to motivate the Israelites. Modern Judaism generally rejects this form of motivation, instead teaching to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. As Maimonides wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;A man should not say: I shall carry out the precepts of the Torah and study her wisdom in order to receive all the blessings written therein or in order to merit the life of the World to Come and I shall keep away from the sins forbidden by the Torah in order to be spared the curses mentioned in the Torah or in order not to be cut off from the life of the World to Come. It is not proper to serve God in this fashion. For one who serves thus serves out of fear. Such as way is not that of the prophets and sages. Only the ignorant, and the women and children serve God in this way. These are trained to serve out of fear until they obtain sufficient knowledge to serve out of love. One who serves God out of love studies the Torah and practices the precepts and walks in the way of wisdom for no ulterior motive at all, neither out of fear of evil nor in order to acquire the good, but follows the truth because it is true and the good will follow the merit of attaining to it. It is the stage of Abraham our father whom the Holy One, blessed be God, called &quot;My friend&quot; (Isaiah 41:8—''ohavi'' = the one who loves me) because he served out of love alone. It is regarding this stage that the Holy One, Blessed be God, commanded us through Moses, as it is said: &quot;You shall love the Lord your God&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:5). When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love.
(Maimonides ''Yad'' Chapter 10, quoted in Jacobs 1973: 159)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Messiah===
{{Main|Messiah}}
Jews believe that a descendant of [[King David]] will one day appear to restore the Kingdom of Israel and usher in an era of peace, prosperity, and spiritual understanding for Israel and all the nations of the world. Jews refer to this person as [[Jewish eschatology|Moshiach]] or &quot;anointed one&quot;, translated as messiah in English. The traditional Jewish understanding of the messiah is that he is fully human and born of human parents without any supernatural element. The messiah is expected to have a relationship with God similar to that of the [[Nevi'im|prophets]] of the Tanakh. In his commentary on the Talmud, Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon) wrote:

:All of the people Israel will come back to Torah; The people of Israel with be gathered back to the land of Israel; The Temple in Jerusalem will be rebuilt; Israel will live among the nations as an equal, and will be strong enough to defend herself; Eventually, war, hatred and famine will end, and an era of peace and prosperity will come upon the Earth.

He adds:
:&quot;And if a king shall stand up from among the House of David, studying Torah and indulging in commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will coerce all Israel to follow it and to strengthen its weak points, and will fight The Lord's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded [and won all nations surrounding him. Old prints and mss.] and built a Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the strayed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together ... But if he did not succeed until now, or if he was killed, it becomes known that he is not this one of whom the Torah had promised us, and he is indeed like all [other] proper and wholesome kings of the House of David who died.&quot;

He also clarified the nature of the Messiah:
:&quot;Do not imagine that the anointed King must perform miracles and signs and create new things in the world or resurrect the dead and so on. The matter is not so: For Rabbi Akiba was a great scholar of the sages of the Mishnah, and he was the assistant-warrior of the king Ben Coziba Simon bar Kokhba... He and all the Sages of his generation deemed him the anointed king, until he was killed by sins; only since he was killed, they knew that he was not. The Sages asked him neither a miracle nor a sign...&quot;

The Christian view of Jesus as Messiah goes beyond such claims and is the fulfillment and union of three anointed offices; a prophet like Moses who delivers God's commands and covenant and frees people from bondage, a High Priest in the order of [[Melchizedek]] overshadowing the [[Levite priesthood]] and a king like King David ruling over Jews, and like God ruling over the whole world and coming from the line of David.

For Christians, Jesus is also [[hypostatic union|fully human and fully divine]] as the [[Logos|Word of God]] who sacrifices himself so that humans can receive salvation. Jesus sits in Heaven at the right hand of God and will [[Last Judgment|judge humanity]] in the [[end times]].

Christian readings of the Hebrew Bible find many references to Jesus. This takes the form in some cases of specific prophesy, but in most cases of foreshadowing by types or forerunners. Traditionally, most Christian readings of the Bible maintained that almost every prophecy was actually about the coming of Jesus, and that the entire Old Testament of the Bible is a prophecy about the [[Ministry of Jesus|coming of Jesus]].

====Catholic views====
Catholicism teaches ''[[Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus]]'' (&quot;Outside the Church there is no salvation&quot;), which some, like Fr. [[Leonard Feeney]], interpreted as limiting salvation to Catholics only. At the same time, it does not deny the possibility that those not visibly members of the Church may attain salvation as well. In recent times, its teaching has been most notably expressed in the Vatican II council documents ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'' (1964), ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' (1964), ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' (1965), an encyclical issued by Pope John Paul II: ''[[Ut Unum Sint]]'' (1995), and in a document issued by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' in 2000. The latter document been criticised for claiming that non-Christians are in a &quot;gravely deficient situation&quot; as compared to Catholics, but also adds that &quot;for those who are not formally and visibly members of the Church, salvation in Christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which, while having a mysterious relationship to the Church, does not make them formally part of the Church, but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation.&quot;

[[Pope John Paul II]] on October 2, 2000 emphasized that this document did not say that non-Christians were actively denied salvation: &quot;...this confession does not deny salvation to non-Christians, but points to its ultimate source in Christ, in whom man and God are united&quot;. On December 6 the Pope issued a statement to further emphasize that the Church continued to support its traditional stance that salvation was available to believers of other faiths: &quot;The gospel teaches us that those who live in accordance with the Beatitudes--the poor in spirit, the pure of heart, those who bear lovingly the sufferings of life--will enter God's kingdom.&quot; He further added, &quot;All who seek God with a sincere heart, including those who do not know Christ and his church, contribute under the influence of Grace to the building of this Kingdom.&quot; On August 13, 2002 American Catholic bishops issued a joint statement with leaders of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism]], called &quot;Reflections on Covenant and Mission&quot;, which affirmed that Christians should not target Jews for conversion. The document stated: &quot;Jews already dwell in a saving covenant with God&quot; and &quot;Jews are also called by God to prepare the world for God's Kingdom.&quot; However, some U.S.-led Baptist and other [[Christian fundamentalist|fundamentalist]] denominations still believe it is their duty to engage in what they refer to as outreach to &quot;unbelieving&quot; Jews.

====Eastern Orthodox views====
Eastern Orthodox Christianity emphasizes a continuing life of repentance or ''metanoia'', which includes an increasing improvement in thought, belief and action. Regarding the salvation of Jews, [[Muslims]], and other non-Christians, the Orthodox have traditionally taught that there is no salvation outside the church. Orthodoxy recognizes that other religions may contain truth, to the extent that they are in agreement with Christianity.

Many Orthodox theologians{{who|date=December 2010}} believe that all people will have an opportunity to embrace union with God, including Jesus, after their death, and so become part of the Church at that time.{{fact|date=December 2010}} God is thought to be good, just, and merciful; it would not seem just to condemn someone because they never heard the Gospel message, or were taught a distorted version of the Gospel by [[heretics]]. Therefore, the reasoning goes, they must at some point have an opportunity to make a genuine informed decision.{{fact|date=December 2010}} Ultimately, those who persist in rejecting God condemn themselves, by cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of all Life, and from the God who is Love embodied. Jews, Muslims, and members of other faiths, then, are expected to convert to Christianity in the afterlife. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also holds this belief, and holds baptismal services in which righteous people are baptized in behalf of their ancestors who, it is believed, are given the opportunity to accept the ordinance.

===Proselytizing===
Judaism is not a [[proselytizing]] religion. Orthodox Judaism deliberately makes it very difficult to [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] and become a Jew, and requires a significant and full-time effort in living, study, righteousness, and conduct over several years. The final decision is by no means a foregone conclusion. A person cannot become Jewish by marrying a Jew, or by joining a synagogue, nor by any degree of involvement in the community or religion, but only by explicitly undertaking intense, formal, and supervised work over years aimed towards that goal. Some less strict versions of Judaism have made this process somewhat easier but it is still far from common.

In the past Judaism was more evangelistic,&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson's ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0-674-39731-2, page 288: &quot;Explicit evidence of a systematic attempt to propagate the Jewish faith in the city of Rome is found as early as 139 BCE. With the increase of the Jewish population of Rome, the Jews intensified their efforts to make converts among the Romans. Although the activity of Jewish missionaries in Roman society caused Tiberius to expel them from that city in 19 CE, they soon returned, and Jewish religious propaganda was resumed and maintained even after the destruction of the Temple. Tacitus mentions it regretfully (''Histories'' 5.5), and Juvenal, in his Fourteenth Satire (11. 96ff.), describes how Roman families 'degenerated' into Judaism: the fathers permitted themselves to adopt some of its customs and the sons became Jews in every respect. ... the Bible provided the apostles of Judaism with a literature unparalleled in any other religion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but this was often more akin just to &quot;greater openness to converts&quot; rather than active soliciting of conversions. Since Jews believe that one need not be a Jew to approach God, there is no religious pressure to convert non-Jews to their faith.

The [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] branch of [[Hasidic Judaism]] has been an exception to this non-proselytizing standard, since in recent decades it has been actively promoting Noahide Laws for Gentiles as an alternative to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noahide.org/article.asp?Level=493&amp;Parent=88 ''The Seven Laws of Noah and the Non-Jews who Follow Them '']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.J.RES.104.ENR:], 102nd Congress of the United States of America, March 5, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Christianity is an explicitly [[evangelism|evangelistic]] religion. Christians are commanded by Jesus to &quot;[[Great Commission|Therefore go and make disciples of all nations]]&quot;. Historically, evangelism has on rare occasions led to [[forced conversion]] under threat of death or mass expulsion. While abuses of this sort are no longer common, at certain times and in certain places, evangelism has veered into high-pressure coercion, in those instances causing significant ill-will.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Mutual views==
===Common Jewish views of Christianity===
{{Main|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
Jesus plays no role whatsoever in Judaism. Jews are familiar with Jesus primarily through the western world since it is a relatively Christian-oriented society. Many view Jesus as just one in a long list of failed [[List of messiah claimants|Jewish claimants to be the Messiah]], none of whom fulfilled the [[Jewish view of Jesus#Prophecy and Jesus|tests]] of a prophet specified in the Law of Moses. Others see Jesus as a teacher who worked with the gentiles and ascribe the messianic claims they find objectionable to his later followers. Because much physical and spiritual violence was done to Jews in the name of Jesus and his followers, and because evangelism is still an active aspect of many church's activities, many religious Jews are uncomfortable with discussing Jesus and treat him as a [[Yeshu|non-person]]. In answering the question, &quot;What do Jews think of Jesus,&quot; philosopher Milton Steinberg claims, for Jews, Jesus cannot be accepted as anything more than a teacher. &quot;In only a few respects did Jesus deviate from the Tradition,&quot; Steinberg concludes, &quot;and in all of them, Jews believe, he blundered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;M. Steinberg, 1975 ''Basic Judaism'' pp. 108, New York: Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich&lt;/ref&gt;

On a religious level, Judaism does not believe that God requires the sacrifice of any human. This is emphasized in Jewish traditions concerning the story of the [[Binding of Isaac|Akedah]], the binding of Isaac. In the Jewish explanation, this is a story in the Torah whereby God wanted to test Abraham's faith and willingness, and Isaac was never going to be actually sacrificed. Thus, Judaism rejects the notion that anyone can or should die for anyone else's sin (see Spiegel, 1993). As a religion, Judaism is far more focused on the practicalities of understanding how one may live a sacred life in this world according to God's will, rather than hope a hope of a future one. Judaism does not believe in the Christian concept of hell but does have a punishment stage in the afterlife (i.e. Gehenna, the New Testament word translated as hell) as well as a Heaven ([[Olam Haba|Gan Eden]]), but the religion does not intend it as a focus.

Judaism views the worship of Jesus as inherently polytheistic, and rejects Christian attempts to explain the [[Trinity]] as a complex monotheism as invalid{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

[[Christmas]] and other Christian festivals have no religious significance in Judaism and are not celebrated. Celebration of Christian holy days is considered [[Avodah Zarah]] or idolatry and is forbidden{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}; however some secular Jews in the West treat Christmas as a secular (but not religious) holiday.

===Common Christian views of Judaism===
Christians believe that Christianity is the fulfillment and successor of Judaism, retaining much of its doctrine and many of its practices including [[monotheism]], the belief in a Messiah, and certain forms of worship like prayer and reading from religious texts. Christians believe that Judaism requires blood sacrifice to atone for sins, and believe that Judaism has abandoned this since the [[destruction of the Second Temple]].

Most Christians consider that the Law was necessary as an intermediate stage, but once the crucifixion of Jesus occurred, adherence to civil and ceremonial Law was superseded by the New Covenant&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%207:11-28;&amp;version=31; Hebrews 7:11-28]&lt;/ref&gt; since the purpose of these laws was to dictate a proper relationship to God through the tabernacles and the temples in Jerusalem.

Some Christians adhere to [[New Covenant theology]], which states that Jews have rejected Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God have ceased being the Chosen People. This position has been softened by some adherents, or completely rejected by other churches where Jews are recognized to have a special status due to their covenant with God through Abraham, so this continues to be an area of ongoing dispute among Christians. This is in contrast to [[Dual-covenant theology]].

Some Christians who view the Jewish people as close to God seek to understand and incorporate elements of Jewish understanding or perspective into their beliefs as a means to respect their &quot;parent&quot; religion of Judaism, or to more fully seek out and return to their Christian roots. Christians embracing aspects of Judaism are sometimes criticized as Biblical [[Judaizers]] by Christians when they pressure Gentile Christians to observe Old Testament teachings rejected by many modern Christians. See also the [[Pejorative|derogatory term]] [[Cafeteria Christianity]].

==Inter-relationship==
{{See also|Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Anti-Judaism|Anti-Christian}}

In addition to each having varied views on the other as a religion, there has also been a long and often painful [[Christianity and anti-Semitism|history]] of conflict, persecution and at times, reconciliation, between the two religions, which have influenced their mutual views of their relationship over time.

[[Genocide]], including [[persecution]], forcible conversion, and forcible [[Forced migration|displacement]] of Jews ([[i.e.]] [[hate crime]]s) were common for many centuries, with occasional gestures to reconciliation from time to time. [[Pogroms]] were common throughout Christian Europe, including organized violence, restrictive land ownership and professional lives, forcible relocation and [[ghetto]]ization, mandatory dress codes, and at times humiliating actions and [[torture]]. All had major effects on Jewish cultures. There have also been non-coercive outreach and missionary efforts such as the [[Church of England]]'s [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|Ministry Among Jewish People]], founded in 1809.

What is clear is that formally, there is mostly peaceful living side by side, with strong inter-dialogue at many levels to [[Christian-Jewish reconciliation|reconcile]] past differences between the two groups, and many Christians emphasize common historical heritage and religious continuity with the ancient spiritual lineage of the Jews. Christians and Jews attempt to coexist ultimately by recognizing the fact that they both worship the same Almighty God, that they both recognize several of the same prophets, and that both religions, while having faults, attempt to make the world a better place. Christians view the Jews as keepers of the [[Old Covenant]]. Jews view Christians as gentiles who worship the one God, but otherwise have their own [[B'nei Noah|distinct religion]]. What is also likely is that for a long time to come, some within each will continue to consider the other with varying degrees of suspicion and hostility. 

For Martin Buber, Judaism and Christianity were variations on the same theme of messianism.  Buber made this theme the basis of a famous definition of the tension between Judaism and Christianity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pre-messianically, our destinies are divided. Now to the Christian, the Jew is the incomprehensibly obdurate man who declines to see what has happened; and to the Jew, the Christian is the incomprehensibly daring man who affirms in an unredeemed world that its redemption has been accomplished. This is a gulf which no human power can bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Buber, &quot;The Two Foci of the Jewish Soul,&quot; cited in The Writings of Martin Buber, Will Herberg (editor), New York: Meridian Books, 1956, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], attempts have been made to construct a new Jewish-Christian relationship of mutual respect for differences, through the inauguration of the interfaith body the [[Council of Christians and Jews]] in 1942 and [[International Council of Christians and Jews]]. The [[Seelisberg Conference]] in 1947 established 10 points relating to the sources of [[Christian antisemitism]]. The ICCJ's &quot;Twelve points of Berlin&quot; sixty years later aim to reflect a recommitment to interreligious dialogue between the two communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iccj.org/en/index.php?id=455&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of [[Pope Alexander VI]] of [[Spain]] and his long-term mistress [[Vannozza dei Cattanei]]. He was the brother of [[Lucrezia Borgia]]; [[Giovanni Borgia (1474)|Giovanni Borgia]] (Juan), Duke of [[Gandia]]; and [[Gioffre Borgia]] (Jofré in [[Valencian]]), Prince of Squillace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Borgias and Their Enemies |author=Christopher Hibbert |year=2008 |publisher=Harcourt, Inc. |isbn=978-0-15-101033-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was half-brother to Don Pedro Luis de Borja (1460–1488) and Girolama de Borja, children of unknown mothers.

==Early life==
Like nearly all aspects of Cesare Borgia's life, the date of his birth is a subject of dispute. However, he was of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent. He was born in [[Rome]]--in either 1475 or 1476--to Cardinal Rodrigo de Lanzol y Borgia, soon to become [[Pope Alexander VI]], and his mistress [[Vannozza dei Cattanei]], about whom information is sparse. The Borgia family originally came from the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] (before it was integrated into the [[Kingdom of Spain]]), and rose to prominence during the mid-15th century; Cesare's great-uncle Alonso Borgia (1378–1458), bishop of Valencia, was elected [[Pope Callixtus III]] in 1455.&lt;ref name = &quot;xvfywc&quot;&gt;Herfried Münkler and Marina Münkler, ''Lexikon der Renaissance'', Munich: Beck, 2000, p. 43ff.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cesare's father, [[Pope Alexander VI]], was the first pope who was openly recognized to have children with a lover.

[[Stefano Infessura]] writes that Cardinal Borgia falsely claimed Cesare to be the legitimate son of another man -- Domenico d'Arignano, the nominal husband of Vannozza de' Cattanei. More likely, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] granted Cesare a release from the necessity of proving his birth in a [[papal bull]] of October 1, 1480.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatini (pp. 45, 48), citing the supplement to the Appendix of Thuasne's edition of Burchard's ''Diarium''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Church office===
Cesare was initially groomed for a career in the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. He was made Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pamplona y Tudela|Pamplona]] at the age of 15. Following school in [[Perugia]] and [[Pisa]] where Cesare studied law, along with his father's elevation to Pope, Cesare was made [[Catholic Cardinal|Cardinal]] at the age of 18.&lt;ref name = &quot;xvfywc&quot;/&gt;  Alexander VI staked the hopes of the Borgia family in Cesare's brother [[Giovanni Borgia (1474)|Giovanni]], who was made captain general of the military forces of the papacy. Giovanni was assassinated in 1497 in mysterious circumstances: with several contemporaries suggesting that Cesare might be his killer,&lt;ref&gt;Spinosa, ''La saga dei Borgia''&lt;/ref&gt; as Giovanni's disappearing could finally open him a long-awaited military career; as well as jealousy over [[Sancha of Aragon]], wife of Cesare's other brother [[Gioffre Borgia|Gioffre]], and mistress of both Cesare and Giovanni.&lt;ref&gt;Rendina, ''I capitani di ventura''&lt;/ref&gt; Cesare's role in the act, however, has never been clear.

On August 17, 1498, Cesare became the first person in history to resign the cardinalate. On the same day the French [[King Louis XII]] named Cesare [[Duke of Valentinois]], and this title, along with his former position as Cardinal of Valencia, explains the nickname &quot;Valentino&quot;.

===Military===
Cesare's career was founded upon his father's ability to distribute patronage, along with his alliance with France (reinforced by his marriage with Charlotte d'Albret, sister of [[John III of Navarre]]), in the course of the [[Italian Wars]]. Louis XII invaded Italy in 1499: after [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]] had ousted its duke [[Ludovico Sforza]], Cesare accompanied the king in his entrance in [[Milan]].

At this point Alexander decided to profit from the favourable situation and carve out for Cesare a state of his own in northern Italy. To this end, he declared that all his vicars in [[Romagna]] and [[Marche]] were deposed. Though in theory subject directly to the pope, these rulers had been practically independent or dependent on other states for generations.  From the view of the citizens, these vicars were cruel and petty. When Cesare eventually took power, he was viewed by the citizens as a great improvement.

Cesare was appointed commander of the papal armies with a number of Italian mercenaries, supported by 300 cavalry and 4,000 Swiss infantry sent by the King of France. His first victim was [[Caterina Sforza]] (mother of the Medici ''condottiero'' [[Giovanni dalle Bande Nere]]), ruler of [[Imola]] and [[Forlì]]. Despite being deprived of his French troops after the conquest of those two cities, Borgia returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph and to receive the title of [[Gonfalonier of the Church|Papal Gonfalonier]] from his father. In 1500 the creation of twelve new cardinals granted Alexander enough money for Cesare to hire the ''condottieri,'' [[Vitellozzo Vitelli]], [[Gian Paolo Baglioni]], [[Giulio Orsini|Giulio]] and [[Paolo Orsini]], and [[Oliverotto|Oliverotto da Fermo]], who resumed his campaign in Romagna.

[[Giovanni Sforza]], first husband of Cesare's sister Lucrezia, was soon ousted from [[Pesaro]]; [[Pandolfo IV Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] lost [[Rimini]]; [[Faenza]] surrendered, its young lord [[Astorre III Manfredi]] being later drowned in the Tiber river by  Cesare's order. In May 1501 the latter was created duke of Romagna. Hired by Florence, Cesare subsequently added the lordship of [[Piombino]] to his new lands.

While his ''condottieri'' took over the siege of Piombino (which ended in 1502), Cesare commanded the French troops in the sieges of Naples and [[Capua]], defended by [[Prospero Colonna|Prospero]] and [[Fabrizio Colonna]]. On June 24, 1501 his troops stormed the latter, causing the collapse of Aragonese power in southern Italy.

In June 1502 he set out for Marche, where he was able to capture [[Urbino]] and [[Camerino]] by treason. The next step would be [[Bologna]], but his ''condottieri'', most notably Vitellozzo Vitelli and the Orsini brothers, fearing Cesare's cruelty, set up a plot against him. [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]] and [[Giovanni Maria da Varano]] returned to Urbino and Camerino, and [[Fossombrone]] revolted. The fact that his subjects had enjoyed his rule thus far meant that his opponents had to work much harder than they would have liked. He eventually recalled his loyal generals to Imola, where he waited for his opponents' loose alliance to collapse. Cesare called for a reconciliation, but imprisoned his ''condottieri'' in [[Senigallia]], a feat described as a &quot;wonderful deceiving&quot; by [[Paolo Giovio]],&lt;ref&gt;Rendina, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; and had them executed.

==Later years==
Although he was an immensely capable general and statesman, Cesare would have trouble maintaining his domain without continued Papal patronage. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] cites Cesare's dependence on the good will of the Papacy, under the control of his father, to be the principal weakness of his rule, arguing that, had Cesare been able to win the favor of the new Pope, he would have been a very successful ruler. The news of his father's death (1503) arrived when Cesare was planning the conquest of [[Tuscany]]. While he was convalescing in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], his troops controlled the conclave. The new pope, [[Pius III]], arrested him, he then broke out, and the accession of the Borgias' deadly enemy [[Julius II]] caused his final ruin.

While moving to Romagna to quell a revolt, he was seized and imprisoned by [[Gian Paolo Baglioni]] near Perugia. All his lands were acquired by the Papal States. Exiled to [[Spain]] in 1504, he was imprisoned in the Castle of La Mota, [[Medina del Campo]], from which he escaped and joined his brother-in-law, King [[John III of Navarre]]. He was killed in 1507 while fighting for the Navarrese king in the city of [[Viana, Spain]].

==Remains==
Borgia was originally buried in a marble tomb beneath the altar of the Church of Santa Maria in Viana with an inscription &quot;Here lies in little earth one who was feared by all, who held peace and war in his hand.&quot; In 1537, the Bishop of Calahorra ordered the tomb destroyed and the remains transferred to an unconsecrated site outside the church. In 2007, Fernando Sebastian Aguilar, the Archbishop of Pamplona, allowed the remains to be moved back inside the church on the day before the 500th commemoration of Borgia's death.

==Evaluation==
[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] met the Duke on a diplomatic mission in his function as Secretary of the Florentine Chancellery. Machiavelli was at Borgia's court from 7 October 1502 through 18 January 1503. During this time he wrote regular dispatches to his superiors in Florence, many of which have survived and are published in Machiavelli's Collected Works. In ''[[The Prince]]'', Machiavelli uses Borgia as an example to elucidate the dangers of acquiring a principality by virtue of another. Although Cesare Borgia's father gave him the power to set up, Cesare ruled the Romagna with skill and tact for the most part. However, when his father died, and a rival to the Borgia family entered the Papal seat, Cesare was overthrown in a matter of months.

Machiavelli attributes two episodes to Cesare Borgia that were at least partially executed by his father: the method by which the Romagna was pacified, which Machiavelli describes in chapter VII of ''[[The Prince]]'', and the assassination of his captains on New Year's Eve of 1503 in Senigallia.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Machiavelli, &quot;A Description of the Method Used by Duke Valentino in Killing Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, and Others&quot;, ''The Chief Works and Others'', trans. Allan Gilbert, Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1989, 3 vols., 163–169&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli's use of Borgia is subject to controversy. Some scholars see in Machiavelli's Borgia the precursor of state crimes in the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, ''The Myth of the State'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] and [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]], have historicized Machiavelli's Borgia, explaining the admiration for such violence as an effect of the general criminality and corruption of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey C. Mansfield, ''Machiavelli's Virtue'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This seemingly makes it obvious that Machiavelli admired Cesare Borgia's father but not Cesare himself.

Cesare Borgia briefly employed [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as military architect and engineer between 1502 and 1503. Cesare and Leonardo became intimate instantaneously — Cesare provided Leonardo with an unlimited pass to inspect and direct all ongoing and planned construction in his domain. Before meeting Cesare, Leonardo had worked at the Milanese court of [[Ludovico Sforza]] for many years, until [[Charles VIII of France]] drove Sforza out of Italy. After Cesare, Leonardo was unsuccessful in finding another patron in Italy. François I of France was able to convince Leonardo to enter his service, and the last three years of da Vinci's life were spent working in France.

Cesare Borgia had wanted to take over Mantua while [[Isabella d'Este]] was ruling.

==Personal life==
On 10 May 1499, Cesare married [[Charlotte of Albret]] (1480 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1514). She was a sister of [[John III of Navarre]]. They were parents to a daughter, [[Louise Borgia, Duchess of Valentinois]], (1500–1553) who first married [[Louis II de La Tremouille]], Governor of Burgundy, and secondly Philippe de Bourbon (1499–1557), Seigneur de [[Bourbon-Busset|Busset]].

Cesare was also father to at least 11 illegitimate children, among them [[Girolamo Borgia]], who married [[Isabella Contessa di Carpi]], and Lucrezia Borgia, who, after Cesare's death, was moved to Ferrara to the court of her aunt, [[Lucrezia Borgia]].

Generally a '''chronicle''' ({{lang-la|chronica}}, from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|χρονικά}}, from {{polytonic|χρόνος}}, ''chronos'', &quot;time&quot;) is a historical account of facts and events ranged in [[chronology|chronological]] order, as in a [[time line]]. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important.

In modern times various contemporary newspapers or other periodicals have adopted &quot;chronicle&quot; as part of their name. Various fictional stories have also adopted &quot;chronicle&quot; as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories. A chronicle which traces world history is called a [[universal chronicle]]. 

Scholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A ''dead'' chronicle is one where the author gathers his list of events up to the time of his writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A ''live'' chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as [[annals]], over dead ones.

&quot;The chronicle is one of the quintessentially Christian forms of historical writing,&quot; Michael Kulikowsky has remarked.&lt;ref&gt;Kulikowski, &quot;Barbarians in Gaul, Usurpers in Britain&quot; ''Britannia'' '''31''' (2000:325-345).&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The ultimate goal of this exercise is usually to place the events of human history in the framework of Christian time, to record the annual stages by which human history marches towards the [[Second Coming]]&quot; This approach makes the Christian chroniclers particularly awake to wars, plagues and disasters.

The term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events.

Chronicles are the predecessors of modern &quot;[[time line]]s&quot; rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent [[continuator]]s. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called [[annal]]s. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point-of-view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual [[abbey]]s.

The most important [[List of English chronicles|English chronicles]] are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', started under the patronage of King Alfred in the ninth century and continued until the twelfth century, and the ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'' (1577–87) by [[Raphael Holinshed]] and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama.&lt;ref&gt;'A Glossary of Literary Terms' - M.H. Abrams&lt;/ref&gt; Later sixteenth century Scottish chronicles, written after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], shape history according to Catholic or Protestant viewpoints.

It is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle]]'' lists some 2500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.

In [[chemistry]], '''concentration''' is defined as the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. Four types can be distinguished: [[Concentration#Mass_concentration|mass concentration]], [[Concentration#Molar_concentration|molar concentration]], [[Concentration#Number_concentration|number concentration]], and [[Concentration#Volume_concentration|volume concentration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = C01222 | title = concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term concentration can be applied to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently it refers to [[solute]]s in [[homogeneous]] [[solution]]s.

==Qualitative description==

[[Image:Dilution-concentration simple example.jpg|frame|right|These glasses containing red dye demonstrate qualitative changes in concentration. The solutions on the left are more dilute, compared to the more concentrated solutions on the right.]]

Often in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] way, through the use of adjectives such as &quot;dilute&quot; for solutions of relatively low concentration and &quot;concentrated&quot; for solutions of relatively high concentration. To '''concentrate''' a solution, one must add more [[solution|solute]] (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of [[solvent]] (for example, water). By contrast, to '''dilute''' a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are ''fully'' [[miscible]] there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]]. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve (except in certain circumstances, when [[supersaturation]] may occur). Instead, [[Phase (matter)#Phase separation|phase separation]] will occur, leading to either coexisting phases or a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.

==Quantitative notation==

There are four quantities that describe concentration:

===Mass concentration===
{{main|Mass concentration (chemistry)}}

The mass concentration &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[mass]] of a constituent &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the volume of the mixture &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i = \frac {m_i}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Molar concentration===

{{main|Molar concentration}}

The molar concentration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the volume of the mixture &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;c_i = \frac {n_i}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. However, more commonly the unit mol/L is used.

===Number concentration===

{{main|Number concentration}}

The number concentration &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the number of entities of a constituent &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; in a mixture divided by the volume of the mixture &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;C_i = \frac{N_i}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is 1/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Volume concentration===

{{main|Volume concentration}}

The '''volume concentration''' &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; (also called '''volume fraction''') is defined as the volume of a constituent &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the volume of all consituents of the mixture &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; prior to mixing:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i = \frac {V_i}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Related Quantities==

Several other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture. Note that these should '''not''' be called concentrations.

===Normality===
{{main|Normality (chemistry)}}

Normality is defined as the molar concentration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by an equivalence factor &lt;math&gt;f_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the definition of the equivalence factor may not be unequivocal, [[IUPAC]] and [[NIST]] discourage the use of normality.

===Molality===
{{main|Molality}}

The molality of a solution &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the mass of the solvent &lt;math&gt;m_{solvent}&lt;/math&gt; ('''not''' the mass of the solution):

:&lt;math&gt;m_i = \frac{n_i}{m_{solvent}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] for molality is mol/kg.

===Mole fraction===
{{main|Mole fraction}}

The mole fraction &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture &lt;math&gt;n_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac {n_i}{n_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is mol/mol. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mole fractions.

===Mole ratio===
{{main|Mixing ratio}}

The mole ratio &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the total amount of all ''other'' constituents in a mixture:

:&lt;math&gt;r_i = \frac{n_i}{n_{tot}-n_i}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;n_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;, the mole ratio is almost identical to the mole fraction.

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is mol/mol. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mole ratios.

===Mass fraction===
{{main|Mass fraction (chemistry)}}

The mass fraction &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of one substance with mass &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; to the mass of the total mixture &lt;math&gt;m_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;, defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;w_i = \frac {m_i}{m_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is kg/kg. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mass fractions.

===Mass ratio===
{{main|Mixing ratio}}

The mass ratio &lt;math&gt;\zeta_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the mass of a constituent &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the total mass of all ''other'' constituents in a mixture:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_i = \frac{m_i}{m_{tot}-m_i}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;m_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;, the mass ratio is almost identical to the mass fraction.

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] is kg/kg. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mass ratios.

'''Christine Lavin''' (born  January 2, 1952) is a [[New York City]]-based [[singer-songwriter]] and promoter of contemporary [[folk music]].  She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name [[Four Bitchin' Babes]].  She has also put together several compilation albums of contemporary folk artists, including ''On a Winter's Night''.

She is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances. Many of her songs alternate between emotional reflections on romance and outright comedy. Two of her more famous songs include &quot;Sensitive New Age Guys&quot; and &quot;Bald Headed Men&quot;.

One of Lavin's songs, &quot;Regretting What I Said to You When You Called Me 11:00 On a Friday Morning to Tell Me that at 1:00 Friday Afternoon You're Gonna Leave Your Office, Go Downstairs, Hail a Cab to Go Out to the Airport to Catch a Plane to Go Skiing in the Alps for Two Weeks, Not that I Wanted to Go With You, I Wasn't Able to Leave Town, I'm Not a Very Good Skier, I Couldn't Expect You to Pay My Way, But After Going Out With You for Three Years I DON'T Like Surprises!! Subtitled: A Musical Apology&quot; is notable for having the longest known song title.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_longest_song_title&lt;/ref&gt; It is the eighth song on her 1984 album ''Future Fossils'', and is 3:04 (3 minutes and 4 seconds) long.

In her youth, Lavin was a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] in [[Geneva, New York]], and she still has impressive baton-twirling skills; she often ends a concert by twirling a glow-in-the-dark [[Baton (twirling)|baton]] with the house lights turned off as she leaves the stage.

Lavin worked at [[Caffe Lena]] in Saratoga, New York, until [[Dave Van Ronk]] convinced her to move to New York City and make a career as a singer-songwriter. She followed his advice and accepted his offer of guitar lessons. She has lived in the City ever since. 

Lavin was the original host of &quot;Sunday Breakfast&quot; on [[WFUV]] in New York City. 

Lavin was a founding member of the [[Four Bitchin' Babes]] when they were formed in 1990.

In recent years Lavin has been known to host knitting circles before her shows, inviting any knitters, hookers (people who crochet), or other crafters to join her.

The '''Cutter Expansive Classification''' system is a [[library classification]] system devised by [[Charles Ammi Cutter]]. The system was the basis for the top categories of the Library of Congress classification.

==History of the Cutter classification==
Charles Ammi Cutter (1837&amp;ndash;1903), inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary [[Melvil Dewey]], developed his own classification scheme for the collections of the [[Boston Athenaeum]], at which he served as librarian for two dozen years. He began work on it about 1880, publishing an overview of the new system in 1882. The same classification would later be used, but with a different notation, also devised by Cutter, at the Cary Library in Lexington&lt;ref&gt;Cutter, C. A. [http://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891–93, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Cutter received many requests from librarians at small libraries who wanted the classification adapted to their needs&lt;ref&gt;Cutter, C. A. [http://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891–93, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;. He devised the Expansive Classification in response, to meet the needs of growing libraries&lt;ref&gt;Cutter, C. A. [http://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891–93, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Cutter Expansive Classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, mostly in [[New England]], has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications. Its outline served as a basis for the Library of Congress classification, which also took over some of its features. It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the 20th century.

==Outline of the Cutter classification==
Like the LC classification system, texts are organized by subject. Users of Cutter, however, will find the subject headings more general than those of the LC system.

* A General works (encyclopedias, periodicals, society publications)
* B&amp;ndash;D Philosophy, Psychology, Religion
* E, F, G Biography, History, Geography and travels
* H&amp;ndash;J, K Social sciences, Law
* L&amp;ndash;T Science and technology
* U&amp;ndash;VS Military, Sports, Recreation
* VT, VV, W Theatre, Music, Fine arts
* X Philology (expanded by language)
* Y Literature (expanded by language, and in English form&amp;mdash;e.g., YY is English and American literature, YYP is poetry in English)
* Z Book arts, Bibliography

==How Cutter call numbers are constructed==
Most call numbers in the Cutter classification follow conventions offering clues to the book's subject. The first line represents the subject, the second the author (and perhaps title), the third and fourth dates of editions, indications of translations, and critical works on particular books or authors. All numbers in the Cutter system are (or should be) shelved as if in decimal order.

Size of volumes is indicated by points (.), pluses (+), or slashes (/ or //). 

For some subjects a numerical geographical subdivision follows the classification letters on the first line. The number 83 stands for the United States&amp;mdash;hence, F83 is U.S. history, G83 U.S. travel, JU83 U.S. politics, WP83 U.S. painting. Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.

The second line usually represents the author's name by a capital letter plus one or more numbers arranged decimally. This may be followed by the first letter or letters of the title in lower-case, and/or sometimes the letters a,b,c indicating other printings of the same title. When appropriate, the second line may begin with a 'form' number&amp;mdash;e.g., 1 stands for history and criticism of a subject, 2 for a bibliography, 5 for a dictionary, 6 for an atlas or maps, 7 for a periodical, 8 for a society or university publication, 9 for a collection of works by different authors.

On the third line a capital Y indicates a work about the author or book represented by the first two lines, and a capital E (for English&amp;mdash;other letters are used for other languages) indicates a translation into English. If both criticism and translation apply to a single title, the number expands into four lines.

===Cutter Numbers===
One of the features adopted by other systems, including Library of Congress, is the Cutter number. It is an alphanumeric device to code text so that it can be arranged in alphabetical order using the fewest characters. It contains one or two initial letters and Arabic numbers, treated as a decimal. To construct a Cutter number, a cataloguer consults a Cutter table as required by the classification rules.  Although Cutter numbers are mostly used for coding the names of authors, the system can be used for titles, subjects, geographic areas, and more.

'''Muhtar Cem Karaca''' (April 5, 1945 - February 8, 2004), also called '''Cem Baba''' (Daddy Cem or Father Cem), was a prominent [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] [[rock music|rock]] musician and one of the most important figures in the [[Anatolian rock]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Biography==
He was the only child of İrma Felekyan ([[Toto Karaca]]) of [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenian]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toto Karaca (1912-1992)|url=http://www.biyografi.net/kisiayrinti.asp?kisiid=960|publisher=biyografi.net|accessdate=2007-02-05}}{{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popular opera, theatre and movie actress, and Mehmet İbrahim Karaca of [[Azeris in Turkey|Azerbaijani]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;aksiyon040216&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Cem Karaca:Sanat Yapar|first=Sema|last=Sak|date=2004-02-16|accessdate=2007-03-04|publisher=Aksiyon| url=http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/detay.php?id=11171 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930155104/http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/detay.php?id=11171 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}{{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first group was called ''Dynamites'' and was a classic rock cover band. Later he joined ''Jaguars'', an [[Elvis Presley]] cover band. In 1967, he started to write his own music, forming the band ''Apaşlar'' (The Apaches) , his first [[Turkish language|Turkish-language]] group. In 1969, Karaca and bass-player Serhan Karabay left Apaşlar and started an original Anatolian group called ''Kardaşlar'' (The Brothers). 

In 1972, Karaca joined the group ''[[Moğollar]]'' (The Mongols) and wrote one of his best-known songs, &quot;''Namus Belası''&quot;. However, [[Cahit Berkay]], the leader of Moğollar, wanted an international name for his band, and he left for [[France]] to take the group to another level. Karaca, who wanted to continue his Anatolian beat sound, left Moğollar and started his own band ''Dervişan'' (Dervishes) in 1974. Karaca and Dervişan sang poetic and [[progressive rock|progressive]] songs. 

In the 1970s, Turkey's image was damaged by political violence between supporters of the left and the right, separatist movements and the rise of [[Islamism]]. As the country fell into chaos, the government suspected Cem Karaca of involvement. At times he was accused of treason for being a separatist thinker and a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]. The Turkish government tried to portray Karaca as a man, who was unknowingly writing songs to start a revolution. One politician was quoted as saying, &quot;Karaca is simply calling citizens to a bloody war against the state.&quot; Dervişan was ultimately dissolved at the end of 1977. He later founded in 1978 ''Edirdahan'', an acronym for &quot;from Edirne to Ardahan&quot;; the westernmost and the easternmost provinces of Turkey. He recorded one LP with ''Edirdahan''.

In early 1979, he left for [[West Germany]] for business reasons. Turkey continued to spin out of control with military curfews and eventually a military coup on September 12, 1980. General [[Kenan Evren]] took over the government and temporarily closed all the nation's political parties. After the coup, many intellectual people, including writers, artists and journalists, were arrested. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Karaca by the government of Turkey. 

The state invited Karaca back to the country several times, but Karaca, not knowing what would happen upon his return, decided not to come back.

While he was in [[Germany]], his father died, but he could not return to attend the funeral. After some time, the Turkish government decided to strip Cem Karaca of his Turkish citizenship, keeping the arrest warrant active.

Several years later, in 1987, the [[prime minister of Turkey|prime minister]] and leader of the Turkish [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]], [[Turgut Özal]], issued an amnesty for Karaca. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Turkey. His return also brought a new album by him, ''Merhaba Gençler ve Her zaman Genç Kalanlar'' (&quot;''Hello Young Ones and Everyone Who'd Always Felt Young''&quot;), one of his most powerful works. His return home was greeted happily by his fans, but during his absence, Karaca had lost the youthful audience and acquired few new listeners. He died on February 8, 2004 and was interred at [[Karacaahmet Cemetery]] in [[Üsküdar]] district of Istanbul.

'''Calista Kay Flockhart''' (born November 11, 1964) is an American actress who is primarily recognized for her work in television. She is best known for playing the [[Ally McBeal (character)|title character]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] comedy-drama series ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (1997–2002) for which she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]]. She currently stars as [[Sally Field]]’s character’s daughter, [[Kitty Walker McCallister]], on the [[American Broadcasting System|ABC]] drama, ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]''.

==Early life==
Flockhart was born in [[Freeport, Illinois]], the daughter of Kay, a teacher of [[English studies|English]], and Ronald Flockhart, an executive for [[Kraft Foods]].&lt;ref name=elp&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schneider|first=Karen S.|coauthors=|title=Arguing Her Case|pages=|publisher=People Magazine|date=1998-11-09|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126712,00.html|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents are retired and live in Morristown, Tennessee. She has one older brother, Gary. Her mother, Kay Calista, reversed her own first and middle names in naming her '''Calista Kay'''. Calista also had a great-grandmother named &quot;Calista&quot;.

Because her father's job required the family to move often, Flockhart and her brother grew up in [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Norwich (city), New York|Norwich]] in [[New York]], and [[New Jersey]]. As a child, she wrote a play called ''Toyland'' in which she performed to a small audience at a dinner party.

Flockhart attended [[Shawnee High School (New Jersey)|Shawnee High School]] in [[Medford Township, New Jersey]]. Following her graduation in 1983, Flockhart attended the [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]] at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. While there, she attended a specialized and competitive class, lasting from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. In her sophomore year at Rutgers, Flockhart met aspiring actress [[Jane Krakowski]], the best friend of her roommate. Later they would both work together on ''Ally McBeal''.

Flockhart's acting ability was recognized when William Esper (Mason Gross' theatre director and Flockhart's acting teacher) made an exception to policy by allowing Flockhart to perform on the main stage. Though this venue is usually reserved for juniors and seniors, Harold Scott insisted that Flockhart perform there in his production of [[William Inge]]'s ''Picnic''. Flockhart graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in theatre in 1988, as one of only a few students who successfully completed the course. She was inducted into the Rutgers Hall of Distinguished Alumni on May 3, 2003.

After receiving her degree, Flockhart moved to [[New York City]] in 1989, where she remained until 1997, living with three other women in a two-bedroom apartment and working as a [[waitress]] and [[aerobics instructor]], while she simultaneously sought auditions.

==Career==
===Early career===
In spring 1989, Flockhart made her first television appearance in a minor role in an episode of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' as a babysitter. She made her professional debut on the New York stage, appearing in ''Beside Herself'' alongside [[Melissa Joan Hart]], at the [[Circle Repertory Theatre]]. Two years later, Flockhart appeared in the television movie ''Darrow''. Though she later appeared in films ''[[Naked in New York]]'' (1993) and ''Getting In'' (1994), her first substantial speaking part in a film was in ''[[Quiz Show]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]].

Flockhart debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1994, as Laura in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''. Actress [[Julie Harris]] felt Flockhart should be hired without further auditions, claiming that she seemed ideal for the part. Flockhart received a [[Clarence Derwent Award]] for her performance. In 1995, Flockhart became acquainted with actors such as [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] when she appeared in the movie ''Drunks''. Later that year, Flockhart starred in ''Jane Doe'' as a drug addict. In 1996, Flockhart appeared as the daughter of [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Gene Hackman]]'s characters in ''[[The Birdcage]]''. Throughout that year, she continued to work on Broadway, playing the role of Natasha in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''.

===''Ally McBeal''===
In 1997 Flockhart was requested to audition for the starring role in [[David E. Kelley]]'s [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television]] series, ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Kelley, having heard of Flockhart, wanted her to audition for the contract part. Though Flockhart at first hesitated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a negotiable contract, she was swayed by the script and traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to audition for the part, which she won. She earned a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the role in 1998. Flockhart also appeared on the June 29, 1998, cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIME Magazine Cover: Is Feminism Dead?|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19980629,00.html|date=June 29, 1998|publisher=''[[Time (magazine){{!}}Time]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; placed as the newest iteration in the evolution of [[feminism]], relating to the ongoing debate about the role depicted by her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988616,00.html|title=It's All About Me!|publisher=''[[Time (magazine){{!}}Time]]''|author=Ginia Bellafante|date=June 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her professional career, Flockhart has maintained her naturally lean figure. However, many have commented that Flockhart had become dangerously thin, particularly when the actress made [[red carpet]] appearances in clothing that revealed a somewhat emaciated physique. She had maintained throughout the show's run that she was never diagnosed with either [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] or [[bulimia]], nor was she a user of illegal drugs. She did remark, however, that while starring in the show she refrained from eating sweets, retaining her slimness with intense workouts and running.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In 2006, she admitted that she had a problem at the time, and was &quot;exercising too much&quot; and &quot;eating too little&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taking beauty's measure|author=Jenifer Goodwin|publisher=''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20060924-9999-lz1c24beauty.html|date=September 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Flockhart played the role of Helena in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', a 1999 film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s play. In 2000, she appeared in ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'' and ''[[Bash: Latter-Day Plays]]'', later accompanying [[Eve Ensler]] to [[Kenya]] in order to protest violence against women, particularly [[Female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]. Flockhart also starred in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Ensler's ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.

In 2004, Flockhart appeared as [[Matthew Broderick]]'s deranged girlfriend in ''[[The Last Shot]]''. In the same year, Flockhart travelled to [[Spain]] for the filming of ''[[Fragile (2005 film)|Fragile]]'', which premiered in September 2005 at the [[Venice Film Festival]].

She was offered the role of [[Susan Mayer]] on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', but declined. The role went to [[Teri Hatcher]]. Flockhart currently stars as [[Kitty Walker]], opposite [[Sally Field]], [[Rachel Griffiths]] and [[Matthew Rhys]], in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] prime time series ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'', which premiered in September 2006 in the time slot after ''Desperate Housewives''.  Flockhart's character was significant throughout the series first four years, but it was announced her schedule of appearances will be reduced for the 2010–2011 season, coinciding with the departure of TV husband [[Rob Lowe]].

==Personal life==
She dated director [[Sam Mendes]] in the late spring and summer of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001222/bio&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart at the 2009 Deauville American Film Festival-02.jpg|thumb|With [[Harrison Ford]] at the 2009 [[Deauville American Film Festival]]]]
As of 2008, Flockhart is the national spokesperson for [[Peace Over Violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Spokesperson|publisher=Peace Over Violence|url=http://peaceoverviolence.org/organization/who_we_are/national_spokesperson|accessdate=January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2001, Flockhart adopted a ten day old baby, Liam (born January 1, 2001), in San Diego.

In March 2009 it was reported that Flockhart became engaged to [[Harrison Ford]] on Valentine's Day, after more than seven years together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20267173,00.html|title=Harrison Ford Proposes to Calista Flockhart|publisher=''[[People (magazine){{!}}People]]''|date=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, 2010, they were married in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. The ceremony was presided over by [[Governor of New Mexico|Governor]] [[Bill Richardson]] and [[New Mexico Supreme Court]] Chief Justice Charles Daniels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20394673,00.html|title=Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart Get Married!|publisher=''[[People (magazine){{!}}People]]''|date=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Convolution of box signal with itself2.gif|thumb|right|475px|Convolution of two square pulses: the resulting waveform is a triangular pulse. One of the functions (in this case ''g'') is first reflected about &lt;math&gt;\tau=0&lt;/math&gt; and then offset by ''t'', making it &lt;math&gt;g(t-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;. The area under the resulting product gives the convolution at ''t''. The horizontal axis is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; for ''f'' and ''g'', and t for &lt;math&gt;f\ast g&lt;/math&gt;.]]

[[File:Convolution of spiky function with box2.gif|thumb|right|475px|Convolution of a square pulse (as input signal) with the impulse response of an RC circuit to obtain the output signal waveform. The integral of their product is the area of the yellow region. In both animations the function ''g'' is symmetric, and so is unchanged under reflection.]]

In [[mathematics]] and, in particular, [[functional analysis]], '''convolution''' is a [[operation (mathematics)|mathematical operation]] on two [[function (mathematics)|function]]s ''f'' and ''g'', producing a third function that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the original functions.  Convolution is similar to [[cross-correlation]].  It has applications that include [[statistics]], [[computer vision]], [[image processing|image]] and [[signal processing]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[differential equations]].

The convolution can be defined for functions on [[group (mathematics)|groups]] other than [[Euclidean space]].  In particular, the [[circular convolution]] can be defined for [[periodic function]]s (that is, functions on the [[circle]]), and the discrete convolution can be defined for functions on the set of [[integers]].  These generalizations of the convolution have applications in the field of [[numerical analysis]] and [[numerical linear algebra]], and in the design and implementation of [[finite impulse response]] filters in signal processing.

Computing the inverse of the convolution operation is known as [[deconvolution]].

==History==

The operation

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^t\varphi(s)\psi(t-s) \, ds, \qquad  0\le t&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

is a particular case of composition products considered by the Italian mathematician [[Vito Volterra]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;
According to 
[Lothar von Wolfersdorf (2000), &quot;Einige Klassen quadratischer Integralgleichungen&quot;,
''Sitzungsberichte der Sächsischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig'',
''Mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche Klasse'', Band '''128''', Heft 2, 6–7], the source is Volterra, Vito (1913),
&quot;Leçons sur les fonctions de linges&quot;. Gauthier-Villars, Paris 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

Convolution is also sometimes called &quot;Faltung&quot; (which means ''folding'' in [[German language|German]]); both ''Faltung'' and ''convolution'' were used as early as 1903, though the definition is rather unfamiliar in older uses.&lt;ref&gt;

The term ''Faltung'' was sometimes used in English through the 1940s, before the notion of convolution became widely used, along with other terms such as ''composition product'', ''superposition integral'', and ''Carson's integral''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definition==

The convolution of ''ƒ'' and ''g'' is written ''ƒ''∗''g'', using an asterisk or star. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted. As such, it is a particular kind of [[integral transform]]:

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;(f * g )(t)\ \ \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;
|&lt;math&gt;\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)\, g(t - \tau)\, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t-\tau)\, g(\tau)\, d\tau.&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ([[#Properties|commutativity]])
|}

While the symbol ''t'' is used above, it need not represent the time domain.  But in that context, the convolution formula can be described as a weighted average of the function ''ƒ''(''τ'') at the moment ''t'' where the weighting is given by ''g''(&amp;minus;''τ'') simply shifted by amount ''t''.  As ''t'' changes, the weighting function emphasizes different parts of the input function.

More generally, if ''f'' and ''g'' are complex-valued functions on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, then their convolution may be defined as the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;(f * g )(x) = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d} f(y)g(x-y)\,dy = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d} f(x-y)g(y)\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

# Express each function in terms of a [[Free variables and bound variables|dummy variable]] &lt;math&gt;\tau.&lt;/math&gt;
# Reflect one of the functions: &lt;math&gt;g(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;→&lt;math&gt;g(-\tau).&lt;/math&gt;
# Add a time-offset, ''t'', which allows &lt;math&gt;g(t-\tau)&lt;/math&gt; to slide along the &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;-axis.
# Start ''t'' at -∞ and slide it all the way to +∞.  Wherever the two functions intersect, find the integral of their product.  In other words, compute a &lt;u&gt;sliding&lt;/u&gt;, weighted-average of function &lt;math&gt;f(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, where the weighting function is &lt;math&gt;g(-\tau).&lt;/math&gt;
:The resulting waveform (not shown here) is the convolution of functions ''f'' and ''g''.  If '''''f''(''t'')''' is a [[unit impulse]], the result of this process is simply '''''g''(''t'')''', which is therefore called the [[impulse response]].

=== Circular convolution ===
{{Main|Circular convolution}}

When a function ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is periodic, with period ''T'', then for functions, ''ƒ'', such that ''ƒ''∗''g''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; exists, the convolution is also periodic and identical to:

:&lt;math&gt;(f * g_T)(t) \equiv \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} \left[\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau + kT)\right] g_T(t - \tau)\ d\tau,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is an arbitrary choice.  The summation is called a [[periodic summation]] of the function ''ƒ''.

If ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[periodic summation]] of another function, ''g'', then ƒ∗''g''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is known as a ''circular'', ''cyclic'', or ''periodic'' convolution of ''ƒ'' and ''g''.

==Discrete convolution==

For complex-valued functions ƒ, ''g'' defined on the set '''Z''' of integers, the '''discrete convolution''' of ƒ and ''g'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;(f * g)[n]\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} f[m]\, g[n - m]&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} f[n-m]\, g[m].&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ([[#Properties|commutativity]])

When multiplying two [[polynomial]]s, the coefficients of the product are given by the convolution of the original coefficient [[sequence]]s, extended with zeros where necessary to avoid undefined terms; this is known as the [[Cauchy product]] of the coefficients of the two polynomials.

===Circular discrete convolution===

When a function ''g''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is periodic, with period N, then for functions, ƒ, such that ƒ∗''g''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; exists, the convolution is also periodic and identical to:

:&lt;math&gt;(f * g_N)[n] \equiv \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \left(\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} {f}[m+kN] \right) g_N[n-m].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The summation on ''k'' is called a [[periodic summation]] of the function ƒ.

If ''g''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[periodic summation]] of another function, ''g'', then ƒ∗''g''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is known as a [[circular convolution]] of ƒ and ''g''.

When the non-zero durations of both ƒ and ''g'' are limited to the interval [0, ''N''-1], ƒ∗''g''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; reduces to these common forms:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(f * g_N)[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} f[m]\ g_N[n-m]\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}
::::&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{m=0}^n f[m]\ g[n-m] + \sum_{m=n+1}^{N-1} f[m]\ g[N+n-m]\,&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} f[m]\ g[(n-m)_{\mod{N}}]\quad \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\quad (f *_N g)[n].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The notation &lt;math&gt;(f *_N g)\,&lt;/math&gt; for ''cyclic convolution'' denotes convolution over the [[cyclic group]] of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''N'']].

===Fast convolution algorithms===

In many situations, discrete convolutions can be converted to circular convolutions so that fast transforms with a convolution property can be used to implement the computation.  For example, convolution of digit sequences is the kernel operation in [[multiplication]] of multi-digit numbers, which can therefore be efficiently implemented with transform techniques ({{harvnb|Knuth|1997|loc=§4.3.3.C}}; {{harvnb|von zur Gathen|Gerhard|2003|loc=§8.2}}).

{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} requires ''N'' arithmetic operations per output value and ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; operations for ''N'' outputs.  That can be significantly reduced with any of several fast algorithms.  [[Digital signal processing]] and other applications typically use fast convolution algorithms to reduce the cost of the convolution to O(''N'' log ''N'') complexity.

The most common fast convolution algorithms use [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms via the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Circular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem|circular convolution theorem]].  Specifically, the [[circular convolution]] of two finite-length sequences is found by taking an FFT of each sequence, multiplying pointwise, and then performing an inverse FFT.  Convolutions of the type defined above are then efficiently implemented using that technique in conjunction with zero-extension and/or discarding portions of the output.  Other fast convolution algorithms, such as the [[Schönhage–Strassen algorithm]], use fast Fourier transforms in other [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s.

==Domain of definition==
The convolution of two complex-valued functions on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(f*g)(x) = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d}f(y)g(x-y)\,dy&lt;/math&gt;
is well-defined only if ƒ and ''g'' decay sufficiently rapidly at infinity in order for the integral to exist.  Conditions for the existence of the convolution may be tricky, since a blow-up in ''g'' at infinity can be easily offset by sufficiently rapid decay in ƒ.  The question of existence thus may involve different conditions on ƒ and ''g''.

===Compactly supported functions===
If ƒ and ''g'' are [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[continuous function]]s, then their convolution exists, and is also compactly supported and continuous {{harv|Hörmander}}.   More generally, if either function (say ƒ) is compactly supported and the other is [[locally integrable function|locally integrable]], then the convolution ƒ∗''g'' is well-defined and continuous.

===Integrable functions===
The convolution of ''ƒ'' and ''g'' exists if ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are both [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable functions]] (in [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)]]), and in this case ƒ∗''g'' is also integrable {{harv|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=Theorem 1.3}}.  This is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem#Tonelli's theorem|Tonelli's theorem]].  Likewise, if ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) where 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞, then ''ƒ''∗''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) and

:&lt;math&gt;\|{f}*g\|_p\le \|f\|_1\|g\|_p. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the particular case ''p''= 1, this shows that ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[Banach algebra]] under the convolution (and equality of the two sides holds if ''f'' and ''g'' are non-negative almost everywhere).

More generally, [[Young's inequality#Young's inequality for convolutions|Young's inequality]] implies that the convolution is a continuous bilinear map between suitable L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; spaces.  Specifically, if 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p'',''q'',''r''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞ satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{r}+1,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\|f*g\|_r\le \|f\|_p\|g\|_q,\quad f\in L^p,\ g\in L^q,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the convolution is a continuous bilinear mapping from ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''L''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Functions of rapid decay===
In addition to compactly supported functions and integrable functions, functions that have sufficiently rapid decay at infinity can also be convolved.  An important feature of the convolution is that if ƒ and ''g'' both decay rapidly, then ƒ∗''g'' also decays rapidly.  In particular, if ƒ and ''g'' are [[rapidly decreasing function]]s, then so is the convolution ƒ∗''g''.  Combined with the fact that convolution commutes with differentiation (see '''Properties'''), it follows that the class of [[Schwartz function]]s is closed under convolution.

===Distributions===
{{Main|Distribution (mathematics)}}
Under some circumstances, it is possible to define the convolution of a function with a distribution, or of two distributions.  If ƒ is a compactly supported function and ''g'' is a distribution, then ƒ∗''g'' is a smooth function defined by a distributional formula analogous to

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^d} {f}(y)g(x-y)\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, it is possible to extend the definition of the convolution in a unique way so that the associative law

:&lt;math&gt;f*(g*\varphi) = (f*g)*\varphi\,&lt;/math&gt;

remains valid in the case where ƒ is a distribution, and ''g'' a compactly supported distribution {{harv|Hörmander|1983|loc=§4.2}}.

===Measures===

The convolution of any two [[Borel measure]]s μ and ν of [[bounded variation]] is the measure λ defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^d} f(x)d\lambda(x) = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d}\int_{\mathbf{R}^d}f(x+y)\,d\mu(x)d\nu(y).&lt;/math&gt;
This agrees with the convolution defined above when μ and ν are regarded as distributions, as well as the convolution of L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; functions when μ and ν are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

The convolution of measures also satisfies the following version of Young's inequality
:&lt;math&gt;\|\mu*\nu\|\le \|\mu\|\|\nu\|&lt;/math&gt;
where the norm is the [[total variation]] of a measure.  Because the space of measures of bounded variation is a [[Banach space]], convolution of measures can be treated with standard methods of [[functional analysis]] that may not apply for the convolution of distributions.

==Properties==
===Algebraic properties===
{{See also|Convolution algebra}}
The convolution defines a product on the [[linear space]] of integrable functions.  This product satisfies the following algebraic properties, which formally mean that the space of integrable functions with the product given by convolution is a [[commutative algebra]] without [[identity element|identity]] {{harv|Strichartz|1994|loc=§3.3}}.  Other linear spaces of functions, such as the space of continuous functions of compact support, are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the convolution, and so also form commutative algebras.

;[[Commutativity]]
: &lt;math&gt;f * g = g * f  \,&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Associativity]]
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g  * h) = (f  * g)  * h \,&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Distributivity]]
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g + h) = (f  * g) + (f  * h) \,&lt;/math&gt;

;Associativity with scalar multiplication
: &lt;math&gt;a (f  * g) = (a f)  * g = f  * (a g) \,&lt;/math&gt;
for any real (or complex) number &lt;math&gt;{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Multiplicative identity]]
No algebra of functions possesses an identity for the convolution.  The lack of identity is typically not a major inconvenience, since most collections of functions on which the convolution is performed can be convolved with a [[Dirac delta|delta distribution]] or, at the very least (as is the case of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) admit [[Nascent delta function|approximations to the identity]].  The linear space of compactly supported distributions does, however, admit an identity under the convolution.  Specifically,
:&lt;math&gt;f*\delta = f\,&lt;/math&gt;
where δ is the delta distribution.

;Inverse element

Some distributions have an [[inverse element]] for the convolution, ''S''&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;1)&lt;/sup&gt;, which is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;S^{(-1)} * S = \delta. \,&lt;/math&gt;
The set of invertible distributions forms an [[abelian group]] under the convolution.

;Complex conjugation

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{f * g} = \overline{f} * \overline{g} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

===Integration===
If ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are integrable functions, then the integral of their convolution on the whole space is simply obtained as the product of their integrals:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^d}(f*g)(x)dx=\left(\int_{\mathbf{R}^d}f(x)dx\right)\left(\int_{\mathbf{R}^d}g(x)dx\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This follows from [[Fubini's theorem]].  The same result holds if ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are only assumed to be nonnegative measurable functions, by [[Fubini's theorem#Tonelli's theorem|Tonelli's theorem]].

===Differentiation===
In the one-variable case, 

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}({f} * g) = \frac{df}{dx}  * g = {f} * \frac{dg}{dx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d''/''dx'' is the [[derivative]].  More generally, in the case of functions of several variables, an analogous formula holds with the [[partial derivative]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}({f} * g)(x) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} * g = {f} * \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

A particular consequence of this is that the convolution can be viewed as a &quot;smoothing&quot; operation: the convolution of ''ƒ'' and ''g'' is differentiable as many times as ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are together.

These identities hold under the precise condition that ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are absolutely integrable and at least one of them has an absolutely integrable (L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) weak derivative, as a consequence of [[Young's inequality]].  For instance, when ''ƒ'' is continuously differentiable with compact support, and ''g'' is an arbitrary locally integrable function,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}({f} * g) = \frac{df}{dx}  * g.&lt;/math&gt;
These identities also hold much more broadly in the sense of tempered distributions if one of ''ƒ'' or ''g'' is a compactly supported distribution or a Schwartz function and the other is a tempered distribution. On the other hand, two positive integrable and infinitely differentiable functions may have a nowhere continuous convolution.

In the discrete case, the [[difference operator]] ''D'' ƒ(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ƒ(''n'') satisfies an analogous relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;D(f*g) = (Df)*g = f*(Dg).\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Convolution theorem===
The [[convolution theorem]] states that 

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}\{f * g\} = k\cdot \mathcal{F}\{f\}\cdot \mathcal{F}\{g\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}\{f\}\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant that depends on the specific [[Normalizing constant|normalization]] of the Fourier transform (see “[[Fourier transform#Properties of the Fourier transform|Properties of the Fourier transform]]”). Versions of this theorem also hold for the [[Laplace transform]], [[two-sided Laplace transform]], [[Z-transform]] and [[Mellin transform]].

See also the less trivial [[Titchmarsh convolution theorem]].

===Translation invariance===
The convolution commutes with translations, meaning that

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_x ({f}*g) = (\tau_x f)*g = {f}*(\tau_x g)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where τ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;ƒ is the translation of the function ƒ by ''x'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;(\tau_x f)(y) = f(y-x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

If ƒ is a [[Schwartz function]], then τ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;ƒ is the convolution with a translated Dirac delta function τ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;ƒ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ∗τ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; δ. So translation invariance of the convolution of Schwartz functions is a consequence of the associativity of convolution.

Furthermore, under certain conditions, convolution is the most general translation invariant operation.  Informally speaking, the following holds

* Suppose that ''S'' is a [[linear operator]] acting on functions which commutes with translations:  ''S''(τ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;ƒ)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;τ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S''ƒ) for all ''x''.  Then ''S'' is given as convolution with a function (or distribution) ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;; that is  ''S''ƒ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;∗ƒ.

Thus any translation invariant operation can be represented as a convolution.  Convolutions play an important role in the study of [[time-invariant system]]s, and especially [[LTI system theory]].  The representing function ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[impulse response]] of the transformation ''S''.

A more precise version of the theorem quoted above requires specifying the class of functions on which the convolution is defined, and also requires assuming in addition that ''S'' must be a [[continuous linear operator]] with respect to the appropriate [[topology]].  It is known, for instance, that every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution with a finite [[Borel measure]].  More generally, every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; for 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞ is the convolution with a [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distribution]] whose [[Fourier transform]] is bounded.  To wit, they are all given by bounded [[Fourier multiplier]]s.

==Convolutions on groups==
If ''G'' is a suitable [[group (mathematics)|group]] endowed with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] λ, and if ''f'' and ''g'' are real or complex valued [[Lebesgue integral|integrable]] functions on&amp;nbsp;''G'', then we can define their convolution by

:&lt;math&gt;(f * g)(x) = \int_G f(y) g(y^{-1}x)\,d\lambda(y). \,&lt;/math&gt;

In typical cases of interest ''G'' is a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] and λ is a (left-) [[Haar measure]].  In that case, unless ''G'' is [[unimodular group|unimodular]], the convolution defined in this way is not the same as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int f(xy^{-1})g(y)d\lambda(y)}&lt;/math&gt;.  The preference of one over the other is made so that convolution with a fixed function ''g'' commutes with left translation in the group:

:&lt;math&gt;L_h(f*g) = (L_hf)*g = f*(L_hg).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the convention is also required for consistency with the definition of the convolution of measures given below.  However, with a right instead of a left Haar measure, the latter integral is preferred over the former.

On locally compact [[abelian group]]s, a version of the [[convolution theorem]] holds: the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise product of the Fourier transforms. The [[circle group]] '''T''' with the Lebesgue measure is an immediate example.  For a fixed ''g'' in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''), we have the following familiar operator acting on the [[Hilbert space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''): 

:&lt;math&gt;T {f}(x) =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{\mathbb{T}} {f}(y) g( x - y) dy.&lt;/math&gt;

The operator ''T'' is [[compact operator on Hilbert space|compact]]. A direct calculation shows that its adjoint ''T*'' is convolution with 

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}(-y).&lt;/math&gt;

By the commutativity property cited above, ''T'' is [[normal operator|normal]]: ''T*T = TT*''. Also, ''T'' commutes with the translation operators.  Consider the family ''S'' of operators consisting of all such convolutions and the translation operators.  Then ''S'' is a commuting family of normal operators. According to [[compact operator on Hilbert space|spectral theory]], there exists an orthonormal basis {''h&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} that simultaneously diagonalizes ''S''. This characterizes convolutions on the circle. Specifically, we have

:&lt;math&gt;h_k (x) = e^{ikx}, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z},\;&lt;/math&gt;

which are precisely the [[Character (mathematics)|character]]s of&amp;nbsp;'''T'''.  Each convolution is a compact [[multiplication operator]] in this basis.  This can be viewed as a version of the convolution theorem discussed above.

A discrete example is a finite [[cyclic group]] of order&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Convolution operators are here represented by [[circulant matrices]], and can be diagonalized by the [[discrete Fourier transform]].

A similar result holds for compact groups (not necessarily abelian): the matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional [[unitary representation]]s form an orthonormal basis in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[Peter-Weyl theorem]], and an analog of the convolution theorem continues to hold, along with many other aspects of [[harmonic analysis]] that depend on the Fourier transform.

==Convolution of measures==
Let ''G'' be a topological group.
If μ and ν are finite [[Borel measure]]s on a group ''G'', then their convolution μ∗ν is defined by 

&lt;!--

Groups are written multiplicatively, so please don't change this to &quot;+&quot;.--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\mu * \nu)(E) = \int\!\!\!\int 1_E(xy) \,d\mu(x) \,d\nu(y)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--

--&gt;

for each measurable subset ''E'' of ''G''.  The convolution is also a finite measure, whose [[total variation]] satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\|\mu * \nu\| \le \|\mu\| \|\nu\|.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case when ''G'' is [[locally compact]] with (left-)[[Haar measure]] λ, and μ and ν are [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] with respect to a λ, [[Radon–Nikodym theorem|so that each has a density function]], then the convolution μ∗ν is also absolutely continuous, and its density function is just the convolution of the two separate density functions.

If μ and ν are [[probability measure]]s, then the convolution μ∗ν is the [[probability distribution]] of the sum ''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Y'' of two [[statistical independence|independent]] [[random variable]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' whose respective distributions are μ and ν.

==Bialgebras==
Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;Δ,&amp;nbsp;∇,&amp;nbsp;''ε'',&amp;nbsp;''η'') be a [[bialgebra]] with comultiplication Δ, multiplication ∇, unit η, and counit ε.  The convolution is a product defined on the [[endomorphism algebra]] End(''X'') as follows.  Let φ, ψ&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;End(''X''), that is, φ,ψ&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X'' are functions that respect all algebraic structure of ''X'', then the convolution φ∗ψ is defined as the composition

:&lt;math&gt;X \xrightarrow{\Delta} X\otimes X \xrightarrow{\phi\otimes\psi} X\otimes X \xrightarrow{\nabla} X. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The convolution appears notably in the definition of [[Hopf algebra]]s {{harv|Kassel|1995|loc=§III.3}}.  A bialgebra is a Hopf algebra if and only if it has an antipode: an endomorphism ''S'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt;S * \operatorname{id}_X = \operatorname{id}_X * S = \eta\circ\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Gold_Spider_SEM_sample_Sharp.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Example of digital image sharpening using three 2D discrete convolutions (one for each [[primary color]]). The [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] used is related to the [[discrete Laplace operator]]. The spider is gold-coated for viewing with a [[scanning electron microscope]].]]
Convolution and related operations are found in many applications of engineering and mathematics.
*In [[electrical engineering]], the convolution of one function (the [[input signal]]) with a second function (the [[impulse response]]) gives the output of a [[linear time-invariant system]] (LTI).  At any given moment, the output is an accumulated effect of all the prior values of the input function, with the most recent values typically having the most influence (expressed as a multiplicative factor).  The impulse response function provides that factor as a function of the elapsed time since each input value occurred.
** In [[digital signal processing]] and [[image processing]] applications, the entire input function is often available for computing every sample of the output function.  In that case, the constraint that each output is the effect of only prior inputs can be relaxed.
** Convolution amplifies or attenuates each frequency component of the input independently of the other components.
* In [[statistics]], as noted above, a weighted [[moving average model|moving average]] is a convolution.
* In [[probability theory]], the [[probability distribution]] of the sum of two [[independent (probability)|independent]] [[random variable]]s is the convolution of their individual distributions.
* In [[optics]], many kinds of &quot;blur&quot; are described by convolutions. A [[shadow]] (e.g., the shadow on the table when you hold your hand between the table and a light source) is the convolution of the [[shape]] of the light source that is casting the shadow and the object whose shadow is being cast. An out-of-focus photograph is the convolution of the sharp image with the shape of the iris diaphragm. The photographic term for this is [[bokeh]].
* Similarly, in [[digital image processing]], convolutional filtering plays an important role in many important [[algorithm]]s in [[edge detection]] and related processes.
* In linear [[acoustics]], an echo is the convolution of the original sound with a function representing the various objects that are reflecting it.
* In artificial [[reverberation]] ([[digital signal processing]], pro audio), convolution is used to map the [[impulse response]] of a real room on a digital audio signal (see previous and next point for additional information).
* In time-resolved [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], the excitation signal can be treated as a chain of delta pulses, and the measured fluorescence is a sum of exponential decays from each delta pulse.
* In radiotherapy treatment planning systems, most part of all modern codes of calculation applies a convolution-superposition algorithm.
* In [[physics]], wherever there is a [[linear system]] with a &quot;[[superposition principle]]&quot;, a convolution operation makes an appearance.
* In [[kernel density estimation]], a distribution is estimated from sample points by convolution with a kernel, such as an isotropic Gaussian. {{harv|Diggle|1995}}.
* In [[computational fluid dynamics]], the [[large eddy simulation]] (LES) [[turbulence model]] uses the convolution operation to lower the range of length scales necessary in computation thereby reducing computational cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Calico Sample.JPG|thumb|A piece of calico used in a shopping bag]]
'''Calico''' is a [[plain weave|plain-woven]] [[textile]] made from unbleached, and often not fully processed, cotton. It may contain unseparated husk parts, for example. The fabric is less coarse and thick than canvas or denim, but owing to its unfinished and undyed appearance, it is still very cheap. Originally from the city of [[Kozhikode]], [[Kerala]], [[India]] (known by Europeans as ''Calicut'' in the 11th century).  The fabric was made by the traditional weavers called [[chaliyan]]s. The raw fabric was dyed and printed in bright hues and [[Chintz|calico prints]] became popular in Europe. 

In Australia, calico is the material used to make sample bags for the minerals exploration &amp; mining industry.

==History==
'''Calico''' originated in [[Kozhikode]], [[India]] (also known as Calicut) during the 11th century.&lt;ref name=eb-calico/&gt; It was mentioned in Indian literature by the 12th century when the writer [[Hemacandra]] described calico fabric prints with a lotus design.&lt;ref name=eb-calico&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica (2008). ''calico''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century calico from [[Gujarat]] made its appearance in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=eb-calico/&gt; Trade with Europe followed from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref name=eb-calico/&gt;
Calico was woven using [[Surat]] cotton for both the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]].

=== The politics of cotton ===
In the eighteenth century, England was famous for its [[woollen]] and [[worsted|worsted cloth]]. That industry, centred in the east and south in towns such as [[Norwich]], jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only {{convert|1,985,868|lb|kg}} of cotton-wool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to {{convert|1,545,472|lb|kg}}. This was due to commercial legislation to protect the woollen industry.&lt;ref name=E296&gt;{{Harvnb|Espinasse|1874|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheap [[Chintz|calico prints]], imported by the [[East India Company]] from &quot;[[Hindustan]]&quot;, had become popular. In 1700 an [[Act of Parliament|&lt;!--Act 11 William III|--&gt;Act of Parliament]] was passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused grey cloth (calico that had not been finished—dyed or printed) to be imported instead, and these were printed in southern England with the popular patterns. Also, Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, known as [[fustian]], which they sent to London to be finished.&lt;ref name=E296/&gt; Cotton-wool imports recovered and by 1720 were almost back to their 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers, in true [[Protectionism|protectionist]] style, claimed that this was taking away jobs from workers in [[Coventry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Espinasse|1874|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[7 George 3 cap 7|law]] was passed, to fine anyone caught wearing any printed or stained calico; muslins, neckcloths and fustians were exempted. It was this exemption that the Lancashire manufactures exploited. The use of coloured cotton weft with [[linen]] warp was permitted by the [[1736 Manchester Act]]. There now was an artificial demand for woven cloth. In 1764, {{convert|3,870,392|lb|kg}} of cotton-wool was imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Espinasse|1874|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calico printing ===
Early Indian chintzes, that is a glazed calico with large floral pattern,  were primarily produced by painting techniques.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, A History of Calico Printing in Great Britain, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the hues were applied by means of wooden blocks, and it was the [[Woodblock printing|wooden block printing]] that was used in London. Confusingly, linen and silk that was printed by this method was known as ''linen calicoes'' and ''silk calicoes''. The early European calicoes (1680) would thus be a cheap equal weft and warp plain weave cotton fabric in white, cream or unbleached cotton, with a block printed design using a single [[Rose madder|alizarin dye]], fixed with two mordants giving a red and black pattern. Polychromatic prints could be done, with two sets of blocks and an additional blue dye. The Indian taste was for dark printed backgrounds while the European market preferred a pattern on a cream base. As the century progressed the European preference moved from the large chintz patterns to a smaller, tighter patterns.&lt;ref name=dreamstress/&gt;

Thomas Bell patented the technique of printing by copper rollers in 1783, and the first machine was set up by [[Livesey, Hargreaves &amp; Co]]  near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in 1785. Production of printed cloth in Lancashire in 1750 was estimated to be 50,000 pieces of {{convert|30|yd|m}}, but in 1850 it was 20,000,000 pieces.&lt;ref name=Turnbull/&gt; From 1888, block printing was limited to short run specialist jobs. After 1880, profits from printing became smaller, there was over capacity and the firms started to form combines. The first was when 3 Scottish firms formed the United Turkey Red Co. Ltd in 1897, and the second, in 1899, was the much larger Calico Printers Association. 46 printing concerns and 13 merchants combined, representing 85% of the British printing capacity. Some of this capacity was removed and in 1901 they had 48% of the trade. In 1916, they and the other printers joined and formed a trade association. This then set minimum prices for each 'price section' of the industry. This held until 1954 when it was challenged by the government Monopolies Commission. Over the intervening period much trade had been lost overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;M&amp;M&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=William|title=Report on the Process of Calico Printing|url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/ulcc-bin/htsearch/Default.aspx?config=COMPCOM2&amp;sort=score&amp;matchesperpage=20&amp;restrict=&amp;words=Calico+printing|accessdate=2010-12-08|date=1954-04-13|publisher=Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission|location=House of Commons, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Australia and New Zealand:
*Calico—simple, cheap equal weft and warp plain weave fabric in white, cream or unbleached cotton.
*Muslin—a very fine, light plain weave cotton fabric.
*Muslin gauze—muslin.
*Gauze—extremely soft and fine cotton fabric with a very open plain weave.
*Cheesecloth—gauze.

Printed calico was imported into the United States from Lancashire in the 1780s, and here a linguistic separation occurred, while Europe maintained the word calico for the fabric, in the States it was used to refer to the printed design.&lt;ref name=dreamstress/&gt;

These colorful, small-patterned printed fabrics gave rise to the use of the word calico to describe a cat coat color: &quot;[[calico cat]]&quot;. The patterned fabric also gave its name to two species of North American crabs; see the [[Calico crab (disambiguation)|calico crab]].

[[Image:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The world’s first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782-83, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the [[heat]] evolved in various [[chemical change]]s; calculations which were based on [[Joseph Black]]’s prior discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments mark the foundation of [[thermochemistry]].]] 

'''Calorimetry''' is the [[science]] of measuring the [[heat]] of [[chemical reaction]]s or [[physical change]]s. Calorimetry is performed with a [[calorimeter]]. The word calorimetry is derived from the Latin word ''calor'', meaning heat. Scottish physician and scientist [[Joseph Black]], who was the first to recognize the distinction between [[heat]] and [[temperature]], is said to be the founder of calorimetry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laider&quot; &gt;{{cite book|author= [[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler, Keith, J.]]|title=The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-19-855919-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Indirect calorimetry''' calculates [[heat]] that living organisms produce from their production of [[carbon dioxide]] and nitrogen waste (frequently [[ammonia]] in aquatic organisms, or [[urea]] in terrestrial ones), OR from their consumption of [[oxygen]]. 
Lavoisier noted in 1780 that heat production can be predicted from oxygen consumption this way, using [[multiple regression]]. The [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory explains why this procedure is correct. Of course, heat generated by living organisms may also be measured by '''direct calorimetry''', in which the entire organism is placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement.

A widely used modern instrument is the '''[[differential scanning calorimeter]]''', a device which allows thermal data to be obtained on small amounts of material. It involves heating the sample at a controlled rate and recording the heat flow either into or from the specimen.

== Calculation of heat ==

===Basic calculation with respect to volume===

Calorimetry requires that the material being heated have known definite thermal properties. The classical rule, recognized by [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius]] and by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]], is that the pressure exerted by the calorimetric material is fully and rapidly determined solely by its temperature and volume; this rule is for changes that do not involve phase change, such as melting of ice. There are many materials that do not comply with this rule, and for them, the present formula of classical calorimetry does not provide an adequate account. Here the classical rule is assumed to hold for the calorimetric material being used, and the propositions are mathematically written:

The thermal response of the calorimetric material is fully described by its pressure &lt;math&gt;p\ &lt;/math&gt; as the value of a function &lt;math&gt;p(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; of just the volume &lt;math&gt;V\ &lt;/math&gt; and the temperature &lt;math&gt;T\ &lt;/math&gt;. All increments are here required to be very small.

The increment of heat &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ =C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\, \delta V\,+\,C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\,\delta T&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the latent heat of the calorimetric material with respect to volume at volume &lt;math&gt;V\ &lt;/math&gt; and temperature &lt;math&gt;T\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the heat capacity of the calorimetric material at constant volume at volume &lt;math&gt;V\ &lt;/math&gt; and temperature &lt;math&gt;T\ &lt;/math&gt;; it is customary to write &lt;math&gt;C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; simply as &lt;math&gt;C_V(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;, or even more briefly as &lt;math&gt;C_V\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta V\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the increment in volume
:&lt;math&gt;\delta T\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the increment in temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins 3.6&quot;&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1975), Section 3.6, pages 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), pages 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P.T. (1978), page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latent heat with respect to volume is the heat required for unit increment in volume at constant temperature. It can be said to be 'measured along an isotherm', and the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely. For a given material, it can have a positive or negative sign or exceptionally it can be zero, and this can depend on the temperature, as it does for water about 4 C.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C. (1872), pages 232-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, G.N., Randall, M. (1923/1961), pages 378-379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), pages 9-10, 15-18, 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C.A. (1980). ''The Tragicomical History of Thermodynamics, 1822-1854'', Springer, New York, ISBN 0-387-90403-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of latent heat with respect to volume was perhaps first recognized by [[Joseph Black]] in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, G.N., Randall, M. (1923/1961), page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'latent heat of expansion' is also used.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C. (1872), page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The latent heat with respect to volume can also be called the 'latent energy with respect to volume'. For all of these usages of 'latent heat', a more systematic terminology uses 'latent heat capacity'.

The heat capacity at constant volume is the heat required for unit increment in temperature at constant volume. It can be said to be 'measured along an isochor', and again, the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely. It always has a positive sign. This means that for an increase the temperature of a body without change of its volume, heat must be supplied to it. This is consistent with common experience.

Quantities like &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt; are sometimes called 'curve differentials', because they are measured along curves in the &lt;math&gt;(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; surface.

===Constant-volume calorimetry (Bomb Calorimetry)===
Constant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant [[volume]]. This involves the use of a [[constant-volume calorimeter]]. Heat is still measured by the above-stated principle of calorimetry.

This means that in a suitably constructed calorimeter, the increment of volume &lt;math&gt;\delta V\ &lt;/math&gt; can be made to vanish, &lt;math&gt;\delta V=0\ &lt;/math&gt;. For constant-volume calorimetry:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = C_V \delta T\ &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\delta T\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the increment in [[temperature]] and
:&lt;math&gt;C_V\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[heat capacity]] at constant volume.

===Heat calculation with respect to pressure===

From the above rule of calculation of heat with respect to volume, there follows one with respect to pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins 3.6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TB 1977 23&quot;&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increment of heat &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ =C^{(p)}_T(p,T)\, \delta p\,+\,C^{(T)}_p(p,T)\,\delta T&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(p)}_T(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the latent heat of the calorimetric material with respect to pressure at pressure &lt;math&gt;p\ &lt;/math&gt; and temperature &lt;math&gt;T\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C^{(T)}_p(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the heat capacity of the calorimetric material at constant pressure at pressure &lt;math&gt;p\ &lt;/math&gt; and temperature &lt;math&gt;T\ &lt;/math&gt;; it is customary to write &lt;math&gt;C^{(T)}_p(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; simply as &lt;math&gt;C_p(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;, or even more briefly as &lt;math&gt;C_p\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta p\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the increment in pressure
:&lt;math&gt;\delta T\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the increment in temperature.

The new quantities here are related to the previous ones:&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins 3.6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TB 1977 23&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(p)}_T(p,T)=\frac{C^{(V)}_T(V,T)}{\left.\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial V}\right|_{(V,T)}} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(T)}_p(p,T)=C^{(T)}_V(V,T)-C^{(V)}_T(V,T) \frac{\left.\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right|_{(V,T)}}{\left.\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial V}\right|_{(V,T)}} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial p}{\partial V}\right|_{(V,T)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[partial derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;p(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;p\ &lt;/math&gt; evaluated for &lt;math&gt;(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right|_{(V,T)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;p(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;T\ &lt;/math&gt; evaluated for &lt;math&gt;(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;.


The latent heats &lt;math&gt;C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^{(p)}_T(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; are always of opposite sign.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;


It is common to refer to the ratio of specific heats as

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(V,T)=\frac{C^{(T)}_p(p,T)}{C^{(T)}_V(V,T)}&lt;/math&gt; often just written as &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{C_p}{C_V}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008), pages 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cumulation of heating===

For a time-dependent process of heating of the calorimetric material, defined by a continuous joint progression &lt;math&gt;P(t_1,t_2)\ &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(t)\ &lt;/math&gt;, starting at time &lt;math&gt;t_1\ &lt;/math&gt; and ending at time &lt;math&gt;t_2\ &lt;/math&gt;, there can be calculated an accumulated quantity of heat delivered, &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\, &lt;/math&gt; . This calculation is done by [[line integral|mathematical integration along the progression]] with respect to time. This is because increments of heat are 'additive'; but this does not mean that heat is a conservative quantity. The idea that heat was a conservative quantity was invented by [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]], and is called the '[[caloric theory]]'; by the middle of the nineteenth century it was recognized as mistaken. Written with the symbol &lt;math&gt;\Delta\ &lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\, &lt;/math&gt; is not at all restricted to be an increment with very small values; this is in contrast with &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt;.

One can write

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\ &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\int_{P(t_1,t_2)} \dot Q(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\int_{P(t_1,t_2)} C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\, \dot V(t)\, dt\,+\,\int_{P(t_1,t_2)}C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\,\dot T(t)\,dt &lt;/math&gt;.

This expression uses quantities such as &lt;math&gt;\dot Q(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; which are defined in the section below headed 'Mathematical aspects of the above rules'.

===Mathematical aspects of the above rules===

The use of 'very small' quantities such as &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt; is related to the physical requirement for the quantity &lt;math&gt;p(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; to be 'rapidly determined' by &lt;math&gt;V\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T\ &lt;/math&gt;; such 'rapid determination' refers to a physical process. These 'very small' quantities are used in the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] approach to the [[infinitesimal calculus]]. The [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] approach uses instead '[[fluxion]]s' such as &lt;math&gt;\dot V(t) = \left.\frac{dV}{dt}\right|_t&lt;/math&gt;, which makes it more obvious that &lt;math&gt;p(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; must be 'rapidly determined'.

In terms of fluxions, the above first rule of calculation can be written&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot Q(t)\ =C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\, \dot V(t)\,+\,C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\,\dot T(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;t\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the time

:&lt;math&gt;\dot Q(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the time rate of heating of the calorimetric material at time &lt;math&gt;t\ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot V(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the time rate of change of volume of the calorimetric material at time &lt;math&gt;t\ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot T(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; denotes the time rate of change of temperature of the calorimetric material.

The increment &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt; and the fluxion &lt;math&gt;\dot Q(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; are obtained for a particular time &lt;math&gt;t\ &lt;/math&gt; that determines the values of the quantities on the righthand sides of the above rules. But this is not a reason to expect that there should exist a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] &lt;math&gt;Q(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, the increment &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt; is said to be an 'imperfect differential' or an '[[inexact differential]]'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins 1975 16&quot;&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1975), Section 1.9.3, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P.T. (1978), pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; An account of this is given by Landsberg, P.T. (1978), Chapter 4, pages 26-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some books indicate this by writing &lt;math&gt;q\ &lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R., Guggenheim, E.A. (1939/1965). ''Statistical Thermodynamics. A version of Statistical Mechanics for Students of Physics and Chemistry'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim, E.A. (1949/1967). ''Thermodynamics. An Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists'', North-Holland, Amsterdam, Section 1.10, pages 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the notation ''đQ'' is used in some books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins 1975 16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008&quot;&gt;Lebon, G., Jou, D., Casas-Vázquez, J. (2008). ''Understanding Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Foundations, Applications, Frontiers'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, e-ISBN 9783540742524, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Carelessness about this can lead to error.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck 1923/1926 57&quot;&gt;Planck, M. (1923/1926). ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'', third English edition translated by A. Ogg from the seventh German edition, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\ &lt;/math&gt; is properly said to be a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the continuous joint progression &lt;math&gt;P(t_1,t_2)\ &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(t)\ &lt;/math&gt;, but, in the mathematical definition of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\ &lt;/math&gt; is not a function of &lt;math&gt;(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;. Although the fluxion &lt;math&gt;\dot Q(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; is defined here as a function of time &lt;math&gt;t\ &lt;/math&gt;, the symbols &lt;math&gt;Q\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; respectively standing alone are not defined here.

===Physical scope of the above rules of calorimetry===

The above rules refer only to suitable calorimetric materials. The terms 'rapidly' and 'very small' call for empirical physical checking of the domain of validity of the above rules.

The above rules for the calculation of heat belong to pure calorimetry. They make no reference to [[thermodynamics]], and were mostly understood before the advent of thermodynamics. They are the basis of the 'thermo' contribution to thermodynamics. The 'dynamics' contribution is based on the idea of [[thermodynamic work|work]], which is not used in the above rules of calculation.

==Connection between calorimetry and thermodynamics==

[[Thermodynamics]] developed gradually over the first half of the nineteenth century, building on the above theory of calorimetry which had been worked out before it, and on other discoveries.

In terms of thermodynamics, the [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U\ &lt;/math&gt; of the calorimetric material can be considered as the value of a function &lt;math&gt;U(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;, with partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\ &lt;/math&gt;.

Then it can be shown that one can write a thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ =\left [p(V,T)\,+\,\left.\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right|_{(V,T)}\right ]\, \delta V\,+\,\left.\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right|_{(V,T)}\,\delta T&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(V)}_T(V,T)=p(V,T)\,+\,\left.\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right|_{(V,T)}\ &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(T)}_V(V,T)=\left.\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right|_{(V,T)}\ &lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;Preston, T. (1894/1904). ''The Theory of Heat'', second edition, revised by J.R. Cotter, Macmillan, London, pages 700-701.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck 1923/1926 57&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1975), page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008), page 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, further in terms of thermodynamics, the [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U\ &lt;/math&gt; of the calorimetric material can sometimes, depending on the calorimetric material, be considered as the value of a function &lt;math&gt;U(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;, with partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial p}\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\ &lt;/math&gt;, and with &lt;math&gt;V\ &lt;/math&gt; being expressible as the value of a function &lt;math&gt;V(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt;, with partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\ &lt;/math&gt; .

Then, according to Adkins (1975)&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins 46&quot;&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1975), page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;, it can be shown that one can write a further thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q\ =\left [\left. \frac{\partial U}{\partial p}\right |_{(p,T)}\,+\,p \left.\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right |_{(p,T)}\right ]\delta p\,+\,\left [ \left.\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right|_{(p,T)}\,+\,p \left.\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right |_{(p,T)}\right ]\delta T&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(p)}_T(p,T)=\left.\frac{\partial U}{\partial p}\right|_{(p,T)}\,+\,p\left.\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right|_{(p,T)}\ &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(T)}_p(p,T)=\left.\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right|_{(p,T)}\,+\,p\left.\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right|_{(p,T)}\ &lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkins 46&quot;/&gt;

Beyond the calorimetric fact noted above that the latent heats &lt;math&gt;C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^{(p)}_T(p,T)\ &lt;/math&gt; are always of opposite sign, it may be shown, using the thermodynamic concept of work, that also

:&lt;math&gt;C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\,\left.\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right|_{(V,T)} \geq 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special interest of thermodynamics in calorimetry: the isothermal segments of a [[Carnot cycle]]===

Calorimetry has a special benefit for thermodynamics. It tells about the heat absorbed or emitted in the isothermal segment of a [[Carnot cycle]].

A Carnot cycle is a special kind of cyclic process affecting a body composed of material suitable for use in a heat engine. Such a material is of the kind considered in calorimetry, as noted above, that exerts a pressure that is very rapidly determined just by temperature and volume. Such a body is said to change reversibly. A Carnot cycle consists of four successive stages or segments:

(1) a change in volume from a volume &lt;math&gt;V_a\ &lt;/math&gt; to a volume &lt;math&gt;V_b\ &lt;/math&gt; at constant temperature &lt;math&gt;T^+\ &lt;/math&gt; so as to incur a flow of heat into the body (known as an isothermal change)

(2) a change in volume from &lt;math&gt;V_b\ &lt;/math&gt; to a volume &lt;math&gt;V_c\ &lt;/math&gt; at a variable temperature just such as to incur no flow of heat (known as an adiabatic change)

(3) another isothermal change in volume from &lt;math&gt;V_c\ &lt;/math&gt; to a volume &lt;math&gt;V_d\ &lt;/math&gt; at constant temperature &lt;math&gt;T^-\ &lt;/math&gt; such as to incur a flow or heat out of the body and just such as to precisely prepare for the following change

(4) another adiabatic change of volume from &lt;math&gt;V_d\ &lt;/math&gt; back to &lt;math&gt;V_a\ &lt;/math&gt; just such as to return the body to its starting temperature &lt;math&gt;T^+\ &lt;/math&gt;.

In isothermal segment (1), the heat that flows into the body is given by

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q(V_a,V_b;T^+)\,=\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\int_{V_a}^{V_b} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^+)\, dV\ &lt;/math&gt;

and in isothermal segment (3) the heat that flows out of the body is given by

:&lt;math&gt;-\Delta Q(V_c,V_d;T^-)\,=\,-\int_{V_c}^{V_d} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^-)\, dV\ &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), pages 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the segments (2) and (4) are adiabats, no heat flows into or out of the body during them, and consequently the net heat supplied to the body during the cycle is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q(V_a,V_b;T^+;V_c,V_d;T^-)\,=\,\Delta Q(V_a,V_b;T^+)\,+\,\Delta Q(V_c,V_d;T^-)\,=\,\int_{V_a}^{V_b} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^+)\, dV\,+\,\int_{V_c}^{V_d} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^-)\, dV\ &lt;/math&gt;.

This quantity is used by thermodynamics and is related in a special way to the net [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the body during the Carnot cycle. The net change of the body's internal energy during the Carnot cycle, &lt;math&gt;\Delta U(V_a,V_b;T^+;V_c,V_d;T^-)\ &lt;/math&gt;, is equal to zero, because the material of the working body has the special properties noted above.

'''Charles Evans Hughes, Sr.''' (April 11, 1862 – August 27, 1948) was a [[lawyer]] and [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician from the State of New York. He served as the [[List of Governors of New York|36th Governor of New York]] (1907–1910), [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] (1910–1916), [[United States Secretary of State]] (1921–1925), and the 11th [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (1930–1941). He was the Republican candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916 U.S. Presidential election]], losing to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Hughes was an important leader of the [[progressive movement]] of the 1900s, a leading diplomat and New York lawyer in the days of Harding and Coolidge, and a leader of opposition to the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s. Historian [[Clinton Rossiter]] has hailed him as a leading [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Rossiter, ''Conservatism in American'' (1962) p 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[image:Charles Evans Hughes, age 16.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Evans Hughes, age 16]]
Charles Evans Hughes was born on April 11, 1862, in [[Glens Falls, New York]]. In 1859, his family had moved to [[New York City]], where his mother enrolled him in a private school. He was active in the [[American Baptist Churches USA|Northern Baptist church]], a [[Mainline Protestant]] denomination.

Hughes went to Madison University (now [[Colgate University]]) where he became a member of [[Delta Upsilon]] [[List of social fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], then transferred to [[Brown University]], where he continued as a member of Delta Upsilon and graduated in 1881 at age 19, youngest in his class, receiving second-highest honors. He entered [[Columbia Law School]] in 1882, and he graduated in 1884 with highest honors. While studying law, he taught at [[Delaware Academy]].

In 1885, he met Antoinette Carter, the daughter of a senior partner of the law firm where he worked, and they were married in 1888. They had one son, [[Charles Evans Hughes, Jr.]] and three daughters, one of whom was [[Elizabeth Hughes Gossett]], one of the first humans injected with insulin, and who later served as president of the [[Supreme Court Historical Society]].&lt;ref name=Insulin&gt;[http://pro-tierisches-insulin.info/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=123&amp;Itemid=2  Elizabeth Hughes: Fifty-eight years on animal-insulin ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, Hughes left the practice of law to become a professor at the [[Cornell University Law School]], but in 1893, he returned to his old law firm in New York City. At that time, in addition to practicing law, he taught at [[New York Law School]] with [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In 1905, he was appointed as counsel to a [[New York]] state legislative committee investigating utility rates. His uncovering of corruption led to lower gas rates in New York City. As a result, he was appointed to investigate the [[insurance]] industry in New York.

==Governor of New York==
[[Image:Governor Charles Evans Hughes.jpg|thumb|left|Governor Charles Evans Hughes]]
Hughes served as the [[Governor of New York]] from 1907 to 1910. He defeated [[William Randolph Hearst]] in the [[New York state election, 1906|1906 election]] to gain the position, and he was the only Republican statewide candidate to win office. In [[New York state election, 1908|1908]], he was offered the [[Vice President of the United States of America|vice-presidential]] nomination by [[William Howard Taft]], but he declined it to run again for Governor.

As the Governor, he pushed the passage of the [[Lessland Act]], which gave him the power as governor to oversee civic officials as well as officials in state bureaucracies. This allowed him to fire many corrupt officials. He also managed to have the powers of the state's Public Service Commissions increased, and he attempted unsuccessfully to have their decisions exempted from judicial review. When two bills were passed to reduce railroad fares, Hughes vetoed them on that grounds that the rates should be set by expert commissioners rather than by elected ones. In his final year as the Governor, he had the state comptroller draw up an executive budget. This began a rationalization of state government and eventually it led to an enhancement of executive authority.

In 1908 Governor Hughes reviewed the clemency petition of [[Chester Gillette]] concerning the murder of [[Grace Brown]]. The governor denied the petition as well as an application for reprieve and Gillette was electrocuted in March of that year.

When Hughes left office, a prominent journal remarked &quot;One can distinctly see the coming of a New Statism ... [of which] Gov. Hughes has been a leading prophet and exponent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nation quoted in Samuel Hendel, Charles Evans Hughes and the Supreme Court (New York: King's Crown Press, 1951), 15, quoted at [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/24.1/henretta.html#FOOT43 The History Cooperative]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, he led an effort to incorporate Delta Upsilon fraternity. This was the first [[List of social fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] to incorporate, and he served as its first international president.

In 1926, Hughes was appointed by New York Governor [[Alfred E. Smith]] to be the chairman of a ''State Reorganization Commission'' through which Smith's plan to place the Governor as the head of a rationalized state government, was accomplished, bringing to realization what Hughes himself had envisioned.

==Supreme Court==
In October 1910, Hughes was appointed as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He wrote for the court in ''[[Bailey v. Alabama]]'' {{ussc|219|219|1911}}, which held that involuntary servitude encompassed more than just [[slavery]], and ''[[Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Atchison T &amp; SF R Co.]]'' {{ussc|234|294|1914}}, holding that the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] could regulate intrastate rates if they were significantly intertwined with interstate commerce.

On April 15, 1915, in the case of Frank v. Mangum, Justice Hughes along with Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] were the two dissenting votes (7-2) that denied an appeal thus upholding the lower courts guilty verdict against [[Leo Frank]].

==Presidential candidate==

{{main|U.S. presidential election, 1916}}
{{see also|American entry into World War I}}
He resigned from the Supreme Court on June 10, 1916,&lt;ref name=&quot;e2&quot;&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL|about/members.pdf}}  Supreme Court of the United States] ''Accessed December 13, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; to be the Republican candidate for [[President of the United States|President]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1916|1916]]. He was also endorsed by the Progressive Party.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, a Justice for All, page 39, ISBN 0-671-76787-9&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was defeated by [[Woodrow Wilson]] in a close election (separated by 23 electoral votes and 594,188 popular votes). The election hinged on [[California]], where Wilson managed to win by 3,800 votes and its 13 [[electoral votes]] and thus Wilson was returned for a second term; Hughes had lost the endorsement of the California governor when he failed to show up for an appointment with him.

Hughes returned to public law practice, again at his old firm, Hughes, Rounds, Schurman &amp; Dwight, today known as [[Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed LLP]].

==Secretary of State==
[[File:Charles Evans Hughes residence.jpg|thumb|Hughes' residence in 1921]]
Hughes returned to government office in 1921 as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]]. As Secretary of State, in 1921 he convened the [[Washington Naval Conference]] for the limitation of naval armament among the [[Great Powers]]. He continued in office after Harding died and was succeeded by [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]], but resigned after Coolidge was elected to a full term. In 1922, September 23, he signed the ''Hughes - Peynado agreement'', that ended the occupation of [[Dominican Republic]] by the [[United States]] (since 1916).

==Various appointments==
In 1907, Gov. Charles Evans Hughes became the first president of newly formed [[Northern Baptist Convention]]. He also served as President of the New York State Bar Association. 

After leaving the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], he again rejoined his old partners at the Hughes firm, which included his son and future [[United States Solicitor General]] Charles E. Hughes, Jr., and was one of the nation's most sought-after advocates. From 1925 to 1930, for example, Hughes argued over 50 times before the U.S. Supreme Court. From 1926 to 1930, Hughes also served as a member of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] and as a judge of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] from 1928 to 1930. He was additionally a delegate to the [[Pan American Conference on Arbitration and Conciliation]] from 1928 to 1930. He was one of the co-founders in 1927 of the National Conference on Christians and Jews, now known as the [[National Conference for Community and Justice]] (NCCJ), along with [[S. Parkes Cadman]] and others, to oppose the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[anti-Catholicism]], and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Conference for Community and Justice |url=http://www.faithstreams.com/topics/members-and-partners/national-conference-for-community-and-justice.html |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 conservative business interests tried to interest Hughes in the GOP presidential nomination of 1928 instead of Herbert Hoover. Hughes, citing his age, turned down the offer.

==Chief Justice==
[[File:Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Hughes as Chief Justice.]]
[[Herbert Hoover]], who had appointed Hughes' son as [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] in 1929, appointed Hughes [[Chief Justice of the United States]] in 1930, in which capacity he served until 1941. Hughes replaced former President [[William Howard Taft]], a fellow Republican who had also lost a presidential election to Woodrow Wilson (in 1912) - and who, in 1910, had appointed Hughes to his first tenure on the Supreme Court.

His appointment was opposed by progressive elements in both parties who felt that he was too friendly to big business. Idaho Republican [[William E. Borah]] said on the [[United States Senate]] floor that confirming Hughes would constitute &quot;placing upon the Court as Chief Justice one whose views are known upon these vital and important questions and whose views, in my opinion, however sincerely entertained, are not which ought to be incorporated in and made a permanent part of our legal and economic system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wittes, Benjamin.  [http://books.google.com/books?id=NJgCR6EOzBEC ''Confirmation Wars: Preserving Independent Courts in Angry Times''] ([[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] 2006). page 50&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Hughes was confirmed as Chief Justice with a vote of 52 to 26.

In 1937 when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attempted to [[Court-packing Bill|pack the Court with five additional justices]], Hughes worked behind the scenes to defeat the effort, which failed in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) pp 394-7&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the opinion for the Court in ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'' {{ussc|283|697|1931}}, which held prior restraints against the press are unconstitutional. He was often aligned with Justices [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone]], and [[Benjamin Cardozo]] in finding President Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] measures to be Constitutional. Although he wrote the opinion invalidating the [[National Recovery Administration]] in ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'' {{ussc|295|495|1935}}, he wrote the opinions for the Court in [[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation|NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.]] {{ussc|301|1|1937}}, [[NLRB v. Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Co.]], {{ussc|301|58|1937}}, and [[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]] {{ussc|300|379|1937}} which looked favorably on New Deal measures.

During Hughes' service as Chief Justice, the Supreme Court moved from its former quarters at the U.S. Capitol to the newly constructed Supreme Court building; the construction of the Supreme Court building had been authorized by Congress during President Taft's service as Chief Justice.

Hughes wrote twice as many constitutional opinions as any of his court's other members. &quot;His opinions, in the view of one commentator, were concise and admirable, placing Hughes in the pantheon of great justices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez&quot;&gt;[http://www.oyez.org/justices/charles_e_hughes/ Charles Evans Hughes, Official Supreme Court media at] [[Oyez.org|Oyez project]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His &quot;remarkable intellectual and social gifts . . . made him a superb leader and administrator. He had a photographic memory that few, if any, of his colleagues could match. Yet he was generous, kind, and forebearing in an institution where egos generally come in only one size: extra large!&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;oyez&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Charles Evans Hughes Headstone.JPG|thumb|The grave of Charles Evans Hughes in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]].]] For many years, he was a member of the [[Union League Club of New York]] and served as its president from 1917 to 1919. The Hughes Room in the club is named for him.

On August 27, 1948, Hughes died in [[Osterville]], [[Massachusetts]]. His remains are interred at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in Bronx, New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050903032026/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html Christensen, George A.

In music, a '''concept album''' is an [[album]] that is &quot;unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, Roy: ''Popular Music: The Key Concepts'', page 5. ISBN 0-415-28425-2. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, concept albums tend to incorporate preconceived musical or lyrical ideas rather than being [[musical improvisation|improvised]] or composed in the studio, with all songs contributing to [[narrative|a single overall theme or unified story]]. This is in contrast to the practice of an artist or group releasing an album consisting of a number of unconnected (lyrically or otherwise) songs performed by the artist.

== History ==
=== 1960s ===

Perhaps the first examples from rock were the albums of [[The Ventures]]. Starting from 1961's ''Colorful Ventures'' (each song had a color in the title), the group became known for issuing records throughout the 1960s whose tracks revolved around central themes, including surf music, country, outer space, TV themes, and psychedelic music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iDesign Studios | www.idesignstudios.com | copyright © 2002 iDesign Studios. All rights reserved. |url=http://www.sandcastlevi.com/ventures/venthst.htm |title=The Fabulous Ventures - Band History |publisher=Sandcastle V.I. |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Charles also issued his ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music|Modern Sounds]]'' recordings, which departed from his well-known R&amp;B and soul style to conceptually country music records.

In 1966, several rock releases were arguably concept albums in the sense that they presented a set of thematically-linked songs - and they also instigated other rock artists to consider using the album format in a similar fashion: The Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' was a musical portrayal of [[Brian Wilson]]'s state of mind at the time (and a major inspiration to [[Paul McCartney]]). Although it has a unified theme in its emotional content, the writers (Brian Wilson and Tony Asher) have said continuously that it was not necessarily intended to be a narrative. However, later in 1966, Brian Wilson began work on the ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' album, which ''was'' intended as a narrative. The album was scrapped before completion, only to be revived in the 2000s. The [[Mothers of Invention]]'s sardonic farce about rock music and America as a whole, ''[[Freak Out!]]'' by [[Frank Zappa]] and ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' by [[The Kinks]], the first collection of [[Ray Davies]]'s idiosyncratic character studies of ordinary people are conceptually oriented albums. However, out of the albums above, only Pet Sounds attracted a huge commercial audience.

This all changed with [[The Beatles]]' most celebrated album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in June 1967. With the release of ''Sgt. Pepper'', the notion of the concept album came to the forefront of the popular and critical mind, with the earlier prototypes and examples from [[Traditional pop music]] and other genres sometimes forgotten.

In fact, as pointed out by many critics since its original reception, ''Sgt. Pepper'' is a concept album only by some definitions of the term. There was, at some stage during the making of the album an attempt to relate the material to firstly the idea of aging, then as an obscure radio play about the life of an ex-army bandsman and his shortcomings. These concepts were lost in the final production. While debate exists over the extent to which ''Sgt. Pepper'' qualifies as a true concept album, there is no doubt that its reputation as such helped inspire other artists to produce concept albums of their own, and inspired the public to anticipate them. Lennon and McCartney distanced themselves from the &quot;concept album&quot; tag as applied to that album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted Nov 01, 2003 12:00 AM |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595610/1_sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band |title=1) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2003-11-01 |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Days of Future Passed]]'', released the same year as ''Sgt. Pepper's'', was fellow UK musicians The Moody Blues' first foray into the concept album.  Originally presented with an opportunity to rock out [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák']]s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9 &quot;From the New World&quot;]] by their new stereophonic label, the band instead forged ahead to unify their own orchestral-based threads of a day in the life of a common man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Eder|first = Bruce|authorlink = |coauthors = |title = The Moody Blues: Biography| work = |publisher = AMG [All Music Group, a subsidiary of Macrovision]| year = 2009|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4948/biography|pure_url=yes}}| format = |doi = |accessdate = 2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' by [[The Who]] followed with its concept of a [[pirate radio]] broadcast. Within the record, joke commercials recorded by the band and actual [[jingle]]s from recently outlawed pirate radio station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] were interspersed between the songs, ranging from pop songs to [[hard rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], culminating with a mini-opera titled &quot;Rael&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted Nov 01, 2003 12:00 AM |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6598681/113_the_who_sell_out |title=113) The Who Sell Out: Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2003-11-01 |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1967, the British group [[Nirvana (UK band)|Nirvana]] released ''[[The Story of Simon Simopath]]'' (subtitled &quot;A Science Fiction Pantomime&quot;), an album that tells the story of the title character. It was only a moderate commercial success. The album ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' (released in December 1968) by British group the [[Pretty Things]] is generally considered to be among the first creatively successful rock concept albums - in that each song is part of an overarching unified concept – the life story of the main character, Sebastian Sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/reviews/article/24787/prettythings-sf |title=The Pretty Things: S.F. Sorrow - PopMatters Music Review |publisher=PopMatters |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in April 1969, was the [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' composed by [[Pete Townshend]] and performed by [[The Who]]. This acclaimed work was presented over [[double album|two discs]] (still unusual in those days) and it took the idea of thematically based albums to a much higher appreciation by both critics and the public. It was also the first ''story-based'' concept album of the rock era (as distinct from the ''song-cycle'' style album) to enjoy commercial success. The Who went on to further explorations of the concept album format with their follow-up project ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', which was abandoned before completion, and with their 1973 rock opera, ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004122/Pete-Townshend.html |title=Pete Townshend Biography - Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five months after the release of ''Tommy'', [[The Kinks]] released another concept album ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' (September 1969), written by [[Ray Davies]], considered by some a rock opera but originally conceived as the score for a proposed but never realised BBC television drama. It was the first of several concept albums released by the band through the first few years of the 1970s. These were: ''[[Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]]'' (1970), ''[[Muswell Hillbillies]]'' (1971), ''[[Preservation: Act 1]]'' (1973), ''[[Preservation: Act 2]]'' (1974), ''[[Soap Opera (album)|Soap Opera]]'' (1975) and ''[[Schoolboys in Disgrace]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001298/Ray-Davies.html |title=Ray Davies Biography - Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
Concept albums are considered ''de rigueur'' in the [[progressive rock]] genre of the 1970s. [[Pink Floyd]] recast itself from its 1960s guise as a psychedelic band into a commercial success with its series of concept albums, most famously with ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (which, according to the RIAA, is the third best selling album in history) and later with the double album rock opera ''[[The Wall]]''.

From 1975 to 1979, a Canadian progressive power trio, [[Rush (band)|Rush]], released three albums containing sidelong epics, regarded by some as concept albums (though not actually concept albums by strict definition of the term; that is, none of the other songs on the album have anything to do with each other or the 20-minute sidelong epic, so there is no pervasive concept or story). The first of which was released in 1975, titled ''[[Caress of Steel]]''. The second was their break through album, ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', released the following year in 1976. Their third was released in 1979, ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]''. Rush is working on another concept album titled ''[[Clockwork Angels]]'', to be released in late 2011/early 2012.

[[Yes (band)|Yes]] also put out concept albums during the 70s, most notably ''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]'', which would become a defining album of prog rock but whose critical backlash would lead to the genre's decline in popularity and the rise of punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warr.org/yes.html |title=Yes |publisher=Warr.org |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/punkhistory/whendinosaursromaedtheearth.htm |title=History Of Punk - Genesis, ELP &amp; Yes |publisher=Punk77.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The group's keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] released many concept albums on his own, most notably ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' and ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'', which was based on the novel by [[Jules Verne]].

Another progressive rock act, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], released the concept album ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' in 1974, a double disc that told the story of the street punk Rael. Rock musician [[David Bowie]] also made three popular concept albums, ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars]]''. The latter is about a fictional character, Ziggy Stardust and his band.

In the 1970s and 80s, [[The Alan Parsons Project]] was a British progressive rock group which specialized entirely in concept albums.

=== 1980s ===
Though the progressive rock genre was beginning to decrease in popularity, concept albums had become a medium that continued. The progressive bands that were still around were still having major successes with concept albums. [[Styx (band)|Styx]] continued to have multiplatinum albums with their 1981 release ''[[Paradise Theater (album)|Paradise Theater]]'' (a concept album about a decaying theater in Chicago which became a metaphor for childhood and American culture) and 1983's ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'' (a science fiction rock opera about a future where moralists imprison rockers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/features/article/8636/concept-albums-are-once-again-in-vogue-in-the-digital-age/ |title=Music Feature &amp;#124; Concept Albums Are Once Again in Vogue in the Digital Age |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the concept album became popular among [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands bands like [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and their bombastic offering, 1981's ''[[Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;]]'', which went on to become the group's poorest selling and charting album in their history. [[Queensrÿche]] fared better later the decade, releasing the rock opera  ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]'' in 1988; which tells a story of a young man, Nikki, awoken from a coma suddenly remembering work done as a political assassin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/columns/begrand/060316.shtml |title=Columns &amp;#124; Adrien Begrand &amp;#124; Blood and Thunder &amp;#124; The Queen Isn't Dead |publisher=PopMatters |date=2006-03-16 |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] gained cult status during the 1980s releasing mostly all concept albums. Releases such as ''[[Abigail (album)|Abigail]]'', ''[[Them (King Diamond album)|&quot;Them&quot;]]'', and ''[[The Eye (King Diamond album)|The Eye]]'' told elaborate sagas of horror and the [[supernatural]].

In 1985 Kerrang! magazine ran a coverstory on [[Phenomena]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.projectphenomena.com&lt;/ref&gt; announcing &quot;the return of the concept album&quot;. Tom Galley had started the project, and together with his brother Mell and Metalhammer magazine founder Wilfried Rimensberger developed it into an international multi-media rock music project with contributions from a string of rock superstars, that, apart from so far a total of 5 albums, produced the Dreamrunner album and an ongoing following around the world. Phenomena's main story lines are dealing with the super-natural and unexplaned, that are also turned in to scripts for musical, rock opera stage productions, feature films and video games. [[Iron Maiden]] also released several concept albums including ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]''; which follows the folklore and myths of a seventh son of a seventh son having mystical powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maidenfans.com/imc/?url=album07_ssoass/commentary07_ssoass&amp;link=albums&amp;lang=eng |title=The Iron Maiden Commentary |publisher=Maidenfans.com |date=1988-04-11 |accessdate=2009-01-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In the 1990s prog rock had all but faded from popular music. With the advent of [[alternative rock]], however, a number of artists still continued to use the format.

In that decade the rock band [[Marilyn Manson]] created three [[rock opera]] concept albums, namely, ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996), ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998) and ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)|Holy Wood]]'' (2000), which formed an ambitious concept trilogy. Though each one came with individual conceptual backgrounds, they are also meant to be taken together to form a larger abstract storyline. The albums were released in reverse order thus in the larger overarching 'fourth storyline' is divulged in reverse chronological order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tom|last=Lanham |date=2000-11 |year= |month= |title=Marilyn Manson: Absinthe Makes The Heart Grow Fonder |trans_title= |journal=[[Alternative Press]] |volume= |series= |issue=#148 |page= |pages=76–86 |at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |accessdate=2010-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431695/19991216/marilyn_manson.jhtml|title= Manson To Walk In The &quot;Valley Of Death&quot; For Next LP |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date= 1999-12-16|accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV Marilyn Manson Tweaks Holy Wood Plans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431690/marilyn-manson-tweaks-holy-wood-plans.jhtml |title=Marilyn Manson Tweaks &quot;Holy Wood&quot; Plans |publisher=MTV News |date=2000-02-29|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, progressive metal band [[Dream Theater]] released ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'', a story concept album.  This was a specific follow-up to a song called &quot;Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper,&quot; which was released on the band's 1992 breakthrough album, ''[[Images and Words]]''.  While &quot;Pt. 1&quot; introduced a story, further parts of the &quot;Metropolis&quot; story were unseen on that album or subsequent releases for seven years.  Although the band had created a twenty-minute follow-up to Part 1 in the mid-nineties, it hadn't been released.  After the band gained complete creative control from their record company, they decided to expand their follow-up of the Metropolis story into a full album: ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]''.  This album builds on concepts introduced in Part 1, both lyrically and musically.  Although it did not achieve the same levels of commercial success as the band's later releases (it reached #73 on the [[Billboard 200]]), it has been hailed by many fans and critics as Dream Theater's masterpiece and the band's defining album.

===2000s and 2010s===
With the advent of the [[World Wide Web]] and other multimedia technologies, bands such as [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] (with the album ''[[Machina/The Machines of God]]''), [[Coheed And Cambria]] (with the [[Amory Wars]] as a backing story), and [[Nine Inch Nails]] (with the album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montgomery |first=James |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1552470/20070215/nine_inch_nails.jhtml |title=Nine Inch Nails' Conspiracy Campaign - News Story &amp;#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &amp;#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploited emergent cultural phenomena such as the [[alternate reality game]] to provide additional web-based content beyond that on the album itself.

Also in the 2000s, [[pop punk]] outfit [[Green Day]] produced two [[Grammy]]-winning concept albums, namely, 2004's ''[[American Idiot]]'' and 2009's ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''“21st Century Breakdown” follows Green Day’s “American Idiot,” the politically charged concept album from 2004 that has sold more than five million copies domestically and an estimated 12 million worldwide.'', [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/arts/music/03pare.html The Morning After ‘American Idiot’], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 ''[[American Idiot]]'' became the first [[American Idiot (musical)|punk rock opera]] to make it to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Hurwitt  | first = Robert  | title = Green Day's hits turn into Berkeley Rep musical  | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle  | date = 2009-03-31  | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/31/DD8R16NNSN.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has garnered two [[Tony Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tonys&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's Nominated?|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/index.html|work=Tony Awards|publisher=IBM Corp.|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American metal band [[Symphony X]] included the sidelong epic ''[[The Divine Wings of Tragedy]]'' in the eponymous album released in 1997. In October 2000, the concept album ''[[V-The New Mythology Suite]]'', the fifth studio album of the band, was released to critical acclaim. The story of the album is a mix of ancient Greek and Egyptian mythology, mixed with Edgar Cayce's visions of Atlantis, and explores the concept of &quot;history repeating itself&quot;, and the view of modern technological advances as a rediscovery of the developments of the Atlanteans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symphonyx.com/cd_v_story.html The story behind ''&quot;V: The New Mythology Suite&quot;'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{sociology}}

'''Critical theory''' is an examination and [[critique]] of [[society]] and [[culture]], drawing from knowledge across the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. The term has two different meanings with different origins and histories: one originating in [[sociology]] and the other in [[literary criticism]]. This has led to the very literal use of 'critical theory' as an [[umbrella term]] to describe any theory founded upon critique. 

In the sociological context, critical theory refers to a style of [[Marxist sociology|Marxist theory]] with a tendency to engage with non-Marxist influences (for instance the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]).&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William. 1988. ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 2nd Edition (2009). p5. ISBN 9780745643281&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency has been referred to pejoratively by stricter Marxists as [[revisionism (Marxism)|'revisionism']]. Modern critical theory arose from a trajectory extending from the [[nonpositivist]] sociology of [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], the Marxist theory of [[György Lukács|Georg Lukács]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], toward the milieu associated with [[Institute for Social Research|Frankfurt Institute of Social Research]]. 

It is with the so-called '&quot;[[Frankfurt School]]&quot; of theorists that the term is most commonly associated: [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. With the latter, critical theory shed further its roots in [[German idealism]] and moved closer to [[Pragmatism|American pragmatism]]. The theoretical concern for a cultural &quot;[[base and superstructure|superstructure]]&quot; derived from a material &quot;base&quot; often stands as the only central Marxist tenet remaining in contemporary critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William. 1988. ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 2nd Edition (2009), p.5-8 (ISBN 9780745643281)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two primary definitions==
The two meanings of critical theory—from different intellectual traditions associated with the meaning of criticism and critique—derive ultimately from the Greek word ''kritikos'' meaning judgment or discernment, and in their present forms go back to the 18th century. While they can be considered completely independent intellectual pursuits, increasingly scholars are interested in the areas of critique where the two overlap.

To use an [[epistemological]] distinction introduced by [[Jürgen Habermas]] in ''Erkenntnis und Interesse'' [1968] (''Knowledge and Human Interests''), critical theory in literary studies is ultimately a form of [[hermeneutics]], i.e. knowledge via interpretation to understand the meaning of human texts and symbolic expressions—including the interpretation of texts which are themselves implicitly or explicitly the interpretation of other texts. Critical social theory is, in contrast, a form of self-reflective knowledge involving both understanding and theoretical explanation to reduce entrapment in systems of domination or dependence, obeying the emancipatory interest in expanding the scope of autonomy and reducing the scope of domination.

From this perspective, much literary critical theory, since it is focused on interpretation and explanation rather than on social transformation, would be regarded as positivistic or traditional rather than critical theory in the Kantian or [[Marxian]] sense. Critical theory in literature and the humanities in general does not necessarily involve a [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] dimension, whereas critical social theory does, either through criticizing society from some general theory of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], norms, or &quot;oughts,&quot; or through criticizing it in terms of its own espoused values.

==In social theory==
{{Frankfurt School}}
{{main|Frankfurt School}}
''Critical theory'' was first defined by [[Max Horkheimer]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] of sociology in his 1937 essay ''Traditional and Critical Theory'': Critical theory is a social theory oriented toward critiquing and changing [[society]] as a whole, in contrast to traditional theory oriented only to understanding or explaining it. Horkheimer wanted to distinguish critical theory as a radical, emancipatory form of [[Marxian]] theory, critiquing both the model of science put forward by [[logical positivism]] and what he and his colleagues saw as the covert positivism and authoritarianism of orthodox [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]]. 

Core concepts are: (1) That critical social theory should be directed at the totality of society in its historical specificity (i.e. how it came to be configured at a specific point in time), and (2) That critical theory should improve understanding of society by integrating all the major social sciences, including geography, economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology.

This version of &quot;critical&quot; theory derives from [[Kant]]'s (18th-century) and [[Marx]]'s (19th Century) use of the term &quot;[[critique]]&quot;, as in Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and Marx's concept that his work ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (''Capital'') forms a &quot;critique of political economy.&quot; For Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], &quot;critique&quot; means examining and establishing the limits of the validity of a faculty, type, or body of knowledge, especially through accounting for the limitations imposed by the fundamental, irreducible concepts in use in that knowledge system. Early on, Kant's notion associated critique with the disestablishment of false, unprovable, or dogmatic philosophical, social, and political beliefs, because Kant's critique of reason involved the critique of dogmatic [[theological]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas and was intertwined with the enhancement of ethical autonomy and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] critique of superstition and irrational authority. Marx explicitly developed this notion into the critique of ideology and linked it with the practice of social revolution, as in the famous 11th of his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]],'' &quot;Philosophers have only interpreted the world in certain ways; the point is to change it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm |title=Theses on Feuerbach |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the distinguishing characteristics of critical theory, as Adorno and Horkheimer elaborated in their ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), is a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence which gave rise to the “pessimism” of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. W., with Max Horkheimer. ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Trans. Edmund Jephcott. Stanford: Stanford UP, 2002. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; This ambivalence was rooted, of course, in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, in particular, the rise of [[National Socialism]], [[state capitalism]], and [[mass culture]] as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer’s circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions.&quot; &quot;The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment: Horkheimer and Adorno.&quot; in Habermas, Jürgen. ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''. trans. Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987. 116. Also, see Helmut Dubiel, ''Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory'', trans. Benjamin Gregg (Cambridge, Mass. and London, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Adorno and Horkheimer [[state intervention]] in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the &quot;[[relations of production]]&quot; and &quot;material [[productive forces]] of society,&quot; a tension which, according to traditional critical theory, constituted the primary [[contradiction]] within capitalism. The market (as an &quot;unconscious&quot; mechanism for the distribution of goods) and [[private property]] had been replaced by [[centralized planning]] and socialized ownership of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism.&quot; ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, contrary to [[Marx]]’s famous prediction in the ''Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', this shift did not lead to &quot;an era of [[social revolution]],&quot; but rather to [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. As such, critical theory was left, in [[Jürgen Habermas]]’ words, without &quot;anything in reserve to which it might appeal; and when the forces of production enter into a baneful symbiosis with the relations of production that they were supposed to blow wide open, there is no longer any dynamism upon which critique could base its hope.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment,&quot; p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, this posed the problem of how to account for the apparent persistence of domination in the absence of the very contradiction that, according to traditional critical theory, was the source of domination itself.

In the 1960s, [[Jürgen Habermas]] raised the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] discussion to a new level in his ''Knowledge and Human Interests'', by identifying critical [[knowledge]] as based on principles that differentiated it either from the [[natural sciences]] or the [[humanities]], through its orientation to self-reflection and emancipation. Though unsatisfied with Adorno and Horkeimer's thought presented in ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', Habermas shares the view that, in the form of [[instrumental rationality]], the era of [[modernity]] marks a move away from the liberation of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and toward a new form of enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William. 1988. ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 2nd Edition
(2009). p6. ISBN 9780745643281&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas regarding the relationship between modernity and [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] are in this sense strongly influenced by [[Max Weber]]. Habermas dissolved further the elements of critical theory derived from [[Hegelian]] [[German Idealism]], though his thought remains broadly Marxist in its epistemological approach. Perhaps his two most influential ideas are the concepts of the [[public sphere]] and [[communicative action]]; the latter arriving partly as a reaction to new [[post-structural]] or so-called &quot;[[Postmodernism|post-modern]]&quot; challenges to the discourse of modernity. Habermas engaged in regular correspondence with [[Richard Rorty]] and a strong sense of philosophical [[pragmatism]] may be felt in his theory; thought which frequently traverses the boundaries between sociology and philosophy.

===Postmodern critical theory===
While [[modernist]] critical theory (as described above) concerns itself with “forms of authority and injustice that accompanied the evolution of industrial and corporate capitalism as a political-economic system,” [[postmodern]] critical theory politicizes social problems “by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings” (Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;52). Meaning itself is seen as unstable due to the rapid transformation in social structures and as a result the focus of research is centered on local manifestations rather than broad generalizations.

Postmodern critical research is also characterized by what is called, the ''crisis of representation'', which rejects the idea that a researcher’s work is considered an “objective depiction of a stable other” (Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;53). Instead, in their research and writing, many postmodern scholars have adopted “alternatives that encourage reflection about the ‘politics and poetics’ of their work. In these accounts, the embodied, collaborative, dialogic, and improvisational aspects of qualitative research are clarified” (Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;53). 

Often, the term &quot;critical theory&quot; is appropriated when an author (perhaps most notably [[Michel Foucault]]) works within sociological terms yet attacks the social or human sciences (thus attempting to remain &quot;outside&quot; those frames of enquiry). [[Jean Baudrillard]] has also been described as a critical theorist to the extent that he was an unconventional and critical sociologist; this appropriation is similarly casual, holding little or no relation to the Frankfurt School.

==In literary criticism==
{{main|Literary theory}}
The second meaning of ''critical theory'' is the theory used in literary criticism and in the analysis and understanding of literature. This is discussed in greater detail under [[literary theory]]. This form of critical theory is not necessarily oriented toward radical social change or even toward the analysis of society, but instead focuses on the analysis of texts. This term was first used by literary scholars in the 1960s and 1970s, and the term has only come into broad use since the 1980s, especially as theory used in literary studies has increasingly been influenced by European philosophy and social theory.

This version of &quot;critical&quot; theory derives from the notion of literary criticism as establishing and enhancing the understanding and evaluation of literature in the search for [[truth]]. Some consider literary theory merely an aesthetic concern, as articulated, for example, in [[Joseph Addison]]'s notion of a [[critic]] as one who helps understand and interpret literary works: &quot;A true critic ought to dwell rather upon excellencies than imperfections, to discover the concealed beauties of a writer, and communicate to the world such things as are worth their observation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/fowlerjh/chap20.htm |title=Literary Criticism|first=Joseph |last=Addison |accessdate=2008-08-22|journal=Spectator|volume=291|date=1712-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of criticism ultimately goes back to Aristotle's ''Poetics'' as a theory of literature.

In the 1940's and 50's, [[New Criticism]] had tried to analyze literary texts purely internally. Starting in the 1960s, literary scholars, reacting against this, began to use analytical tools from critical social theory - initially [[semiotic]], [[linguistics|linguistic]], and interpretive theory, then [[structuralism]], [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[deconstruction]] as well as [[Continental philosophy]], especially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]], and various other forms of [[neo-Marxian]] theory.

Thus literary criticism became highly theoretical and some of those practicing it began referring to the theoretical dimension of their work as &quot;critical theory&quot; - a philosophically inspired theory of literary criticism. And thus incidentally critical theory in the sociological sense also became, especially among literary scholars of left-wing sympathies, one of a number of influences upon and streams within critical theory in the literary sense.

With the expansion of the mass media and mass/popular culture in the 1960s and 1970s and the blending of social and cultural criticism and literary criticism, the methods of both kinds of critical theory sometimes intertwined in the analysis of phenomena of popular culture, as in the emerging field of [[cultural studies]], in which concepts deriving from [[Marxian]] theory, [[post-structuralism]], [[semiology]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[feminist theory]] would be found in the same interpretive work. Both strands were often present in the various modalities of [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern theory]].

==Language and construction==
The two points at which there is the greatest overlap or mutual impingement of the two versions of critical theory are in their interrelated foci on language, symbolism, and communication and in their focus on social construction.

===Language and communication===
From the 1960s and 1970s onward, language, symbolism, text, and meaning came to be seen as the theoretical foundation for the [[humanities]], through the influence of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and other thinkers in linguistic and analytic philosophy, [[structural linguistics]], [[symbolic interactionism]], [[hermeneutics]], [[semiology]], linguistically oriented psychoanalysis ([[Jacques Lacan]], [[Alfred Lorenzer]]), and [[deconstruction]].

When, in the 1970s and 1980s, [[Jürgen Habermas]] redefined critical social theory as a theory of communication, i.e. communicative competence and communicative rationality on the one hand, distorted communication on the other, the two versions of critical theory began to overlap or intertwine to a much greater degree than before.

===Construction===
Both versions of critical theory have focused on the processes by which human communication, culture, and [[political consciousness]] are created. This includes:
* Whether it is through universal pragmatic principles through which mutual understanding is achieved ([[Habermas]]).
* The [[semiotic]] rules by which objects obtain symbolic meanings ([[Barthes]]).
* The psychological processes by which the phenomena of everyday consciousness are generated ([[psychoanalytic]] thinkers).
* The ''[[episteme]]'' that underlies our cognitive formations ([[Foucault]]), 

There is a common interest in the processes (often of a linguistic or symbolic kind) that give rise to observable phenomena and here there is some mutual influence among the different versions of critical theory.
Ultimately this emphasis on production and construction goes back to the revolution wrought by [[Kant]] in philosophy, namely his focus in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' on synthesis according to rules as the fundamental activity of the mind that creates the order of our experience.

The '''clavichord''' is a European stringed [[keyboard instrument]] known from the late [[Medieval music|Medieval]], through the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] eras. Historically, it was widely used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard. The name is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''clavis'', meaning &quot;key&quot; (associated with more common ''clavus'', meaning &quot;nail, rod, etc.&quot;) and ''chorda'' (from Greek χορδή) meaning &quot;string, especially of a musical instrument&quot;.

From [[John Mainwaring]]:s biography of Handel:

{{quote|From his very childhood [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] had discovered such a strong propensity to Music, that his father, who always intended him for the study of the Civil Law, had reason to be alarmed. Perceiving that this inclination still increased, he took every method to oppose it. He strictly forbad him to meddle with any musical instrument; nothing of that kind was suffered to remain in the house, nor was he ever permitted to go to any other, where such kind of furniture was in use. All this caution and art, instead of restraining, did but augment his passion. He had found means to get a little clavichord privately convey’d to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep. He had made some progress before Music had been prohibited, and by his assiduous practice at hours of rest, had made such farther advances, as, tho’ not attended to at that time, were no slight prognostications of his future greatness.|4=John Mainwaring, ''Memoirs of the Life of the late G. F. Handel'', 1760.}}

==History and use==
[[Image:Komponierzimmer Bachhaus.jpg|thumb|left|Clavichord in Bach's birthplace in [[Eisenach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kottick|1997|p=85–87}}. The Bachhaus contains 4 clavichords, including an early 19th century pedal clavichord by Johann Georg Marckert.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The clavichord was invented in the early fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brauchli|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jeans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1504, the German poem Der Minne Regeln mentions the terms clavicimbalum (a term used mainly for the [[harpsichord]]) and clavichordium, designating them as the best instruments to accompany melodies.

clavichord, [[Cité de la Musique]], Paris (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Musée de la Musique, Paris]]
One of the earliest references to the clavichord in England occurs in the privy-purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, in an entry dated August 1502:
:'' Item. The same day, [[Hugh Denys of Osterley|Hugh Denys]] for money by him delivered to a stranger that gave the queen a payre of clavycordes. In crowns form his reward iiii libres.''&lt;ref&gt;Brinsmead, Edgar. History of the Pianoforte, London, 1879.pp.90-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was very popular from the 16th century to the 18th century, but mainly flourished in German-speaking lands, [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the latter part of this period. It had fallen out of use by 1850. In the late 1890s, [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] revived clavichord construction and [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]], among others, helped to popularize the instrument. Although most of the instruments built before the 1730s were small (four octaves, four feet long), the latest instruments were built up to seven feet long with a six octave range.

Today clavichords are played primarily by Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical music enthusiasts. They attract many interested buyers, and are manufactured worldwide. A modern clavichord can range in price from $2,400 to as much as $20,000. There are now numerous clavichord societies around the world, and some 400 recordings of the instrument have been made in the past 70 years. Leading modern exponents of the instrument include [[Derek Adlam]], [[Christopher Hogwood]], [[Richard Troeger]], and [[Miklos Spányi]], and fine modern instruments are widely available. Some modern makers include: [http://www.dickverwolf.nl Dick Verwolf] in the Netherlands, Peter Bavington and Karin Richter in Great Britain, Joris Potvlieghe and Jean Tournay in Belgium, Thomas Steiner in Switzerland, and Ronald Haas, Owen Daly, [http://www.clavichords.com Charles Wolff], David Jensen, Andrew Lagerquist, and [http://www.garyblaise.com Gary Blaise] in the United States.

===Modern music===
The clavichord has also gained attention in other genres of music, in the form of the [[clavinet]], which is essentially an electric clavichord which uses a magnetic pickup to provide a signal for amplification. [[Stevie Wonder]] uses a clavinet in many of his songs, such as &quot;[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]&quot; and &quot;[[Higher Ground (Stevie Wonder song)|Higher Ground]]&quot;. A clavinet played through an [[instrument amplifier]] with guitar [[effect pedal]]s is often associated with [[funk]]y, [[disco]]-infused 1970s rock.

[[Guy Sigsworth]] has played clavichord in a modern setting with [[Bjork]], notably on the studio recording of &quot;[[All Is Full Of Love]]&quot;.

[[Tori Amos]] uses the instrument on &quot;Little Amsterdam&quot; from the album ''[[Boys For Pele]]'' as well as on the song &quot;Smokey Joe&quot; from her 2007 album ''[[American Doll Posse]]''. 

In 1976 [[Oscar Peterson]] played (with Joe Pass on acoustic guitar) songs from Porgy And Bess on the clavichord. [[Keith Jarrett]] also recorded an album entitled ''Book of Ways'' (1987) in which he plays a series of clavichord improvisations. [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[For No One]]&quot; (1966) features [[Paul McCartney]] playing the clavichord. [[Rick Wakeman]] plays the clavichord in the track &quot;The Battle&quot; from the album [[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]].

==Structure and action==
[[Image:Clavichord action.svg|thumb|right|450px|Schematic diagram of clavichord mechanism: A/B. Keys. 1A/1B. Tangents. 2A/2B. Keylevers. 3. String. 4. Soundboard. 5. Bridge-pin, next to tuning peg. 6. Damping felt, next to hitch-pin. (Note that the keylevers are perpendicular to the strings.) &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brauchli|1998|p=1–10}}. The introduction to this book contains far more detailed and accurate diagrams, labeled by the technical names of the different parts of the clavichord.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the clavichord, strings run transversely from the [[hitchpin rail]] at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers with a small brass tangent, a small piece of metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the ''hammering'' technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] and as the initiator of sound. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as ''[[Bebung]]''). When the key is released, the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration of the string is silenced by strips of damping cloth.

The action of the clavichord is unique among all keyboard instruments in that one part of the action simultaneously initiates the sound vibration while at the same time defining the endpoint of the vibrating string, and thus its pitch. Because of this intimate contact between the player's hand and the production of sound, the clavichord has been referred to as the most intimate of keyboard instruments. Despite its many (serious) limitations, including extremely low volume, it has considerable expressive power, the player being able to control attack, duration, volume, and even provide certain subtle effects of swelling of tone and a type of vibrato unique to the clavichord.

==Fretting==
[[Image:Clavichord-JA Haas 007 reworked.jpg|thumb|Large five-octave unfretted clavichord by Paul Maurici, after [[Johann Adolph Hass|J.A. Hass]]]]
Since the string vibrates from the bridge only as far as the tangent, multiple keys with multiple tangents can be assigned to the same string. This is called ''fretting''. Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed [[monochord]] &amp;mdash; an instrument with only one string &amp;mdash; though most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted. Since only one note can be played at a time on each string, the fretting pattern is generally chosen so that notes which are rarely heard together (such as C and C#) share a string pair. The advantages to this system compared with unfretted instruments (see below) include relative ease of [[Musical tuning|tuning]] (with around half as many strings to keep in tune), greater volume (though still not really enough for use in [[chamber music]]), and a clearer, more direct sound. Among the disadvantages: [[Musical temperament|temperament]] could not be re-set without bending the tangents; and playing required a further refinement of touch, since notes sharing a single string played in quick succession needed to be slightly separated to avoid a disagreeable deadening of the sound, potentially disturbing a [[legato]] line.
[[Image:Clavicord.jpg|thumb|Fretted clavichord, copy of an unsigned instrument conserved in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], [[Belgium]]. The way the same string pair is used for several notes is clearly visible in the full size image.]]
Some clavichords have been built with a single pair of strings for each note. The first known reference to one was by [[Johann Speth]] in 1693 and the earliest such extant signed and dated clavichord was built in 1716 by Johann Michael Heinitz. Such instruments are referred to as ''unfretted'' whereas instruments using the same strings for several notes are called ''fretted''. Among the advantages to unfretted instruments are flexibility in tuning (the temperament can be easily altered) and the ability to play any music exactly as written without concern for &quot;bad&quot; notes. Disadvantages include a smaller volume, even though many or most unfretted instruments tend to be significantly larger than fretted instruments; and ''many'' more strings to keep in tune. Unfretted instruments tend to have a sweeter, less incisive tone due to the greater load on the bridge resulting from the greater number of strings, though the large, late (early 19th century) Swedish clavichords tend to be the loudest of any of the historic clavichords.

==Pedal clavichord==
[[Image:Pedal-clavichord.jpg|thumb|right|J. Verscheure Reynvaan: engraving of an eighteenth century pedal clavichord]]
While clavichords were typically single manual instruments, they could be stacked to provide multiple keyboards. With the addition of a '''pedal clavichord''', which included a [[pedal keyboard]] for the lower notes, a clavichord could be used to practice organist repertoire. In the era of [[pipe organ]]s which used hand-pumped blowers, and of churches which were only heated during church services, organists used [[harpsichord|pedal harpsichord]]s and pedal clavichords as practice instruments (see also: [[pedal piano]]).&lt;ref&gt;The use of the pedal clavichord as a practice instrument is discussed by Friedrich Griepenkerl in the 1844 foreword to Volume I of the first edition of the complete organ works of J.S. Bach; see {{harvnb|Riemenschneider|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that some works written for organ may have been intended for pedal clavichord. An interesting case is made by {{harvtxt|Speerstra|2004}} that [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] [[Eight Short Preludes and Fugues|&quot;Eight Little Preludes and Fugues&quot;]], now thought to be spurious, may actually be authentic. The keyboard writing seems unsuited to organ, but Speerstra argues that they are idiomatic on the pedal clavichord. As Speerstra and {{harvtxt|Williams|2003}} also note, the compass of the keyboard parts of Bach's six organ [[trio sonata]]s BWV 525–530 rarely go below the tenor C, so could have been played on a single manual pedal clavichord, by moving the left hand down an octave, a customary practice in the 18th century. Various modern copies have been made of surviving pedal clavichords, such as the one in the [[Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig|Instrumenten-Museum]] in the [[University of Leipzig]] built in the 1760s by the organ-builder Johann David Gerstenberg from [[Geringswalde]] in [[Saxony]].

==Repertoire==
[[File:Gerard Dou, Woman at the Clavicord.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gerard Dou]], Woman at the Clavichord]]

Much of the musical repertoire written for [[harpsichord]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] from the period circa 1400–1800 can be played on the clavichord; however, it does not have enough (unamplified) volume to participate in chamber music, with the possible exception of providing accompaniment to a soft baroque flute, recorder, or single singer. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] was a great proponent of the instrument, and most of his German contemporaries regarded it as a central keyboard instrument, for performing, teaching, composing and practicing.
Among recent clavichord recordings, those by Christopher Hogwood (''The Secret Bach'', ''The Secret Handel'',&lt;!-- That's the title: see http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000CDYDGC --&gt; and, most recently, ''The Secret Mozart''), break new ground. In his liner notes, Hogwood points out that these composers would typically have played the clavichord in the privacy of their homes. The English composer [[Herbert Howells]](1892–1983) wrote two significant collections of pieces for Clavichord (Lambert's Clavichord &amp; Howells' Clavichord).

In [[classical mechanics]], '''centrifugal force''' is an outward [[force]], relative to some (possibly not stationary) origin, which arises when describing the motion of objects in [[rotating reference frame]]s.  The centrifugal force is one of several so-called [[fictitious force]]s (also known as pseudo forces), so named because, unlike [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]], they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Rather, centrifugal force originates in the curved motion of the frame of reference within which observations are made.&lt;ref&gt;

== Derivation ==
{{Main|Rotating reference frame}}
{{See also|Fictitious force|Mechanics of planar particle motion}}

For the following formalism, the [[rotating frame of reference]] is regarded as a special case of a [[non-inertial reference frame]] that is rotating relative to an [[inertial reference frame]] denoted the stationary frame.

=== Velocity ===

In a rotating frame of reference bodies can have the same positions as in a nonrotating frame, but they will move differently due to the rotation of the frame. Consequently, the time derivatives of any position vector {{math|'''''r'''''}} depending on time (velocity {{math|d'''''r'''''/d''t''}} and acceleration {{math|d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''r'''''/dt&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) will differ according to the rotation. When time derivative {{math|[d'''''r'''''/d''t'']}} is evaluated from a reference frame with a coincident origin at &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; but rotating with the absolute [[angular velocity]] {{math|'''Ω'''}}:&lt;ref name=Synge&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} = \left[\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t}\right] + \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[vector cross product]] and square brackets {{math|'''[...]'''}} denote evaluation in the rotating frame of reference. In other words, the apparent velocity in the rotating frame is altered by the amount of the apparent rotation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}&lt;/math&gt; at each point, which is perpendicular to both the vector from the origin {{math|'''r'''}} and the axis of rotation {{math|'''Ω'''}} and directly proportional in magnitude to each of them. The vector {{math|'''Ω'''}} has magnitude {{math|Ω}} equal to the rate of rotation and is directed along the axis of rotation according to the [[right-hand rule]]. The angle must be measured in [[radians]] per unit of time.

=== Acceleration ===

Newton's law of motion for a particle of mass ''m'' can be written in vector form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} = m\boldsymbol{a}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''F'''''}} is the vector sum of the physical forces applied to the particle and {{math|'''''a'''''}} is the absolute [[acceleration]] (that is, acceleration in a stationary frame) of the particle, given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{a}=\frac{\operatorname{d}^2\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''r'''''}} is the position vector of the particle. The differentiations are performed in the stationary frame.

By twice applying the transformation above from the stationary to the rotating frame, the absolute acceleration of the particle can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{a} &amp;=\frac{\operatorname{d}^2\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} = \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t}\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} = \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t} \left( \left[\frac{\operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t}\right] + \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}\ \right) \\
 &amp;= \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^2 \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t^2} \right] + \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{\Omega}}{\operatorname{d}t}\times\boldsymbol{r} + 2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}\times \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d} \boldsymbol{r}}{\operatorname{d}t} \right] + \boldsymbol{\Omega}\times ( \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}) \ .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Force ===

The apparent acceleration in the rotating frame is [d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;r/dt&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]. An observer unaware of the rotation would expect this to be zero in the absence of outside forces. However [[Newton's first law]] applies only in the stationary frame, to the absolute acceleration d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''r''/dt&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore the observer perceives the extra terms as accelerations imposed by fictitious forces. These terms in the apparent acceleration are independent of mass; so it appears that each of these fictitious forces, like gravity, pulls on an object in proportion to its mass. When these forces are added, the equation of motion has the form:&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2005). p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnold_A&gt;

== Advantages of rotating frames ==

When living on Earth the rotating frame of reference is far more convenient to use than one in which our velocity changes daily by hundreds of kilometers per hour. But even from the abstract stance of solving problems in mechanics, a rotating reference frame can have advantages over a stationary reference frame.&lt;ref name=Marion&gt;

By treating the extra acceleration terms due to the rotation of the frame as if they were forces, subtracting them from the physical forces, it's possible to treat the second time derivative of position (relative to the rotating frame) as absolute acceleration. Thus the analysis using Newton's law can proceed as if the reference frame was stationary, provided the fictitious force terms are included in the sum of forces.

== Examples ==

Below several examples illustrate both the stationary and rotating frames of reference, and the role of centrifugal force and its relation to Coriolis force in rotating frameworks. For more examples see [[Fictitious force#Crossing a carousel|Fictitious force]], [[Rotating_bucket#Detailed_analysis|rotating bucket]] and [[Rotating_spheres#Formulation_of_the_argument|rotating spheres]].

=== Dropping ball ===
[[File:Falling object.PNG|thumb|450px|A ball moving vertically along the axis of rotation in a stationary frame appears to spiral downward in the rotating frame. The right panel shows a downward view in the rotating frame. The rate of rotation '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Ω&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' = ω is assumed constant in time]]

An example of [[straight-line motion]] as seen in a stationary frame is a ball that steadily drops at a constant rate parallel to the axis of rotation. From a stationary frame of reference it moves in a straight line, but from the rotating frame it moves in a spiral. The projection of the spiral motion in a rotating horizontal plane is shown at the right of the figure. Because the projected horizontal motion in the rotating frame is a circular motion, the ball's motion requires an inward centripetal force, provided in this case by a fictitious force that produces the apparent spiral motion. This force is the sum of an outward centrifugal force and an inward Coriolis force. The Coriolis force overcompensates the centrifugal force by exactly the required amount to provide the necessary centripetal force to achieve circular motion.

=== Banked turn ===
{{Main|Banked turn}}
{{See also|Centripetal force#Example: The banked turn|Reactive centrifugal force#Example: The turning car}}

Riding a car around a curve, we take a personal view that we are at rest in the car, and should be undisturbed in our seats. Nonetheless, we feel sideways force applied to us from the seats and doors and a need to lean to one side. To explain the situation, we propose a centrifugal force that is acting upon us and must be combated. Interestingly, we find this discomfort is reduced when the curve is banked, tipping the car inward toward the center of the curve.

A different point of view is that of the highway designer. The designer views the car as executing curved motion and therefore requiring an inward centripetal force to impel the car around the turn. By banking the curve, the force exerted upon the car in a direction normal to the road surface has a horizontal component that provides this centripetal force. That means the car tires no longer need to apply a sideways force to the car, but only a force perpendicular to the road. By choosing the angle of bank to match the car's speed around the curve, the car seat transmits only a perpendicular force to the passengers, and the passengers no longer feel a need to lean nor feel a sideways push by the car seats or doors.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;

Gravity diminishes according to the [[inverse square]] of distance, but centrifugal force increases in direct proportion to the distance. Thus a circular [[geosynchronous orbit]] has a radius of 42164&amp;nbsp;km; 42164/6378.1 = 6.61, the cube root of 289.

=== Planetary motion ===
{{See also|Orbit|Two-body problem|Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}

Centrifugal force arises in the analysis of [[orbital mechanics|orbital motion]] and, more generally, of motion in a [[central force|central-force]] field: in the case of a [[two-body problem]], it is easy to convert to an equivalent one-body problem with force directed to or from an origin, and motion in a plane,&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; so we consider only that.

The symmetry of a central force lends itself to a description in [[polar coordinates]]. The dynamics of a mass, ''m'', expressed using [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]] ('''F''' = ''m'''''a'''), becomes in polar coordinates:&lt;ref name=&quot;John_C_Taylor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} = m((\ddot r - r \dot \theta^2) \boldsymbol{\hat r} + (r \ddot\theta + 2 \dot r \dot\theta) \boldsymbol{\hat \theta})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the force accelerating the object and the &quot;hat&quot; variables are unit direction vectors (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; points in the centrifugal or outward direction, and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}&lt;/math&gt; is [[orthogonal]] to it).

In the case of a central force, relative to the origin of the polar coordinate system, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;F(r) \boldsymbol{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the entire force is the component in the radial direction. An inward force of gravity would therefore correspond to a negative-valued ''F''(''r'').

The components of '''F''' = ''m'''''a''' along the radial direction therefore reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;F(r) = m(\ddot r - r \dot\theta^2) &lt;/math&gt;

in which the term proportional to the square of the rate of rotation appears on the acceleration side as a &quot;centripetal acceleration&quot;, that is, a negative acceleration term in the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; direction.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2005). p. 358-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the special case of a planet in ''circular'' orbit around its star, for example, where &lt;math&gt;\ddot r&lt;/math&gt; is zero, the centripetal acceleration alone is the entire acceleration of the planet, curving its path toward the sun under the force of gravity, the negative ''F''(''r'').

As pointed out by Taylor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor_2005_359&quot;&gt;Taylor (2005). p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, it is sometimes convenient to work in a ''co-rotating frame'', that is, one rotating with the object so that the angular rate of the frame, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, equals the &lt;math&gt;\dot\theta&lt;/math&gt; of the object in the stationary frame. In such a frame, the observed &lt;math&gt;\dot \theta &lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt;\ddot r&lt;/math&gt; alone is treated as the acceleration: so in the equation of motion, the &lt;math&gt;m r \dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt; term is &quot;reincarnated on the force side of the equation (with opposite signs, of course) as the centrifugal force ''mΩ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;r'' in the radial equation&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor_2005_359&quot; /&gt; The &quot;reincarnation&quot; on the force side of the equation is necessary because, without this force term, observers in the rotating frame would find they could not predict the motion correctly. They would have an incorrect radial equation:

:&lt;math&gt;F(r) + m r \dot\theta^2 = m\ddot r &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;m r \dot\theta^2&lt;/math&gt; term is known as the centrifugal force. The centrifugal force term in this equation is called a &quot;fictitious force&quot;, &quot;apparent force&quot;, or &quot;pseudo force&quot;, as its value varies with the rate of rotation of the [[frame of reference]]. When the centrifugal force term is expressed in terms of parameters of the rotating frame, replacing &lt;math&gt;\dot\theta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, it can be seen that it is the same centrifugal force [[#Derivation|previously derived]] for rotating reference frames.

Because of the absence of a net force in the azimuthal direction, [[conservation of angular momentum]] allows the radial component of this equation to be expressed solely with respect to the radial coordinate, ''r'', and the angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L=m \dot\theta r^2&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the radial equation (a &quot;fictitious one-dimensional problem&quot;&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; with only an ''r'' dimension):

:&lt;math&gt;F(r) + \frac{L^2}{mr^3} = m \ddot r &lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;math&gt;L^2/mr^3&lt;/math&gt; term is again the centrifugal force, a force component induced by the rotating frame of reference. The equations of motion for ''r'' that result from this equation for the rotating 2D frame are the same that would arise from a particle in a fictitious one-dimensional scenario under the influence of the force in the equation above.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''F''(''r'') represents gravity, it is a negative term proportional to 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so the net acceleration in ''r'' in the rotating frame depends on a difference of reciprocal square and reciprocal cube terms, which are in balance in a circular orbit but otherwise typically not. This equation of motion is similar to one originally proposed by [[Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;

When the angular velocity of this co-rotating frame is not constant, that is, for non-circular orbits, other fictitious forces—the [[Coriolis force]] and the [[Euler force]]—will arise, but can be ignored since they will cancel each other, yielding a net zero acceleration transverse to the moving radial vector, as required by the starting assumption that the &lt;math&gt;\hat r&lt;/math&gt; vector co-rotates with the planet.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|History of centrifugal and centripetal forces}}

Concepts of centripetal and centrifugal force played a key early role in establishing the set of inertial frames of reference and the significance of fictitious forces, even aiding in the development of [[general relativity]] in which [[gravity]] itself becomes a fictituous force.&lt;ref name=VonBaeyerEssays&gt;

== Applications ==

The operations of numerous common rotating mechanical systems are most easily conceptualized in terms of centrifugal force. For example:

* A [[centrifugal governor]] regulates the speed of an engine by using spinning masses that move radially, adjusting the [[throttle]], as the engine changes speed. In the reference frame of the spinning masses, centrifugal force causes the radial movement.
* A [[centrifugal clutch]] is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. [[Self-locking device#Inertial drum brake ascender|Inertial drum brake ascenders]] used in [[rock climbing]] and the [[seat belt#Technologies|inertia reels]] used in many automobile seat belts operate on the same principle.
* Centrifugal forces can be used to generate [[artificial gravity]], as in proposed designs for rotating space stations. The [[Mars Gravity Biosatellite]] will study the effects of [[Mars]]-level gravity on mice with gravity simulated in this way.
*[[Spin casting]] and [[centrifugal casting (industrial)|centrifugal casting]] are production methods that uses centrifugal force to disperse liquid metal or plastic throughout the negative space of a mold.
* [[Centrifuge]]s are used in science and industry to separate substances. In the reference frame spinning with the centrifuge, the centrifugal force induces a hydrostatic pressure gradient in fluid-filled tubes oriented perpendicular to the axis of rotation, giving rise to large [[buoyant force]]s which push low-density particles inward. Elements or particles denser than the fluid move outward under the influence of the centrifugal force. This is effectively [[Archimedes' principle]] as generated by centrifugal force as opposed to being generated by gravity.
* Some [[amusement ride]]s make use of centrifugal forces. For instance, a [[Gravitron]]'s spin forces riders against a wall and allows riders to be elevated above the machine's floor in defiance of Earth's gravity.

Nevertheless, all of these systems can also be described without requiring the concept of centrifugal force, in terms of motions and forces in a stationary frame, at the cost of taking somewhat more care in the consideration of forces and motions within the system.

&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical description was derived in 1659 by Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]]. [[Isaac Newton]]'s description was: &quot;A centripetal force is that by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a center.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sommerfeld&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula==

The magnitude of the centripetal force on an object of mass ''m'' moving at a speed ''v'' along a path with [[radius of curvature]] ''r'' is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;F = ma_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_c&lt;/math&gt; is the centripetal acceleration.
The direction of the force is toward the center of the circle in which the object is moving, or the [[osculating circle]], the circle that best fits the local path of the object, if the path is not circular.&lt;ref&gt;

This force is also sometimes written in terms of the [[angular velocity]] ''ω'' of the object about the center of the circle:

:&lt;math&gt;F = m r \omega^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Sources of centripetal force==

For a [[satellite]] in [[orbit]] around a [[planet]], the centripetal force is supplied by gravity. Some sources, including [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], refer to the entire gravitational force as a centripetal force, even for non-circular orbits, for which gravity is not aligned with the direction to the center of curvature.&lt;ref&gt;

The gravitational force acts on each object toward the other, which is toward the [[center of mass]] of the two objects; for circular orbits, this center of gravity is the center of the circular orbits.  For non-circular orbits or trajectories, only the component of gravitational force directed orthogonal to the path (toward the center of the osculating circle) is termed centripetal; the remaining component acts to speed up or slow down the satellite in its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;

For an object swinging around on the end of a rope in a horizontal plane, the centripetal force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. For a spinning object, internal [[tensile stress]] provides the centripetal forces that make the parts of the object trace out circular motions.

The rope example is an example involving a 'pull' force. The centripetal force can also be supplied as a 'push' force such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the centripetal force for a [[wall of death (motorcycle act)|wall of death]] rider.

Another example of centripetal force arises in the helix which is traced out when a charged particle moves in a uniform [[magnetic field]] in the absence of other external forces. In this case, the magnetic force is the centripetal force which acts towards the helix axis.

==Analysis of several cases==

Below are three examples of increasing complexity, with derivations of the formulas governing velocity and acceleration.

===Uniform circular motion===
{{See also|Circular motion|Uniform circular motion}}

Uniform circular motion refers to the case of constant rate of rotation. Here are two approaches to describing this case.

====Geometric derivation====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

[[Image:Uniform motion in circle.svg|thumb|Figure 2: Left circle: The particle's orbit – particle moves in a circle and velocity is tangent to orbit; Right circle: a &quot;velocity circle&quot;; velocity vectors are brought together so tails coincide: because velocity is a constant in uniform motion, the tip of the velocity vector describes a circle, and acceleration is [[tangent lines to circles|tangent to the velocity circle]]. That means the acceleration is radially inward in the left-hand circle showing the orbit.]]

The circle in the left of Figure 2 shows an object moving on a circle at constant speed at two different times in its orbit. Its position is given by the vector '''R''' and its velocity by the vector '''v'''.

The velocity vector is always [[perpendicular]] to the position vector (since the velocity vector is always [[tangent]] to the circle of motion). Since '''R''' moves in a circle, so does '''v'''. The circular motion of the velocity is shown in the circle on the right of Figure 2, along with its [[acceleration]] '''a'''. Just as velocity is the rate of change of position, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

Since the position and velocity vectors move in tandem, they go around their circles in the same time ''T''. That time equals the distance traveled divided by the velocity

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{2\pi|\mathbf{R}|}{|\mathbf{v}|}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
and, by analogy,

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{2\pi |\mathbf{v}|}{|\mathbf{a}|}
&lt;/math&gt;

Setting these two equations equal and solving for |'''a'''|, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
|\mathbf{a}| = \frac{|\mathbf{v}|^{2}}{|\mathbf{R}|}
&lt;/math&gt;

The angular rate of rotation in [[radian per second|radians per second]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac {2 \pi} {T} \ &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the two circles in Figure 2 also shows that the acceleration points toward the center of the '''R''' circle. For example, in the left circle in Figure 2, the position vector '''R''' pointing at 12 o'clock has a velocity vector '''v''' pointing at 9 o'clock, which (switching to the circle on the right) has an acceleration vector '''a''' pointing at 6 o'clock. So the acceleration vector is opposite to '''R''' and toward the center of the '''R''' circle.

====Derivation using vectors====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

[[Image:Circular motion vectors.PNG|right|thumb|Figure 3: Vector relationships for uniform circular motion; vector 

'''Ω''' representing the rotation is normal to the plane of the orbit with polarity determined by the [[right-hand rule]] and magnitude ''dθ'' /''dt''.]]
Figure 3 shows the vector relationships for uniform circular motion. The rotation itself is represented by the vector '''Ω''', which is normal to the plane of the orbit (using the [[right-hand rule]]) and has magnitude given by:
:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{\Omega}| = \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta } {\mathrm{d}t} = \omega \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''θ'' the angular position at time ''t''. In this subsection, d''θ''/d''t'' is assumed constant, independent of time. The distance traveled '''ℓ''' of the particle in time d''t'' along the circular path is 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} = \mathbf {\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}(t) \mathrm{d}t \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which, by properties of the [[vector cross product]], has magnitude ''r''d''θ'' and is in the direction tangent to the circular path. 

Consequently,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac {\mathbf{r}(t + \mathrm{d}t)-\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In other words,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{ = }\ \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\ell}}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf {\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}(t)\ . &lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to time,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{ = }\  \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v}} {d\mathrm{t}} = \mathbf {\Omega} \times \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{\Omega} \times \left[ \mathbf {\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}(t)\right] \ .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Triple_product#Vector_triple_product|Lagrange's formula]] states:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \times \left ( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} \right ) = \mathbf{b} \left ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} \right ) - \mathbf{c}  \left ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \right ) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Applying Lagrange's formula with the observation that '''Ω • r'''(''t'') = 0 at all times,
::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = - {|\mathbf{\Omega|}}^2 \mathbf{r}(t) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the acceleration is pointing directly opposite to the radial displacement '''r''' at all times, and has a magnitude:
::&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{a}| = |\mathbf{r}(t)| \left ( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \right) ^2 = R {\omega}^2\ &lt;/math&gt;

where vertical bars |...| denote the vector magnitude, which in the case of '''r'''(''t'') is simply the radius ''R'' of the path. This result agrees with the previous section if the substitution is made for rate of rotation in terms of the period of rotation ''T'':
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{d} \theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \omega = \frac {2 \pi } {T} = \frac {|\mathbf{v}|}{R} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

When the rate of rotation is made constant in the analysis of [[Centripetal force#Nonuniform circular motion|nonuniform circular motion]], that analysis agrees with this one.

A merit of the vector approach is that it is manifestly independent of any coordinate system.

====Example: The banked turn====
{{Main|Banked turn}}
{{See also|Reactive centrifugal force}}

[[Image:Banked turn.PNG|thumb|Figure 4: Upper panel: Ball on a banked circular track moving with constant speed ''v''; Lower panel: Forces on the ball.]]

The upper panel in Figure 4 shows a ball in circular motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle ''θ'' from the horizontal, and the surface of the road is considered to be slippery. The object is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road.&lt;ref name = Lerner&gt;{{cite book |title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers |author = Lawrence S. Lerner |page = 128 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=kJOnAvimS44C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=centripetal+%22banked+curve%22
|isbn = 0867204796 |year = 1997 |location = Boston |publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuition tells us that on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.

Apart from any acceleration that might occur in the direction of the path, the lower panel of Figure 4 indicates the forces on the ball. There are ''two'' forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball ''m'''''g''' where ''m'' is the mass of the ball and '''g''' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]; the second is the upward [[normal force]] exerted by the road perpendicular to the road surface ''m'''''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion also is shown in Figure 4. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the [[net force]] on the ball resulting from [[vector addition]] of the [[normal force]] and the [[force of gravity]]. The resultant or [[net force]] on the ball found by [[vector addition]] of the [[normal force]] exerted by the road and vertical force due to [[gravity]] must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path.  The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.

The horizontal net force on the ball is the horizontal component of the force from the road, which has magnitude |'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;| = ''m''|'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|sin''θ''. The vertical component of the force from the road must counteract the gravitational force: |'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;| = ''m''|'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|cos''θ'' = ''m''|'''g'''|, which implies |'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|=|'''g'''| / cos''θ''.  Substituting into the above formula for |'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;| yields a horizontal force to be:

:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{h}| = m |\mathbf{g}| \frac { \mathrm{sin}\ \theta}{ \mathrm {cos}\ \theta} = m|\mathbf{g}| \mathrm{tan}\ \theta \ . &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, at velocity |'''v'''| on a circular path of radius ''R'', kinematics says that the force needed to turn the ball continuously into the turn is the radially inward centripetal force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{c}| = m |\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{c}| = \frac{m|\mathbf{v}|^2}{R} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Consequently the ball is in a stable path when the angle of the road is set to satisfy the condition:

:&lt;math&gt;m |\mathbf{g}| \mathrm{tan}\ \theta = \frac{m|\mathbf{v}|^2}{R} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

or,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{tan}\ \theta = \frac {|\mathbf{v}|^2} {|\mathbf{g}|R} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

As the angle of bank ''θ'' approaches 90°, the [[tangent function]] approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |'''v'''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''R''. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |'''v'''|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for ''θ''), and for sharper turns (smaller ''R'') the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle ''θ'' does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If [[friction]] cannot do this (that is, the [[coefficient of friction]] is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.&lt;ref name = Schaum&gt;{{cite book |title = Schaum's Outline of Applied Physics |author = Arthur Beiser |page = 103 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=soKguvJDgmsC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=friction+%22banked+turn%22

===Nonuniform circular motion===
{{See also|Circular motion|Non-uniform circular motion}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

[[Image:Nonuniform circular motion.svg|thumb|Figure 5: Velocity and acceleration for nonuniform circular motion: the velocity vector is tangential to the orbit, but the acceleration vector is not radially inward because of its tangential component '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; that increases the rate of rotation: ''d''ω / ''dt'' = &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; / ''R''.]]

As a generalization of the uniform circular motion case, suppose the angular rate of rotation is not constant. The acceleration now has a tangential component, as shown in Figure 5. This case is used to demonstrate a derivation strategy based upon a [[polar coordinate system]].

Let '''r'''(''t'') be a vector that describes the position of a [[point mass]] as a function of time. Since we are assuming [[circular motion]], let '''r'''(''t'') = ''R''·'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''R'' is a constant (the radius of the circle) and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[unit vector]] pointing from the origin to the point mass. The direction of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is described by ''θ'', the angle between the x-axis and the unit vector, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. The other unit vector for polar coordinates, '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is perpendicular to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and points in the direction of increasing ''θ''. These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] unit vectors in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions, denoted '''i''' and '''j''' respectively:&lt;ref&gt;Note: unlike the Cartesian unit vectors '''i''' and '''j''', which are constant, in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] the direction of the unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;'''r'''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;'''θ'''&lt;/sub&gt; depend on ''θ'', and so in general have non-zero time derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = cos''θ'' '''i''' + sin''θ'' '''j'''

and

:'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; = -sin''θ'' '''i''' + cos''θ'' '''j'''.

We differentiate to find velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = R \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = R \frac {\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \mathrm{cos}\ \theta \ \mathbf{i} + \mathrm{sin}\ \theta \ \mathbf{j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = R \frac {d \theta} {dt} \left( -\mathrm{sin}\ \theta \ \mathbf{i} + \mathrm{cos}\ \theta \ \mathbf{j}\right)\, &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = R \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} \, &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \omega R \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the angular velocity d''θ''/d''t''.

This result for the velocity matches expectations that the velocity should be directed tangential to the circle, and that the magnitude of the velocity should be ''ωR''. Differentiating again, 
and noting that

:&lt;math&gt;{\frac {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} = - \omega \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

we find that the acceleration, '''a''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = R \left( \frac {\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} - \omega^2 \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} \right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the radial and tangential components of the acceleration are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{r}} = - \omega^{2} R \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} = - \frac{|\mathbf{v}|^{2}}{ R} \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{r} \ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{\theta}} = R \ \frac {\mathrm{d}\omega}{\mathrm{d}t} \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} = \frac {\mathrm{d} | \mathbf{v} | }{\mathrm{d}t} \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{\theta} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where |'''v'''| = ''R''ω is the magnitude of the velocity (the speed).

These equations express mathematically that, in the case of an object that moves along a circular path with a changing speed, the acceleration of the body may be decomposed into a [[perpendicular component]] that changes the direction of motion (the centripetal acceleration), and a parallel, or [[tangential component]], that changes the speed.

===General planar motion===

[[Image:Polar unit vectors.PNG|thumb|Figure 6: Polar unit vectors at two times ''t'' and ''t'' + ''dt'' for a particle with trajectory '''r''' ( ''t'' ); on the left the unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; at the two times are moved so their tails all meet, and are shown to trace an arc of a unit radius circle. Their rotation in time ''dt'' is ''d''θ, just the same angle as the rotation of the trajectory '''r''' ( ''t'' ).]]

====Polar coordinates====
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2009}}

The above results can be derived perhaps more simply in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], and at the same time extended to general motion within a plane, as shown next. Polar coordinates in the plane employ a radial unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and an angular unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown in Figure 6.&lt;ref name = polar&gt;Although the polar coordinate system moves with the particle, the observer does not. The description of the particle motion remains a description from the stationary observer's point of view.&lt;/ref&gt; A particle at position '''r''' is described by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \rho \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where the notation ''ρ'' is used to describe the distance of the path from the origin instead of ''R'' to emphasize that this distance is not fixed, but varies with time. The unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; travels with the particle and always points in the same direction as '''r'''(''t''). Unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; also travels with the particle and stays orthogonal to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; form a local Cartesian coordinate system attached to the particle, and tied to the path traveled by the particle.&lt;ref&gt;Notice that this local coordinate system is not autonomous; for example, its rotation in time is dictated by the trajectory traced by the particle. Note also that the radial vector '''r'''(''t'') does not represent the [[Osculating circle|radius of curvature]] of the path.&lt;/ref&gt; By moving the unit vectors so their tails coincide, as seen in the circle at the left of Figure 6, it is seen that '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; form a right-angled pair with tips on the unit circle that trace back and forth on the perimeter of this circle with the same angle ''θ''(''t'') as '''r'''(''t'').

When the particle moves, its velocity is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + \rho \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

To evaluate the velocity, the derivative of the unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is needed. Because '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is a unit vector, its magnitude is fixed, and it can change only in direction, that is, its change d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; has a component only perpendicular to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;. When the trajectory '''r'''(''t'') rotates an amount d''θ'', '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;, which points in the same direction as '''r'''(''t''), also rotates by d''θ''. See Figure 6. Therefore the change in '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is 

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} = \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \mathrm{d}\theta \ , &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, the rate of change of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is found. As with '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;, '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is a unit vector and can only rotate without changing size. To remain orthogonal to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; while the trajectory '''r'''(''t'') rotates an amount d''θ'', '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, which is orthogonal to '''r'''(''t''), also rotates by d''θ''. See Figure 6. Therefore, the change d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; is orthogonal to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; and proportional to d''θ'' (see Figure 6):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Figure 6 shows the sign to be negative: to maintain orthogonality, if d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; is positive with d''θ'', then d'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; must decrease. 

Substituting the derivative of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; into the expression for velocity:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + \rho \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{v}_{\rho} + \mathbf{v}_{\theta} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain the acceleration, another time differentiation is done:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \rho }{\mathrm{d}t^2} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho }{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\rho}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac {\mathrm{d} \rho}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} + \rho \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{u}_{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} + \rho \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the derivatives of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, the acceleration of the particle is:&lt;ref name = Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Mechanics |author = John Robert Taylor |pages = 28–29 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;printsec=index&amp;dq=isbn=189138922X
|year = 2005 |isbn = 189138922X |publisher = University Science Books |location = Sausalito CA }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \rho }{\mathrm{d}t^2} \mathbf{u}_{\rho} + 2\frac {\mathrm{d} \rho}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}-\rho \mathbf{u}_{\rho}\left( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}\right)^2 + \rho \mathbf{u}_{\theta} \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \left[ \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \rho }{\mathrm{d}t^2}-\rho\left( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}\right)^2 \right] + \mathbf{u}_{\theta}\left[ 2\frac {\mathrm{d} \rho}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t} + \rho \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2}\right] \ &lt;/math&gt;

As a particular example, if the particle moves in a circle of constant radius ''R'', then d''ρ''/d''t'' = 0, '''v''' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, and:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \left[ -\rho\left( \frac {\mathrm{d} \theta} {\mathrm{d}t}\right)^2 \right] + \mathbf{u}_{\theta}\left[ \rho \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \theta} {\mathrm{d}t^2}\right] \ &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = \mathbf{u}_{\rho} \left[ -\frac{|\mathbf{v}|^2}{R}\right] + \mathbf{u}_{\theta}\left[  \frac {\mathrm{d} |\mathbf{v}|} {\mathrm{d}t}\right] \ . &lt;/math&gt;

These results agree with those above for [[Centripetal force#Nonuniform circular motion|nonuniform circular motion]]. See also the article on [[non-uniform circular motion]]. If this acceleration is multiplied by the particle mass, the leading term is the centripetal force and the negative of the second term related to angular acceleration is sometimes called the Euler force.&lt;ref name = Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |author = Cornelius Lanczos |title = The Variational Principles of Mechanics |url = http://books.google.com/?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Euler+force%22

For trajectories other than circular motion, for example, the more general trajectory envisioned in Figure 6, the instantaneous center of rotation and radius of curvature of the trajectory are related only indirectly to the coordinate system defined by '''u&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''u&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''' and to the length |'''r'''(''t'')| = ''ρ''. Consequently, in the general case, it is not straightforward to disentangle the centripetal and Euler terms from the above general acceleration equation.&lt;ref name = Curtis&gt;See, for example, {{cite book |title = Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students |author = Howard D.

====Local coordinates====

[[Image:Local unit vectors.PNG|thumb |Figure 7: Local coordinate system for planar motion on a curve. Two different positions are shown for distances ''s'' and ''s'' + ''ds'' along the curve. At each position ''s'', unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; points along the outward normal to the curve and unit vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is tangential to the path. The radius of curvature of the path is ρ as found from the rate of rotation of the tangent to the curve with respect to arc length, and is the radius of the [[osculating circle]] at position ''s''. The unit circle on the left shows the rotation of the unit vectors with ''s''.]]

By local coordinates is meant a set of coordinates that travel with the particle,
&lt;ref name = observer&gt;The ''observer'' of the motion along the curve is using these local coordinates to describe the motion from the observer's ''frame of reference'', 
that is, from a stationary point of view. 
In other words, although the local coordinate system moves with the particle, 
the observer does not. 
A change in coordinate system used by the observer is only a change in 
their ''description'' of observations, and does not mean that the observer
has changed their state of motion, and ''vice versa''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and have orientation determined by the path of the particle.&lt;ref name = Ito&gt;{{cite book |title = The immersed interface method: numerical solutions of PDEs involving interfaces and irregular domains |author = Zhilin Li &amp; Kazufumi Ito |page = 16 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=_E084AX-iO8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22local+coordinates%22

Distance along the path of the particle is the arc length ''s'', considered to be a known function of time.

:&lt;math&gt; s = s(t) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

A center of curvature is defined at each position ''s'' located a distance ''ρ'' (the [[Osculating_circle#Mathematical_description|radius of curvature]]) from the curve on a line along the normal '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (''s''). The required distance ''ρ''(''s'') at arc length ''s'' is defined in terms of the rate of rotation of the tangent to the curve, which in turn is determined by the path itself. If the orientation of the tangent relative to some starting position is ''θ''(''s''), then ''ρ''(''s'') is defined by the derivative d''θ''/d''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1} {\rho (s)} = \kappa (s) = \frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

The radius of curvature usually is taken as positive (that is, as an absolute value), while the ''[[Curvature#Local_expressions|curvature]]'' ''κ'' is a signed quantity. 

A geometric approach to finding the center of curvature and the radius of curvature uses a limiting process leading to the [[osculating circle]].&lt;ref name = osculating&gt;The osculating circle at a given point ''P'' on a curve is the limiting circle of a sequence of circles that pass through ''P'' and two other points on the curve, ''Q'' and ''R'', on either side of ''P'', as ''Q'' and ''R'' approach ''P''.

Using these coordinates, the motion along the path is viewed as a succession of circular paths of ever-changing center, and at each position ''s'' constitutes [[non-uniform circular motion]] at that position with radius ''ρ''. The local value of the angular rate of rotation then is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \omega(s) = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} \frac {\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{\rho(s)}\ \frac {\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{v(s)}{\rho(s)}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
with the local speed ''v'' given by:

:&lt;math&gt; v(s) = \frac {\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

As for the other examples above, because unit vectors cannot change magnitude, their rate of change is always perpendicular to their direction (see the left-hand insert in Figure 7):&lt;ref name = Gregory&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Mechanics: An Undergraduate Text |author = R.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)}{ds} = \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)\frac{d\theta}{ds} = \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)\frac{1}{\rho} \ ; &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)}{\mathrm{d}s} = -\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = - \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)\frac{1}{\rho} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

=====Alternative approach=====

Looking at Figure 7, one might wonder whether adequate account has been taken of the difference in curvature between ''ρ''(''s'') and ''ρ''(''s'' + d''s'') in computing the arc length as d''s'' = ''ρ''(''s'')d''θ''. Reassurance on this point can be found using a more formal approach outlined below. This approach also makes connection with the article on [[Curvature#Local_expressions|curvature]]. 

To introduce the unit vectors of the local coordinate system, one approach is to begin in Cartesian coordinates and describe the local coordinates in terms of these Cartesian coordinates. In terms of arc length ''s'' let the path be described as:&lt;ref name = curvature&gt;The article on [[curvature]] treats a more general case where the curve is parametrized by an arbitrary variable (denoted ''t''), rather than by the arc length ''s''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(s) = \left[ x(s),\ y(s) \right] \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Then an incremental displacement along the path d''s'' is described by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}(s) = \left[ \mathrm{d}x(s),\ \mathrm{d}y(s) \right] = \left[ x'(s),\ y'(s) \right] \mathrm{d}s \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where primes are introduced to denote derivatives with respect to ''s''. The magnitude of this displacement is d''s'', showing that:&lt;ref name = Shabana&gt;{{cite book |title = Railroad Vehicle Dynamics: A Computational Approach |author = Ahmed A. Shabana, Khaled E. Zaazaa, Hiroyuki Sugiyama |page = 91 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=YgIDSQT0FaUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA207&amp;dq=%22generalized+coordinate%22
|isbn = 1420045814 |publisher = CRC Press |year = 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[ x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2 \right] = 1 \ . &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;{{anchor|Eq. 1}}(Eq. 1)

This displacement is necessarily tangent to the curve at ''s'', showing that the unit vector tangent to the curve is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = \left[ x'(s), \ y'(s) \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

while the outward unit vector normal to the curve is 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) = \left[ y'(s),\ -x'(s) \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

[[Orthogonality]] can be verified by showing that the vector [[dot product]] is zero. The unit magnitude of these vectors is a consequence of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]. Using the tangent vector, the angle ''θ'' of the tangent to the curve is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{y'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}} = y'(s) \ ;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp; and &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac{x'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}} = x'(s) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The radius of curvature is introduced completely formally (without need for geometric interpretation) as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of ''θ'' can be found from that for sin''θ'':
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} \sin\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = \cos \theta \frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = \frac{1}{\rho} \cos \theta \ = \frac{1}{\rho} x'(s)\ . &lt;/math&gt;

Now:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} \sin \theta }{\mathrm{d}s} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s} \frac{y'(s)}{\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt; = \frac{y''(s)x'(s)^2-y'(s)x'(s)x''(s)} {\left(x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2\right)^{3/2}}\ , &lt;/math&gt;

in which the denominator is unity. With this formula for the derivative of the sine, the radius of curvature becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}s} = \frac{1}{\rho} = y''(s)x'(s) - y'(s)x''(s)\ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt; = \frac{y''(s)}{x'(s)} = -\frac{x''(s)}{y'(s)} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the equivalence of the forms stems from differentiation of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x'(s)x''(s) + y'(s)y''(s) = 0 \ . &lt;/math&gt;
With these results, the acceleration can be found:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{v}(s) &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt; = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left[\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( x'(s), \ y'(s) \right) \right]\ &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}^2s}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\right)\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) + \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) ^2 \left(x''(s),\ y''(s) \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}^2s}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\right)\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) - \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) ^2 \frac{1}{\rho} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
as can be verified by taking the dot product with the unit vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''). This result for acceleration is the same as that for circular motion based on the radius ''ρ''. Using this coordinate system in the inertial frame, it is easy to identify the force normal to the trajectory as the centripetal force and that parallel to the trajectory as the tangential force. From a qualitative standpoint, the path can be approximated by an arc of a circle for a limited time, and for the limited time a particular radius of curvature applies, the centrifugal and Euler forces can be analyzed on the basis of circular motion with that radius. 

This result for acceleration agrees with that found earlier. However, in this approach the question of the change in radius of curvature with ''s'' is handled completely formally, consistent with a geometric interpretation, but not relying upon it, thereby avoiding any questions Figure 7 might suggest about neglecting the variation in ''ρ''.

=====Example: circular motion=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

To illustrate the above formulas, let ''x'', ''y'' be given as:
:&lt;math&gt;x = \alpha \cos \frac{s}{\alpha} \ ; \ y = \alpha \sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = \alpha^2 \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which can be recognized as a circular path around the origin with radius ''α''. The position ''s'' = 0 corresponds to [''α'', 0], or 3 o'clock. To use the above formalism the derivatives are needed:

:&lt;math&gt;y^{\prime}(s) = \cos \frac{s}{\alpha} \ ; \ x^{\prime}(s) = -\sin \frac{s}{\alpha} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y^{\prime\prime}(s) = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ ; \ x^{\prime\prime}(s) = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\cos \frac{s}{\alpha} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

With these results one can verify that:
:&lt;math&gt; x^{\prime}(s)^2 + y^{\prime}(s)^2 = 1 \ ; \ \frac{1}{\rho} = y^{\prime\prime}(s)x^{\prime}(s)-y^{\prime}(s)x^{\prime\prime}(s) = \frac{1}{\alpha} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The unit vectors also can be found:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = \left[-\sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] \ ; \ \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) = \left[\cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which serve to show that ''s'' = 0 is located at position [''ρ'', 0] and ''s'' = ''ρ''π/2 at [0, ''ρ''], which agrees with the original expressions for ''x'' and ''y''. In other words, ''s'' is measured counterclockwise around the circle from 3 o'clock. Also, the derivatives of these vectors can be found:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = -\frac{1}{\alpha} \left[\cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) = \frac{1}{\alpha} \left[-\sin\frac{s}{\alpha} \ , \ \cos\frac{s}{\alpha} \right] = \frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain velocity and acceleration, a time-dependence for ''s'' is necessary. For counterclockwise motion at variable speed ''v''(''t''):
:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = \int_0^t \ dt^{\prime} \ v(t^{\prime}) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''(''t'') is the speed and ''t'' is time, and ''s''(''t'' = 0) = 0. Then:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v(t)\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) + v\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s) = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)-v\frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s)\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(s)-\frac{v^2}{\alpha}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}(s) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where it already is established that α = ρ. This acceleration is the standard result for [[non-uniform circular motion]].

[[Image:Checksum.svg|thumb|330px|right|Effect of a typical checksum function (the Unix &lt;tt&gt;[[cksum]]&lt;/tt&gt; utility).]]

A '''checksum''' or '''hash sum''' is a fixed-size [[datum]] computed from an arbitrary block of [[digital]] data for the purpose of [[error detection|detecting accidental errors]] that may have been introduced during its [[telecommunication|transmission]] or [[computer storage|storage]].  The integrity of the data can be [[redundancy check|checked]] at any later time by recomputing the checksum and comparing it with the stored one.  If the checksums match, the data were almost certainly not altered (either intentionally or unintentionally).

The [[algorithm|procedure]] that yields the checksum from the data is called a '''checksum function''' or '''checksum algorithm'''. A good checksum algorithm will yield a different result with high probability when the data is accidentally corrupted; if the checksums match, the data is very likely to be free of accidental errors. 

Checksum functions are related to [[hash function]]s, [[fingerprint (computing)|fingerprint]]s, [[randomization function]]s, and [[cryptographic hash function]]s.  However, each of those concepts has different applications and therefore different design goals.  [[Check digit]]s and [[parity bit]]s are special cases of checksums, appropriate for small blocks of data (such as [[Social Security number]]s, [[bank account]] numbers, [[Word (data type)|computer word]]s, single [[byte]]s, etc.).  Some [[error-correcting code]]s are based on special checksums that not only detect common errors but also allow the original data to be recovered in certain cases.

==Checksum algorithms==
===Parity byte or parity word===
The simplest checksum algorithm is the so-called [[longitudinal redundancy check|longitudinal parity check]], which breaks the data into &quot;words&quot; with a fixed number ''n'' of bits, and then computes the [[exclusive or]] of all those words.  The result is appended to the message as an extra word. To check the integrity of a message, the receiver computes the exclusive or of all its words, including the checksum; if the result is not a word with ''n'' zeros, the receiver knows that a transmission error occurred.

With this checksum, any transmission error that flips a single bit of the message, or an odd number of bits, will be detected as an incorrect checksum.  However, an error that affects two bits will not be detected if those bits lie at the same position in two distinct words.  If the affected bits are independently chosen at random, the probability of a two-bit error being undetected is 1/''n''.

===Modular sum===

A variant of the previous algorithm is to add all the &quot;words&quot; as unsigned binary numbers, discarding any overflow bits, and append the [[two's complement]] of the total as the checksum.  To validate a message, the receiver adds all the words in the same manner, including the checksum; if the result is not a word full of zeros, an error must have occurred.  This variant too detects any single-bit error, but the probability that a two-bit error will go undetected is a little less than 1/''n''.

===Position-dependent checksums===

The simple checksums described above fail to detect some common errors that affect many bits at once, such as changing the order of data words, or inserting or deleting words with all bits set to zero.  The checksum algorithms that are most used in practice, such as [[Fletcher's checksum]], [[Adler-32]], and [[cyclic redundancy check]]s (CRCs), address these weaknesses by considering not only the value of each word but also its position in the sequence. This feature generally increases the [[computational complexity|cost]] of computing the checksum.

===General considerations===

A message that is ''m'' bits long can be viewed as a corner of the ''m''-dimensional [[hypercube]].  The effect of a checksum algorithm that yields an ''n''-bit checksum is to map each ''m''-bit message to a corner of a larger hypercube, with dimension ''m''+''n''.  The 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt; corners of this hypercube represent all possible received messages.  The valid received messages (those that have the correct checksum) comprise a smaller set, with only 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; corners.  

A single-bit transmission error then corresponds to a displacement from a valid corner (the correct message and checksum) to one of the ''m'' adjacent corners.  An error that affects ''k'' bits moves the message to a corner that is ''k'' steps removed from its correct corner.  The goal of a good checksum algorithm is to spread the valid corners as far from each other as possible, so as to increase the likelihood that &quot;typical&quot; transmission errors will end up in an invalid corner.

==Checksum tools==

* &lt;tt&gt;[[bitser_software|Bitser]]&lt;/tt&gt;, a free [[Windows]] applications that calculates [[MD5]], [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-256]] sums for any given input file.

The '''City University of New York''' ('''CUNY'''; {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|juː|n|i}}) is the public [[university system]] of [[Education in New York City|New York City]], with its administrative offices in [[Yorkville, Manhattan|Yorkville]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices.html Administrative Offices].&quot; City University of New York. Retrieved on May 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest urban university in the [[United States]], consisting of 23 institutions: 11 senior colleges, six [[community colleges]], the [[William E. Macaulay Honors College]] at CUNY, the doctorate-granting [[CUNY Graduate Center|Graduate School and University Center]], the [[City University of New York School of Law]], [[CUNY Graduate School of Journalism]], and the [[Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education]]. More than 260,000 degree-credit students and 273,000 continuing and professional education students are enrolled at campuses located in all five New York City boroughs.

CUNY students hail from 205 countries. The black, white and Hispanic undergraduate populations each comprise more than a quarter of the student body, and Asian undergraduates make up more than 15 percent. Nearly 60 percent are female, and 29 percent are 25 or older. CUNY graduates include 12 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]], a U.S. Secretary of State, a Supreme Court Justice, several mayors, members of Congress, state legislators, scientists and artists.

Millions of dollars in [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|federal stimulus funds]] have been awarded to CUNY’s projects and programs, providing more opportunities for research, training and expansion. Chancellor [[Matthew Goldstein]], who recently championed higher education as critical to the nation's economic recovery efforts, said enrollment at City University of New York is at its highest level in more than three decades.

CUNY is the third-largest university system in the United States, in terms of enrollment, behind the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY), and the [[California State University]] system. CUNY and SUNY are separate and independent university systems, although both are public institutions that receive funding from New York State. CUNY, however, is additionally funded by the City of New York.

==History==
CUNY's history dates back to the formation of the Free Academy in 1847 by [[Townsend Harris]]. The school was fashioned as &quot;a Free Academy for the purpose of extending the benefits of education gratuitously to persons who have been pupils in the common schools of the city and county of New York.&quot; The [[City College of New York|Free Academy]] later became the City College of New York, the oldest institution among the CUNY colleges. [[Hunter College]]&amp;nbsp;– so-named in 1914, originally Female Normal and High School and later the Normal College&amp;nbsp;– had existed since 1870, and later expanded into the Bronx in the early 20th century with what became [[Lehman College|Hebert Lehman College]], but CCNY and Hunter resisted merging.&lt;ref name=fitzp&gt;Fitzpatrick, John.

In 1926, in response to the growth in population of the city, the New York State legislature created the '''Board of Higher Education of the City of New York''' to integrate, coordinate and expand the institutions of higher education in the city.  Through this agency, the state legislature asserted considerable control over the city's higher education. During the period the Board existed, [[John Jay College]] (1925), [[Brooklyn College]] (1930) and [[Queens College]] (1937) were created, along with a number of 2-year community colleges.&lt;ref name=fitzp /&gt;

In 1961, Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed the bill that formally created the City University of New York to integrate these institutions, and a new graduate school, together into a coordinate system of higher education for the city, and by 1979, the Board of Higher Education had become the Board of Trustees of the CUNY.&lt;ref name=fitzp /&gt; Eventually, the system grew to include seven senior colleges, four hybrid schools, six community colleges, as well as graduate schools and professional programs.

CUNY has historically served a diverse student body, especially those excluded from or unable to afford private universities. CUNY offered a high quality, tuition-free education to the poor, the working class and the immigrants of New York City until 1975, when the City's fiscal crisis forced the imposition of tuition. Many Jewish academics and intellectuals studied and taught at CUNY in the post-[[World War I]] era when [[Ivy League]] universities, such as [[Yale University]], discriminated against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Joining the Club: A History of Jews at Yale'' by Dan A. Oren (Yale University Press 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The City College of New York has had a reputation of being &quot;the [[Harvard]] of the proletariat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Leveling the Playing Field: Justice, Politics, and College Admissions'' by Robert K. Fullinwider, Judith Lichtenberg (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2004); ''City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College'' by [[James Traub]] (Perseus 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Over its history, CUNY and its colleges, especially CCNY, have been involved in various political movements. It was known as a hotbed of socialistic support in the earlier 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1367/is_199405/ai_n6388140 When the Old Left Was Young: Student Radicals and America's First Mass Student Movement, 1929–1941] (book review), ''[[The Nation]]'', May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; CUNY also lent some support to various conferences, such as the Socialist Scholars Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. notes from CUNY Chancellor Murphy to leaders of the Socialist Scholars Conference. [http://www.southerndomains.com/cstruggle/archive.html 1986 Memo from Bogdan Denitch to Joseph S. Murphy, Chancellor City University of New York in 1980s]. &quot;This memo was the opening channel for several hundred thousand dollars to be used in the Socialist Scholars Conference account. Murphy supported the SSC [''Socialist Scholars Conference''] until his tragic death in an automobile collision in Ethiopia on January 17, 1998.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

CUNY's tradition of diversity continues today, with much of its student body new immigrants to New York City, representing 172 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.cuny.edu/about/index.html About CUNY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open admissions and remedial education===
Demand in the United States for higher education rapidly grew each decade after [[World War II]] into the 1970s. The increased demand for limited college slots had the effect in New York City of increasing the competitiveness of the city's system of higher education. By the end of the 1960s, admission to CUNY's flagship City College had become highly competitive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In 1969, a group of black and Puerto Rican students occupied City College demanding the integration of CUNY, which at the time had an overwhelmingly white student body. The occupation spread to other CUNY campuses, forcing the Board of Trustees to implement a ground-breaking new admissions policy. The doors to CUNY were opened wide to all those demanding entrance, assuring all high school graduates, despite possible inadequacies of preparation, entrance to the University. This policy was known as &quot;[[open admissions]]&quot;. [[Remedial education]], to supplement the training of under-prepared students, became a significant part of CUNY's offerings.

The effect was instantaneous and dramatic. Whereas 20,000 freshmen had matriculated in one CUNY institution or another in 1969, more than 35,000 showed up for registration in the fall of 1970. Forty percent of these newcomers to the senior colleges were open-admissions students. The proportion of black and Hispanic students in the entering class nearly tripled. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Facing a fiscal crisis in 1975, the city imposed tuition on CUNY in that year. Middle-class students who had flocked to CUNY because it offered a cost-free alternative to the state university or a private college no longer had a reason to prefer it. Their enrollment at CUNY dropped precipitously and CUNY faced declines in enrollment through the 1980s and into the 1990s.

===The end of open admissions===
CUNY's prestige also declined in the 1970s and 1980s. Under a new chancellor, [[Matthew Goldstein]], and facing pressure from Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], CUNY ended its open admissions policy to the University's four-year colleges in 1999. Critics had cautioned that the policy change could lead to a drop in enrollment of minority students at CUNY's four-year institutions.

CUNY officials reported that enrollment at its senior colleges increased 10.5% from 1999 to 2002, however. Mean SAT scores of admitted freshmen also rose. CUNY reported that the number of African-American students at its senior colleges had increased in the same time period, while changes in the proportions of other ethnic groups were &quot;minimal.&quot; The University reported that two-thirds of its entering class were minority students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

CUNY students who are not directly admitted to the senior colleges because they do not meet academic admissions standards can choose to enroll in an associate degree program at one of CUNY’s community colleges, take part in &quot;immersion&quot; programs offered in the summer and winter months, find public or private tutoring, or participate in the one-semester &quot;Prelude to Success&quot; program taught by community college faculty at senior colleges. The graduates of the community college programs then earn admission to the senior colleges.

==Structure==
The City University is governed by the Board of Trustees composed of 17 members, ten of whom are appointed by the [[Governor of New York]] &quot;with the advice and consent of the senate,&quot; and five by the [[Mayor of New York City]] &quot;with the advice and consent of the senate.&quot; The final two trustees are ex-officio members. One is the chair of the university's student senate, and the other is non-voting and is the chair of the university's faculty senate. Both the mayoral and gubernatorial appointments to the CUNY Board are required to include at least one resident of each of New York City's five boroughs. Trustees serve seven-year terms, which are renewable for another seven years. College presidents report directly to the Board. The Chancellor is voted upon by the Board of Trustees, and is the &quot;chief educational and administrative officer&quot; of the City University.

Unlike some state college systems, CUNY in its early years did not operate as a central authority to the colleges. The central administration had limited power over the colleges. This is partly because most of the senior colleges (namely Brooklyn, Hunter, Queens, and City) predate CUNY and were thus established by mandate of the New York State Legislature, which has institutionalized the autonomy of the colleges. Veteran college presidents and faculty had typically viewed CUNY as a loose confederation of individual colleges rather than a unified university system. Nevertheless, in recent years and at the behest of the Governor and the Mayor, the Board of Trustees and the Chancellor have, through the power of the purse, succeeded in weakening the college presidents and faculty and consolidating executive powers to themselves.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Colleges==
{{see also|List of City University of New York units}}
CUNY consists of three different types of institutions: senior colleges, which grant bachelor's degrees and occasionally master's and associates degrees; community colleges, which grant associate's degrees; and graduate/professional schools. CUNY's Law School grants Juris Doctor (J.D.) degrees, and Ph.D. degrees are awarded only by the CUNY Graduate Center.

The colleges are listed below, with establishment dates in parentheses.

==Programs==
Programs hold an institutional level below that of a college within the CUNY system.

===CUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies===
The CUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies, also commonly known as the CUNY Baccalaureate Program or simply CUNY BA was founded in 1971. It is an individualized, University-wide degree where highly motivated, academically superior students work one-on-one with faculty mentors to design their own fields of study. The Program exists to give students an opportunity to pursue a course of study that may not exist within the current framework of CUNY. Part of the eligibility criteria includes demonstrating a desire and plan to pursue an area of concentration (like a major) that transcends the traditional college offerings. Students have created areas of concentration ranging from &quot;20th Century American Literature&quot; and &quot;Adaptive Physical Education for Vulnerable Populations,&quot; to &quot;World Politics and Social Change&quot; and &quot;Zoological Photography.&quot; Students must enroll in one of the CUNY colleges in order to participate; they then have access to courses and opportunities throughout the University. Additional admissions criteria include having completed at least 15 college credits with a 2.50 GPA or higher. The average GPA for admission is typically about 3.25, which means that a large portion of students enter with GPAs of 3.8 and higher. Given the rigorous admission process it is not surprising that CUNY BA boasts a 70% graduation rate within an average of 2.2 years and that 60% graduate with academic honors.

===William E. Macaulay Honors College===
The brainchild of CUNY chancellor Matthew Goldstein, CUNY Honors College was to be an independent institution within the university. However, support for existing honors programs at CUNY colleges and institutional opposition resulted in it being downgraded to a program. Now known as The Macaulay Honors College University Scholars Program, it graduated its first class in 2005, attracting students with a mean high school GPA of 3.5 and SAT scores of 1365 for the Class of 2009.

In July 2006 Dr. [[Ann Kirschner]] was appointed Dean of [[William E. Macaulay Honors College]] after a nationwide search. The standards of the Honors College continued to rise as well, with incoming freshmen having an average of 93.8 and SAT scores of 1381. Graduating high school students with [[Ivy League]] caliber academic records have given the Honors College a closer look as a result, and this has had a trickle-down effect in improving the image of CUNY as a whole, which prior to the inception of the HC had been criticized as 'an institution adrift' by the Giuliani administration.

As an incentive to students, University Scholars receive a free tuition, a laptop, a &quot;cultural passport&quot; that offers free or reduced-admission to various cultural institutions and venues in New York City, and a $7500 expense account that may be used for research and/or study abroad. Unlike honors programs at individual CUNY colleges, Macaulay Honors College students must be accepted into and begin the program as freshmen. They currently study at one of the participating senior CUNY colleges (Queens, Hunter, Staten Island, Lehman, Baruch, Brooklyn, and City), as well as taking part in cross-campus activities and programs. Institutional barriers that would allow cross campus enrollment in academic programs have not yet been eliminated.

In September 2006, The City University of New York received a $30,000,000 gift from philanthropist and [[City College of New York|City College]] alumnus, William E. Macaulay, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of [[First Reserve Corporation]]. It is the largest single donation in the history of CUNY and has been used to buy a landmark building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that is to become the permanent home of the Honors College, and will add support to its endowment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.cuny.edu/forum/?p=838 &quot;William E. Macaulay, City College Graduate And Chairman and CEO of First Reserve, Donates Record $30 Million To CUNY Honors College&quot;], The CUNY Newswire, Wednesday, September 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2010, pending official confirmation of the New York State Board of Education, Macaulay Honors College will cease to be a 'program' and enter the CUNY system as joint-degree granting four-year college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Degree&quot;&gt;[http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=dc3847422c9f7582958d52e0b&amp;id=f409bf1114&amp;e=50fe3c517a]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public safety==
{{main|City University of New York Public Safety Department}}
CUNY has its own police force whose duties are to protect and serve all students and faculty members, and enforce all state and city laws at all of CUNY's universities. The force currently has more than 600 officers, making it one of the largest police forces in [[New York City]].

==City University Television (CUNY TV)==
CUNY also has a cable TV service, [[CUNY TV]] (channel 75 on [[Time Warner Cable|Time Warner]]) which airs tapes of freshman level survey [[distance learning|telecourses]], old and foreign films, and panel discussions in various languages.
{{Further|[[CUNY TV]]}}

==City University Film Festival (CUFF)==
[[CUFF]] is CUNY's official [[film festival]]. The festival was founded in 2009 by Hunter College student Daniel Cowen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Computational complexity theory''' is a branch of the [[theory of computation]] in [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematics]] that focuses on classifying [[computational problems]] according to their inherent difficulty. In this context, a computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer (which basically means that the problem can be stated by a set of mathematical instructions). Informally, a computational problem consists of problem instances and solutions to these problem instances. For example, [[primality testing]] is the problem of determining whether a given number is [[prime number|prime]] or not. The instances of this problem are [[natural numbers]], and the solution to an instance is ''yes'' or ''no'' based on whether the number is prime or not.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what [[computer]]s can and cannot do.

Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[computability theory]]. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, it tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.

==Computational problems==

It is the shortest among 43,589,145,600&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Take one city, and take all possible orders of the other 14 cities. Then divide by two because it does not matter in which direction in time they come after each other: 14!/2 = 43,589,145,600.&lt;/ref&gt; possible tours visiting each city exactly once.]]

===Problem instances===

A [[computational problem]] can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of [[primality testing]]. The instance is a number and the solution is &quot;yes&quot; if the number is prime and &quot;no&quot; otherwise. Alternatively, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.

To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the [[traveling salesman problem]]: Is there a route of length at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in [[Milan]] whose total length is at most 10&amp;nbsp;km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.

===Representing problem instances===
When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a [[string (computer science)|string]] over an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are [[bitstring]]s. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, [[integer]]s can be represented in [[binary notation]], and [[graph (mathematics)|graphs]] can be encoded directly via their [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]], or by encoding their [[adjacency list]]s in binary.

Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.

[[Image:Decision Problem.png|thumb|200px|A [[decision problem]] has only two possible outputs, ''yes'' or ''no'' (or alternately 1 or 0) on any input.]]

===Decision problems as formal languages===
[[Decision problem]]s are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either ''yes'' or ''no'', or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a [[formal language]], where the members of the language are instances whose answer is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an [[algorithm]], whether a given input string is member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer ''yes'', the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.

An example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary [[graph (mathematics)|graph]]. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is [[connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs&amp;mdash;of course, to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.

===Function problems===
A [[function problem]] is a computational problem where a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]], that is, it isn't just yes or no. Notable examples include the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]].

It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the [[multiplication]] of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') such that the relation ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' holds. Deciding whether a given triple is member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.

===Measuring the size of an instance===
To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2''n'' vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with ''n'' vertices?

If the input size is ''n'', the time taken can be expressed as a function of ''n''. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(''n'') is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size ''n''. If T(''n'') is a polynomial in ''n'', then the algorithm is said to be a [[polynomial time]] algorithm. [[Cobham's thesis]] says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.

==Machine models and complexity measures==
===Turing Machine===
[[Image:Maquina.png|thumb|An artistic representation of a Turing machine]]
{{main|Turing machine}}
A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a [[RAM machine]], [[Conway's Game of Life]], [[cellular automata]] or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.

Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as [[deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s, [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[symmetric Turing machine]]s and [[alternating Turing machine]]s. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.

A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called [[randomized algorithm]]s. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see [[nondeterministic algorithm]].

===Other machine models===
Many machine models different from the standard [[Turing machine equivalents#Multi-tape Turing machines|multi-tape Turing machines]] have been proposed in the literature, for example [[random access machine]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Arora|Barak|2009|loc=Chapter 1: The computational model and why it doesn't matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; What all these models have in common is that the machines operate [[deterministic algorithm|deterministically]].

However, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The nondeterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that [[nondeterministic time]] is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.

===Complexity measures===
For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the [[deterministic Turing machine]] is used. The ''time required'' by a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' on input ''x'' is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). A Turing machine ''M'' is said to operate within time ''f''(''n''), if the time required by ''M'' on each input of length ''n'' is at most ''f''(''n''). A decision problem ''A'' can be solved in time ''f''(''n'') if there exists a Turing machine operating in time ''f''(''n'') that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time ''f''(''n'') on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by [[DTIME]](''f''(''n'')).

Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any [[complexity measure]] can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the [[Blum complexity axioms]]. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include [[communication complexity]], [[circuit complexity]], and [[decision tree complexity]].

===Best, worst and average case complexity===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|250px|Visualization of the [[quicksort]] [[algorithm]] that has [[Best, worst and average case|average case performance]] &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The [[best, worst and average case]] complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size ''n'' may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:
*Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size ''n''.
*Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size ''n''.
*Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a [[probability distribution]] over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size ''n''.

For example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm [[quicksort]]. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(''n'' log ''n''). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(''n'' log ''n'') time.

===Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems===
To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of [[analysis of algorithms]]. To show an upper bound ''T''(''n'') on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most ''T''(''n''). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase &quot;all possible algorithms&quot; includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of ''T''(''n'') for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than ''T''(''n'').

Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the [[big Oh notation]], which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40, in big Oh notation one would write ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Complexity classes==
===Defining complexity classes===
A '''complexity class''' is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:
* The type of computational problem: The most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s, [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s, [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.
* The model of computation: The most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[Boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.
* The resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds: These two properties are usually stated together, such as &quot;polynomial time&quot;, &quot;logarithmic space&quot;, &quot;constant depth&quot;, etc.

Of course, some complexity classes have complex definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:

:The set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time ''f''(''n''). (This complexity class is known as DTIME(''f''(''n'')).)

But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham-Edmonds thesis]] states that &quot;the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related&quot; {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]], which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is [[FP (complexity)|FP]].

===Important complexity classes===
[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|300px|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among complexity classes]]
Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

! Complexity class

! Model of computation

! Resource constraint
|-
| [[DTIME]](''f''(''n''))
| Deterministic Turing machine
| Time ''f''(''n'')
|-
| [[P (complexity)|P]]
| Deterministic Turing machine
| Time poly(''n'')
|-
| [[EXPTIME]]
| Deterministic Turing machine
| Time 2&lt;sup&gt;poly(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[NTIME]](''f''(''n''))
| Non-deterministic Turing machine
| Time ''f''(''n'')
|-
| [[NP (complexity)|NP]]
| Non-deterministic Turing machine
| Time poly(''n'')
|-
| [[NEXPTIME]]
| Non-deterministic Turing machine
| Time 2&lt;sup&gt;poly(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[DSPACE]](''f''(''n''))
| Deterministic Turing machine
| Space ''f''(''n'')
|-
| [[L (complexity)|L]]
| Deterministic Turing machine
| Space O(log ''n'')
|-
| [[PSPACE]]
| Deterministic Turing machine
| Space poly(''n'')
|-
| [[EXPSPACE]]
| Deterministic Turing machine
| Space 2&lt;sup&gt;poly(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[NSPACE]](''f''(''n''))
| Non-deterministic Turing machine
| Space ''f''(''n'')
|-
| [[NL (complexity)|NL]]
| Non-deterministic Turing machine
| Space O(log ''n'')
|-
| [[NPSPACE]]
| Non-deterministic Turing machine
| Space poly(''n'')
|-
| [[NEXPSPACE]]
| Non-deterministic Turing machine
| Space 2&lt;sup&gt;poly(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

It turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by [[Savitch's theorem]].

Other important complexity classes include [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]], [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]] and [[RP (complexity)|RP]], which are defined using [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s; [[AC (complexity)|AC]] and [[NC (complexity)|NC]], which are defined using Boolean circuits and [[BQP]] and [[QMA]], which are defined using quantum Turing machines. [[Sharp-P|#P]] is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like [[IP (complexity)|IP]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]] are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s. [[ALL (complexity)|ALL]] is the class of all decision problems.

===Hierarchy theorems===
{{main|time hierarchy theorem|space hierarchy theorem}}
For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(''n'') is contained in DTIME(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.

More precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{DTIME}\big(f(n) \big) \subsetneq \operatorname{DTIME} \big(f(n) \sdot \log^{2}(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{DSPACE}\big(f(n)\big) \subsetneq \operatorname{DSPACE} \big(f(n) \sdot \log(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

===Reduction===
{{main|Reduction (complexity)}}
Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.

The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.

This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems ''C'' if every problem in ''C'' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in ''C'' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in ''C''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of [[NP-hard]] problems.

If a problem ''X'' is in ''C'' and hard for ''C'', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for ''C''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in ''C''. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in ''C''.) Thus the class of [[NP-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to another problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an [[NP-complete]] problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sipser2006&quot;/&gt;

==Important open problems==
[[Image:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP. The existence of problems in NP outside both P and NP-complete in this case was established by Ladner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladner75&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Ladner|first=Richard E.|title=On the structure of polynomial time reducibility|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] (JACM)|volume=22|year=1975|pages=151&amp;ndash;171|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/330000/321877/p155-ladner.pdf?key1=321877&amp;key2=7146531911&amp;coll=&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=15151515&amp;CFTOKEN=6184618|format=PDF|doi=10.1145/321864.321877|issue=1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===P versus NP problem===
{{Main|P versus NP problem}}

The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] and the [[vertex cover problem]]. Since deterministic Turing machines are special nondeterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.

The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sipser2006&quot;&gt;See {{harvnb|Sipser|2006|loc= Chapter 7: Time complexity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of [[integer programming]] problems in [[operations research]], many problems in [[logistics]], [[protein structure prediction]] in [[biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Protein folding in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model is NP-complete|last=Berger|first=Bonnie A.|journal=Journal of Computational Biology|year=1998|volume=5|number=1|pages=p27–40|pmid=9541869|doi=10.1089/cmb.1998.5.27|last2=Leighton|first2=T|issue=1|postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ability to find formal proofs of [[pure mathematics]] theorems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|title=The P versus NP Problem|publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]]|year=2000|month=April|url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/Official_Problem_Description.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-18|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The P versus NP problem is one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]] proposed by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].

===Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete===

It was shown by Ladner that if P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladner75&quot; /&gt; Such problems are called [[NP-intermediate]] problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.

The [[graph isomorphism problem]] is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK06&quot;&gt;{{Citation

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[Laszlo Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]] has run time 2&lt;sup&gt;O(√(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''))&lt;/sup&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices.

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. September 13, 2002. http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes time O(e&lt;sup&gt;(64/9)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''.log 2)&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;(log (''n''.log 2))&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to factor an ''n''-bit integer. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

===Separations between other complexity classes===

Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance P ⊆ NP ⊆ [[PP (complexity)|PP]] ⊆ PSPACE, but it is possible that P = PSPACE. If P is not equal to NP, then P is not equal to PSPACE either. Since there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE, such as RP, BPP, PP, BQP, MA, PH, etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.

Along the same lines, [[co-NP]] is the class containing the [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] problems (i.e. problems with the ''yes''/''no'' answers reversed) of NP problems. It is believed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/ Boaz Barak's course on Computational Complexity] [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/lec2.pdf Lecture 2]&lt;/ref&gt; that NP is not equal to co-NP; however, it has not yet been proven. It has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then P is not equal to NP.

Similarly, it is not known if L (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in P or equal to P. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as NL and NC, and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.

==Intractability== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Minimax]], [[Intractability]], [[Intractable]] --&gt;
{{See also|Combinatorial explosion}}
Problems that can be solved but not fast enough for the solution to be useful are called ''intractable''.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, J.E., Motwani, R. and Ullman, J.D. (2007) [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], Addison Wesley, Boston/San Francisco/New York (page 368)&lt;/ref&gt; In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. In fact, the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]] states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are [[EXPTIME]]-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations before halting. For small ''n'', say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; operations each second, the program would run for about 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years, which is roughly the [[age of the universe]]. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.

What intractability means in practice is open to debate. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example the decision problem in [[Presburger arithmetic]] has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete [[knapsack problem]] over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and [[SAT solver]]s routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].

==Continuous complexity theory==

Continuous complexity theory can refer to complexity theory of problems that involve continuous functions that are approximated by discretizations, as studied in [[numerical analysis]]. One approach to complexity theory of numerical analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.33.4678&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Complexity Theory and Numerical Analysis], Steve Smale, Acta Numerica, 1997 - Cambridge Univ Press&lt;/ref&gt; is [[information based complexity]].

Continuous complexity theory can also refer to complexity theory of the use of [[analog computation]], which uses continuous [[dynamical system]]s and [[differential equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/arxiv:0907.3117 A Survey on Continuous Time Computations], Olivier Bournez, Manuel Campagnolo, New Computational Paradigms. Changing Conceptions of What is Computable. (Cooper, S.B. and L{\&quot;o}we, B. and Sorbi, A., Eds.). New York, Springer-Verlag, pages 383-423. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Control theory]] can be considered a form of computation and differential equations are used in the modelling of continuous-time and hybrid discrete-continuous-time systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.70.4296&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Computational Techniques for the Verification of Hybrid Systems], Claire J. Tomlin, Ian Mitchell, Alexandre M. Bayen, Meeko Oishi, Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 91, No. 7, July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible notion of computer.

{{Harvtxt|Fortnow|Homer|2003}} date the beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity to the seminal paper &quot;On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms&quot; by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns (1965), which laid out the definitions of time and space complexity and proved the hierarchy theorems.

According to {{Harvtxt|Fortnow|Homer|2003}}, earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include [[John Myhill]]'s definition of [[linear bounded automata]] (Myhill 1960), [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as [[Hisao Yamada]]'s paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1109/TEC.1962.5219459}}&lt;/ref&gt; on real-time computations (1962). Somewhat earlier, [[Boris Trakhtenbrot]] (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure.&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenbrot, B.A.: Signalizing functions and tabular operators. Uchionnye Zapiski
Penzenskogo Pedinstituta (Transactions of the Penza Pedagogoical Institute) 4, 75–87 (1956) (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; As he remembers:
{{quote|However, [my] initial interest [in automata theory] was increasingly set aside in favor of computational complexity, an exciting fusion of combinatorial methods, inherited from switching theory, with the conceptual arsenal of the theory of algorithms. These ideas had occurred to me earlier in 1955 when I coined the term &quot;signalizing function&quot;, which is nowadays commonly known as &quot;complexity measure&quot;.
|Boris Trakhtenbrot|From Logic to Theoretical Computer Science – An Update. In: ''Pillars of Computer Science'', LNCS 4800, Springer 2008.
}}
In 1967, [[Manuel Blum]] developed an axiomatic complexity theory based on his [[Blum axioms|axioms]] and proved an important result, the so called, [[Blum's speedup theorem|speed-up theorem]]. The field really began to flourish when the US researcher [[Stephen Cook]] and, working independently, [[Leonid Levin]] in the USSR, proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]]. In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, &quot;Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems&quot;, in which he showed that 21 diverse [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Richard M.

'''Camelot''' ({{IPA-en|ˈkæm.ə.lɒt|pron}}) is the most famous [[castle]] and court associated with the legendary [[King Arthur]]. Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century [[France|French]] romances and eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world. The stories locate it somewhere in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its geography being perfect for romance writers; Arthurian scholar [[Norris J. Lacy]] commented that &quot;Camelot, located no where in particular, can be anywhere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;&gt;[[Norris J. Lacy|Lacy, Norris J.]] (1991). &quot;Camelot&quot;. In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 66–67. New York: Garland. ISBN 0-8240-4377-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless arguments about the location of the &quot;real Camelot&quot; have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.

==Early appearances==
The castle is mentioned for the first time in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' poem ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'', dating to the 1170s, though it is not mentioned in all the manuscripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/cammenu.htm &quot;Camelot&quot;]. From the Camelot Project. Retrieved October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in passing, and is not described:
:''A un jor d'une Acenssion / Fu venuz de vers Carlion / Li rois Artus et tenu ot / Cort molt riche a Camaalot / Si riche com au jor estut. ''&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.perso.cegetel.net/lancelot/lancelot/lancelot01.htm Lancelot Ou Le Chevalier De La Charette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Upon a certain Ascension Day King Arthur had come from Caerleon, and had held a very magnificent court at Camelot as was fitting on such a day.&lt;ref&gt;''Lancelot'', vv. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing in Chrétien's poem suggests the level of importance Camelot would have in later romances. For Chrétien, Arthur's chief court was in [[Caerleon]] in [[Wales]]; this was the king's primary base in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and subsequent literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt; Chrétien depicts Arthur, like a typical medieval monarch, holding court at a number of cities and castles. It is not until the 13th-century French prose romances, including the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], that Camelot began to supersede Caerleon, and even then, many descriptive details applied to Camelot derive from Geoffrey's earlier grand depiction of the Welsh town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt; Most Arthurian romances of this period produced in English or Welsh did not follow this trend; Camelot was referred to infrequently, and usually in translations from French. One exception is ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', which locates Arthur's court at &quot;Camelot&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 37.&lt;/ref&gt; however, in Britain, Arthur's court was generally located at Caerleon, or at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which is usually identified with the &quot;Carduel&quot; of the French romances.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, pp. 612-3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 15th century that [[Thomas Malory]] created the image of Camelot most familiar to English speakers today in his ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', a work based mostly on the French romances. He firmly identifies Camelot with [[Winchester]], an identification that remained popular over the centuries, though it was rejected by Malory's own editor, [[William Caxton]], who preferred a Welsh location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caxton&quot;&gt;Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The name's derivation is also unknown. Some have suggested it is similar enough to other [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] place names such as [[Camulodunum]] to suggest some historicity, or at least to suggest the name was similarly derived from the Celtic god [[Camulos]]. Camulodunum specifically was the first capital of [[Roman Britain]] and would have significance in [[Romano-British culture]]. Indeed [[John Morris]], the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the [[Roman Empire]] and the history of [[Sub-Roman Britain]], suggested in his book ''The Age of Arthur'' that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name &quot;Camelot&quot; of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of [[Britannia]] ([[Camulodunum]], modern [[Colchester]]) in Roman times. If historical the first part of it, ''Cam,'' could also reflect the Celtic word meaning &quot;crooked&quot; which is commonly used in place names as seen in [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]]. Given Chrétien's known tendency to create new stories and characters, being the first to mention the hero [[Lancelot]] and his love affair with Queen [[Guinevere]] for example, the name might also be entirely invented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt;

==Description in the romances==
The romances depict the city of Camelot as standing along a river, downstream from [[Astolat]]. It is surrounded by plains and forests, and its magnificent cathedral, [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen's]], is the religious centre for Arthur's [[Knights of the Round Table]]. There Arthur and Guinevere are married and there are the tombs of many kings and knights. In a mighty castle stands the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]]; it is here that [[Galahad]] conquers the [[Siege Perilous]], and where the knights see a vision of the [[Holy Grail]] and swear to find it. Jousts are held in a meadow outside the city. In the ''[[Palamedes (romance)|Palamedes]]'' and other works, the castle is eventually destroyed by King [[Mark of Cornwall]] after the loss of Arthur at the Battle of Camlann.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt; However maddening to later scholars searching for Camelot's location, its imprecise geography serves the romances well, as Camelot becomes less a literal place than a powerful symbol of Arthur's court and universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt;

The romancers' versions of Camelot drew on earlier descriptions of Arthur's fabulous court. From Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt; Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and perhaps written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in [[Celliwig]], an uncertain locale in [[Cornwall]]. Although the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various versions of the [[Welsh Triads]] agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one in each of the areas inhabited by the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]: [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Hen Ogledd|Old North]]. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by 800 which are recorded in various place names and features such as [[Arthur's Seat]] indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across Brittonic areas of Britain as well as [[Brittany]]. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadbury&quot;&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]] (1991). &quot;Topography and Local Legends&quot;. In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 455–458. New York: Garland. ISBN 0-8240-4377-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other places are listed as a location where Arthur holds court in the later romances, Carlisle and [[London]] perhaps being the most prominent.

==Identifications==
The romancers' versions of Camelot draw on earlier traditions of Arthur's fabulous court. The Celliwig of ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' appears in the [[Welsh Triads]] as well; interestingly, this early Welsh material places Wales' greatest leader outside its national boundaries. Geoffrey's description of [[Caerleon]] is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and its impressive Roman ruins; it is less clear that Caerleon was associated with Arthur before Geoffrey. The later French romances make much of &quot;Carduel,&quot; a northern city based on the real [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].

Malory's identification of Camelot as [[Winchester]] was probably partially inspired by the latter city's history. It had been the capital of [[Wessex]] under [[Alfred the Great]], and boasted the [[Winchester Round Table]], an artifact constructed in the 13th century but widely believed to be the original by Malory's time. Malory's editor Caxton rejects the association, saying Camelot was in Wales and that its ruins could still be seen; this is a likely reference to the Roman ruins at [[Caerwent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caxton&quot;/&gt; Malory associated other Arthurian locations with modern places, for instance locating [[Astolat]] at [[Guildford]].

In 1542 [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] reported the locals around [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]] in [[Somerset]] considered it to be the original Camelot. This theory, which was repeated by later antiquaries, is bolstered, or may have derived from, Cadbury's proximity to the River Cam and towns [[Queen Camel]] and [[West Camel]], and remained popular enough to help inspire a large-scale archaeological dig in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadbury&quot;/&gt; These excavations, led by archaeologist [[Leslie Alcock]] from 1966–70, were titled &quot;Cadbury-Camelot,&quot; and won much media attention, even being mentioned in the film of the musical ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadbury&quot;/&gt; The dig revealed by far the largest known fortification of the period, with Mediterranean artifacts (representing extensive trade) and Saxon artifacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadbury&quot;/&gt; The use of the name Camelot and the support of [[Geoffrey Ashe]] helped ensure much publicity for the finds, but Alcock himself later grew embarrassed by the supposed Arthurian connection to the site. Following the arguments of [[David Dumville]], Alcock felt the site was too late and too uncertain to be a tenable Camelot. Modern archaeologists follow him in rejecting the name, calling it instead Cadbury Castle hill fort.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, Stenvenson, &amp; Musson, C. R.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Cadbury remains widely associated with Camelot. 

There were two towns in Roman Britain named [[Camulodunum]], [[Colchester]] in [[Essex]], and [[Slack, West Yorkshire|Slack]] in [[West Yorkshire]], derived from the Celtic god [[Camulos]], and this has led to the suggestion that they originated the name. However, the [[Essex]] Camulodunum was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the 5th century by [[Saxons]], so it is unlikely to have been the location of any &quot;true&quot; Camelot. The town was definitely known as Colchester as early as the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/badger/placenames.htm Place Names]&lt;/ref&gt; Even Colchester Museum argues strongly regarding the historical Arthur: &quot;It would be impossible and inconceivable to link him to the Colchester area, or to Essex more generally&quot;, pointing out that the connection between the name Camulodunum and Colchester was unknown till the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camulos.com/arthur/official.htm Official Response to linking Arthur and Colchester]&lt;/ref&gt; Other places in Britain with names related to &quot;Camel&quot; have also been suggested, such as [[Camelford]] in Cornwall, located down the [[River Camel]] from where Geoffrey places Camlann, the scene of Arthur's final battle. The area's connections with Camelot and Camlann are merely speculative. The Scottish village of [[Camelon]], near [[Falkirk]], the site of a Roman fort on the [[Antonine Wall]], is another example.

==Later uses==
In [[United States|American]] contexts, the word &quot;Camelot&quot; is sometimes used to refer admiringly to the presidency of [[John F. Kennedy]], as his term was said to have potential and promise for the future, and many were inspired by Kennedy's speeches, vision, and policies. 

At the time, Kennedy's [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] had been compared to the fall of King Arthur. The lines &quot;Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot,&quot; from the musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', were quoted by his widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]] as being from his favorite song in the score. &quot;There'll be great Presidents again,&quot; she added, &quot;but there'll never be another Camelot again … it will never be that way again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Kennedy, interview with Theodore H. White, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', Dec. 6, 1963. Coincidentally, the [http://artwork.barewalls.com/artwork/KennedyAssassinated.html?ArtworkID=250738&amp;thumbs=1&amp;productid=278738 November 23, 1963] edition of the ''London Herald'' had the subheadline: “America Mourns Camelot Dream.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Camelot has become a permanent fixture in interpretations of the Arthurian legend. Modern versions typically retain Camelot's lack of precise location and its status as a symbol of the Arthurian world, though they typically transform the castle itself into romantically lavish visions of a [[High Middle Ages]] palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacy&quot;/&gt; It lends its name to the 1960 musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]], which is based on [[T. H. White]]'s literary version of the legend, ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. The musical was adapted into a 1967 [[Camelot (film)|film of the same name]], which starred [[Richard Harris]] as Arthur, and which featured the Castle of [[Coca, Segovia]] as a fittingly opulent Camelot. The symbolism of Camelot so impressed [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] that he wrote up a prose sketch on the castle as one of his earliest attempts to treat the Arthurian legend.&lt;ref&gt;Staines, David (1991). &quot;Alfred, Lord Tennyson&quot;. In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 446–449. New York: Garland. ISBN 0-8240-4377-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers of the &quot;realist&quot; strain of modern Arthurian fiction have attempted a more sensible Camelot; inspired by Alcock's Cadbury-Camelot excavation, writers [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], [[Mary Stewart]], and Catherine Christian place their Camelots in that city and describe it accordingly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadbury&quot;/&gt;

The '''Contras''' is a label given to the various rebel groups opposing [[Nicaragua]]'s FSLN ([[Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional]]) [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] government following the July 1979 overthrow of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]'s dictatorship. Although the Contra movement included a number of separate groups, with different aims and little ideological unity, the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN) emerged as by far the largest. In 1987, virtually all Contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]].

From an early stage, the rebels received both overt and covert financial and military support from the [[United States government]] through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), initially supplemented by the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine dictatorship]] of the time. At other times the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] wished to distance itself from the Contras and withdrew all overt support.

The term &quot;Contra&quot; comes from the Spanish ''contra'', which means ''against'' but in this case is short for {{lang|es|''la contrarrevolucion''}}, in English &quot;the [[counter-revolution]]&quot;. (Many references use the uncapitalized form, &quot;contra&quot;, sometimes italicizing it.) Some rebels disliked being called Contras, feeling that it defined their cause only in negative terms, or implied a desire to restore the old order. Rebel fighters usually referred to themselves as {{lang|es|''comandos''}} (&quot;commandos&quot;); peasant sympathizers also called the rebels {{lang|es|''los primos''}} (&quot;the cousins&quot;). From the mid-1980s, as the [[Reagan administration]] and the rebels sought to portray the movement as the &quot;democratic resistance,&quot; members started describing themselves as {{lang|es|''la resistencia''}}.

During the war against the Sandinista government, they carried out many violations of [[human rights]]. Their supporters in [[Miami]] and the [[White House]] usually countered that the Sandinista government carried out more such violations, but in retrospect it is clear that they downplayed the severity of the abuses of the contras. In 1989, [[Human Rights Watch]] released a report on the situation, which stated: &quot;[The] contras were major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners.&quot; Several other human rights organizations, including
the [[Progressio (organization)|Catholic Institute for International Relations]], released similar reports, each coming to roughly the same conclusions.
&lt;!---need to state when this ended. 1987 when they &quot;united&quot; must be pretty close to the end----&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The Contras were not a monolithic group, but a combination of three distinct elements of Nicaraguan society:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Contras were not a monolithic group, but a combination of three distinct elements of Nicaraguan society:...&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ex-guardsmen of the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]] and other right wing figures who had fought for Nicaragua's ex-dictator [[Somoza]]&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; - these later were especially found in the military wing of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force|FDN]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The contras are made up of a combination of: ex-National Guardsmen (especially the military wing of the FDN),...&quot; As seen at: Gill 1984, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; After the Guard's disbandment, they formed groups such as the [[15th of September Legion]], the [[Anti-Sandinista Guerrilla Special Forces]], and the National Army of Liberation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Initially, these groups were small and conducted little active raiding into Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, Christopher. With the Contras, A Reporter in the Wilds of Nicaragua. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Anti-Somozistas who had supported the revolution but felt betrayed by the Sandinista government&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; - e.g. [[Edgar Chamorro]], prominent member of the political directorate of the FDN&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The contras are made up of a combination of: ... anti-Sandinista opponents of ex-dictator Somoza (some of the members of the FDN political directorate eg Messrs. Chamorro and Cruz)...&quot; As seen at: Gill 1984, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;, or [[Jose Francisco Cardenal]], who had briefly served in the Council of State before leaving Nicaragua out of disagreement with the Sandinista government's policies and founding the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Union|Nicaraguan Democratic Union (UDN)]], an opposition group of Nicaraguan exiles in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;International Court of Justice (IV) (1986), p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Another example are the [[MILPAS]] (Milicias Populares Anti-Sandinistas), peasant [[militia]]s led by disillusioned Sandinista veterans from the northern mountains. Founded by [[Pedro Joaquín González]] (known as &quot;Dimas&quot;), the Milpistas were also known as {{lang|es|''chilotes''}} (green corn). Even after his death, other MILPAS bands sprouted during 1980–1981. The Milpistas were composed largely of the {{lang|es|''[[campesino]]''}} highlanders and rural workers who would later form the rank and file of the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Sam |title=Comandos: The CIA and Nicaragua's Contra Rebels |origyear=1991 |publisher=Henry Holt |location=New York |isbn=9780805014754 |oclc=23974023 |pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horton |first=Lynn |title=Peasants in Arms: War and Peace in the Mountains of Nicaragua, 1979–1994 |origyear=1998 |publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies |location=Athens |isbn=9780896802049 |oclc=39157572 |pages=95–117}}

*Nicaraguans who had avoided direct involvement in the revolution but opposed the Sandinistas' increasingly anti-democratic regime.&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; For example, businessman [[José Francisco Cardenal]],who went into exile and founded the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Union]] (UDN), centered on fellow [[Nicaraguan Conservative Party]] exiles, with the [[Nicaraguan Revolutionary Armed Forces]] (FARN) as its armed wing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Main groups===

[[Image:Smoke break el serrano 1987.jpg|thumb|Members of ARDE Frente Sur taking a smoke break after routing the [[FSLN]] garrison at [[El Serrano]], southeast Nicaragua, 1987.]]

The [[CIA]] and [[Argentine intelligence]], seeking to unify the anti-Sandinista cause before initiating large-scale aid, persuaded the 15th of September Legion, the UDN and several former smaller groups to merge in August 1981 as the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (''Fuerza Democrática Nicaragüense'', FDN).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Although the FDN had its roots in two groups made up of former National Guardsmen (of the Somoza regime), its joint political directorate was led by businessman and former anti-Somoza activist [[Adolfo Calero|Adolfo Calero Portocarrero]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although Calero had opposed Somoza, the FDN had its roots in two insurgent groups made up of former National Guardsmen...&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Based in [[Honduras]], Nicaragua's northern neighbor, under the command of former [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]] Colonel [[Enrique Bermúdez]], the new FDN commenced to draw in other smaller insurgent forces in the north.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It emerged as the largest and most active contra group.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The largest and most active of these groups, which later came to be known as ... (FDN), ...&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1982, [[Edén Pastora]] (''Comandante Cero''), one of the heroes in the fight against Somoza, organized the Sandinista Revolutionary Front (FRS) - embedded in the Nicaraguan Democratic Revolutionary Alliance (ARDE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Williams| first = Adam| title = Edén Pastora: A wanted man| work = The Tico Times| accessdate = 2011-05-22| date = 2010-11-26| url = http://www.ticotimes.net/News/Top-Story/News/Eden-Pastora-A-wanted-man_Friday-November-26-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and declared war on the Sandinista government.&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a former Sandinista who had held several high posts in the government, he had resigned apruptly in 1981 and defected&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;, believing that the newly found power had corrupted the Sandinista's original ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Williams| first = Adam| title = Edén Pastora: A wanted man| work = The Tico Times| accessdate = 2011-05-22| date = 2010-11-26| url = http://www.ticotimes.net/News/Top-Story/News/Eden-Pastora-A-wanted-man_Friday-November-26-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular and charismatic leader, Pastora initially saw his group develop quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He confined himself to operate in the southern part of Nicaragua&lt;ref&gt;&quot;He insisted on operating in the southern part of Nicaragua.&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;; after a press conference he was holding on [[La Penca bombing|May 30th 1984 was bombed]], he &quot;voluntarily withdrew&quot; from the contra struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Williams| first = Adam| title = Edén Pastora: A wanted man| work = The Tico Times| accessdate = 2011-05-22| date = 2010-11-26| url = http://www.ticotimes.net/News/Top-Story/News/Eden-Pastora-A-wanted-man_Friday-November-26-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third force, Misurasata, appeared among the [[Miskito people|Miskito]], [[Sumo (people)|Sumo]] and Rama [[Amerindian]] peoples of Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, who in December 1981 found themselves in conflict with the authorities following the government's efforts to nationalize [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indian]] land. In the course of this conflict, forced removal of at least 10,000 Indians to relocation centers in the interior of the country and subsequent burning of some villages took place.&lt;ref&gt;The Americas Watch Committee. &quot;Human Rights in Nicaragua 1986&quot; (print), Americas Watch, February 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The Misurasata movement split in 1983, with the breakaway Misura group of [[Stedman Fagoth Muller]] allying itself more closely with the FDN, and the rest accomodating themselves with the Sandinista government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} A subsequent autonomy statute in September 1987 largely defused Miskito resistance.

===Unity efforts===
U.S. officials were active in attempting to unite the Contra groups. In June 1985 most of the groups reorganized as the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO), under the leadership of [[Adolfo Calero]], [[Arturo Cruz]] and [[Alfonso Robelo]], all originally supporters of the anti-Somoza revolution. After UNO's dissolution early in 1987, the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]] (RN) was organized along similar lines in May.

==U.S. military and financial assistance==
{{See also|Iran-Contra affair|Reagan Doctrine}}
[[Ronald Reagan]], who had assumed the American presidency in January 1981, accused the Sandinistas of importing Cuban-style [[socialism]] and aiding [[FMLN|leftist guerrillas]] in [[El Salvador]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} On January 4, 1982, Reagan signed the [[top secret]] National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsdd/nsdd-017.htm&lt;/ref&gt; giving the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] the authority to recruit and support the Contras with $19 million in military aid. The effort to support the Contras was one component of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], which called for providing military support to movements opposing [[Soviet Union|Soviet-supported]], [[communism|communist]] [[communist state|governments]].

By December 1981, however, the U.S. had already begun to support the armed opponents of the Sandinista regime.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;By December 1981, the United  States had begun supporting the Nicaraguan Contras, armed opponents of the Sandinista regime&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government agency in charge of this was the C.I.A.&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;, which - in its most ambitious paramilitary and political operation in nearly a decade&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In December 1982, the New York Times reported intelligence officials as saying that Washington's ‘covert activities have... become the most ambitious paramilitary and political action operation mounted by the C.I.A. in nearly a decade...‘&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; - commenced to arm, cloth, feed, and supervise the Contras.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...the CIA armed, clothed, fed and supervised the Contras.&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fiscal year 1984, the U.S. congress approved $24 million in contra aid.&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the contras failed to win widespread popular support or military victories within Nicaragua&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...the contras failed to win widespread popular support or military victories within Nicaragua...&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;, since opinion polls indicated that a majority of the U.S. public was not supportive of the contras&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...opinion polls indicated that a majority of the public was not supportive.&quot; As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;, and since the Reagan administration lost much of its support regarding its contra policy within congress after disclosure of CIA mining of Nicaraguan ports&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Following disclosure...that the CIA had a role in connection with the mining of the Nicaraguan harbors..., public critisism mounted and the Administration's Contra policy lost much of its support within Congress.&quot;  As seen at: Lee et al. 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;, congress cut off all funds for the contras in 1985 by the third [[Bolan Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al. 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The Boland Amendment had first been passed by congress in December 1982. At this time, it only outlawed U.S. assistance to the contras ''for the purpose of overthrowing the Nicaraguan government'', while allowing assistance for other purposes.&lt;ref name=clr&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riesenfeld|first=Stefan A.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987|month=January|title=The Powers of Congress and the President in International Relations: Revisited|journal=California Law Review|volume= 75|issue= 1 |pages=405|id= |doi=10.2307/3480586|accessdate=2007-11-07 |quote=The Boland Amendment was part of the Joint Resolution of December 21, 1982, providing further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1983 |jstor=3480586 |publisher=California Law Review, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1984, it was amended to forbid action by not only the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency but all U.S. government agencies.

The CIA distributed to the civilians ''[[The Freedom Fighter's Manual]]'', meant to teach them simple [[sabotage]] methods (not going to work, damaging light bulbs, putting nails on roads, and so on.) and more dangerous ones (how to make a [[molotov cocktail]]).

In 1984, Sandinista-run Nicaraguan government filed a suit in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) against the United States (''[[Nicaragua vs. United States]]''), which resulted in a 1986 judgment against the United States, calling on it to &quot;cease and to refrain&quot; from the &quot;unlawful use of force&quot; against Nicaragua, through such actions as the placement of underwater mines by CIA operatives and training, funding and support for the guerrilla forces. The court concluded that the United States was &quot;in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State&quot;, &quot;not to intervene in its affairs&quot;, &quot;not to violate its sovereignty&quot;, &quot;not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce&quot;, and &quot;in breach of its obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the Parties signed at Managua on 21 January 1956.&quot; Regarding human rights violations by the Contras, however, the court stated that the United States could be held accountable only for acts the Contras committed in connection with the United States, and therefore the &quot;Court does not have to determine whether the violations of humanitarian law attributed to the contras were in fact committed by them.&quot; The Court found that the United States &quot;has encouraged the commission by them [the Contras] of acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law; but does not find a basis for concluding that any such acts which may have been committed are imputable to the United States of America as acts of the United States of America&quot; The United States was ordered to pay reparations.&lt;ref name = &quot;icj&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The United States, which did not participate in the merits phase of the proceedings, maintained that the ICJ's power did not supersede the [[Constitution of the United States]] and argued that the court did not seriously consider the Nicaraguan role in El Salvador, whose intervention the court would not accept. The latter argument was affirmed by the primary dissenting justices—notably U.S. Judge Schwebel, who claimed that &quot;Nicaragua does not come before the Court with clean hands.&quot; [http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/icases/inus/inus_isummaries/inus_isummary_19860627.htm] Nicaragua then took its case to the UN Security Council, where a resolution supporting the ruling of the ICJ was vetoed by the United States. Nicaragua then went to the General Assembly, which passed a resolution supporting the ruling of the ICJ 94-3.

Administration officials sought to arrange funding and military supplies by means of third-parties. These efforts culminated in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1986–1987, which concerned contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to Iran. On February 3, 1988 the [[United States House of Representatives]] rejected President Reagan's request for $36.25 million to aid the Contras. According to the [[National Security Archive]], [[Oliver North]], an important official in the Iran-Contra affair, had been in contact with [[Manuel Noriega]], the military leader of [[Panama]] later convicted on drug charges, whom he personally met.

The issue of drug money and its importance in funding the Nicaraguan conflict was the subject of various reports and publications. The contras were funded by drug trafficking, of which the USA was aware.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Barry Seal]], a Medellin cartel pilot took photos which allegedly showed a high ranking Sandinista official unloading cocaine shipments at a Sandinista military airport.

The Reagan administration's support for the Contras continued to stir controversy well into the 1990s. In August 1996, ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' reporter [[Gary Webb]] published a series titled ''Dark Alliance'', alleging that the contras contributed to the rise of [[crack cocaine]] in California.

==Human rights violations==
Americas Watch - which subsequently became part of [[Human Rights Watch]] - stated that &quot;the Contras systematically engage in violent abuses... so prevalent that these may be said to be their principal means of waging war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm Nicaragua&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It accused the Contras of:
*targeting health care clinics and health care workers for assassination.
*kidnapping civilians.
*torturing civilians.
*executing civilians, including children, who were captured in combat.
*raping women.
*indiscriminately attacking civilians and civilian houses.
*seizing civilian property.
*burning civilian houses in captured towns.&lt;ref name=AW1986&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Rights in Nicaragua 1986|format=print|author=The Americas Watch Committee|publisher=Americas Watch|date=February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Progressio (organization)|Catholic Institute for International Relations]] (CIIR, now known as &quot;Progressio&quot;), a [[human rights]] organization which identifies itself with [[liberation theology]], summarized Contra operating procedures in their 1987 human rights report: &quot;The record of the contras in the field, as opposed to their official professions of democratic faith, is one of consistent and bloody abuse of human rights, of murder, torture, mutilation, rape, arson, destruction and kidnapping.&quot;&lt;ref name=CIIR&gt;{{cite news|title=Right to Survive: Human Rights in Nicaragua|format=print|author=The Catholic Institute for International Relations|publisher=The Catholic Institute for International Relations|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicaragua v. United States#Third witness: Professor Michael Glennon|A fact finding mission of 1985]] - sponsored by the [[International Human Rights Law Group]] and the [[Washington Office on Latin America]], and carried out independently of any Nicaraguan government interference or direction&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1989, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; - found that the contras with some frequency deliberately targeted Nicaraguan citizens in acts of terroristic violence.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We found that there is substantial credible evidence that the contras engaged with some frequency in acts of terroristic violence directed at Nicaraguan civilians... These are individuals who are not caught in the cross-fire between Government and contra forces, but... deliberately targeted by the contras for acts of terror.&quot; As seen at: Gill 1989, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the report speaks of &quot;a distinct pattern&quot; of attacks on purely civilian targets resulting in the killing of unarmed men, women, children, and the elderly; premeditated acts of brutality including rape, beatings, mutilation and torture; and individual and mass kidnappings of civilians for the purpose of forced recruitment into the contra forces.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Those incidents that have been investigated, however, reveal a distinct pattern, indicating that contra activities often include: attacks on purely civilian targets resulting in the killing of unarmed men, women, children, and the elderly; premeditated acts of brutality including rape, beatings, mutilation and torture; individual and mass kidnappings of civilians ... for the purpose of forced recruitment into the contra forces and the creation of a hostage refugee population in Honduras; assaults on economic and social targets ...&quot; As seen at: International Court of Justice (IV) (1986), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Chamorro]], a former Contra and member of the FDN's political directorate who later became a critic of the Contras, stated that during his time with the Contras, he frequently received reports about atrocities committed by Contra troops against civilians and against Sandinista prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As time went on, I became more and more troubled by the frequent reports I received of atrocities committed by our troops against civilians and against Sandinista prisoners.&quot; As seen at: Sklar 1988, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he &quot;went straight to our unit commanders as they returned from combat mission inside Nicaragua and asked them about their activities. I was saddened by what I was told. The atrocities I had heard about were not isolated incidents, but reflected a consistent pattern of behaviour by our troops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sklar 1988, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential report on Contra atrocities was issued by lawyer [[Reed Brody]] shortly before the 1985 U.S. Congressional vote on Contra aid. The report was soon published as a book.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Reed. ''Contra Terror in Nicaragua''.  South End Press (Boston, MA). ISBN 0896083136.&lt;/ref&gt; It charged that the Contras attacked purely civilian targets and that their tactics included murder, rape, beatings, kidnapping and disruption of harvests. Brody's report had been requested by the Sandinista government's Washington law firm [[Reichler &amp; Applebaum]] and the Sandinista government had provided facilities in Nicaragua for him.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New Republic]], January 20, 1986, with letters in ''[[The New Republic]]'', February 17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=brody-letter&gt;{{cite news|title='Contra' Terrorism Is, Unfortunately, True|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E7DA1F38F935A15757C0A963948260|accessdate=2006-10-13 | work=The New York Times | date=April 26, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brody asserted that this in no way affected his report, and added that the newspaper had confirmed the veracity of four randomly chosen incidents.

A Sandinista militiaman interviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that Contra rebels committed these atrocities against Sandinista prisoners after a battle at a Sandinista rural outpost: &quot;Rosa had her breasts cut off. Then they cut into her chest and took out her heart. The men had their arms broken, their testicles cut off. They were killed by slitting their throats and pulling the tongue out through the slit.&quot;&lt;ref name=rosa-guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=The Slaugter at the Cooperatives|format = print|author = Jonathan Steele and Tony Jenkins|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1984-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
The Sandinista government, its supporters, and outside groups such as [[Human Rights Watch|Americas Watch]] frequently accused the Contras of indiscriminate attacks on civilians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The Contras and their backers, especially those in the Reagan administration, dismissed these accusations as a propaganda campaign and accused the Sandinistas of the same [[crimes against humanity]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

US news media published several articles accusing Americas Watch and other bodies of ideological bias and unreliable reporting. It alleged that Americas Watch gave too much credence to alleged Contra abuses and systematically tried to discredit Nicaraguan human rights groups such as the [[Permanent Commission on Human Rights]], which blamed the major human rights abuses on the Sandinistas.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Republic]]'', January 20, 1986; ''[[The New Republic]]'', August 22, 1988; ''[[The National Interest]]'', Spring 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported:
:Three weeks ago, [[Human Rights Watch|Americas Watch]] issued a report on human rights abuses in Nicaragua. One member of the Permanent Commission for Human Rights commented on the Americas Watch report and its chief investigator [[Juan E. Méndez|Juan Mendez]]: &quot;The Sandinistas are laying the groundwork for a totalitarian society here and yet all Mendez wanted to hear about were abuses by the contras. How can we get people in the U.S. to see what's happening here when so many of the groups who come down are pro-Sandinista?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Asman, &quot;Despair and fear in Managua&quot;, ''[[Wall Street Journal]],'' March 25, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was part of a strategy of the Reagan Administration that largely involved stonewalling the press on matters of human rights violations: in addition to skepticism of Contra abuses, the White House insisted that the notorious [[El Mozote Massacre]] (carried out by government death squads trained at the [[School of the Americas]]) didn't happen. However, with regard to Nicaragua, their tactic was refuted by many activists on the ground, including [[Human Rights Watch]], who said the following of the White House's attempts at denial:

&quot;This hostility yielded, among other things, an inordinate amount of publicity about human rights issues. Almost invariably, U.S. pronouncements on human rights exaggerated and distorted the real human rights violations of the Sandinista regime, and exculpated those of the U.S.-supported insurgents, known as the contras.... the contras were major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners. In 1989 the number of contra abuses has been greatly reduced in comparison to the beginning of the peace process, largely because, at least through September, they were entering Nicaragua less frequently. To the extent that the contras have continued to operate, however, they have continued to commit these violations, and toward the end of 1989, abuses by the contras appeared to be on the increase. The Bush administration is responsible for these abuses, not only because the contras are, for all practical purposes, a U.S. force, but also because the Bush administration has continued to minimize and deny these violations, and has refused to investigate them seriously. As in the Reagan years, the Bush State Department has continued to make too much of monitoring mechanisms within the contra movement that have been wholly unsuccessful in prosecuting those responsible for abuses.&quot;

==Catholic Church's view==
During the Sandinista rule, the movement of [[liberation theology]] had a powerful foothold in Nicaragua,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...especially in Nicaragua, where it gained a powerful foothold during the 1980s rule of the Marxist Sandinista Front and the war against U.S.-backed contra guerrillas.&quot; As seen at: {{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/theo/echo.htm|title=Rethinking option for poor|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 85% of Nicaraguans claimed to belong to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&quot;We feel that any form of assistance, regardless of the source, which causes the destruction, suffering, and death of our families, or which sows hatred and discord among the Nicaraguan people is reprehensible.

After a cutoff in US military support and with both sides facing international pressure to bring an end to the conflict the Contras agreed to negotiations with the FSLN. This peace allowed the Nicaraguan elections of February 1990 in which [[Violeta Chamorro]] and her party the [[UNO]] won an upset victory 55% to 41% over Daniel Ortega with Chamorro winning nearly 68% of the rural vote. This in spite of the fact that the estimated 500,000 refugees created by the war living outside Nicaragua were not allowed to cast absentee ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''John Craig Venter''' (born October 14, 1946) is an American [[biologist]] and [[entrepreneur]], most famous for his role in being one of the first to sequence the [[human genome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |title = The Blueprint Of Life |first = Jamie|last= Shreeve |accessdate = December 6, 2007|date=October 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for his role in creating the first cell with a synthetic genome in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2010/0521/J.-Craig-Venter-Institute-creates-first-synthetic-life-form |title =J.

Craig Venter Institute]], now working at the latter to create synthetic biological organisms and to document [[genetic diversity]] in the world's oceans. He was listed on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's 2007 and 2008 [[Time 100]] list of the most influential people in the world. In 2010, the British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' listed Craig Venter at 14th in the list of &quot;The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;htanna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=14.

==Early life==
Venter was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. In his youth, he did not take his education seriously, preferring to spend his time on the water in boats or surfing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} According to his biography, ''A Life Decoded'', he was said to never be a terribly engaged student, having Cs and Ds on his eighth-grade report cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Venter, J. Craig  | date=2007-11-19 | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqRJL7PveWs#t=1m40s | title=Authors@Google: J. Craig Venter | location=United States | time=1:40-2:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Time Magazine]]'', it was not always evident that Venter would become a transformative figure, particularly when he was a boy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Although he was against the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Life Decoded

Craig Venter|isbn=9780670063581 |oclc=165048736| publisher=Viking| unused_data=publisher-Viking }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter was drafted and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] where he worked in the intensive-care ward of a field hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Breakthrough Awards 2010: Pioneering New Life | journal = Popular Mechanics | date = 2010-11 | first = Logan | last = Ward | volume = 187 | issue = 11 | pages = 62–5| id = | format = Print | accessdate = 2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Vietnam, he attempted to commit suicide by swimming out to sea, but changed his mind more than a mile out.&lt;ref name=&quot;God of Small Things&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |magazine=Atlantic Magazine |date=January/February 2007

|author=Ross Douthat | title=The God of Small Things| accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Being confronted with wounded, maimed, and dying soldiers on a daily basis instilled in him a desire to study medicine&lt;ref&gt;'Artificial life' breakthrough announced by scientists, BBC, 21 May 2010. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10138849.stm&lt;/ref&gt; — although he later switched to biomedical research.

==Education==
Venter graduated from [[Mills High School]] and began his college career at a [[community college]], [[College of San Mateo]] in [[California]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[biochemistry]] in 1972, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[physiology]] and [[pharmacology]] in 1975, both from the [[University of California, San Diego]]. At UCSD, he studied under biochemist [[Nathan O. Kaplan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/sept-oct97/sw_sep-oct97_page3.htm |title=Craig Venter Takes Aim at the Big Questions |journal=[[ScienceWatch]] |date=September/October 1997 |volume=8 |issue=5 |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married former Ph.D. candidate Barbara Rae.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae-venterlaw.com/who.htm Rae-Venter Law Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;abfamb&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/the-god-of-small-things/2007/01/25/1169594430068.html?page=fullpage |title=The god of small things |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.famouswhy.com/craig_venter/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nndb.com/people/832/000163343/&lt;/ref&gt; After working as an associate professor, and later as full professor, at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]], he joined the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1984. In Buffalo, he divorced Dr. Rae-Venter and married his student, [[Claire M. Fraser]],&lt;ref name = &quot;abfamb&quot;/&gt; remaining married to her until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wadman |first=Meredith |date=May 2007 |title=High-profile departure ends genome institute's charmed run |journal=[[Nature Medicine]] |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=518 |doi=10.1038/nm1594 |pmid=17479082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
While at the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], Venter learned of a technique for rapidly identifying all of the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]s present in a cell and began to use it to identify human brain genes. The short [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] sequence fragments discovered by this method are called [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs) a name coined by [[Anthony Kerlavage]] at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]]. The NIH initially led an effort to patent these gene fragments, in which Venter coincidentally and controversially became involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Leslie | date = October 11, 1991 | title = Genome patent fight erupts: an NIH plan to patent thousands of random DNA sequences will discourage industrial investment and undercut the Genome Project itself, the plan's critics charge | journal = [[Science (magazine)|Science]] | volume = 254 | issue = 5029 | pages = 184–186 | doi = 10.1126/science.1925568}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Syn|date=October 2009|reason=There's nothing at all &quot;coincidental&quot; here...}} The NIH later withdrew the patent applications, following public outcry. Subsequent court cases declared that ESTs were not directly patentable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2006 | journal = [[Harvard Law Review]] | volume = 119 | title = Patent Law—Utility—Federal Circuit holds that expressed sequence tags lack substantial and specific utility unless underlying gene function is identified.—''In re Fisher'', 421 F.3d 1365 (Fed.

===Human Genome Project===
Venter was passionate about the power of genomics to radically transform healthcare. Venter believed that [[shotgun sequencing]] was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data.&lt;ref name=Weber1997&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weber | first1 = James L.  | last2 = Myers | first2 = Eugene W.  | year = 1997 | journal = [[Genome Research]] | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | title = Human Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequencing | pages = 401–409 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7.5.401  | url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/7/5/401.full  | doi_brokendate = 2010-05-20 | pmid=9149936
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method was controversial, however, since some geneticists felt it would not be accurate enough for a genome as complicated as that of humans.&lt;ref name=Green1997&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Green | first =  Philip | year = 1997 | journal = Genome Research | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | title = Against a Whole-Genome Shotgun | pages = 410–417 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7.5.410 | url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/7/5/410.full  | pmid = 9149937  | doi_brokendate = 2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2009|reason=One scientist's opinion is not *most* scientists.}} Frustrated with what Venter viewed as the slow pace of progress in the Human Genome project, and unable to get funds for his ideas, he sought funding from the private sector to fund [[Celera Genomics]].&lt;ref&gt;See Victor McElheny, ''Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project'', New York, Basic Books, 2010. ISBN 978-0-465-04333-0&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the company was to sequence the entire human genome and release it into the public domain for non-commercial use in much less time and for much less cost than the public human genome project. The company planned to monetize their work by creating a value-added database of genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee. The goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence. [[DNA]] from five demographically different individuals was used by Celera to generate the sequence of the human genome; one of the individuals was Venter himself. In 2000, Venter and [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] and U.S. Public Genome Project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000, a full three years ahead of the expected end of the Public Genome Program. The announcement was made along with [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueprint&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Shreeve |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |title=The Blueprint of Life |newspaper=[[U.S. News and World Report]] |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter and Collins thus shared an award for &quot;Biography of the Year&quot; from [[A&amp;E Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;montgomery&quot;&gt;&quot;{{cite press release |url=http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mc/news/press/00-463.html |title=Time Magazine Dubs Montgomery County &quot;DNA Alley&quot; |publisher=[[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County, Maryland Government]]|date=December 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Celera published the first Human Genome in the journal Science, and was soon followed by a Human Genome Project Publication in Nature.&lt;ref name=Venter2001&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Venter | first1 = J.

Although Celera was originally set to sequence a composite of DNA samples, partway through the sequencing, Venter switched the samples for his own DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;dna switch&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Singer |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/19328/?a=f |title=Technology Review |newspaper=[[Technology review]] |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After contributing to the Human Genome, and its release into the public domain, Venter was fired by Celera in early 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Antonio |last=Regalo |title=Maverick biologist at work on next goal: creating life |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |date=July 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his biography, Venter was ready to leave Celera, and was fired due to conflict with the main investor, Tony White, that had existed since day one of the project. Venter writes that his main goal was always to accelerate science and thereby discovery, and he only sought help from the corporate world when he couldn't find funding in the public sector.

===Ocean sampling===
The [[Global Ocean Sampling Expedition]] (GOS) is an [[ocean exploration]] [[genome project]] with the goal of assessing the [[genetic diversity]] in [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[microbial communities]] and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes. Begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003,Craig Venter announced the full Expedition on 4 March 2004. The project, which used Craig Venter's personal yacht, ''Sorcerer II'', started in Halifax,Canada, circumnavigated the globe and returned to the U.S. in January 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;for sale&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Yacht for Sale: Suited for Sailing, Surfing, and Seaborne Metagenomics |work=GenomeWeb.com |publisher=GenomeWeb News|author=Larkman, Kirell |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=September 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current work===
Venter is currently the president of the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], which conducts research in [[synthetic biology]]. In June 2005, he co-founded [[Synthetic Genomics]], a firm dedicated to using modified [[microorganisms]] to produce clean fuels and biochemicals. In July 2009, [[ExxonMobil]] announced a $600 million collaboration with Synthetic Genomics to research and develop next-generation [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;exxon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/14/14greenwire-exxon-sinks-600m-into-algae-based-biofuels-in-33562.html |title=Exxon Sinks $600M Into Algae-Based Biofuels in Major Strategy Shift|work=NYTimes.com|publisher=New York Times|date=July 14, 2009 | first=Katie | last=Howell}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Venter is a member of the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors retrieved 2010-07-05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
{{Cleanup-reorganize|section|date=October 2009}}
{{In popular culture|date=October 2009}}
Venter has been the subject of articles in several magazines, including ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;Shreeve, James. &quot;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.08/venter.html Craig Venter's Epic Voyage to Redefine the Origin of the Species],&quot; ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'', August 2004.

Venter appeared in the &quot;Evolution&quot; episode of the documentary television series ''[[Understanding (TV series)|Understanding]]''.

On May 16, 2004, Venter gave the commencement speech at [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bu&quot;&gt;Warren, Jessica.

Accessed August 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 interview with ''[[New Scientist]]'' when asked &quot;Assuming you can make [[Synthetic life|synthetic bacteria]], what will you do with them?&quot;, Venter replied:

{{bquote|Over the next 20 years, synthetic genomics is going to become the standard for making anything. The chemical industry will depend on it. Hopefully, a large part of the energy industry will depend on it. We really need to find an alternative to taking carbon out of the ground, burning it, and putting it into the atmosphere. That is the single biggest contribution I could make.}}

Furthermore it suggests that one of the main purposes for creating synthetic bacteria would be to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels through [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|year=2007|title=Interview: DNA's messengers |journal=[[New Scientist]]|issue=2626|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2007, Venter was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Arizona State University]].,&lt;ref name=&quot;asu&quot;&gt;Aufrett, Sarah.

Number three in 2008's Top 10 Scientific Discoveries was a piece outlining his work stitching together the 582,000 base pairs necessary to invent the genetic information for a whole new bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1863947,00.html | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2008 | date=November 3, 2008 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Venter took part in the inaugural [http://mysdscience.com/ San Diego Science Festival] and spoke at its press conference on February 26, 2009.

On April 6, 2009, Venter gave a speech at [[Arizona State University]] as part of the Origins Symposium.

For an episode aired on July 27, 2009, Venter was interviewed on his boat by BBC One for the first episode of TV show [[Bang Goes the Theory]].

On May 8, 2010, Venter received an honorary doctor of science degree from [[Clarkson University]] for his work on the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarkson.edu/news/view.php?id=2455&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2010, Venter announced the creation of first self-replicating semi-synthetic bacterial cell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/craig_venter_unveils_synthetic_life.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 2010 [[Steve Kroft]] profiled J. Craig Venter and his research on [[60 minutes]].

On April 21, 2011, Venter received the 2011 Benjamin Rush Medal from [[William &amp; Mary School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch-Donahue|first=Jaime|title=Benjamin Rush Scholars to Honor Dr. J.

==Individual human genome sequenced==
On September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published the first complete (six-billion-letter) [[genome]] of an individual human&amp;mdash;Venter's own DNA sequence.&lt;ref name=PloS_VG&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2007|volume=5|issue=10|title=The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human|author=Levy S, Sutton G, Ng PC, Feuk L, Halpern AL, et al. |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254|pages=e254|pmid=17803354|pmc=1964779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sequences in Venter's genome are associated with wet earwax,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=117800 Omim - Ear Wax, Wet/Dry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; increased risk of antisocial behavior, Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Life Decoded|author=Venter, J.C.|isbn=978-0-670-06358-1|year=2007|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was especially interesting since it contained a [[diploid]] instead of a [[haploid]] genome and shows promise for [[personalized medicine]] via [[genotyping]].{{Or|date=October 2009}} This genome, rather immodestly dubbed HuRef by Levy and others., was a landmark accomplishment and as of mid-2010 is probably the highest quality personal genome sequence yet completed.

The [[Human Reference Genome Browser]] is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter's recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using [[microfluidic Sanger sequencing]], assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million [[Mutation|DNA variation]]s identified by genome analysis. These variants include [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), block [[point mutation|substitutions]], short and large [[indel]]s, and structural variations like [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]], inversions{{Clarify|date=October 2009|reason=is this a [[chromosome inversion]], or something I've never heard of? Wikilink it.}} and [[copy number variation|copy number changes]].

The browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] and [[Ensembl]] annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the [[haplotype]] blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to [[gene annotation]]s. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including [[dbSNP]], Ensembl, [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] (OMIM) and [[Gene Ontology]] (GO).

Users can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef [[contig]] or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.

==''Mycoplasma laboratorium''==
Venter is seeking to patent the first life form created by humanity, possibly to be named ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05180/530330.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Biologist Venter aims to create life from scratch | first=Antonio | last=Regalado | date=June 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that this line of research could lead to producing bacteria that have been engineered to perform specific reactions, for example, produce fuels, make medicines, combat global warming, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553919/Man-made-microbe-to-create-endless-biofuel.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Man-made microbe 'to create endless biofuel' | first=Roger | last=Highfield | date=June 8, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, a team of scientists led by Venter became the first to successfully create what was described as &quot;[[synthetic life]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1190719 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1190719 |publisher=[[Science (journal)]] |pmid=20488990 |year=2010 |pages=52–6 |last1=Gibson |first1=DG |last2=Glass |issue=5987 |first2=JI |last3=Lartigue |first3=C |last4=Noskov |first4=VN |volume=329 |last5=Chuang |first5=RY |last6=Algire |first6=MA |last7=Benders |first7=GA |last8=Montague |first8=MG |last9=Ma |first9=L |title=Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome |journal=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/05/scientists-create-first-self-replicating-synthetic-life/ |title = Scientists Create First Self-Replicating Synthetic Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done by synthesizing a very long DNA molecule containing an entire bacterium [[genome]], and introducing this into another cell, analogous to the accomplishment of [[Eckard Wimmer]]'s group, who synthesized and ligated an [[RNA virus]] genome and &quot;booted&quot; it in cell lysate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20010599  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | doi=10.1038/nbt.1593 | volume=27 | issue=12 | year=2009 | month=December | pages=1163–72 | pmc=2819212 | title = Synthetic viruses: a new opportunity to understand and prevent viral disease | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = Eckard | last2 = Mueller | first2 = Steffen | last3 = Tumpey | first3 = Terrence M | last4 = Taubenberger | first4 = Jeffery K | journal = Nature Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single-celled organism contains four &quot;watermarks&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcfn.com/2010/06/using-arc-to-decode-venters-secret-dna.html Using Arc to decode Venter's secret DNA watermark by Ken Shirriff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected bibliography==
Venter is an [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]] [[ISI highly cited researcher|highly cited researcher]] and has authored over 200 publications in [[scientific journal]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HighlyCited&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Venter, J. Craig |work=[[ISIHighlyCited.com]] |url=http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&amp;link1=Browse&amp;link2=Results&amp;id=770 |format=restricted access |date=August 19, 2003 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--LIST CRITERIA--&gt;
&lt;!-- For inclusion on this list, a publication must meet ALL of the following criteria (see exceptions below):
(1) Include Venter as a ''primary'' author. He will invariably be listed first or last. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CRITERION.
(2) Be cited in a peer-reviewed scientific journal with an [[impact factor]] of at least 10.
(3) It must have at least an average of 100 citations PER YEAR. If you are using ISIknowledge, just click on the number of times cited, then click on &quot;analyze results&quot;, and rank by publication year. To calculate this manually, take the number of citations the article has (try using ISIknowledge.com) and divide it by the number of years since it was published. This rule is more flexible for articles published in the 20th century, as most can reasonably be expected not to be cited often anymore.

Exceptions to criteria 3 are:
(1) his autobiography
(2) an article that is a BIG DEAL but is too recent to have been so highly cited (for example, &quot;Environmental genome shotgun sequencing of the Sargasso Sea&quot; was a huge deal, but was only cited 60 times in 2004, a very low number for a Venter article)
(3) a review, editorial, etc., that is often cited and that provides a broad overview OF HIS OWN WORKS.

The criteria may seem incredibly high, but they account for the fact that Venter's articles are hugely cited and WP is not a directory.
--&gt;
&lt;!--NOTE: the use of the ellipsis is prescribed by the [[APA]] when a work has more than 7 authors and a later one needs mentioning. For the purposes of this section (and with a modification so that it matches the output of citation templates), the first 7 authors are listed, followed by the spaced ellipsis, followed by the author (Venter), and, if necessary, followed by ''et al''.--&gt;

}}
'''''Carl Ransom Rogers''''' (January 8, 1902 – February 4, 1987) was an influential American [[psychologist]] and among the founders of the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic approach]] to [[psychology]]. Rogers is widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of psychotherapy research and was honored for his pioneering research with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1956.

The person-centered approach, his own unique approach to understanding personality and human relationships, found wide application in various domains such as psychotherapy and counseling ([[Person-centered psychotherapy|client-centered therapy]]), [[education]] ([[student-centered learning]]), organizations, and other group settings. For his professional work he was bestowed the Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Psychology by the APA in 1972. Towards the end of his life Carl Rogers was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work with national intergroup conflict in South Africa and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;On January 28, 1987 Carl Rogers was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by congressman [[Jim Bates (politician)|Jim Bates]].  http://www.nrogers.com/carlrogersevents.html&lt;/ref&gt;   In an empirical study by Haggbloom et al. (2002) using six criteria such as citations and recognition, Rogers was found to be the sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century and second, among clinicians, only to [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Haggbloom, S.J. et al. (2002). The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century. ''Review of General Psychology''. Vol. 6, No. 2, 139–15. Haggbloom et al. combined 3 quantitative variables: citations in professional journals, citations in textbooks, and nominations in a survey given to members of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], with 3 qualitative variables (converted to quantitative scores): [[National Academy of Science]] (NAS) membership, [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) President and/or recipient of the APA Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and surname used as an eponym. Then the list was rank ordered.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rogers was born on January 8, 1902, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a Chicago suburb. His father Walter A. Rogers was a [[civil engineer]] and his mother, Julia M. Cushing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cushing&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cushing|first=James Stevenson|title=The genealogy of the Cushing family, an account of the ancestors and descendants of [[Matthew Cushing]], who came to America in 1638|publisher=The Perrault printing co.|location=Montreal|year=1905|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/06032460 |page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CalDeath&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=CAdeath1940|title=California Death Index, 1940-1997|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=19 April 2010 |postscript=.

Rogers was quite smart and could read well before kindergarten.  Following an education in a strict religious [[vicarage]] of [[Jimpley]] and ethical environment as an [[altar boy]], he became a rather isolated, independent and disciplined person, and acquired a knowledge and an appreciation for the [[scientific method]] in a practical world. His first career choice was [[agriculture]], at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], followed by history and then [[religion]].  At age 20, following his 1922 trip to [[Peking]], [[Republic of China|China]], for an international Christian conference, he started to doubt his religious convictions.  To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled ''Why am I entering the Ministry?'', after which he decided to change his career.

After two years he left the [[seminary]] to attend [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], obtaining an MA in 1928 and a PhD in 1931.  While completing his doctoral work, he engaged in child study. In 1930, Rogers served as director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Rochester, New York. From 1935 to 1940 he lectured at the [[University of Rochester]] and wrote ''The Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child'' (1939), based on his experience in working with troubled children. He was strongly influenced in constructing his client-centered approach by the post-Freudian psychotherapeutic practice of [[Otto Rank]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Robert. &quot;The Birth of Client-Centered Therapy : Carl Rogers, Otto Rank, and 'The Beyond'&quot;. ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'', 35.4 (1995) p. 54-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 Rogers became professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State University, where he wrote his second book, ''Counseling and Psychotherapy'' (1942).  In it, Rogers suggested that the client, by establishing a relationship with an understanding, accepting therapist, can resolve difficulties and gain the insight necessary to restructure their life. 

In 1945, he was invited to set up a counseling center at the [[University of Chicago]]. While a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago (1945–57), Rogers helped to establish a counseling centre connected with the university and there conducted studies to determine the effectiveness of his methods. His findings and theories appeared in ''Client-Centered Therapy'' (1951) and ''Psychotherapy and Personality Change'' (1954). One of his graduate students at the University of Chicago, [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], established the [[Parent Effectiveness Training|Parent Effectiveness Training (P.E.T.)]] movement. In 1956, Rogers became the first President of the American Academy of Psychotherapists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapweb.com/history.html American Academy of Psychotherapists History of the Academy&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957–63), during which time he wrote one of his best-known books, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961). He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers continued teaching at University of Wisconsin until 1963, he became a resident at the new Center for Studies of the Person in [[La Jolla]].   Rogers left the WBSI to help found the Center for Studies of the Person in 1968.  His later books include ''Carl Rogers on Personal Power'' (1977) and ''Freedom to Learn for the 80's'' (1983). He remained a resident of La Jolla for the rest of his life, doing therapy, giving speeches and writing until his sudden death in 1987. In 1987, Rogers suffered a fall that resulted in a fractured [[pelvis]].  He had a successful operation, but his pancreas failed the next night and he died a few days later.

Rogers' last years were devoted to applying his theories in situations of political oppression and national social conflict, and he traveled worldwide to accomplish this.  In [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], he brought together influential Protestants and Catholics; in South Africa, blacks and whites; in Brazil people emerging from dictatorship to democracy in the United States, consumers and providers in the health field. His last trip, at age 85, was to the Soviet Union, where he lectured and facilitated intensive experiential workshops fostering communication and creativity.  He was astonished at the numbers of Russians who knew of his work.

Together with his daughter, Natalie Rogers, and psychologists Maria Bowen, Maureen O'Hara,and John K. Wood, between 1974 and 1984, Rogers convened a series of residential programs in the US, Europe, Brazil and Japan, the Person-Centered Approach Workshops, which focused on cross-cultural communications, personal growth, self-empowerment, and learning for social change. Rogers was nominated for the Nobel Peace prize for his work though the nomination arrived just days after his death.

==Theory==
{{Psychology sidebar}}
Rogers' theory of the self is considered to be [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] and [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Pescitelli, [http://pandc.ca/?cat=carl_rogers&amp;page=rogerian_theory ''An Analysis of Carl Rogers' Theory of Personality'']&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is based directly on the &quot;[[phenomenal field theory|phenomenal field]]&quot; personality theory of Combs and Snygg (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Snygg, Donald and Combs, Arthur W. (1949), ''Individual Behavior: A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html Article on Snygg and Combs' &quot;Phenomenal Field&quot; Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers' elaboration of his own theory is extensive. He wrote 16 books and many more journal articles describing it. However, Prochaska and Norcross(2003) states Rogers &quot;consistently stood for an empirical evaluation of psychotherapy. He and his followers have demonstrated a humanistic approach to conducting therapy and a scientific approach to evaluating therapy need not be incompatible.&quot;

===Nineteen propositions===
His theory (as of 1951) was based on 19 propositions:&lt;ref name=&quot;r51&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Client-centered therapy: Its current practice, implications and theory.|first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1951 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84119-840-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#All individuals (organisms) exist in a continually changing world of experience (phenomenal field) of which they are the center.
#The organism reacts to the field as it is experienced and perceived. This perceptual field is &quot;reality&quot; for the individual.
#The organism reacts as an organized whole to this phenomenal field.
#A portion of the total perceptual field gradually becomes differentiated as the self.
#As a result of interaction with the environment, and particularly as a result of evaluational interaction with others, the structure of the self is formed - an organized, fluid but consistent conceptual pattern of perceptions of characteristics and relationships of the &quot;I&quot; or the &quot;me&quot;, together with values attached to these concepts.
#The organism has one basic tendency and striving - to actualize, maintain and enhance the experiencing organism.
#The best vantage point for understanding behavior is from the internal frame of reference of the individual.
#Behavior is basically the goal-directed attempt of the organism to satisfy its needs as experienced, in the field as perceived.
#Emotion accompanies, and in general facilitates, such goal directed behavior, the kind of emotion being related to the perceived significance of the behavior for the maintenance and enhancement of the organism.
#Values experienced directly by the organism, and in some instances are values introjected or taken over from others, but perceived in distorted fashion, as if they had been experienced directly.
#As experiences occur in the life of the individual, they are either, a) symbolized, perceived and organized into some relation to the self, b) ignored because there is no perceived relationship to the self structure, c) denied symbolization or given distorted symbolization because the experience is inconsistent with the structure of the self.
#Most of the ways of behaving that are adopted by the organism are those that are consistent with the concept of self.
#In some instances, behavior may be brought about by organic experiences and needs which have not been symbolized. Such behavior may be inconsistent with the structure of the self but in such instances the behavior is not &quot;owned&quot; by the individual.
#Psychological adjustment exists when the concept of the self is such that all the sensory and visceral experiences of the organism are, or may be, assimilated on a symbolic level into a consistent relationship with the concept of self.
#Psychological maladjustment exists when the organism denies awareness of significant sensory and visceral experiences, which consequently are not symbolized and organized into the gestalt of the self structure. When this situation exists, there is a basic or potential psychological tension.
#Any experience which is inconsistent with the organization of the structure of the self may be perceived as a threat, and the more of these perceptions there are, the more rigidly the self structure is organized to maintain itself.
#Under certain conditions, involving primarily complete absence of threat to the self structure, experiences which are inconsistent with it may be perceived and examined, and the structure of self revised to assimilate and include such experiences.
#When the individual perceives and accepts into one consistent and integrated system all his sensory and visceral experiences, then he is necessarily more understanding of others and is more accepting of others as separate individuals.
#As the individual perceives and accepts into his self structure more of his organic experiences, he finds that he is replacing his present value system - based extensively on introjections which have been distortedly symbolized - with a continuing organismic valuing process.

Additionally, Rogers is known for practicing &quot;unconditional positive regard,&quot; which is defined as accepting a person &quot;without negative judgment of .... [a person's] basic worth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P. (2002). Mental Health and Mental Illness. (7th ed.) New York: Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the personality===
With regard to development, he described principles rather than stages. The main issue is the development of a self concept and the progress from an undifferentiated self to being fully differentiated. 

{{quote|'''Self Concept''' ''... the organized consistent conceptual gestalt composed of perceptions of the characteristics of 'I' or 'me' and the perceptions of the relationships of the 'I' or 'me' to others and to various aspects of life, together with the values attached to these perceptions. It is a gestalt which is available to awareness though not necessarily in awareness. It is a fluid and changing gestalt, a process, but at any given moment it is a specific entity.'' (Rogers, 1959)&lt;ref name=&quot;r59&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Carl.|editor=(Ed.) S. Koch|title= Psychology: A study of a science. Vol. 3: Formulations of the person and the social context.|year=1959|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn= |pages= |chapter=A theory of therapy, personality and interpersonal relationships as developed in the client-centered framework.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the development of the self concept, he saw conditional and unconditional positive regard as key. Those raised in an environment of unconditional positive regard have the opportunity to fully actualize themselves. Those raised in an environment of conditional positive regard feel worthy only if they match conditions (what Rogers describes as ''conditions of worth'') that have been laid down for them by others.

===The fully functioning person===
Optimal development, as referred to in proposition 14, results in a certain process rather than static state. He describes this as ''the good life'', where the organism continually aims to fulfill its full potential. He listed the characteristics of a fully functioning person (Rogers 1961):&lt;ref name=&quot;r61&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=On becoming a person: A therapist's view of psychotherapy |first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1961 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84529-057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A growing openness to experience – they move away from defensiveness and have no need for subception (a perceptual defense that involves unconsciously applying strategies to prevent a troubling stimulus from entering consciousness).
#An increasingly existential lifestyle – living each moment fully – not distorting the moment to fit personality or self concept but allowing personality and self concept to emanate from the experience. This results in excitement, daring, adaptability, tolerance, spontaneity, and a lack of rigidity and suggests a foundation of trust. &quot;To open one's spirit to what is going on now, and discover in that present process whatever structure it appears to have&quot; (Rogers 1961)&lt;ref name=&quot;r61&quot;/&gt;
#Increasing organismic trust – they trust their own judgment and their ability to choose behavior that is appropriate for each moment. They do not rely on existing codes and social norms but trust that as they are open to experiences they will be able to trust their own sense of right and wrong.
#Freedom of choice – not being shackled by the restrictions that influence an incongruent individual, they are able to make a wider range of choices more fluently. They believe that they play a role in determining their own behavior and so feel responsible for their own behavior.
#Creativity – it follows that they will feel more free to be creative. They will also be more creative in the way they adapt to their own circumstances without feeling a need to conform.
#Reliability and constructiveness – they can be trusted to act constructively. An individual who is open to all their needs will be able to maintain a balance between them. Even aggressive needs will be matched and balanced by intrinsic goodness in congruent individuals.
#A rich full life – he describes the life of the fully functioning individual as rich, full and exciting and suggests that they experience joy and pain, love and heartbreak, fear and courage more intensely. Rogers' description of ''the good life'':{{quote|''This process of the good life is not, I am convinced, a life for the faint-hearted. It involves the stretching and growing of becoming more and more of one's potentialities. It involves the courage to be. It means launching oneself fully into the stream of life.'' (Rogers 1961)&lt;ref name=&quot;r61&quot;/&gt;}}

===Incongruity===
Rogers identified the &quot;[[real self]]&quot; as the aspect of one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard. It is the &quot;you&quot; that, if all goes well, you will become. On the other hand, to the extent that our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an &quot;ideal self&quot;.  By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the &quot;I am&quot; and the &quot;I should&quot; is called ''incongruity''.

===Psychopathology===
Rogers described the concepts of ''congruence'' and ''incongruence'' as important ideas in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for ''positive regard''. In a fully congruent person realizing their potential is not at the expense of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forego their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others. They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on the inside. 

Rogers suggested that the incongruent individual, who is always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self concept. Because their lives are not authentic this is a difficult task and they are under constant threat. They deploy ''defense mechanisms'' to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: ''distortion'' and ''denial''. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self concept.

This defensive behavior reduces the consciousness of the threat but not the threat itself. And so, as the threats mount, the work of protecting the self concept becomes more difficult and the individual becomes more defensive and rigid in their self structure. If the incongruence is immoderate this process may lead the individual to a state that would typically be described as neurotic.  Their functioning becomes precarious and psychologically vulnerable. If the situation worsens it is possible that the defenses cease to function altogether and the individual becomes aware of the incongruence of their situation. Their personality becomes disorganised and bizarre; irrational behavior, associated with earlier denied aspects of self, may erupt uncontrollably.

==Applications==
{{main|Person-centered psychotherapy|Student-centered learning}}
Rogers originally developed his theory to be the foundation for a system of therapy. He initially called this &quot;non-directive therapy&quot; but later replaced the term &quot;non-directive&quot; with the term &quot;client-centered&quot; and then later used the term &quot;person-centered&quot;. The first empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the client-centered approach was published in 1941 at the Ohio State University by [[Elias Porter]], using the recordings of therapeutic sessions between Carl Rogers and his clients.,&lt;ref&gt;Porter, E.H. (1941) The development and evaluation of a measure of counseling interview procedure. Ph. D. Dissertation, Ohio State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter used Rogers' transcripts to devise a system to measure the degree of directiveness or non-directiveness a counselor employed.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschenbaum, Howard (1979). ''On Becoming Carl Rogers.'' pp. 206-207.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attitude and orientation of the counselor were demonstrated to be instrumental in the decisions made by the client.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, E.H. (1950) An Introduction to Therapeutic Counseling. Boston: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl. (1951). ''Client-Centered Therapy.'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the publication of ''Client-Centered Therapy'' in 1951, he believed that the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts and not just in the therapy situation. As a result he started to use the term ''person-centered approach'' later in his life to describe his overall theory.

Person-centered therapy is the application of the person-centered approach to the therapy situation. Other applications include a theory of personality, interpersonal relations, education, nursing, cross-cultural relations and other &quot;helping&quot; professions and situations.

In 1970, Richard Young, Alton Becker, and Kenneth Pike published ''Rhetoric: Discovery and Change'', a widely influential college writing textbook that used a [[Rogerian argument|Rogerian approach]] to communication to revise the traditional Aristotelian framework for rhetoric.

The application to education has a large robust research tradition similar to that of therapy. Rogers described the approach to education in ''Client-Centered Therapy'' and wrote ''Freedom to Learn'' devoted exclusively to the subject in 1969. ''Freedom to Learn'' was revised two times. The new Learner-Centered Model is similar in many regards to this classical person-centered approach to education.

The application to cross-cultural relations has involved workshops in highly stressful situations and global locations including conflicts and challenges in South Africa, Central America, and Ireland. This work resulted in a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] nomination for Rogers.

[[File:Casimir plates bubbles.svg|thumb|Casimir forces on parallel plates]]
In [[quantum field theory]], the '''Casimir effect''' and the Casimir-Polder force are physical [[force (physics)|forces]] arising from a [[quantum field theory|quantized field]]. The typical example is of two [[electric charge|uncharged]] metallic plates in a [[vacuum]], placed a few micrometers apart, without any external [[electromagnetic field]]. In a [[classical electromagnetism|classical]] description, the lack of an external field also means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them.&lt;ref&gt;Cyriaque Genet, Francesco Intravaia, Astrid Lambrecht and Serge Reynaud(2004)&quot;[http://www.ensmp.fr/aflb/AFLB-291/aflb291p331.pdf Electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations,Casimir and Van der Waals forces]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When this field is instead studied using [[quantum electrodynamics]], it is seen that the plates do affect the [[virtual particle|virtual photons]] which constitute the field, and generate a net force&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.aps.org/story/v2/st28 The Force of Empty Space], Physical Review Focus, 3 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;—either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of [[virtual particle]]s interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the [[zero-point energy]] of a [[Quantum field theory|quantized field]] in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured, and is a striking example of an effect purely due to [[Canonical_quantization#Second_quantization:_field_theory|second quantization]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lambrecht, [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747 The Casimir effect: a force from nothing], ''Physics World'', September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/pnu/1996/split/pnu300-3.htm American Institute of Physics News Note 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations has led to some controversy.
In fact &quot;Casimir's original goal was to compute the [[van der Waals force]] between [[dipolar polarization|polarizable molecules]]&quot; of the metallic plates. Thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the [[zero-point energy]] (vacuum energy) or [[virtual particle]]s of quantum fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaffe|first1=R.|title=Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum|arxiv=hep-th/0503158|journal=Physical Review D|volume=72|pages=021301|year=2005 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301|issue=2|bibcode = 2005PhRvD..72b1301J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physicist]]s [[Hendrik Casimir|Hendrik B. G. Casimir]] and
[[Dirk Polder]] proposed the existence of the force and formulated an experiment to detect it in 1948 while participating in research at [[Philips]] Research Labs. The classic form of the experiment, described above, successfully demonstrated the force to within 15% of the value predicted by the theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061217.html Photo of ball attracted to a plate by Casimir effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is only measurable when the distance between the objects is extremely small. On a submicrometre scale, this force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors. In fact, at separations of 10&amp;nbsp;nm—about 100 times the typical size of an atom—the Casimir effect produces the equivalent of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] of pressure (101.325 kPa), the precise value depending on surface geometry and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747|title=The Casimir effect: a force from nothing|date=2002-09-01|accessdate=2009-07-17|publisher=physicsworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[theoretical physics]], the Casimir effect plays an important role in the [[nucleon#Models|chiral bag model]] of the [[nucleon]]; and in [[applied physics]], it is significant in some aspects of emerging [[microtechnologies]] and [[nanotechnologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Lambrecht,Serge Reynaud and Cyriaque Genet&quot; [http://www.fisica.unipa.it/~cewqo2007/Archive/presentations/Genet.pdf Casimir In The Nanoworld]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and [[dielectric]]s alters the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy of the second quantized [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Losada&quot; [http://particulas.cnea.gov.ar/workshops/silafae/data/226.pdf Functional Approach to the Fermionic Casimir Effect]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the Casimir effect makes itself manifest as a force between such objects.

==Vacuum energy==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Faster-than-light]] --&gt;
{{Quantum field theory}}
{{Main|Vacuum energy}}
The causes of the Casimir effect are described by [[quantum field theory]], which states that all of the various fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a &quot;field&quot; in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], and its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. However, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: [[spin (physics)|spin]], or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] in the case of [[light]], [[energy]], and so on. On average, most of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is, after all, &quot;empty&quot; in this sense. One important exception is the [[vacuum energy]] or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or [[zero-point energy]] that such an oscillator may have is

:&lt;math&gt;{E} = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} \hbar \omega \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. To remove this infinity, one may argue that only differences in energy are physically measurable; this argument is the underpinning of the theory of [[renormalization]]. In all practical calculations, this is how the infinity is always handled. In a deeper sense, however, renormalization is unsatisfying, and the removal of this infinity presents a challenge in the search for a [[Theory of Everything]]. Currently there is no compelling explanation for how this infinity should be treated as essentially zero; a non-zero value is essentially the [[cosmological constant]] and any large value causes trouble in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]].

==Effects==
Casimir's observation was that the [[Canonical quantization|second-quantized]] quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or [[dielectric]]s, must obey the same [[Boundary value problem|boundary condition]]s that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] or dielectric.

Consider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a [[Cavity magnetron|radar cavity]] or a [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]. In this case, the correct way to find the zero point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the [[standing wave]]s of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the ''n''th standing wave is &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. The vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum running over all possible values of ''n'' enumerating the standing waves. The factor of 1/2 corresponds to the fact that the zero-point energies are being summed (it is the same 1/2 as appears in the equation &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar \omega/2&lt;/math&gt;). Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions.

In particular, one may ask how the zero point energy depends on the shape ''s'' of the cavity. Each energy level &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; depends on the shape, and so one should write &lt;math&gt;E_n(s)&lt;/math&gt; for the energy level, and &lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: the force at point ''p'' on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape ''s'' of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by &lt;math&gt;\delta s&lt;/math&gt;, at point ''p''. That is, one has

:&lt;math&gt;F(p) = - \left. \frac{\delta \langle E(s) \rangle} {\delta s} \right\vert_p\,&lt;/math&gt;

This value is finite in many practical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief summary, see the introduction in {{cite journal|last1=Passante|first1=R.|last2=Spagnolo|first2=S.|title=Casimir-Polder interatomic potential between two atoms at finite temperature and in the presence of boundary conditions|arxiv=0708.2240|journal=Physical Review A|volume=76|pages=042112|year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042112|issue=4|bibcode = 2007PhRvA..76d2112P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casimir's calculation==
In the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; apart. In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, since the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the parallel plates lie in the xy-plane, the standing waves are

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,y,z;t) = e^{-i\omega_nt} e^{ik_xx+ik_yy} \sin \left( k_n z \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[wave vector]]s in directions parallel to the plates, and

:&lt;math&gt;k_n = \frac{n\pi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

is the wave-vector perpendicular to the plates. Here, ''n'' is an integer, resulting from the requirement that ψ vanish on the metal plates. The energy of this wave is

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_n = c \sqrt{{k_x}^2 + {k_y}^2 + \frac{n^2\pi^2}{a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2
\int \frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty A\omega_n &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave. This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The [[Zeta function regularization|zeta-regulated]] version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = \hbar 
\int \frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n 
\vert \omega_n\vert^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

In the end, the limit &lt;math&gt;s\to 0&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken. Here ''s'' is just a [[complex number]], not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral/sum is finite for ''s'' [[real number|real]] and larger than 3. The sum has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at ''s'' = 3, but may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] to ''s'' = 0, where the expression is finite. Expanding this, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = 
\frac{\hbar c^{1-s}}{4\pi^2} \sum_n \int_0^\infty 2\pi qdq 
\left \vert q^2 + \frac{\pi^2 n^2}{a^2} \right\vert^{(1-s)/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;q^2 = k_x^2+k_y^2&lt;/math&gt; were introduced to turn the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] into a single integral. The &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; in front is the Jacobian, and the &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; comes from the angular integration. The integral is easily performed, resulting in

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = 
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}} \frac{1}{3-s}
\sum_n \vert n\vert ^{3-s}&lt;/math&gt;

The sum may be understood to be the [[Riemann zeta function]], and so one has

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = 
\lim_{s\to 0} \frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = 
-\frac {\hbar c \pi^{2}}{6a^{3}} \zeta (-3)&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\zeta(-3)=1/120&lt;/math&gt; and so one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = 
\frac {-\hbar c \pi^{2}}{3 \cdot 240 a^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

The Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is

:&lt;math&gt;{F_c \over A} = -
\frac{d}{da} \frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} =
-\frac {\hbar c \pi^2} {240 a^4}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; (hbar, ħ) is the [[reduced Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]],
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distance]] between the two plates.

The force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; shows that the Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.

===More recent theory===
Casimir's analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dzyaloshinskii|first1=I E|last2=Lifshitz|first2=E M|last3=Pitaevskii|first3=Lev P|title=GENERAL THEORY OF VAN DER WAALS' FORCES|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|volume=4|pages=153|year=1961|doi=10.1070/PU1961v004n02ABEH003330|issue=2|bibcode = 1961SvPhU...4..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dzyaloshinskii|first1=I E|last2=Kats|first2=E I|title=Casimir forces in modulated systems|arxiv=cond-mat/0408348|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=16|pages=5659|year=2004 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/16/32/003|issue=32|bibcode = 2004JPCM...16.5659D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, such as the modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials.  Lifshitz' theory for two metal plates reduces to Casimir's idealized 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; force law for large separations ''a'' much greater than the [[skin depth]] of the metal, and conversely reduces to the 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force law of the [[London dispersion force]] (with a coefficient called a [[Hamaker constant]]) for small ''a'', with a more complicated dependence on ''a'' for intermediate separations determined by the [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Parsegian, ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifshitz' result was subsequently generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries as well as to anisotropic and magnetic materials, but for several decades the calculation of Casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt;  For example, the force in the experimental sphere–plate geometry was computed with an approximation (due to Derjaguin) that the sphere radius ''R'' is much larger than the separation ''a'', in which case the nearby surfaces are nearly parallel and the parallel-plate result can be adapted to obtain an approximate ''R''/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force (neglecting both skin-depth and [[Orders of approximation|higher-order]] curvature effects).&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. V. Derjaguin, I. I. Abrikosova, and E. M. Lifshitz, ''Quarterly Reviews, Chemical Society'', vol. 10, 295–329 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 2000s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques, in many cases adapted from classical [[computational electromagnetics]], that are capable of accurately calculating Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials, from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S.|last1=Johnson|first2=F.|last2=Capasso|title=The Casimir effect in microstructured geometries|journal=Nature Photonics|volume=5|pages=211–221|year=2011|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2011.39|last3=Johnson|first3=Steven G.|issue=4|bibcode = 2011NaPho...5..211R }} Review article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
One of the first experimental tests was conducted by Marcus Sparnaay at Philips in Eindhoven, in 1958, in a delicate and difficult experiment with parallel plates, obtaining results not in contradiction with the Casimir theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparnaay|first1=M. J.|title=Attractive Forces between Flat Plates|journal=Nature|volume=180|pages=334|year=1957|doi=10.1038/180334b0|issue=4581|bibcode = 1957Natur.180..334S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparnaay|first1=M|title=Measurements of attractive forces between flat plates|journal=Physica|volume=24|pages=751|year=1958|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(58)80090-7|issue=6–10|bibcode = 1958Phy....24..751S }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with large experimental errors. Some of the experimental details as well as some background information on how Casimir, Polder and Sparnaay arrived at this point&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draschan.com/gallery/casimir-sparnaay-werner.mov Movie]&lt;/ref&gt; are highlighted in a 2007 interview with Marcus Sparnaay.

The Casimir effect was measured more accurately in 1997 by Steve K. Lamoreaux of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamoreaux|first1=S. K.|title=Demonstration of the Casimir Force in the 0.6 to 6 μm Range|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=78|pages=5|year=1997|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5|bibcode = 1997PhRvL..78....5L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Umar Mohideen and Anushree Roy of the [[University of California at Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.4549|last1=Mohideen|first1=U.|year=1998|pages=4549|volume=81|journal=Physical Review Letters|last2=Roy|first2=Anushree|title= Precision Measurement of the Casimir Force from 0.1 to 0.9 µm|issue=21|arxiv = physics/9805038 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.4549M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, rather than using two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a [[sphere]] with a large [[radius]]. In 2001, a group at the [[University of Padua]] finally succeeded in measuring the Casimir force between parallel plates using microresonators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bressi|first1=G.|last2=Carugno|first2=G.|last3=Onofrio|first3=R.|last4=Ruoso|first4=G.|title=Measurement of the Casimir Force between Parallel Metallic Surfaces|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=88|pages=041804|year=2002|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.041804|issue=4|pmid=11801108|arxiv = quant-ph/0203002 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88d1804B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regularisation==
In order to be able to perform calculations in the general case, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] in the summations. This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.

The [[heat kernel regularization|heat kernel]] or [[Exponential function|exponentially]] regulated sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n| 
\exp (-t|\omega_n|)&lt;/math&gt;

where the limit &lt;math&gt;t\to 0^+&lt;/math&gt; is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle = \frac{C}{t^3} + \textrm{finite}\,&lt;/math&gt;

for three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant ''C'' which ''does not'' depend on the shape of the cavity. The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] regulator

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n| 
\exp (-t^2|\omega_n|^2)&lt;/math&gt;

is better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well. The [[zeta function regulator]]

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n| |\omega_n|^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

is completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the [[complex plane|complex ''s'' plane]], with the bulk divergence at ''s'' = 4. This sum may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] past this pole, to obtain a finite part at ''s'' = 0.

Not every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at ''s'' = 0) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the [[plasma frequency]]), metals become transparent to [[photon]]s (such as [[X-ray]]s), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in [[solid state physics]], mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the [[cutoff frequency]] comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in ''Landau and Lifshitz'', &quot;Theory of Continuous Media&quot;.)

==Generalities==
The Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of [[functional integral]]s of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called &quot;[[virtual particle]]s&quot;.

More interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the [[van der Waals force]], to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in [[configuration space]]. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.

In the [[chiral bag model]] of the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the [[spectral asymmetry]] is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[baryon number]], cancelling the [[topological winding number]] of the [[pion]] field surrounding the nucleon.

==Wormholes==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}

[[Exotic matter]] with negative energy density may be required to stabilize a [[wormhole]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Visser (1995) ''Lorentzian Wormholes: from Einstein to Hawking'', AIP Press, Woodbury NY, ISBN 1-56396-394-9&lt;/ref&gt; Morris, [[Kip Thorne|Thorne]] and Yurtsever pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the Casimir effect can be used to produce a locally mass-negative region of space-time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=Kip|last3=Yurtsever|first3=Ulvi|title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|pages=1446|year=1988|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446|issue=13|pmid=10038800 |bibcode = 1988PhRvL..61.1446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that negative effect could be used to stabilize a wormhole to allow [[faster than light travel]]. See also the [[Scharnhorst effect]]. This concept has been used extensively in [[science fiction]].

==Analogies and the dynamic Casimir effect==
A similar analysis can be used to explain [[Hawking radiation]] that causes the slow &quot;[[Hawking_radiation#Black_hole_evaporation|evaporation]]&quot; of [[black hole]]s (although this is generally visualised as the escape of one particle from a [[virtual particle]]-[[antiparticle]] pair, the other particle having been captured by the black hole).

The dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated boundary, often referred to as a ''moving mirror''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fulling|first1=S. A.|last2=Davies|first2=P. C. W.|title=Radiation from a Moving Mirror in Two Dimensional Space-Time: Conformal Anomaly|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=348|pages=393|year=1976|doi=10.1098/rspa.1976.0045|issue=1654 |bibcode = 1976RSPSA.348..393F }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''motion-induced radiation''.

Constructed within the framework of [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]], the dynamical Casimir effect has been used to better understand acceleration radiation; i.e. the [[Unruh effect]].

Moving mirrors create entropy, particles, energy and gravitational-like effects. In analogy to the event horizon of a black hole, an accelerated mirror amplifies quantum field vacuum fluctuations.

An experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect is still lacking, although for the first time, an experiment is being conducted that aims at measuring the dynamical Casimir effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agnesi, A. et al|title=MIR: An experiment for the measurement of the dynamical Casimir effect|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/161/1/012028|year=2009|pages=012028|volume=161|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |bibcode = 2009JPhCS.161a2028A }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the effective motion of a wall of a superconducting microwave resonant cavity. The effective motion is produced by periodic illumination of a semiconductor slab by means of an ultra-high-frequency amplitude modulated laser.

==Repulsive forces==
There are few instances wherein the Casimir effect can give rise to repulsive forces between uncharged objects. In a seminal paper, [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dzyaloshinskii|first1=I.E.|last2=Lifshitz|first2=E.M.|last3=Pitaevskii|first3=L.P.|title=The general theory of van der Waals forces†|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=10|pages=165|year=1961|doi=10.1080/00018736100101281|issue=38|bibcode = 1961AdPhy..10..165D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz was recently carried out by Munday et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munday|first1=J.N.|last2=Capasso|first2=F.|last3=Parsegian |first3=V.A.|title=Measured long-range repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz forces |journal=Nature|volume=457|pages=170|year=2009|doi=10.1038/nature07610|pmid=19129843|issue=7226|bibcode = 2009Natur.457..170M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have also suggested the use of [[gain media]] to achieve a similar levitation effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1559579/Physicists-have-%27solved%27-mystery-of-levitation.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|title=Physicists have 'solved' mystery of levitation|first=Roger|last=Highfield|date=2007-08-06|accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is controversial{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide a controversial citation/paper explaining how causality constraints are violated.|date=March 2009}} because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium.

==Applications==
It has been suggested that the Casimir forces have application in nanotechnology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Capasso|first1=F.|last2=Munday|first2=J.N.|last3=Iannuzzi|first3=D.|last4=Chan|first4=H.B.|title=Casimir forces and quantum electrodynamical torques: physics and nanomechanics|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics|volume=13|pages=400|year=2007|doi=10.1109/JSTQE.2007.893082|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular silicon integrated circuit technology based micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems, silicon array propulsion for space drives, and so-called Casimir oscillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serry|first1=F.M.|last2=Walliser|first2=D.|last3=MacLay|first3=G.J.|title=The anharmonic Casimir oscillator (ACO)-the Casimir effect in a model microelectromechanical system|url=http://www.quantumfields.com/IEEEJMEMSACO.pdf|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems|volume=4|pages=193|year=1995|doi=10.1109/84.475546|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Numismatics}}

A '''coin''' is a piece of hard material that is standardized in weight, is produced in large quantities in order to facilitate trade, and primarily can be used as a legal tender token for commerce in the designated country, region, or territory.

Coins are usually [[metal]] or a metallic material and sometimes made of synthetic materials, usually in the shape of a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]], and most often issued by a government. Coins are used as a form of [[money]] in transactions of various kinds, from the everyday circulation coins to the storage of large numbers of [[bullion coins]]. In the present day, coins and [[banknote]]s make up the cash forms of all modern money systems. Coins made for paying bills and general [[monetize]]d use are usually used for lower-valued units, and banknotes for the higher values; also, in many money systems, the highest value coin made for circulation is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has usually been higher than the gross value of the metal used in making them; exceptions occurring when [[inflation]] causes the metal value to surpass the face value, causing the minting authority to change the composition and the old coins to begin to disappear from circulation (see [[Gresham's Law]].) However, this has generally not been the case throughout the rest of history for circulation coins made of precious metals.

Exceptions to the rule of coin face-value being higher than content value, also occur for some bullion coins made of silver or gold (and, rarely, other metals, such as [[platinum]] or [[palladium]]), intended for collectors or investors in precious metals. Examples of modern gold collector/investor coins include the [[American Gold Eagle]] minted by the United States, the [[Canadian Gold Maple Leaf]] minted by Canada, and the [[Krugerrand]], minted by South Africa. The [[American Gold Eagle]] has a face value of US$50, and the [[Canadian Gold Maple Leaf]] coins also have nominal (purely symbolic) face values (e.g., C$50 for 1 oz.); but the [[Krugerrand]] does not.

Historically, a great number of [[coinage metals]] (including alloys) and other materials have been used practically, artistically, and experimentally in the production of coins for circulation, collection, and metal investment, where bullion coins often serve as more convenient stores of assured metal quantity and purity than other bullion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tclayton.demon.co.uk/metal.html Comprehensive list of metals and their alloys which have been used at various times, in coins for all types of purposes.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins have long been linked to the concept of money, as reflected by the fact that in some other languages the words &quot;coin&quot; and &quot;[[currency]]&quot; are synonymous. Fictional currencies may also bear the name coin (as such, an item may be said to be worth 123 coin or 123 coins).

==The value of a coin==

In terms of its value as a collector's item, a coin is generally made more or less valuable by its condition, specific historical significance, rarity, quality/beauty of the design and general popularity with collectors. If a coin is greatly lacking in all of these, it is unlikely to be worth much. Bullion coins are also valued based on these factors, but are largely valued based on the value of the gold or silver in them. Sometimes non-monetized bullion coins such as the [[Canadian Maple Leaf]] and the [[American Gold Eagle]] are minted with nominal face values less than the value of the metal in them, but as such coins are never intended for circulation, these value numbers are not market but [[fiat money|fiat values]].

Most coins presently are made of a [[base metal]], and their value comes from their status as [[fiat money]]. This means that the value of the coin is decreed by government fiat (law), and thus is determined by the [[free market]] only as national currencies are subjected to [[arbitrage]] in international trade. This causes such coins to be monetary [[Token coin|tokens]] in the same sense that paper currency is, when the paper currency is not backed directly by metal, but rather by a government guarantee of international exchange of goods or services. Some have suggested that such coins not be considered to be &quot;true coins&quot; (see below). However, because [[fiat money]] is backed by government guarantee of a certain amount of goods and services, where the value of this is in turn determined by [[free market]] currency exchange rates, similar to the case for the international market exchange values which determines the value of metals which back [[commodity money]], in practice there is very little economic difference between the two types of money (types of currencies).

Coins may be minted that have fiat values lower than the value of their component metals, but this is never done intentionally and initially for circulation coins, and happens only in due course later in the history of coin production due to [[inflation]], as market values for the metal overtake the fiat declared face value of the coin. Examples of this phenomenon include the [[Dime (United States coin)|pre-1965 US dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar]], [[Nickel (United States coin)|US nickel]], and [[Cent (United States coin)|pre-1982 US penny]]. As a result of the increase in the value of copper, the United States greatly reduced the amount of copper in each penny. Since mid-1982, United States pennies are made of 97.5% zinc, coated with 2.5% copper. Extreme differences between fiat values and metal values of coins causes coins to be removed from circulation by illicit smelters interested in the value of their metal content.  This is an example of [[Gresham's Law]].  In fact, the [[United States Mint]], in anticipation of this practice, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of pennies and nickels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index.cfm?action=press_release&amp;ID=724 The United States Mint Pressroom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.

==First coins==
[[Homer]] used the [[ox]] as the base &quot;currency&quot; of goods, for example he valued the bronze armour of [[Diomedes]] worth nine oxen, while the golden armour of [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], worth one hundred oxen.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D6%3Acard%3D232 Hom. Il. 6.232]&lt;/ref&gt; As a measure of gold he used the [[Talent (measurement)|talent]],
[[Achilles]] for example gives half-talent of gold to [[Antilochus]] as a prize
.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D23%3Acard%3D784  Hom. Il. 23.784].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] states that the first coins were struck by [[Demodike]] of [[Kyme (Aeolis)|Kyme]], of Ancient Greece, who had married [[Midas]], king of [[Pessinus]], and had by him a son named [[Agamemnon]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.metrum.org/gyges/homgyg.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] states (I, 94) that the Lydians 'were the first to coin in gold and silver'. He means that they first coined in the two precious metals separately{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Many people{{who|date=August 2010}} confuse his statement, as if it refers to coinage in [[electrum]] (a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver).

Some archaeological and literary evidences suggest that the [[Iron Age India|Indians]] invented coinage, somewhere between the 6th to 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q5ZM0nZXZEkC&amp;pg=PA1611 Indian Encyclopaedia. Biographical, Historical, Religious, Administrative, Ethnological, Commercial And Scientific] edited by Subodh Kapoor&lt;/ref&gt; However,  some numismatists consider coins to have originated ca. 600-550 BC in [[Anatolia]], which corresponds to modern-day Turkey, in particular in the Anatolian kingdom of [[Lydia]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Kroll, review of G. Le Rider's ''La naissance de la monnaie'', ''Schweizerische Numismatische Rundschau'' '''80''' (2001), p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Sear, Greek Coins and Their Values Vol. 2, Seaby, London, 1979, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the Lydia scenario point to the fact that coins of that era have been totally absent from archeological finds in [[Sardis]], capital of Lydia.&lt;ref&gt;G. Hanfmann, pp. 73, 77. R. Seaford, p. 128, points out, &quot;The nearly total lack of ... coins in the excavated commercial-industrial areas of Sardis suggests that they were concentrated in the hands of the king and possibly wealthy merchants.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A coin, by definition, is an object used to facilitate commerce and exchanges. The proponents of the Lydian Greek coins scenario admit the fact that they were likely not used in commerce or industry. [[Electrum]] coins were not standardized in weight and are considered by opponents as badges, medals or ceremonial objects issued by priests,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;THE TYPES OF GREEK COINS&quot; AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ESSAY BY PERCY GARDNER 1883 p.42 ''&quot;Considering these and other facts it may be held to be probable, if not absolutely proved, that priests first issued stamped coin, and that the first mints were in Greek temples.&quot;'' [http://dln2.comyr.com/PDF/7682.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than coins (actually the oldest of them have been discovered not in Lydia, but in an ancient Greek temple of [[Ephesos]]), a city colony built by the ancient Greeks (modern day Turkey).

The oldest coins are considered by other numismatists to be the [[Aegina]] [[Chelone (Greek mythology)|Chelone]] coins which were minted ca. [http://www.snible.org/coins/bmc/attica/XXIII.jpg 700-550 BC], either by the local Aegina people or by [[Pheidon]] king of [[Argos]] (who first set the standards of weights and measures). In the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris, there is a unique [[electrum]] stater of [[Aegina]]. The date of this coin can hardly be much later than about B.C. 700.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/aegina.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Ancient Greeks spread the Anatolia practice (or vice versa) and extended it to commerce and trade. Coinage followed Greek colonization and influence first around the Mediterranean and soon after to North Africa (including Egypt), Syria, Persia, and the Balkans.

The first Lydian coins were made of [[electrum]], a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold that was further alloyed with added silver and copper.&lt;ref&gt;http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html Accessed December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many early Lydian and Greek coins were undoubtedly minted under the authority of private individuals and are thus more akin to tokens or badges than true coins, though because of their numbers it's evident that some were official state issues, with [[Alyattes II|King Alyattes]] of Lydia being a frequently mentioned originator of coinage.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ramage, &quot;Golden Sardis&quot;, King Croesus' Gold: Excavations at Sardis and the History of Gold Refining, edited by A. Ramage and P. Craddock, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the early Lydian coins include no writing, called a &quot;legend&quot; or &quot;inscription&quot;, only an image of a symbolic animal. Therefore the dating of these coins relies primarily on archeological evidence, with the most commonly cited evidence coming from excavations at the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], also called the Ephesian Artemision (which would later evolve into one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]). The fact that the oldest lion head coins were discovered in that temple, and the fact that they were not used in commerce, strengths the scenario that these coins found there may have actually been badges or medals that were issued by the priests of the [[temple of Artemis]], and the name of the person who received the badge or medal was inscribed on it. Artemis in Anatolia was named [[Potnia Theron]], which is translated as &quot;mistress of the animals&quot;, and her symbol was the lion and the tiger.

A small percentage of early Lydian Greek coins have a legend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/inscriptions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flavian dynasty Aurei.png|thumb|150px|right|Set of three roman [[Aureus|aurei]] depicting the rulers of the [[Flavian dynasty]]. Top to bottom: [[Vespasian]], [[Titus]] and [[Domitian]]. 69-96 AD.]]A famous early [[electrum]] coin, the most ancient inscribed coin at present known, is from nearby [[Caria]], [[Asia Minor]]. This coin has a Greek legend reading &quot;Phaenos emi sema&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/e/electrum_stater_inscribed_with.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; which can be translated either as &quot;I am the badge of Phanes&quot; or as &quot;I am the sign of light&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Newton (Num. Chron., 1870, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; or maybe &quot;I am the tomb of light&quot; or &quot;I am the tomb of Phanes&quot;. The celebrated coins of Phanes are known to be amongst the earliest of Greek coins, a [[hemihekte]] of the issue was found in the famous foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (this deposit is considered the oldest deposit of [[electrum]] coins discovered). One assumption is that Phanes was a wealthy merchant, another that this coin is associated with Apollo-[[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] and, due to the [[Deer]], with [[Artemis]] (twin sister of the god of light [[Apollo]]-Phaneos). Although only seven Phanes type coins were discovered, it is also notable that 20% of all early [[electrum]] coins also have the Lion (symbol of Artemis-Potnia Theron) and the sun burst (symbol of Apollo-Phaneos). Alternatively it is stated &lt;ref&gt;http://www.archive.org/stream/newnumismatic18royauoft/newnumismatic18royauoft_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; that the inscribed Phanes maybe was the [[Halicarnassus|Halicarnassian]] mercenary of [[Amasis]], mentioned by [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus third book (ch. iv.)&lt;/ref&gt; who escaped to the court of [[Cambyses]], and became his guide in the invasion of Egypt in the year B.C. 527 or 525. According to Herodotus, this Phanes was buried alive by a sandstorm, together with 50000 Persian soldiers, while trying to conquer the temple of [[Amun]]&amp;ndash;[[Zeus]] in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus third book&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the Greek word &quot;Phanes&quot; also means light (or lamp), and the word &quot;sema&quot; also means tomb,&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 2.814, 6.419&lt;/ref&gt; makes this coin a famous and controversial one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/ionia.html#571&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible candidate for first metal coins come from China. The earliest known Chinese metal tokens were made ca. 900 BC, discovered in a tomb near [[Anyang]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.big5.henan.gov.cn/hngk/system/2006/08/02/010000219.shtml (IN CHINESE ONLY)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=RGu62yiVF8wC&amp;pg=PT186&amp;dq=shang+coin&amp;lr=#PPT187,M1&lt;/ref&gt; These were replicas in bronze of earlier Chinese money, [[cowry]] shells, so they were named [[Tong Bei|Bronze Shell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://chinesechinese.net/HistoryofChina.html A snap shot view of The history of China by YK Kwan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/focus/currency.htm Shell Money before Qin Dynasty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_681500371_2/shang_dynasty.html Shang Dynasty Economy Encarta. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013886252294 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most numismatists, however, regard these as well as later Chinese bronzes that were replicas of knives, spades, and hoes as money but not as coins because they did not at least initially carry a mark or marks certifying them to be of a definite exchange value.&lt;ref&gt;G. Davies, A History of Money: From Ancient Times to the Present Day, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1994, pp. 54-57, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Anatolia and China, India also played a major part in the development of coinage. The first Indian coins were [[mint (coin)|minted]] around the 6th century BC by the [[Mahajanapadas]] of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. The coins of this period were punch marked coins called ''Puranas'', ''Karshapanas'' or ''Pana''.&lt;ref&gt;See P.L. Gupta: ''Coins'', New Delhi, National Book Trust, 1996, Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahajanapadas that minted their own coins included [[Gandhara]],&lt;ref&gt;http://coinindia.com/galleries-gandhara.html Accessed 2007-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuntala]],&lt;ref&gt;http://coinindia.com/galleries-kuntala.html Accessed 2007-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]],&lt;ref&gt;http://coinindia.com/galleries-kuru.html Accessed 2007-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; [[Panchala]],&lt;ref&gt;http://coinindia.com/galleries-panchala.html Accessed 2007-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakya]],&lt;ref&gt;http://coinindia.com/galleries-shakya.html, Accessed 2007-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; [[Surasena]],&lt;ref&gt;http://coinindia.com/galleries-shurasena.html Accessed 2007-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Surashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://coinindia.com/galleries-surashtra.html Accessed 2007-06-03&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest coins made of pure [[gold]] and [[silver]] were made by King [[Croesus]] of Lydia, son of Alyattes. Shortly afterward in the same region gold &quot;darics&quot; and silver &quot;sigloi&quot; were issued by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of the Persians.

The first European coins are regarded as having been minted ca. 550 BC in [[Aegina]], an island in the Aegean Sea, with coins of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] soon following.&lt;ref&gt;C. Kraay, Archaic and Classical Greek Coins, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Roman currency|Roman coins]], which were crude, heavy cast bronzes, were issued ca. 289 BC.&lt;ref&gt;W. Sayles, Ancient Coin Collecting III: The Roman World&amp;ndash;Politics and Propaganda, Krause Publications, Iola, Wisconsin, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The first European coin to use [[Arabic numerals]] to date the year in which the coin was minted was the Swiss 1424 [[St. Gallen]] silver Plappart.&lt;ref&gt;Early Dated Coins, http://www.medievalcoinage.com/earlydated, Accessed December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coin debasement==
{{Main|Debasement}}

Throughout history, governments have been known to create more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow. By replacing some fraction of a coin's precious metal content with a base metal (often [[copper]] or [[nickel]]), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby ''&quot;debasing&quot;'' their money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible. Debasement sometimes occurs in order to make the coin harder and therefore less likely to be worn down as quickly. Debasement of money almost always leads to price [[inflation]] unless [[price control]]s are also instituted by the governing authority, in which case a [[black market]] will often arise.

The United States is unusual in that it has only slightly modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest coin in common circulation is 25 cents, a low value for the largest denomination coin compared to other countries. Recent increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc, mean that both the US one- and five-cent coins are now worth more for their raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) now contain about two cents worth of copper. Some denominations of circulating coins that were formerly minted in the United States are no longer made. These include coins with a face value of half a cent, two cents, three cents,and twenty cents. (The Half Dollar and Dollar coins are still produced, but mostly for vending machines and collectors.) The United States also used to coin the following denominations for circulation in gold: One dollar, $2.50, three dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, and twenty dollars. In addition, cents were originally slightly larger than the modern quarter and weighed nearly half an ounce, while five cent coins were smaller than a dime and made of a silver alloy. Dollars were also much larger and weighed approximately an ounce. Half dollar and one dollar coins are still produced but rarely used. The U.S. also has bullion and commemorative coins with the following denominations: 50¢, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.

Some convicted criminals from the British Isles who were sentenced to transportation to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries used coins to leave messages of remembrance to loved ones left behind in Britain. The coins were defaced, smoothed and inscribed, either by stippling or engraving, with sometimes touching words of loss. These coins were called &quot;convict love tokens&quot; or &quot;leaden hearts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/convict_tokens&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these tokens are in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].

==Features of modern coins==
[[File:1884 trade dollar rev.jpg|left|thumb|166px|1884 United States [[Trade Dollar]].]]Circulating coins commonly suffered from &quot;shaving&quot; or &quot;clipping&quot;, by which persons would cut off small amounts of precious metal from their edges to form new coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origin of Financial Crises |last=Cooper |first=George |authorlink=George Cooper|year= 2008|publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-47345-5 |page=46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unmilled British [[sterling silver]] coins were sometimes reduced to almost half their minted weight. This form of debasement in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] England was commented on by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]], whose name was later attached to [[Gresham's Law]]. The monarch would have to periodically recall circulating coins, paying only bullion value of the silver, and reminting them. This, also known as recoinage, is a long and difficult process that was done only occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper G. 2008 p.47&lt;/ref&gt; While master of the Royal Mint, [[Isaac Newton]] came up with the idea of milling lines on the edges of coins to make it easier to detect coin clipping and to help reduce recoining.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper G. 2008 p.46&lt;/ref&gt; The milled, or reeded, edges are still found on many coins today.

Traditionally, the side of a coin carrying a bust of a monarch or other authority, or a [[national emblem]], is called the ''[[obverse]]'', or colloquially, ''heads''; ''see also [[List of people on coins]]''. The other side is called the ''[[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]'', or colloquially, ''tails''. However, the rule is violated in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucalgary.ca/~cns/euro.html The Euro Coin and the Inadequacy of our definition of &quot;Obverse&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another rule is that the side carrying the year of [[mint (coin)|mint]]ing is the obverse, although some [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] coins, most [[Canadian coinage|Canadian]] coins, the pre-2008 British [[Twenty pence (British decimal coin)|20p]] coin, and all Japanese coins, are exceptions.

In cases where a correctly oriented coin is flipped vertically to show the other side correctly oriented, the coin is said to have [[coin orientation]]. In cases where a coin is flipped horizontally to show the other side, it is said to have [[medallic orientation]]. The latter is found in British coins.

[[Bi-metallic coins]] are sometimes used for higher values and for commemorative purposes. In the 1990s, France used a tri-metallic coin. Common circulating examples include the [[1 euro coins|€1]], [[2 euro coins|€2]], [[Two pounds (British decimal coin)|British £2]] and [[Canadian 2 dollar coin|Canadian $2]].

The ''exergue'' is the space on a coin beneath the main design, often used to show the coin's date, although it is sometimes left blank or containing a [[mint mark]], [[privy mark]], or some other decorative or informative design feature. Many coins do not have an exergue at all, especially those with few or no legends, such as the Victorian bun penny.

Not all coins are round. The [[Fifty cent coin (Australian)|Australian 50 cent coin]], for example, has [[dodecagon|twelve flat sides]]. A twist on it is wavy edges, found in the two dollar and the twenty cent coins of [[Coins of the Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong]] and the 10 cent coins of Bahamas.  Some coins have also been issued in the shape of a square, such as the 15 cent coin of the Bahamas. During the 1970s, [[Swaziland|Swazi]] coins were minted in several shapes, including squares, polygons, and wavy edged circles with 8 and 12 waves.

Some other coins, like the [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|British Fifty pence coin]] and the Canadian [[Loonie]], have an odd number of sides, with the edges rounded off. This way the coin has a [[Curve of constant width|constant diameter]], recognisable by [[vending machine]]s whichever direction it is inserted.

The triangular coin (produced to commemorate the 2007/2008 [[Tutankhamun]] exhibition at [[The O2 arena (London)|The O2 Arena]]) was commissioned by the [[Isle of Man]], became legal tender on 6 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;It is unlikely to be spent as it costs 15[[GBP]] to buy - article ''Pyramid coin a nightmare for pockets'', article by Gary Cleland p13 of the [[Daily Telegraph]] issue number 47,434 dated December 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and has a value of 25p (a [[Crown (British coin)|crown]]). Other triangular coins issued earlier include: [[Republic of Cabinda|Cabinda]] coin, [[Bermuda]] coin, 2 Dollar [[Cook Islands]] 1992 triangular coin, [[Uganda]] Millennium Coin and [[Poland|Polish]] Sterling-Silver 10-Zloty Coin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dig4coins.com/Articles/37-Other%20Coins/139-triangular-coins.html Triangular Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mediaeval coins, called [[bracteate]]s, were so thin they were struck on only one side.

The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] is now able to produce holographic-effect gold and silver coinage. However this procedure is not limited to only bullion or commemorative coinage. The 500 yen coin from Japan, was subject to a massive amount of counterfeiting. The Japanese government in response produced a circulatory coin with a holographic image.

The Canadian Mint has also released several coins that are coloured, the first of which was in commemoration of remembrance day. The subject was a coloured poppy on the reverse of a 25 cent piece.

For a list of many pure metallic elements and their alloys which have been used in actual circulation coins and for trial experiments, see [[coinage metals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tclayton.demon.co.uk/metal.html Metals Used in Coins and Medals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins are popularly used as a sort of two-sided [[dice|die]]; in order to choose between two options with a random possibility, one choice will be labeled &quot;heads&quot; and the other &quot;tails&quot;, and a coin will be flipped or &quot;tossed&quot; to see whether the heads or tails side comes up on top. See [[Bernoulli trial]]; a fair coin is defined to have the probability of heads (in the parlance of Bernoulli trials, a &quot;success&quot;) of exactly 0.5. See also [[coin flipping]]. Coins are sometimes falsified to make one side weigh more, in order to simulate a fair type of coin which is actually not fair. Such a coin is said to be &quot;weighted&quot;.

{{TNO}}
A '''classical Kuiper belt object''', also called a '''cubewano''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|k|juː|b|iː|ˈ|w|ʌ|n|oʊ}} &quot;QB1-o&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;somewhat old-fashioned, but still used by the Minor Planet Center for their list of [http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/mpec/K10/K10S44.html Distant Minor Planets]&lt;/ref&gt;
is a [[Kuiper belt]] object (KBO) that [[orbit]]s beyond [[Neptune]] and is not controlled by an [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object|orbital resonance with Neptune]]. Cubewanos have orbits with [[Semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] in the 40-50&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] range and, unlike [[Pluto]], do not cross Neptune’s orbit.
  
The name &quot;cubewano&quot; derives from the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] (TNO) found after Pluto and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], which was {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}.  [[Provisional designation in astronomy|Decoding the provisional designation]] &quot;QB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; reveals that it was the 27th object found in the second half of August of that year.  Later similar objects were called &quot;QB1-o's&quot;, or &quot;cubewanos&quot;, although the term &quot;classical&quot; is much more frequently used in the scientific literature.

Objects identified as cubewanos include:

[[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]] (2003 EL&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;) was provisionally listed as a cubewano by the [[Minor Planet Center]] in 2006,&lt;ref name=K06X45&gt;{{cite web  |date=2006-12-12 |title=MPEC 2006-X45 : Distant Minor Planets |publisher=IAU Minor Planet Center &amp; Tamkin Foundation Computer Network |url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/mpec/K06/K06X45.html |accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is no longer listed as one.&lt;ref name=K10B62/&gt;

The [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricities]] of the orbits are represented by segments (extending from [[perihelion]] to [[aphelion]]) with the [[inclination]]s represented on the vertical axis.]]

==Orbits: 'hot' and 'cold' populations==
Most cubewanos are found between the 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune (populated by [[plutino]]s) and the 1:2 resonance. [[50000 Quaoar]], for example, has a near-circular orbit close to the [[ecliptic]]. Plutinos, on the other hand, have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]].

The majority of objects (the so-called 'cold population'), have low inclinations and near-circular orbits. A smaller population (the 'hot population') is characterised by highly inclined, more eccentric orbits.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewittDelsanti2006&quot;&gt;[[David Jewitt|D.Jewitt]], A.Delsanti ''The Solar System Beyond The Planets'' in ''Solar System Update : Topical and Timely Reviews in Solar System Sciences '', Springer-Praxis Ed., ISBN 3-540-26056-0  (2006). [http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf Preprint of the article (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deep Ecliptic Survey]] reports the distributions of the two populations; one with the inclination centered at 4.6° (named ''Core'') and another with inclinations extending beyond 30° (''Halo'').&lt;ref name=&quot;DES_Elliot2006&quot; &gt;

=== Distribution ===
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt 55AU ClassicalAndPlutinos.svg|right|thumb|400px|This diagram plots the distribution of cubewanos and [[plutino]]s. [[Histogram]]s are shown for orbit inclinations, eccentricity, and semi-major axes distribution. Inserts on the left compare the populations of cubewanos and plutinos  using eccentricity versus inclination plots.]]

The vast majority of KBOs (more than two-thirds) have inclinations of less than 5° and eccentricities of less than 0.1. Their semi-major axes show a preference for the middle of the main belt; arguably, smaller objects close to the limiting resonances have been either captured into resonance or have their orbits modified by Neptune.

The 'hot' and 'cold' populations are strikingly different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are in low inclination, near-circular orbits. The parameters of the plutinos’ orbits are more evenly distributed, with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in  0.15-0.2 range and low inclinations 5-10°.
See also the comparison with [[scattered disk#Scattered objects versus classical objects|scattered disk objects]].

[[Image:TheKuiperBelt Projections 55AU Classical Plutinos.svg|left|thumb|300px|Polar and ecliptic view of the (aligned) orbits of the classical objects (in blue), together with the plutinos in red, and Neptune (yellow).]]&lt;br clear=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;
When the orbital eccentricities of cubewanos and plutinos are compared, it can be seen that the cubewanos form a clear 'belt' outside Neptune's orbit, whereas the plutinos approach, or even cross Neptune's orbit. When orbital inclinations are compared, 'hot' cubewanos can be easily distinguished by their higher inclinations, as the plutinos typically keep orbits below 20°. (No clear explanation currently exists for the inclinations of 'hot' cubewanos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/plutino.html Dave Jewitt, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;

== Cold and hot populations: physical characteristics ==

In addition to the distinct orbital characteristics the two populations display different physical characteristics.

The difference in colour between the red cold population and more heterogeneous hot population was observed as early as in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doressoundiram2002&quot;&gt;
  {{cite journal

  |journal=The Astronomical Journal
  |volume=124|date=October 2002
  |id={{arXiv|astro-ph|0206468}} }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent studies, based on a larger data set, indicate the cut-off inclination of 12° (instead of 5°) between the cold and hot populations while confirming the distinction between the homogenous red cold population and the bluish hot population.&lt;ref name=&quot;LacerdaJewitt2008&quot;&gt;

  |volume=136|date=August 2008
  |id={{arXiv|0808.3025v1}} }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another difference between the low inclination (cold) and high inclination (hot) classical objects is the observed number of [[binary asteroid|binary objects]]. Binaries are quite common on low-inclination orbits and are typically similar-brightness systems. Binaries are less common on high-inclination orbits and their components typically differ in brightness. This correlation, together with the differences in colour, support further the suggestion that the currently observed classical objects belong to at least two different overlapping populations, with different physical properties and orbital history.&lt;ref name=&quot;NollGrundy-binaries2008&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toward a formal definition==
There is no official definition of 'cubewano' or 'classical KBO'. However, the terms are normally used to refer to objects free from significant perturbation from Neptune, thereby excluding KBOs in orbital resonance with Neptune ([[resonant trans-Neptunian object]]s).  The [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) and the [[Deep Ecliptic Survey]] (DES) do not list cubewanos (classical objects) using the same exact criteria.  Many TNOs classified as cubewanos by the MPC are classified as ScatNear (possibly [[Perturbation (astronomy)|scattered]] by Neptune) by the DES.  Dwarf planet [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] is such a borderline classical cubewano/scatnear object.  {{mpl|(119951) 2002 KX|14}} may be an inner cubewano near the [[plutino]]s.  Furthermore, there is evidence that the Kuiper belt has an 'edge', in that an apparent lack of low-inclination objects beyond 47-49&amp;nbsp;AU was suspected as early as 1998 and shown with more data in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trujillo 2001&quot;&gt;[[Chadwick A. Trujillo]] and [[Michael E. Brown]]
''The Radial Distribution of the Kuiper Belt'', The Astrophysical Journal, '''554''' (2001), pp. L95–L98 [http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~chad/publications/2001-trujillo-brown.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the traditional usage of the terms is based on the orbit’s semi-major axis, and includes objects situated between the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances, that is between 39.4 and 47.8 AU (with exclusion of these resonances and the minor ones in-between).&lt;ref name=&quot;JewittDelsanti2006&quot;/&gt;

These definitions lack precision: in particular the boundary between the classical objects and the [[scattered disk]] remains blurred. As of 2010, there are 377 objects with perihelion (q) &gt; 40 AU and aphelion (Q) &lt; 47AU.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPL-SSD&quot;&gt;{{cite web
  |title=JPL Small-Body Database Search Engine

=== DES classification ===
Introduced by the report from the [[Deep Ecliptic Survey]] by J. L. Elliott ''et al.'' in 2005 uses formal criteria based on the mean orbital parameters.&lt;ref name=&quot;DES_Elliot2006&quot;/&gt; Put informally, the definition includes the objects that have never crossed the orbit of Neptune. According to this definition, an object qualifies as a classical KBO if:
*it is not [[Resonant Trans-Neptunian Object|resonant]]
*it has the average [[Tisserand's parameter]] exceeding 3
*its average eccentricity is less than 0.2.

=== SSBN07 classification ===

An alternative classification, introduced by [[Brett J. Gladman|B. Gladman]], [[Brian G. Marsden|B. Marsden]] and C. VanLaerhoven in 2007, uses 10 million years orbit integration instead of the Tisserand parameter. Classical objects are defined as not resonant and not being currently scattered by Neptune.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArizonaBook_Gladman2007&quot;&gt;

Formally, this definition includes as ''classical'' all objects with the ''current'' orbits that
*are non-resonant (see the [[Resonant_trans-Neptunian_object#Classification_methods|definition of the method]])
*have the semi-major axis greater than that of Neptune (i.e. excluding Centaurs) but less than 2000 AU (to exclude Inner Oort Cloud Objects)
*have the eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e &lt; 0.240&lt;/math&gt; (to exclude detached objects)
Unlike other schemes, this definition includes the objects with major semi-axis less than 39.4 AU (2:3 resonance) - named '''''Inner classical belt''''', or more than 48.7 (1:2 resonance) - named '''''Outer classical belt''''' while reserving the term '''''Main  classical belt''''' for the orbits between these two resonances.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArizonaBook_Gladman2007&quot;/&gt;

{{Politics of the United States}}
The '''foreign policy of the United States''' is the policy for which the United States interacts with foreign nations and sets standards of interaction for its organizations, corporations and individual citizens. The U.S. is highly influential in the world. The global reach of the United States is backed by a $15 trillion economy,&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2011/pdf/gdp4q10_adv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; approximately [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|a quarter of global GDP]], and a defense budget of $711 billion, which accounts for approximately [[List of countries by military expenditures|43% of global military spending]]. The [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] is the [[foreign minister]] and is the official charged with state-to-state diplomacy, although the [[President of the United States|president]] has ultimate authority over [[foreign policy]]; that policy includes defining the [[national interest]], as well as the strategies chosen both to safeguard that and to achieve its policy goals.

The officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States, as mentioned in the Foreign Policy Agenda of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], are &quot;to create a more secure, democratic, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/pub/ejournalusa/foreignpolagenda.html U.S. Dept of State - Foreign Policy Agenda]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] states as some of its jurisdictional goals: &quot;export controls, including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware; measures to foster commercial intercourse with foreign nations and to safeguard [[Economy of the United States|American business]] abroad; International commodity agreements; international education; and protection of American citizens abroad and [[expatriation]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/about.asp?nav=jurisdiction Committee on Foreign Affairs: U.S. House of Representatives]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. foreign policy and [[United States foreign aid|foreign aid]] have been the subject of much debate, praise and criticism both domestically and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0204-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if the [[WikiLeaks]] of 2010 would damage American relations with other countries, Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] noted that &quot;governments deal with the United States because it's in their interest, not because they like us, not because they trust us, and not because they believe we can keep secrets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in David Rieff, &quot;Wikileaks and the Cyberwars to Come,&quot; ''New Republic'' December 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers of the President and Congress==
{{Main|Treaty Clause|War Powers Clause|Appointments Clause|Commerce Clause|l4=Foreign Commerce Clause}}

Subject to the advise and consent role of the [[U.S. Senate]], the [[President of the United States]] negotiates treaties with foreign nations, but treaties enter into force only if ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 9, http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html&lt;/ref&gt; The President is also [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]], and as such has broad authority over the armed forces; however only Congress has authority to declare war,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the civilian and military budget is written by the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 7, http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Secretary of State]] is the [[foreign minister]] of the United States and is the primary conductor of state-to-state diplomacy. Both the Secretary of State and ambassadors are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Congress also has power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.

==Historical overview==
{{Main|History of U.S. foreign policy}}

[[File:Jay-treaty.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795 aligned the U.S. more with Britain  less with France, leading to political polarization at home]]

The main trend regarding the history of U.S. foreign policy since the American Revolution is the shift from [[isolationism]] before and after [[World War I]], to its growth as a world power and global [[hegemon]] during and since World War II and the end of the [[Cold War]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Herring, ''''From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, US foreign policy also has been characterized by a shift from the [[Political realism|realist school]] to the idealistic or [[Wilsonian]] school of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Russell, &quot;American Diplomatic Realism: A Tradition Practised and Preached by George F. Kennan,&quot; ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'', Nov 2000, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 159-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign policy themes were expressed considerably in [[George Washington]]'s [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]]; these included among other things, observing good faith and justice towards all nations and cultivating peace and harmony with all, excluding both &quot;inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others&quot;, &quot;steer[ing] clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world&quot;, and advocating trade with all nations. These policies became the basis of the [[Federalist Party]] in the 1790s. But the rival [[Jeffersonian Democracy|Jeffersonians]] feared Britain and favored France in the 1790s, declaring the [[War of 1812]] on Britain. After the 1778 alliance with France, the U.S. did not sign another permanent treaty until the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] in 1949. Over time, other themes, key goals, attitudes, or stances have been variously expressed by [[United States Presidential doctrines|Presidential 'doctrines']], named for them. Initially these were uncommon events, but since WWII, these have been made by most presidents.

Despite occasional entanglements with European Powers such as the [[War of 1812]] and the 1898 [[Spanish-American War]], U.S. foreign policy was marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade and scope during the 19th century, and it maintained its policy of avoiding wars with and between European powers. Concerning its domestic borders, the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] doubled the nation's geographical area; Spain ceded the territory of [[Florida]] in 1819; annexation brought Texas in 1845; a war with Mexico in 1848 added California, Arizona and New Mexico. The U.S. bought [[Alaska Purchase|Alaska]] from the Russian Empire in 1867, and it annexed the Republic of Hawaii in 1898. Victory over Spain in 1898 brought the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]], as well as oversight of Cuba. The short experiment in imperialism ended by 1908, as the U.S. turned its attention to the Panama Canal and the stabilization of regions to its south, including Mexico.

The 20th century was marked by two world wars in which the United States, along with allied powers, defeated its enemies and increased its international reputation. President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], developed from his idealistic [[Wilsonianism]] program of spreading democracy and fighting militarism so as to end wars. It became the basis of the German Armistice (really a surrender) and the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The resulting [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to European allies' punitive and territorial designs, showed insufficient conformity with these points and the U.S. signed separate treaties with each of its adversaries; due to Senate objections also, the U.S. never joined the [[League of Nations]], which was established as a result of Wilson's initiative. In the 1920s, the United States followed an independent course, and succeeded in a program of [[Washington Naval Conference|naval disarmament]], and [[Dawes Plan|refunding the German economy]]. New York became the financial capital of the world, but the downside was that the [[Crash of 1929]] hurled the entire world into the [[Great Depression]]. American trade policy relied on high tariffs under the Republicans, and reciprocal trade agreements under the Democrats, but in any case exports were at very low levels in the 1930s.

The United States adopted an isolationist foreign policy from 1932 to 1938, but then President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved toward strong support of the Allies in their wars against Germany and Japan. As a result of intense internal debate, the national policy was one of becoming the [[Arsenal of Democracy]], that is financing and equipping the Allied armies without sending American combat soldiers. Roosevelt mentioned four fundamental freedoms, which ought to be enjoyed by people &quot;everywhere in the world&quot;; these included the freedom of speech and religion, as well as freedom from want and fear. Roosevelt helped establish terms for a post-war world among potential allies at the [[Atlantic Charter|Atlantic Conference]]; [[Atlantic_Charter#Content|specific points]] were included to correct earlier failures, which became a step toward the [[United Nations]]. American policy was to threaten Japan, to force it out of China, and to prevent its attacking the Soviet Union. However, Japan reacted by an attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the United States was at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy. Instead of the loans given to allies in World War I, the United States provided Lend-Lease grants of $50,000,000,000. Working closely with [[Winston Churchill]] of Britain, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt sent his forces into the Pacific against Japan, then into North Africa against Italy and Germany, and finally into Europe starting with France and Italy in 1944 against the Germans. The American economy roared forward, doubling industrial production, and building vast quantities of airplanes, ships, tanks, munitions, and, finally, the atomic bomb. Much of the American war effort went to strategic bombers, which flattened the cities of Japan and Germany.

After the war, the U.S. rose to become the dominant non-colonial economic power with broad influence in much of the world. Almost immediately however, the world witnessed division into broad two camps during the [[Cold War]]; one side was led by the U.S., and the other by the Soviet Union, but this situation also led to the establishment of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. This period lasted until almost the end of the 20th century, and was characterized by ideological struggle.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} A policy of [[containment]] was adopted to limit Soviet expansion, and a series of proxy wars were fought with mixed results. In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved into separate nations, and the Cold War formally ended as the United States gave separate diplomatic recognition to the Russian Federation and other former Soviet states. With these changes to forty-five years of established diplomacy and military confrontation, new challenges confronted U.S. policymakers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} U.S. foreign policy is characterized still by a commitment to [[free trade]], protection of its national interests, and a concern for [[human rights]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

In the 21st century, U.S. influence remains strong but, in relative terms, is declining in terms of economic output compared to rising nations such as China, India, Russia, [[Brazil]], and the newly consolidated [[Europe|European Union]]. Substantial problems remain, such as [[climate change]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and the specter of [[nuclear terrorism]]. Foreign policy analysts Hachigian and Sutphen in their book ''The Next American Century'' suggest all six powers have similar vested interests in stability and terrorism prevention and trade; if they can find common ground, then the next decades may be marked by peaceful growth and prosperity.&lt;ref name=tws13jans3w2&gt;{{Cite news
|author= Nikolas K. Gvosdev
|title= FDR's Children
|quote= Hachigian ... and Sutphen ... recognize that the global balance of power is changing; that despite America's continued predominance, the other pivotal powers &quot;do challenge American dominance and impinge on the freedom of action the U.S. has come to enjoy and expect.&quot; Rather than focusing on the negatives, however, they believe that these six powers have the same vested interests: All are dependent on the free flow of goods around the world and all require global stability in order to ensure continued economic growth (and the prosperity it engenders).

==Law==
{{Main|Treaty|Treaty Clause}}
In the United States, there are three types of treaty-related law:

* '''Congressional-executive agreements''' are made by the [[President of the United States|president]] or [[United States Congress|Congress]]. When made by Congress, a majority of both houses makes it binding much like regular legislation. While the constitution does not expressly state that these agreements are allowed, and constitutional scholars such as [[Laurence Tribe]] think they're unconstitutional, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has upheld their validity.

* '''Executive agreements''' are made by the [[President of the United States|president]] alone.

* '''Treaties''' are formal written agreements specified by the [[Treaty Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The president makes a treaty with foreign powers, but then the proposed treaty must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. For example, President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] proposed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after World War I after consulting with allied powers, but this treaty was rejected by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]; as a result, the U.S. subsequently made separate agreements with different nations. While most international law has a broader interpretation of the term ''[[treaty]]'', the U.S. sense of the term is more restricted.

International law in most nations considers all three of the above agreements as ''[[Treaty|treaties]]''. In most nations, treaty laws supersede domestic law. So if there's a conflict between a treaty obligation and a domestic law, then the treaty usually prevails.

In contrast to most other nations, the United States considers the three types of agreements as distinct. Further, the United States incorporates treaty law into the body of U.S. federal law. As a result, [[United States Congress|Congress]] can modify or repeal treaties afterwards. It can overrule an agreed-upon treaty obligation even if this is seen as a violation of the treaty under international law. Several U.S. court rulings confirmed this understanding, including the 1900 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[The Paquete Habana|Paquete Habana]]'', a late 1950s decision in ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'', and a lower court ruling in 1986 in ''[[Garcia-Mir v. Meese]]''. Further, the Supreme Court has declared itself as having the power to rule a treaty as void by declaring it &quot;unconstitutional&quot;, although as of 2009, it has never exercised this power.

[[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] has taken the position that the Vienna convention represents established law. Generally when the U.S. signs a treaty, it is binding. However, because of the ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' decision, the U.S. adds a caveat to the text of every treaty that says, in effect, that the U.S. intends to abide by the treaty, but if the treaty is found to be in violation of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], then the U.S. legally can't abide by the treaty since the U.S. signature would be [[ultra vires]].

==Geography==
===NATO===
[[Image:USA military relations 2007.png|thumb|A map of allies of the United States&lt;br /&gt;
{{legend|#3300CC|[[NATO]] member states, including their colonies and overseas possessions}}
{{legend|#6666FF|[[Major non-NATO ally|Major non-NATO allies]], plus [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]]}}
{{legend|#99CCFF|Signatories of [[Partnership for Peace]] with NATO}}]]
The United States is a founding member of [[NATO]], the world's largest military alliance. The 28 nation alliance consists of Canada and much of Europe, including NATO's second largest military; the United Kingdom . Under the NATO charter, the United States is compelled to defend any NATO state that is attacked by a foreign power. NATO is restricted to within the North American and European areas. Starting in 1989, the United States also created a [[major non-NATO ally]] status (MNNA) for five nations; this number was increased in the late 1990s and following the [[September 11 attacks]]; it currently includes 14 nations. Each such state has a unique relationship with the United States, involving various military and economic partnerships and alliances.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|United Kingdom-United States relations}}
[[File:Barack &amp; Michelle Obama meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace 4-1-09.jpg|thumb|225px|left|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] welcomes President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to [[Buckingham Palace]] on April 1, 2009.]]
{{See|Special Relationship|Anglosphere}}
United States foreign policy affirms its alliance with the United Kingdom as its most important [[bilateral relationship]] in the world, evidenced by aligned political affairs between the [[White House]] and [[10 Downing Street]], as well as joint military operations carried out between the two nations. While both the United States and the United Kingdom maintain close relationships with many other nations around the world, the level of cooperation in military planning, execution of military operations, nuclear weapons technology, and intelligence sharing with each other has been described as &quot;unparalleled&quot; among major powers throughout the 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;wither&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last =James| first =Wither| year =2006| month =March| title =An Endangered Partnership: The Anglo-American Defence Relationship in the Early Twenty-first Century| journal =European Security| volume =15| issue =1| pages =47–65| doi =10.1080/09662830600776694| id ={{ISSN|0966-2839}}| accessdate =2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and Britain share the world's largest foreign direct investment partnership. American investment in the United Kingdom reached $255.4 billion in 2002, while British direct investment in the United States totaled $283.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of State, Background Note on the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[File:Barack Obama meets Stephen Harper.jpg|thumb|right|[[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] (right) and President Obama (left) meet in Ottawa in February 2009]]
{{Main|Canada-United States relations}}
The bilateral relationship between Canada and the United States is of fundamental importance to both countries. About 75–85% of Canadian trade is with the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, and chief supplier of oil. While there are disputed issues between the two nations, relations are close and the two countries famously share the &quot;[[Canada – United States border|world's longest undefended border]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Herd  Thompson, and Stephen J. Randall, ''Canada and the United States: Ambivalent Allies'' (4th ed. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2008) is the standard scholarly survey&lt;/ref&gt; The border was demilitarized after the [[War of 1812]] and, apart from minor raids, has remained peaceful. Military collaboration began during World War II and continued throughout the [[Cold War]] on both a bilateral basis and a multilateral relationship through [[NATO]]. A high volume of trade and migration between the United States and Canada since the 1850s has generated closer ties, despite continued Canadian fears of being culturally overwhelmed by its neighbor, which is ten times larger in terms of population and economy. The two economies have increasingly merged since the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) of 1994, which also includes Mexico.

===Mexico===
{{Main|Mexico-United States relations}}

The United States shares a unique and often complex relationship with Mexico. A history of armed conflict goes back to the [[Texas Revolution]] in the 1830s, the [[Mexican-American War]] in the 1840s, and an American invasion in the 1910s. Important treaties include the [[Gadsden Purchase]], and multilaterally with Canada, the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. The central issue in recent years has been illegal immigration, followed by illegal gun sales (from the U.S.), drug smuggling (to the U.S.) and escalating drug cartel violence just south of its border.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Padgett, &quot;Mexico's Calderón Needs to Listen, Not Just Lecture U.S.&quot; ''TIME'' May 19, 2010 [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1990176,00.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton Kirkwood, ''The History of Mexico'' (2010) pp 97-99, 138-52, 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Australia-United States relations}}
[[Image:Barack Obama &amp; Kevin Rudd in the Oval Office 3-24-09.JPG|thumb|left|[[Australian Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]], talks with President Obama in Washington ]]
The United States' relationship with Australia is a very close one, with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] stating that &quot;America doesn't have a better friend in the world than Australia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/25/2525854.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship is formalized by the [[ANZUS treaty]] and the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]].
The two countries have a shared history, both have previously been British Colonies and many Americans flocked to the [[Australian goldfields]] in the 19th century. At a strategic level, the relationship really came to prominence in World War II, when the two nations worked extremely closely in the [[Pacific war]] against Japan, with General [[Douglas MacArthur]] undertaking his role as Supreme Allied Commander based in Australia, effectively having Australian troops and resources under his command. During this period, the cultural interaction between Australia and the U.S. were elevated to a higher level as over 1 million U.S. military personnel moved through Australia during the course of the war. The relationship continued to evolve throughout the second half of the 20th Century, and today now involves strong relationships at the executive and mid levels of government and the military, leading [[Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs]], [[Kurt M. Campbell]] to declare that &quot;in the last ten years, [Australia] has ascended to one of the closest one or two allies [of the U.S.] on the planet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/q-and-a-news/q-guyon-espiner-interviews-kurt-campbell-3065958]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
{{See also|American intervention in the Middle East}}

The United States has seven major non-NATO allies in the [[Greater Middle East]] region. These allies are [[Saudi Arabia-United States relations|Saudi Arabia]], [[Foreign_relations_of_Egypt#United_States|Egypt]], [[Jordan - United States relations|Jordan]], [[Israel – United States relations|Israel]], [[Kuwait – United States relations|Kuwait]], [[Pakistan – United States relations|Pakistan]], and [[Morocco – United States relations|Morocco]]. Israel and Egypt are leading recipients of foreign aid, receiving 2.75 billion&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary.org&quot;&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/aid2010.html Congress Approves FY2010 Aid to Israel&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.75 billion&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; in 2010.

United States has invested several hundred billion dollars in re-building [[Iraq]]'s infrastructure and military in the aftermath of [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and other Global War on Terror Operations since 9/11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]] is host to approximately 90 [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s at [[Incirlik Air Base]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-206266-report-us-considers-withdrawing-nuclear-bombs-from-turkey.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other allies include [[Qatar]], where 3,500 US troops are based.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=130093&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. has built a non-NATO alliance with Pakistan to assist with the [[War in Afghanistan]] and jointly combat terror in the subcontinent.

===China===
{{Main|Sino-American relations}}

American relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] are complex. A great amount of trade between the two countries necessitates positive political relations, although periodic disagreements over tariffs and currency exchange rates do occur. China's status as a rising world power also strains relations, as many American conservatives see China as a long-term military rival. The U.S. criticizes China on human rights issues. Finally, the political status of Taiwan complicates relations, since the U.S. does not officially recognize the country, but in fact offers the island protection against the threat of any invasion from China.

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Republic of China – United States relations}}

[[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]), does not have official [[diplomatic relations]] recognized and is no longer officially recognized by the State Department of the United States, but it conducts unofficial diplomatic relations through their [[de facto]] embassy, commonly known as the &quot;[[American Institute in Taiwan]] (AIT)&quot;, and is considered to be a strong Asian ally and supporter of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, ed., ''Dangerous Strait: The U.S.-Taiwan-China Crisis'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Europe===
American relations with Eastern Europe are influenced by the legacy of the [[Cold War]]. Since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], former Communist-bloc states in Europe have gradually transitioned to democracy and capitalism. Many have also joined the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], strengthening economic ties with the broader Western world and gaining the military protection of the United States via the [[North Atlantic Treaty]].

===Kosovo===
{{Main|Kosovo – United States relations}}
The UN Security Council remains divided on the question of [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo declaration of independence]]. Kosovo declared its independence on February 17, 2008, which [[Serbia]] opposes. Of the five members with [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]], USA, UK, and France [[International reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|recognized]] the declaration of independence, and [[People's Republic of China|China]] has expressed concern, while Russia considers it [[International reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|illegal]]. &quot;In its declaration of independence, [[Kosovo]] committed itself to the highest standards of democracy, including freedom and tolerance and justice for citizens of all ethnic backgrounds&quot;, Bush said on February 19, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america.gov/st/peacesec-english/2008/February/20080219131902idybeekcm0.4052851.html Bush Hails Kosovo Independence], U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Information Programs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/11/balkans.usa Bush insists Kosovo must be independent and receives hero's welcome in Albania], The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hub and spoke vs multilateral===
While America's relationships with Europe have tended to be in terms of multilateral frameworks, such as NATO, America's relations with Asia have tended to be based on a series of bilateral relationships where the client states would coordinate with the United States in order to not have to deal directly with each other. On May 30, 2009, at the [[Shangri-La Dialogue]] Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged the nations of Asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they established and grew multilateral institutions such as [[ASEAN]], [[APEC]] and the ad hoc arrangements in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/05/mil-090530-afps03.htm Gates Delivers Keynote Address to Open Asia Security Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil==
=== Persian Gulf ===
{{See|Energy policy of the United States|Petroleum politics}}

The U.S. currently produces about 40% of the [[Petroleum|oil]] that it consumes; its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early 1990s. Since the U.S.'s [[oil consumption]] continues to rise, and its [[oil production]] continues to fall, this ratio may continue to decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html Crude Oil and Total Petroleum Imports Top 15 Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] identified dependence on imported oil as an urgent ''&quot;national security concern&quot;.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&amp;sid=ar4D7HVGikXo&amp;refer=top_world_news Bush Leverage With Russia, Iran, China Falls as Oil Prices Rise], Bloomberg.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-thirds of the world's proven [[oil reserves]] are estimated to be found in the
[[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E4D6123AF93AA15752C0A9649C8B63 Shrinking Our Presence in Saudi Arabia], New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/environment/alternative-energy/end-cheap-oil.html The End of Cheap Oil], National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its distance, the Persian Gulf region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United States during World War II. [[Petroleum]] is of central importance to modern armies, and the United States—as the world's leading oil producer at that time—supplied most of the oil for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies. Many U.S. strategists were concerned that the war would dangerously reduce the U.S. oil supply, and so they sought to establish good relations with [[Saudi Arabia]], a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] with large oil reserves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/oil/2005/crudedesigns.htm Crude Designs: The Rip-Off of Iraq’s Oil Wealth]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian Gulf region continued to be regarded as an area of vital importance to the United States during the [[Cold War]]. Three Cold War [[United States Presidential doctrines]]—the [[Truman Doctrine]], the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], and the [[Nixon Doctrine]]—played roles in the formulation of the [[Carter Doctrine]], which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its &quot;[[national interest]]s&quot; in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20874331/ The war is about oil but it's not that simple], msnbc.com&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's successor, President [[Ronald Reagan]], extended the policy in October 1981 with what is sometimes called the ''&quot;Reagan Corollary to the Carter Doctrine&quot;'', which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect Saudi Arabia, whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/dstorm/sword-shield.htm The United States Navy and the Persian Gulf]&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have argued that the implementation of the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Corollary also played a role in the outbreak of the [[Iraq War|2003 Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/996605.html What if the Chinese were to apply the Carter Doctrine?], Haaretz - Israel News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921819,00.html Selling the Carter Doctrine], TIME&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article2461214.ece Alan Greenspan claims Iraq war was really for oil], Times Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/20/iraq.oil Oil giants to sign contracts with Iraq], The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Almost all of Canada's energy exports go to the United States, making it the largest foreign source of U.S. energy imports: Canada is consistently among the top sources for U.S. oil imports, and it is the largest source of U.S. natural gas and electricity imports.&lt;ref&gt;See Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Canada/Background.html &quot;Canada&quot; (2009 report)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In 2007 the U.S. was [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s largest single export market accounting for 28.4% of exports (second in total to the EU at 31.4%). 81% of U.S. imports from this region were petroleum products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agoa.gov/resources/US_African_Trade_Profile_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign aid==
{{Main|United States foreign aid|United States Agency for International Development}}
Foreign assistance is a core component of the State Department's international affairs budget and is considered an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. There are four major categories of non-military foreign assistance: bilateral development aid, economic assistance supporting U.S. political and security goals, humanitarian aid, and multilateral economic contributions (for example,, contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/31987.pdf Foreign Aid: An Introductory Overview of U.S. Programs and Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In absolute dollar terms, the United States is the largest international aid donor ($22.7 billion in 2006), but as a percent of gross national income, its contribution is only 0.2%, proportionally much smaller than contributions of countries such as Sweden (1.04%) and the United Kingdom (0.52%){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. The [[USAID|U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance; the Treasury Department handles most multilateral aid.

Although the United States is the largest donor in absolute dollar terms, it is actually ranked 17 out of 22 countries on the [[Commitment to Development Index]]. The CDI ranks the 22 richest donor countries on their policies that affect the developing world. In the aid component the United States is penalized for low net aid volume as a share of the economy, a large share of [[tied aid|tied]] or partially tied aid, and a large share of aid given to less poor and relatively undemocratic governments.

==Military==
The United States has fought wars and intervened militarily on many occasions. See, [[Timeline of United States military operations]]. The U.S. also operates a vast network of military bases around the world. See, [[List of United States military bases]].

In recent years, the U.S. has used its military superiority as sole superpower to lead a number of wars, including, most recently, the invasion of [[Iraq]] in March 2003 as part of its global &quot;War on Terror.&quot;

===Aid===
{{Main|United States military aid|United States Foreign Military Financing|Foreign Military Sales}}
The [[United States military aid|U.S. provides military aid]] through many different channels. Counting the items that appear in the budget as '[[United States Foreign Military Financing|Foreign Military Financing]]' and '[[Plan Colombia]]', the U.S. spent approximately $4.5 billion in military aid in 2001, of which $2 billion went to [[Israel]], $1.3 billion went to [[Egypt]], and $1 billion went to [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/all-countries/colombia/us-military-aid-to-colombia/page.do?id=1101863&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[9/11]], [[Pakistan]] has received approximately $11.5 billion in direct military aid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=226110&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, according to Fox News, the U.S. had more than 700 military bases in 130 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Fox News, 1 November 2004 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2004/041101-iraq-basing.htm Analysts Ponder U.S. Basing in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missile defense===
{{Main|National missile defense|Strategic Defense Initiative}}
The [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) was a proposal by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] on March 23, 1983&lt;ref&gt;[[Federation of American Scientists]]. [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm Missile Defense Milestones]. Accessed March 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; to use ground and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[ballistic missile]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-obamas-chance-to-end-the--fantasy-that-is-star-wars-1015509.html Johann Hari: Obama's chance to end the fantasy that is Star Wars], The Independent, November 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; later dubbed ''&quot;Star Wars&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/22/documents/starwars.speech/ Historical Documents: Reagan's 'Star Wars' speech], CNN Cold War&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD). Though it was never fully developed or deployed, the research and technologies of SDI paved the way for some [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems of today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/missile-defense3.htm &quot;How Missile Defense Systems Will Work&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the U.S. started formal negotiations with Poland and [[Czech Republic]] concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] system&lt;ref name=&quot;news.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080823/ap_on_go_co/us_russia_missile_defense Missile defense backers now cite Russia threat]&lt;/ref&gt; (in April 2007, 57% of [[Poles]] opposed the plan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042400871.html U.S. Might Negotiate on Missile Defense], washingtonpost.com&lt;/ref&gt; According to press reports the government of the Czech Republic agreed (while 67% Czechs disagree)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvvm.cas.cz/upl/zpravy/100761s_pm80306.pdf Citizens on U.S. Anti-Missile Radar Base in Czech Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; to host a [[missile defense]] radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6704669.stm Europe diary: Missile defence], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/commentary/032907IHT.html Missile Defense: Avoiding a Crisis in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia threatened to place short-range [[nuclear missiles]] on the Russia's border with [[NATO]] if the United States refuses to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1569495/Russia-piles-pressure-on-EU-over-missile-shield.html Russia piles pressure on EU over missile shield], Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/05/23/asia/AS-GEN-China-Russia.php China, Russia sign nuclear deal, condemn U.S. missile defense plans], International Herald Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, Putin warned of a new [[Cold War]] if the Americans deployed the shield in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/11/usa.topstories3 Russia threatening new cold war over missile defence], The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under a [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] of 1987 with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-10-12-us-russia_N.htm U.S., Russia no closer on missile defense], USATODAY.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinion that U.S. intervention does not export democracy====
Professor Paul W. Drake argued that the U.S. first attempted to export [[democracy]] in [[Latin America]] through intervention from 1912 to 1932. Drake argued that this was contradictory because international law defines [[invasion|intervention]] as &quot;dictatorial interference in the affairs of another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things.&quot; The study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions, and can not be forcibly imposed. There was disagreement about what constituted ''[[democracy]]''; Drake suggested American leaders sometimes defined democracy in a narrow sense of a nation having elections; Drake suggested a broader understanding was needed. Further, there was disagreement about what constituted a &quot;rebellion&quot;; Drake saw a pattern in which the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] disapproved of any type of rebellion, even so-called &quot;revolutions&quot;, and in some instances rebellions against dictatorships.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowenthal |first=Abraham F. |date=March 1, 1991 |title=Exporting Democracy : The United States and Latin America |pages=1, 4, 5|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-4132-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter LaFeber]] stated, &quot;The world's leading revolutionary nation (the U.S.) in the eighteenth century became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Walter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lafeber |first=Walter |year=1993 |title=Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America |publisher=W.

[[Bruce Bueno de Mesquita|Mesquita]] and Downs evaluated 35 U.S. interventions from 1945 to 2004 and concluded that in only one case, [[Colombia]], did a &quot;full fledged, stable democracy&quot; develop within ten years following the intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why2&quot;&gt;Factors included limits on [[executive power]], clear rules for the transition of power, [[Universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]], and
competitive elections.&lt;/ref&gt; Samia Amin Pei argued that nation building in developed countries usually unravelled four to six years after American intervention ended. Pei, based on study of a database on worldwide democracies called ''[[Polity]]'', agreed with Mesquita and Downs that U.S. intervention efforts usually don't produce real democracies, and that most cases result in greater authoritarianism after ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Opinion that U.S. intervention has mixed results====
Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005, using [[Freedom House]] data. A plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country's democracy. In 69 instances the country became less democratic after the intervention. In the remaining 63 cases, a country became more democratic.&lt;ref name=&quot;operation&quot;/&gt;

====Opinion that U.S. intervention effectively exports democracy====
Hermann and Kegley found that American military interventions designed to protect or promote democracy increased freedom in those countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;promote&quot;/&gt; Penceny argued that the democracies created after military intervention are still closer to an [[autocracy]] than a [[democracy]], quoting Przeworski &quot;while some democracies are more democratic than others, unless offices are contested, no regime should be considered democratic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Covert actions==
{{See also|Covert U.S. regime change actions|Reagan Doctrine}}

United States foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple foreign governments that have been opposed to the United States. In 1953 the CIA, working with the British government, endorsed the military in a [[coup d'état]] against the anti-British government of [[Iran]] led by [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] who had attempted to [[nationalize]] Iran's oil, threatening the interests of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]].&lt;ref name=NYTsr2000&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Special Report: Secret History of the CIA in Iran|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html| ear=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Operation Ajax]].

==War on Drugs==
{{Main|War on Drugs}}
United States foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the U.S. government to control imports of illicit [[illegal drug trade|drugs]], including [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. This is especially true in Latin America, a focus for the U.S. [[War on Drugs]]. Those efforts date back to at least 1880, when the U.S. and China completed an agreement that [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibited]] the shipment of [[opium]] between the two countries.

Over a century later, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requires the President to identify the major drug transit or major illicit drug-producing countries. In September 2005 [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050915-2.html], the following countries were identified: [[Bahamas]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Burma]], [[Colombia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], India, [[Jamaica]], [[Laos]], Mexico, [[Nigeria]], Pakistan, [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. Two of these, Burma and Venezuela are countries that the U.S. considers to have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months. Notably absent from the 2005 list were [[Afghanistan]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Vietnam]]; Canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of [[MDMA]] destined for the United States and that large-scale cross-border trafficking of Canadian-grown cannabis continues. The U.S. believes that the Netherlands are successfully countering the production and flow of MDMA to the U.S.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of American foreign policy}}

Critics from the left cite episodes that undercut leftist governments or showed support for Israel. Others cite human rights abuses and violations of international law. Critics have charged that the [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] have used [[democracy]] to justify [[List of United States military history events|military intervention]] abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meernik 1996 391&quot;/&gt; It was also noted that the U.S. overthrew democratically elected governments in [[Operation Ajax|Iran]], [[Operation PBSUCCESS|Guatemala]], and in [[Covert U.S. Regime Change Actions|other instances]]. Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;operation&quot;/&gt; Until recently, scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been &quot;negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mark7&quot;/&gt; Other studies find [[List of United States military history events|U.S. intervention]] has had mixed results,&lt;ref name=&quot;operation&quot; /&gt; and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;promote&quot;/&gt;

==Support==
Regarding support for certain anti-Communist dictatorships during the [[Cold War]], a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil, with the alternatives even worse Communist or fundamentalist dictatorships. David Schmitz says this policy did not serve U.S. interests. Friendly tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center (though not in South Korea), while the '[[Political realism|realist]]' policy of coddling dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long memories.&lt;ref&gt;The United States and Right-Wing Dictatorships, 1965-1989. David F. Schmitz. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/12/11/do1102.xml&amp;sSheet=/opinion/2005/12/11/ixopinion.html Do the sums, then compare U.S. and Communist crimes from the Cold War] Telegraph, 11/12/2005, Niall Ferguson&lt;/ref&gt;

Many democracies have voluntary military ties with United States. See [[NATO]], [[ANZUS]], [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]], [[Mutual Defense Treaty]] with [[South Korea]], and [[Major non-NATO ally]]. Those nations with military alliances with the U.S. can spend less on the military since they can count on U.S. protection. This may give a false impression that the U.S. is less peaceful than those nations. [http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9266967] [http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/407850/all]

Research on the [[democratic peace theory]] has generally found that democracies, including the United States, have not made war on one another. There have been U.S. support for coups against some democracies, but for example [[Spencer R. Weart]] argues that part of the explanation was the perception, correct or not, that these states were turning into Communist dictatorships. Also important was the role of rarely transparent United States government agencies, who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Weart|first=Spencer R.|title=Never at War|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn= 0-300-07017-9 }}p. 221-224, 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical studies (see [[democide]]) have found that democracies, including the United States, have killed much fewer civilians than dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;DEATH BY GOVERNMENT By R.J. Rummel New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1994. Online links: [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM][http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.FIG23.4.GIF][http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.FIG2.GIF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ No Lessons Learned from the Holocaust?]'', Barbara Harff, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Media may be biased against the U.S. regarding reporting human rights violations. Studies have found that ''The New York Times'' coverage of worldwide human rights violations predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations.&lt;ref name=Caliendo1999&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Caliendo, S.M.|year=1999|title=All the News That's Fit to Print?

Finally, those nations with military alliances with the U.S. can spend less on the military and have a less active foreign policy since they can count on U.S. protection. This may give a false impression that the U.S. is less peaceful than those nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9266967 Give peace a rating] May 31, 2007, from ''The Economist'' print edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/407850/all Japan ranked as world's 5th most peaceful nation: report] Japan Today, May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Niall Ferguson]] argues that the U.S. is incorrectly blamed for all the human rights violations in nations they have supported. He writes that it is generally agreed that Guatemala was the worst of the US-backed regimes during the Cold War. However, the U.S. cannot credibly be blamed for all the 200,000 deaths during the long [[Guatemalan Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The U.S. Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations, that the U.S. helped stop a coup in 1993, and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciponline.org/iob.htm Report on the Guatemala Review] Intelligence Oversight Board. June 28, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the U.S. states that democratic nations best support U.S. national interests. According to the U.S. State Department, &quot;Democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others. Democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace, deter aggression, expand open markets, promote economic development, protect American citizens, combat international terrorism and crime, uphold human and worker rights, avoid humanitarian crises and refugee flows, improve the global environment, and protect human health.&quot; [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/democ/] According to former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], &quot;Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Clinton, Bill |title=1994 State Of The Union Address|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou94.htm|accessdate=2006-01-22 | work=The Washington Post | date=January 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one view mentioned by the U.S. State Department, democracy is also good for business. Countries that embrace political reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve the productivity of businesses. Accordingly, since the mid-1980s, under President [[Ronald Reagan]], there has been an increase in levels of foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative to countries that have not undertaken political reforms.

The United States officially maintains that it supports democracy and human rights through several tools [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/] Examples of these tools are as follows:
*A published yearly report by the State Department entitled &quot;Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The U.S. Record&quot; in compliance with a 2002 law (enacted and signed by President [[George W. Bush]], which requires the Department to report on actions taken by the U.S. Government to encourage respect for human rights. [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/shrd/]
*A yearly published &quot;Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.&quot; [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/]
*In 2006 (under President [[George W. Bush]]), the United States created a &quot;Human Rights Defenders Fund&quot; and &quot;Freedom Awards.&quot; [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/hr/c20063.htm]
*The &quot;Human Rights and Democracy Achievement Award&quot; recognizes the exceptional achievement of officers of foreign affairs agencies posted abroad. [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/77769.htm]
*The &quot;Ambassadorial Roundtable Series&quot;, created in 2006, are informal discussions between newly-confirmed U.S. [[Ambassador]]s and human rights and democracy non-governmental organizations. [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/hr/c18970.htm]
*The [[National Endowment for Democracy]], a private non-profit created by Congress in 1983 (and signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]], which is mostly funded by the U.S. Government and gives cash grants to strengthen democratic institutions around the world

'''[[Christmas]] in [[Poland]]''' is a major annual celebration, as in most countries of the Western world. The [[observance]] of Christmas developed gradually over the centuries, beginning in ancient times; combining old pagan customs with the religious ones introduced after the [[Christianization of Poland]] by the [[Catholic Church]]. Later influences include mutual permeating of local traditions and various folk cultures. Unlike in many other Christian countries, [[St. Nicholas]] does not play a major role in Polish Christmas, but instead, is celebrated on his Saint feast day of December 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmkamsterdam&quot; /&gt;

==Advent==
Among the special tasks carried out in private homes during [[Advent]] (a time of waiting for the celebration of the [[Nativity of Jesus]]) is the baking of the Christmas [[Pierniki|piernik]] (gingerbread), and the making of Christmas decorations. Pierniki are made in a variety of shapes, including hearts, animals, and St. Nicholas figures. Old traditional decorations include handmade stars, decorated eggshells, colorful paper garlands, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmkamsterdam&quot; /&gt;

Christmas Trees are decorated and lit in family rooms on the day of [[Christmas Eve]]. Other trees are placed in most public areas and outside churches. Traditionally the Christmas trees are decorated with hand blown glass [[bauble]]s, garlands, and many homemade [[Decorative arts|ornaments]] including shiny red apples, walnuts, wrapped chocolate shapes, and candles. At the top of the tree there is a star or a glittering [[tree topper|top piece]]. In many homes, [[sparkler]]s are hung on the branches of the trees for wintery ambiance. Sometimes the trees are left standing until February 2, the [[feast day]] of St. Mary of the Candle of Lightning.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmkamsterdam&quot; /&gt;

During Advent and all the way until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], or the [[baptism of Jesus]] (Sunday of January 6), the &quot;gwiazdory&quot;, or the star carriers walk through the villages. Some of them sing [[carols]]; others recite verses or put on &quot;szopki&quot; ([[puppet show]]s), or &quot;herody&quot; ([[nativity scene]]s). The last two customs are inspired by the traditional [[manger]] scenes or &quot;Jaselka&quot; ([[crib]]). One tradition unique to Poland is the sharing of the &quot;[[opłatek]]&quot;, a thin wafer into which a holy picture is pressed. In the old days people carried these wafers from house to house wishing their neighbors a Merry Christmas. Nowadays, opłatek is mostly shared with members of the family and immediate neighbors before the Christmas Eve supper ([[Wigilia]] in the Polish language). As each person shares pieces of the wafer with another, they are supposed to forgive each other any hurts that have occurred over the past year and wish them happiness in the coming year.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmkamsterdam&quot; /&gt;

==[[Wigilia]], the Christmas Eve supper==
[[File:Wigilia potrawy 554.jpg|thumb|Christmas Eve supper - dishes]]
[[File:04577 Christmas chocolate cakes, PL 2010.JPG|thumb|Christmas Eve deserts]]
In Poland, [[Christmas Eve]] is a day first of [[fasting]], then of feasting. The [[Wigilia]] feast begins at the appearance of the first star. There is no red meat served (except fish, usually [[carp]]). The supper, which includes many traditional dishes and deserts, can sometimes last for over an hour. It is followed by the exchange of gifts. The next day, the [[Christmas Day]], is often spent visiting friends. In Polish tradition, people combine religion and family closeness at Christmas. Although gift-giving plays a major role in the rituals, emphasis is placed more on the making of special foods and decorations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmkamsterdam&quot; /&gt;

On the night of Christmas Eve, so important is the appearance of the first star in remembrance of the [[Star of Bethlehem]], that it has been given an affectionate name of &quot;the little star&quot; or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, &quot;The star has come!&quot; Only after it appears, the family members sit down to a dinner table.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmkamsterdam&quot; /&gt; 

According to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a [[manger]]. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the table cloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table. In many homes an empty place setting is symbolically left at the table for the [[Baby Jesus]] or, for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, or if a deceased relative should come and would like to share in the meal. 

The supper begins with the breaking of the [[opłatek]]. Everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. They then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]], or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). 

A traditional Christmas meal in Poland includes fried [[carp]] and [[borscht]] (beetroot soup) with [[uszka]] (ravioli). Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; [[carp]] fillet, carp in [[aspic]] etc. Universal Polish Christmas foods are [[pierogi]] as well as some [[herring]] dishes, and for desert, [[makowiec_(pastry)|makowiec]] or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a [[compote]] of dry fruits for a drink. 

The remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that &quot;The Little Star&quot; brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.

Christmas Eve ends with [[Pasterka]], the [[midnight mass]] at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of  Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmkamsterdam&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080107101742/http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm  &quot;Boże Narodzenie i polskie tradycje,&quot;] Polska Misja Katolicka, Amsterdam {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kolędy, the Christmas carols==
[[Christmas carols]] are not celebrated in Poland until after the Christmas Vigil Mass. The Christmas season often runs until February 2nd. The early religious hymns sung in Catholic church were brought to Poland by the [[Franciscan Brothers of Peace|Franciscan Brothers]] already in the [[Middle Ages]]. The early Christmas music was Latin in origin. When the Polish words and melodies started to become popular, including many new secular [[pastoral]]s (pastoralka, or shepherd's songs), they were not written down originally, but rather taught among people by heart. Many of these early Polish carols were collected in 1838 by Rev. Hioduszewki in a book called ''Pastoralki i Koledy z Melodiami'' (Pastorals and Carols with Melodies).&lt;ref name=&quot;polishsite&quot;&gt;Lorraine Grochowsa Kiefer, [http://culture.polishsite.us/articles/art336.html Christmas Kolendy - Polish Carols], at culture.polishsite.us&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Carousel''''' is the second [[musical theater|stage musical]] by the team of [[Richard Rodgers]] (music) and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] (book and lyrics). The work premiered in 1945 and was adapted from [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s 1909 play ''[[Liliom]]'', transplanting its [[Budapest]] setting  to the [[Maine]] coastline.   The story revolves around &lt;!-- pun intended --&gt; carousel [[barker (occupation)|barker]] Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs.  He attempts a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; when it goes wrong, he has a chance to make things right.  A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow. The show includes the well-known songs &quot;[[If I Loved You]]&quot;, &quot;June Is Bustin' Out All Over&quot; and &quot;[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]&quot;.   Richard Rodgers later wrote that ''Carousel'' was his favorite among all his musicals.

Following the spectacular success of the first [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical, ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), the pair sought to collaborate on another piece, knowing that any resulting work would be compared with ''Oklahoma!'', most likely unfavorably.  They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to ''Liliom''; Molnár had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre.  After acquiring the rights, the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful.

The musical required considerable modification during out-of-town tryouts, but once it opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 19, 1945, it was an immediate hit with both critics and audiences.  ''Carousel'' initially ran for 890 performances and duplicated its success in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1950.  Though it has never achieved as much commercial success as ''Oklahoma!'', the piece has been repeatedly revived, and has been recorded several times.  A production by [[Nicholas Hytner]] enjoyed success in 1992 in London, in 1994 in New York and on tour.  In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named ''Carousel'' the best musical of the 20th century.

==Background==
===''Liliom''===
[[Ferenc Molnár]]'s Hungarian-language drama, ''[[Liliom]]'', premiered in [[Budapest]] in 1909.  The audience was puzzled  by the work, and it lasted only thirty-odd performances before being withdrawn, the first shadow on Molnár's successful career as a playwright.  ''Liliom'' was not presented again until after [[World War I]].  When it reappeared on the Budapest stage, it was a tremendous hit.&lt;ref&gt;Molnár, pp. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liliom offers Louise a star.jpg|thumb|right|200px|&quot;A star—please, my dear—I must do something good.&quot;  Liliom ([[Joseph Schildkraut]]) offers Louise (Evelyn Chard) the star he stole.  1921 [[Theatre Guild]] production.]]
Except for the ending, the plots of ''Liliom'' and ''Carousel'' are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  Andreas Zavocky (nicknamed Liliom, the Hungarian word for &quot;lily&quot;, a slang term for &quot;tough guy&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyland, p. 158&quot;&gt;Hyland, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; a carnival [[Barker (occupation)|barker]], falls in love with Julie Zeller, a servant girl, and they begin living together.  With both discharged from their jobs, Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie, but decides not to do so on learning that she is pregnant.  A subplot involves Julie's friend Marie, who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld, a soldier—after the two marry, he becomes the owner of a successful cafe.  Desperate to make money so that he, Julie and their child can escape to America and a better life, Liliom conspires with lowlife Ficsur to commit a robbery, but it goes badly, and Liliom stabs himself.  He dies, and his spirit is taken to heaven's police court.  As Ficsur suggested while the two waited to commit the crime, would-be robbers like them do not come before God himself.  Liliom is told by the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to redeem the wrongs he has done to his family, but must first spend sixteen years in a fiery purgatory.&lt;ref name = &quot;liliom&quot;/&gt;

On his return to Earth, he encounters his daughter, Louise, who like her mother is now a factory worker.  Saying that he knew her father, he tries to give her a star he stole from the heavens.  When Louise refuses to take it, he strikes her.  Not realizing who he is, Julie confronts him, but finds herself unable to be angry with him.  Liliom is ushered off to his fate, presumably Hell, and Louise asks her mother if it is possible to feel a hard slap as if it was a kiss.  Julie reminiscently tells her daughter that it is very possible for that to happen.&lt;ref name = &quot;liliom&quot;&gt;Molnár, pp. 1–185&lt;/ref&gt;

An English translation of ''Liliom'' was credited to [[Benjamin Glazer|Benjamin &quot;Barney&quot; Glazer]], though there is a story that the actual translator, uncredited, was  Rodgers' first major partner [[Lorenz Hart]].&lt;ref name = &quot;n153&quot;/&gt;  The [[Theatre Guild]] presented it in New York City in 1921, with [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as Liliom,&lt;ref name = &quot;n153&quot;/&gt; and the play was a success, running 300&amp;nbsp;performances.&lt;ref name = &quot;h38&quot;&gt;Hischak, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1940 revival, with [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] was seen by both Hammerstein and Rodgers.&lt;ref name = &quot;n153&quot;&gt;Nolan, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Glazer, in introducing the English translation of ''Liliom'', wrote of the play's appeal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she had always been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.&amp;nbsp;... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.&lt;ref&gt;Molnár, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Inception===
In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became well known for creating [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] hits with other partners.  Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, pp. 403–04&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre:  ''[[On Your Toes]]'' was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the &quot;[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]&quot; scene), while ''Pal Joey'' flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero.&lt;ref&gt;Block (ed.), pp. 194–95&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as ''[[Rose Marie (operetta)|Rose Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an [[Academy Award]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], &quot;[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]&quot;, which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOF&quot;&gt;[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 &quot;Oscar Hammerstein II&quot;].  Songwriters Hall of Fame. Retrieved on December 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and  prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.&lt;ref&gt;Layne, Joslyn. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84807|pure_url=yes}} Lorenz Hart Biography] at Allmusic. Retrieved on December 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan1&quot;&gt;Nolan, pp. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas Hischak states, in his ''The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia'', that ''Oklahoma!'' is &quot;the single most influential work in the American musical theatre.  In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before ''Oklahoma!'' and what came after it.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;h202&quot;&gt;Hischak, pp. 201–02&lt;/ref&gt;  An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, ''Oklahoma!'' would serve, according to Hischak, as &quot;the model for Broadway shows for decades&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;h202&quot;/&gt; and proved a huge popular and financial success.  Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair.  Movie producer [[Sam Goldwyn]] saw ''Oklahoma!'' and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers &quot;was Sam's blunt but funny way of telling me that I'd never create another show as good as ''Oklahoma!''&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;shoot&quot;&gt;Rodgers, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;  As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, &quot;We're such fools.  No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another ''Oklahoma!''' &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordin, p. 224&quot;&gt;Fordin, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oklahoma!'' had been a struggle to finance and produce.  Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with [[Theresa Helburn]] and [[Lawrence Langner]] of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed &quot;the Gloat Club&quot;.  At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Molnár's ''Liliom'' into a musical.  Both men refused—they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre.&lt;ref name = &quot;n153&quot;/&gt;  In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might need to change the setting from Hungary while in rehearsal.&lt;ref name = &quot;tunnel&quot;&gt;Fordin, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;  At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed ''Liliom'', suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]].  Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with &quot;zis&quot; and &quot;zose&quot; would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.&lt;ref name = &quot;tunnel&quot;/&gt;

A breakthrough came when Rodgers, who owned a house in [[Connecticut]], proposed a [[New England]] setting.&lt;ref name = &quot;h157&quot;&gt;Hyland, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammerstein wrote of this suggestion in 1945,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I began to see an attractive ensemble—sailors, whalers, girls who worked in the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans—a libel I was anxious to refute&amp;nbsp;... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest.  Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere.&lt;ref name = &quot;turn&quot;&gt;Hammerstein, Oscar II. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D11FE355B10728FDDAC0994DC405B8588F1D3&amp;scp=16&amp;sq=carousel&amp;st=p &quot;Turns on a Carousel; an account of adventures in setting the play 'Liliom' to music].  ''The New York Times'', April 15, 1945, Arts and Leisure, p. X1.  Retrieved on December 20, 2010.  Fee for article.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed &quot;the tunnel&quot; of Molnár's second act—a series of gloomy scenes leading up to Liliom's suicide—followed by a dark ending.  They also felt it would be difficult to set Liliom's motivation for the robbery to music.&lt;ref name = &quot;tunnel&quot;/&gt;  Molnár's opposition to having his works adapted was also an issue; he had famously turned down [[Giacomo Puccini]] when the great composer wished to transform ''Liliom'' into an opera, stating that he wanted the piece to be remembered as his, not Puccini's.&lt;ref name = &quot;n153&quot;/&gt;  In 1937, Molnár, who had recently emigrated to the United States, had declined another offer from [[Kurt Weill]] to adapt the play into a musical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyland, p. 158&quot;&gt;Hyland, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a ''Liliom'' adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944—writing the movie musical ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]''&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; and producing ''[[I Remember Mama]]'' on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, pp. 223–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Molnár to see ''Oklahoma!''  Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt ''Liliom'' as beautifully as they had modified ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play) | Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' into ''Oklahoma!'', he would be pleased to have them do it.&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, pp. 221–22&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guild obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943.  The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for &quot;personal services&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, pp. 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Molnár permit them to make changes in the plot.  At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded.  Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, &quot;we could never have made ''Carousel''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

In seeking to establish through song Liliom's motivation for the robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in ''Pal Joey''.  Rodgers and Hart had  overcome the problem  with a song that Joey sings to himself, &quot;I'm Talking to My Pal&quot;.  This inspired &quot;[[Soliloquy (song)|Soliloquy]]&quot;.  Both partners later told a story that &quot;Soliloquy&quot; was only intended to be a song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl.  However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: &quot;Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;edsel&quot;&gt;Fordin, pp. 156–57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liliom prologue.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The opening carnival scene in ''Liliom'' inspired the [[Mime artist|pantomime]] that begins ''Carousel''.  1921 Theatre Guild production.]]
Hammerstein and Rodgers returned to the ''Liliom'' project in mid-1944.  Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing that no matter what they did, Molnár would disapprove of the results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordin, p. 224&quot;/&gt;  ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' had been a little-known work; ''Liliom'' was a theatrical standard.  Molnár's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society.  On a character level, a dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyland, p. 158&quot;/&gt;  Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers.  He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in ''Liliom''; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge.&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, pp. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;This Was a Real Nice Clambake&quot; was repurposed from a song, &quot;A Real Nice Hayride&quot;, written for ''Oklahoma!'' but not used.&lt;ref name = &quot;b162&quot;&gt;Block, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Molnár's ending was unsuitable, and after a couple of false starts, Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the musical.  According to [[Frederick Nolan]] in his book on the team's works: &quot;From that scene the song &quot;[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]&quot; sprang almost naturally.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;n157&quot;&gt;Nolan, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of Hammerstein's simple lyrics for &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot;, Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to music.&lt;ref&gt;Block (ed.), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Liliom'' was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other people.  The way Molnár wrote it, the man ends up hitting his daughter and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless.  We couldn't accept that.  The way we ended ''Carousel'' it may still be a tragedy but it's a hopeful one because in the final scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others.&lt;ref&gt;Block (ed.), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the pair decided to make &quot;This Was a Real Nice Clambake&quot; into an ensemble number, Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake was like, and researched the matter.  Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, &quot;First came codfish chowder&quot;.  However, further research convinced him the proper term was &quot;codhead chowder&quot;, a term unfamiliar to many playgoers.  He decided to keep it as &quot;codfish&quot;.  When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line &quot;We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good&quot;.  He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front.  The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back.  Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back.  One error not caught involved the song &quot;June Is Bustin' Out All Over&quot;, in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring—they actually do so in the winter.  Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodgers early decided to dispense with an overture, feeling that the music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  In his autobiography, Rodgers complained that only the brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never enough strings in a musical's small orchestra.  He determined to force the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a [[Mime artist|pantomime]] scene accompanied by what became known as &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  The pantomime paralleled one in the Molnár play, which was also used to introduce the characters and situation to the audience.&lt;ref name = &quot;h161&quot;/&gt; Author [[Ethan Mordden]] described the effectiveness of this opening:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Other characters catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, the widow who runs the carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat.  But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the rhythm of Billy's spiel.  And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R &amp; H have not only skipped the overture ''and'' the opening number but the exposition as well.  They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.&lt;ref&gt;Mordden, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Casting and tryouts===
The casting for ''Carousel'' began when ''Oklahoma!'''s production team, including Rodgers and Hammerstein, was seeking a replacement for the part of Curly (the male lead in ''Oklahoma!'').  Lawrence Langner had heard, through a relative, of a California singer named [[John Raitt]], who might be suitable for the part.  Langner went to hear Raitt, then urged the others to bring Raitt to New York for an audition.  Raitt asked to sing ''[[Largo al factotum]]'', Figaro's song from ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'', to warm up.  The warmup was sufficient to convince the producers that not only had they found a Curly, they had found a Liliom (or Billy Bigelow, as the part was renamed).&lt;ref name=&quot;Block ed., p. 122&quot;&gt;Block (ed.), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Theresa Hepburn made another California discovery, [[Jan Clayton]], a singer/actress who had made a few minor films for [[MGM]].  She was brought east and successfully auditioned for the part of Julie.&lt;ref name = &quot;n157&quot;/&gt;

The producers sought to cast unknowns.  Though many had played in previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works, only one, Jean Casto (cast as carousel owner Mrs. Mullin, and a veteran of ''Pal Joey''), had ever played on Broadway before.&lt;ref name = &quot;n157&quot;&gt;Nolan, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  It proved harder to cast the ensemble than the leads, due to the war—Rodgers told his casting director, [[John Fearnley]], that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be alive.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative team that had made ''Oklahoma!'' a success, including director [[Rouben Mamoulian]] and choreographer [[Agnes de Mille]].   [[Miles White]] was the costume designer while [[Jo Mielziner]] (who had not worked on ''Oklahoma!'') was the scenic and lighting designer.  Even though ''Oklahoma!'' orchestrator [[Russell Bennett]] had informed Rodgers that he was unavailable to work on ''Carousel'' due to a radio contract, Rodgers insisted he do the work in his spare time.  He orchestrated &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot; and &quot;(When I Marry) Mister Snow&quot; before finally being replaced by [[Don Walker (orchestrator)|Don Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  A new member of the creative team was [[Trude Rittman]], who arranged the dance music.  Rittman initially felt that Rodgers mistrusted her because she was a woman, and found him difficult to work with, but the two worked together on Rodgers' shows until the 1970s.&lt;ref name = &quot;h161&quot;&gt;Hyland, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hammerstein.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of Hammerstein in middle age, seated, wearing a suit|Oscar Hammerstein II]]
Rehearsals began in January 1945;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyland, p. 158&quot;/&gt; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present.&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Raitt was presented with the lyrics for &quot;Soliloquy&quot; on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes.  Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he felt that they were never fully addressed.&lt;ref name = &quot;god&quot;&gt;Secrest, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play.  There are a number of variations on the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Block ed., p. 122&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fordin, pp. 231–32&lt;/ref&gt;  As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár in the rear of the theatre and whispered the news to his partner.  Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right.  At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár.  Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, &quot;What you have done is so beautiful.  And you know what I like best?  The ending!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, pp. 240–41&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.&lt;ref name = &quot;turn&quot;/&gt;

Like most of the pair's works, ''Carousel'' contains a lengthy ballet, &quot;Billy Makes a Journey&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; in the second act, as Billy looks down to the Earth from &quot;Up There&quot; and observes his daughter.  In the original production, and in the film, the ballet was choreographed by de Mille.&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;  As originally written, de Mille's ballet lasted an hour and fifteen minutes.  It began with Billy looking down from heaven at his wife in labor, with the village women gathered for a &quot;birthing&quot;.  The ballet involved every character in the play, some of whom spoke lines of dialogue, and contained a number of subplots.  The focus was on Louise, played by [[Bambi Linn]], who at first almost soars in her dance, expressing the innocence of childhood.  She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates, and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people, who symbolize Billy's world.  A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce Louise, as she discovers her own sexuality, but he decides she is more girl than woman, and he leaves her.  After Julie comforts her, Louise goes to a children's party, where she is shunned.  The carnival people reappear and form a ring around the children's party, with Louise lost between the two groups.  At the end, the performers form a huge carousel with their bodies.&lt;ref name = &quot;agnes&quot;&gt;Easton, pp. 243–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play opened for tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] on March 22, 1945.  The first act was well-received; the second act was not.&lt;ref name = &quot;f233&quot;&gt;Fordin, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;  Casto recalled that the second act finished about 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name = &quot;n157&quot;/&gt;  The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference.  Five scenes, half a ballet and two songs were cut from the show as the result.  John Fearnley commented, &quot;Now I see why these people have hits.  I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;f233&quot;/&gt;  De Mille said of this conference, &quot;not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished.  Nor was there any idle joking.&amp;nbsp;... We cut and cut and cut and then we went to bed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Block (ed.), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.&lt;ref name = &quot;agnes&quot;/&gt;

A major concern with the second act was the effectiveness of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers &quot;Mr. and Mrs. God&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; depicted as a New England minister and his wife,&lt;ref&gt;Block (ed.), p. 129.  At this time, according to the cast sheet distributed during the Boston run, Dr. Seldon was listed as the &quot;Minister&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; before whom Billy appears after his death.  Mr. and Mrs. God were seen in a New England parlor.&lt;ref name = &quot;god&quot;/&gt;  The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening.&lt;ref name = &quot;god&quot;/&gt;  Rodgers said to Hammerstein, &quot;We've got to get God out of that parlor&quot;.  When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, &quot;I don't care where you put Him.  Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!&quot;  Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder,&lt;ref&gt;Block, pp. 161–62&lt;/ref&gt; and Mrs. God was removed from the show.&lt;ref name = &quot;god&quot;/&gt;  Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by ''[[The New Republic]]'' as &quot;a [[Rotary International|Rotarian]] atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;god&quot;/&gt;

Hammerstein wrote that Molnár's advice, to combine two scenes into one, was key to pulling together the second act and represented &quot;a more radical departure from the original than any change we had made&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;turn&quot;/&gt;  A reprise of &quot;If I Loved You&quot; was added in the second act, which Rodgers felt needed more music.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Three weeks of tryouts in Boston followed the brief New Haven run, and the audience there gave the musical a warm reception.&lt;ref name = &quot;f233&quot;/&gt;  An even shorter version of the ballet was presented the final two weeks in Boston, but on the final night there, de Mille expanded it back to forty minutes, and it brought the house down, causing both Rodgers and Hammerstein to embrace her.&lt;ref name = &quot;agnes&quot;/&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
Two young female millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's carousel after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts the attention of the barker, Billy Bigelow (&quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot;).  Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return, as Julie let Billy (whom Mrs. Mullin fancies) put his arm around her during the ride. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin.  Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her and is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a beer.  As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie for her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive (&quot;You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan&quot;). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow (&quot;(When I Marry) Mister Snow&quot;).  Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by and warns Julie that Billy has taken money from other women. Bascombe offers to take Julie home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses the growing attraction they feel for each other (&quot;[[If I Loved You]]&quot;).

A month passes, and preparations for the spring clambake are under way (&quot;June Is Bustin' Out All Over&quot;). Julie and Billy, now married, live at Julie's cousin Nettie's spa.  Julie confides in Carrie that Billy, frustrated over being unemployed, slapped Julie. Carrie has happier news&amp;mdash;she is engaged to Enoch, who promptly arrives.  Billy enters with his ne'er-do-well whaler friend, Jigger.  The ex-barker is openly rude to Enoch and Julie.  He leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie.  Enoch tells Carrie that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large family with Carrie (&quot;When the Children Are Asleep&quot;).

Jigger and his shipmates sing of life on the sea (&quot;Blow High, Blow Low&quot;).  The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim—Julie's former boss, Mr. Bascombe—might have to be killed.  Mrs. Mullin tries to tempt Billy back to the carousel (and to her).  He would have to abandon Julie; no married barker can match the sexual tension of an unmarried one.  Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and Mrs. Mullin leaves.  Julie tells him she is pregnant.  Billy is overwhelmed with happiness by the news, ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel.  Billy, now alone on stage, imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr.—until he realizes that child might be a girl, and &quot;you've got to be a ''father'' to a girl&quot; (&quot;[[Soliloquy (song)|Soliloquy]]&quot;).  Determined to provide financially for his future child, Billy decides to be Jigger's accomplice.

The whole town leaves for the clambake. Billy agrees to join in, as he realizes that being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jigger's alibi.  Julie is delighted that he will accompany her (&quot;Act I Finale&quot;).

===Act 2===
Everyone reminisces about the huge meal and much fun (&quot;This Was a Real Nice Clambake&quot;).  Jigger tries to seduce Carrie.  Enoch walks in at the wrong moment, seeing Carrie in Jigger's arms, and declares that he is finished with her (&quot;Geraniums In the Winder&quot;), as Jigger jeers (&quot;There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman&quot;). The girls try to comfort Carrie, saying all men are bad.  For Julie, however, all that matters is that &quot;he's your feller and you love him&quot; (&quot;What's the Use of Wond'rin'?&quot;).  Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, she feels the knife hidden in his shirt.  She begs him to give it to her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.

As they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards.  They stake their shares of the anticipated robbery spoils. Billy loses: his participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger, Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mill's money.  The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in time for him to say his last words to her and die.  Julie strokes his hair, finally able to tell him that she loved him.  Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair (&quot;[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]&quot;).

Billy's defiant spirit (&quot;The Highest Judge of All&quot;) is taken Up There&lt;!-- as described in the libretto --&gt; to see the Starkeeper, a heavenly official.  The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to do good to redeem himself.  He informs Billy that fifteen years have now passed on Earth since the former barker's suicide, and suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he does something to help his daughter, Louise.  He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: &quot;Billy Makes a Journey&quot;). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter.  The local children mock her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater.  In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young.  The dance concludes, and Billy decides to return to Earth to help his daughter.  He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.

Outside Julie's cottage, Carrie describes her visit to New York with the now-wealthy Enoch.  Carrie's husband and their many children enter to fetch her—the family must get ready for the high school graduation later that day.  Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind  to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters.  Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe.  He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged:  each insults the other's father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away.  Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise; he pretends to be a friend of her father.  He offers her a gift—the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her.  As he makes himself invisible, Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly.

Billy invisibly attends Louise's graduation, hoping for one last chance to help his daughter and redeem himself. The beloved town physician, Dr. Seldon (who resembles the Starkeeper) advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents' success or be held back by their failure (words directed at Louise).  Seldon prompts everyone to sing an old song, &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot;.  Billy, still invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldon's words, and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns she does not have to be an outcast.  Billy goes to Julie, telling her at last that he loved her.  As his widow and daughter join in the singing, Billy is taken to his heavenly reward.

==Productions==
===Early productions===
The original Broadway production opened at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] on April 19, 1945.  The [[dress rehearsal]] the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well-received.&lt;ref name = &quot;r243&quot;/&gt;  One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime.  The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working.&lt;ref name = &quot;agnes&quot;/&gt;  Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain.  Sedated with morphine, he could see only part of the stage.  As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure.  It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause.&lt;ref name = &quot;r243&quot;&gt;Rodgers, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bambi Linn]], who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow.  Rodgers' daughter [[Mary Rodgers|Mary]] caught sight of her friend, [[Stephen Sondheim]], across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.&lt;ref name = &quot;f233&quot;/&gt;

The original production ran for 890 performances, closing on May 24, 1947.  The original cast included [[John Raitt]] (Billy), [[Jan Clayton]] (Julie), [[Jean Darling]] (Carrie), Eric Mattson (Enoch Snow), [[Christine Johnson (actress)|Christine Johnson]] (Nettie Fowler), [[Murvyn Vye]] (Jigger), Bambi Linn (Louise) and Russell Collins (Starkeeper).  In December 1945, Clayton left to star in the Broadway revival of ''[[Show Boat]]'' and was replaced by [[Iva Withers]]; Raitt was replaced by Henry Michel in January 1947.&lt;ref name = &quot;enc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

After closing on Broadway, the show went on a national tour for two years.  It played for five months in Chicago alone, visited twenty states and two Canadian cities, covered {{convert|15000|mi}} and played to nearly two million people. The touring company had a four-week run at [[New York City Center]] in January 1949.&lt;ref name = &quot;lou&quot;&gt;Calta, Louis.

The musical premiered in the [[West End theatre|West End]], London, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] on June 7, 1950. The production was restaged by Jerome Whyte, with a cast that included [[Stephen Douglass]] (Billy), Iva Withers (Julie) and Margot Moser (Carrie).  ''Carousel'' ran in London for 566 performances, remaining there for over a year and a half.&lt;ref name =&quot;enc&quot;&gt;Green, Stanley.

===Subsequent productions===
''Carousel'' was revived in 1954 and 1957 at City Center, presented by the New York City Center Light Opera Company.  Both times, the production featured [[Barbara Cook]], though she played Carrie in 1954 and Julie in 1957 (playing alongside [[Howard Keel]] as Billy).  The production was then taken to Belgium to be performed at the [[1958 Brussels World's Fair]], with Clayton reprising the role of Julie, which she had originated.&lt;ref name = &quot;h40&quot;/&gt;

In August 1965, Rodgers and the Music Theater of [[Lincoln Center]] produced ''Carousel'' for 47 performances. [[John Raitt]] reprised the role of Billy, with [[Jerry Orbach]] as Jigger. The roles of the Starkeeper and Dr. Seldon were played by [[Edward Everett Horton]] in his final stage appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven.

[[Nicholas Hytner]] directed a new production of ''Carousel'' in 1992, at London's [[Royal National Theatre]], with choreography by Sir [[Kenneth MacMillan]] and designs by [[Bob Crowley]].

After work ends, they move to the shipyards and then to the carnival.&lt;ref name=&quot;h40&quot;&gt;Hischak, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  As they proceed on a revolving stage, carnival characters appear, and at last the carousel is assembled onstage for the girls to ride.&lt;ref name = &quot;94review&quot;&gt;Richards, David.

A film version of the musical was made in 1956, starring [[Gordon MacRae]] and [[Shirley Jones]].  It follows the musical's story fairly closely, although a prologue, set in the Starkeeper's heaven, was added.  The film was released only a few months after the release of [[Oklahoma! (film)|the film version of ''Oklahoma!'']].  It garnered some good reviews and&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' called the movie a &quot;beautifully turned out film, crisply played and richly sung by a fine cast that is fully worthy of the original show&quot;.

As the same stars appeared in both pictures, however, the two films were often compared, generally to the disadvantage of ''Carousel''.  Thomas Hischak, in his ''The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia'', later wondered &quot;if the smaller number of ''Carousel'' stage revivals is the product of this often-lumbering &lt;nowiki&gt;[movie]&lt;/nowiki&gt; musical&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;film&quot;&gt;Hischak, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an abridged (100 minute) 1967 [[ABC Television|network television version]] that starred [[Robert Goulet]], with choreography by [[Edward Villella]].&lt;ref name = &quot;film&quot;/&gt;

==Music and recordings==
===Musical treatment===
Rodgers designed ''Carousel'' to be an almost continuous stream of music, especially in Act 1.  In later years, Rodgers was asked if he had considered writing an opera.  He stated that he had been sorely tempted to, but saw ''Carousel'' in operatic terms.  He remembered, &quot;We came very close to opera in the Majestic Theatre.&amp;nbsp;... There's much that is operatic in the music.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;stream&quot;&gt;Secrest, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rodgers.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of Rodgers, in middle age, seated in a theatre, wearing a suit and holding a cigarette|Richard Rodgers]]
Rodgers uses music in ''Carousel'' in subtle ways to differentiate characters and tell the audience of their emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Block, pp. 164–65&lt;/ref&gt;  In &quot;You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan&quot;, the music for the placid Carrie is characterized by even [[Modern musical symbols|eighth-note rhythms]], whereas the emotionally restless Julie's music is marked by dotted eighths and sixteenths; this rhythm will characterize her throughout the show.  When Billy whistles a snatch of the song, he selects Julie's dotted notes rather than Carrie's.&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting the close association in the music between Julie and the as-yet unborn Louise, when Billy sings in &quot;Soliloquy&quot; of his daughter, who &quot;gets hungry every night&quot;, he uses Julie's dotted rhythms.   Such rhythms also characterize Julie's Act 2 song, &quot;What's the Use of Wond'rin'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;  The stable love between Enoch and Carrie is strengthened by her willingness to let Enoch not only plan his entire life, but hers as well.  This is reflected in &quot;When the Children Are Asleep&quot;, where the two sing in close harmony, but Enoch musically interrupts his intended's turn at the chorus with the words &quot;Dreams that won't be interrupted&quot;.  Rodgers biographer Geoffrey Block, in his book on the Broadway musical, points out that though Billy may strike his wife, he allows her musical themes to become a part of him and never interrupts her music.&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  Block suggests that, as reprehensible as Billy may be for his actions, Enoch requiring Carrie to act as &quot;the little woman&quot;, and his having nine children with her (more than she had found acceptable in &quot;When the Children are Asleep&quot;) can be considered to be even more abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Block, pp. 174–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The twelve-minute &quot;bench scene&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;h129&quot;&gt;Hischak, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; in which Billy and Julie get to know each other and which culminates with &quot;[[If I Loved You]]&quot;, according to Hischak, &quot;is considered the most completely integrated piece of music-drama in the American musical theatre&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;h38&quot;/&gt;  The scene is almost entirely drawn from Molnár and is one extended musical piece; [[Stephen Sondheim]] described it as &quot;probably the single most important moment in the revolution of contemporary musicals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;If I Loved You&quot; has been recorded many times, by such diverse artists as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Barbara Streisand]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Mario Lanza]] and [[Chad and Jeremy]].&lt;ref name = &quot;h129&quot;/&gt;  The D-flat major theme that dominates the music for the second act ballet seems like a new melody to many audience members.  It is, however, a greatly expanded development of a theme heard during &quot;Soliloquy&quot; at the line &quot;I guess he'll call me 'The old man'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mordden, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shankly Gates.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Shankly Gates at [[Anfield]], [[Liverpool F.C.]]'s stadium.]]
When the pair discussed the song that would become &quot;Soliloquy&quot;, Rodgers improvised at the piano to give Hammerstein an idea of how he envisioned the song.  When Hammerstein presented his collaborator with the lyrics after two weeks of work (Hammerstein always wrote the words first, then Rodgers would write the melodies), Rodgers wrote the music for the eight-minute song in two hours.&lt;ref name = &quot;eight&quot;&gt;Fordin, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;What's the Use of Wond'rin'&quot;, one of Julie's songs, worked well in the show but was never as popular on the radio or for recording, and Hammerstein believed that the lack of popularity was because he had concluded the final line, &quot;And all the rest is talk&quot; with a hard consonant, which does not allow the singer a vocal climax.&lt;ref name = &quot;eight&quot;/&gt;

[[Irving Berlin]] later stated that &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; had the same sort of effect on him as [[Psalm 23|the 23rd Psalm]].&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  When singer [[Mel Tormé]] told Rodgers that &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; had made him cry, Rodgers nodded impatiently.  &quot;You're supposed to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  The frequently-recorded song has become a universally accepted hymn.&lt;ref name=Bradley79&gt;Bradley, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  The cast album of ''Carousel'' proved popular in Liverpool, like many Broadway albums, and in 1963, the [[Brian Epstein]]-managed band, [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]] had a number-one hit with the song.  At the time, the top ten hits would be played before [[Liverpool F.C.]] home matches; even after &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; dropped out of the top ten, fans continued to sing it, and it has become closely associated with the soccer team&lt;!-- This an article on an American musical uses American terminology --&gt; and the city of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;Coslet, Paul.

===Recordings===
The [[cast album]] of the 1945 Broadway production was issued on [[Gramophone record|78s]], and the score was significantly cut—as was the 1950 London cast recording.&lt;ref name = &quot;record&quot;/&gt;  Theatre historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]] notes that a number of songs had to be abridged to fit the 78 format, but that there is a small part of &quot;Soliloquy&quot; found on no other recording, as Rodgers cut it from the score immediately after the studio recording was made.&lt;ref name = &quot;ken&quot;&gt;Kenrick, John.  [http://www.musicals101.com/cdcomps2.htm Comparative CD reviews—''Carousel''].  Musicals101.com.  Retrieved on December 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of songs were cut for the movie and for the soundtrack.  When the soundtrack was reissued on CD, those cut songs which had been recorded were included.  The recording of the 1965 Lincoln Center revival was the first recording of ''Carousel'' in stereo and featured Raitt in the role of Billy, which he had originated.  Studio recordings of ''Carousel'''s songs were released in 1956 (with [[Robert Merrill]] as Billy and [[Florence Henderson]] as Nettie), 1962 and 1987.  The last featured a mix of opera and musical stars, including [[Samuel Ramey]], [[Barbara Cook]] and [[Sarah Brightman]].&lt;ref name = &quot;record&quot;/&gt;  Kenrick recommends the 1962 studio recording, though it is not yet available on CD, for its outstanding cast, including [[Alfred Drake]] and [[Roberta Peters]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ken&quot;/&gt;

Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner production contain portions of dialogue that, according to Hischak, speak to the power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy.&lt;ref name = &quot;record&quot;&gt;Hischack, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of ''Carousel'' on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard).&lt;ref name = &quot;ken&quot;/&gt;

==Critical reception and legacy==
The musical received almost unanimous rave reviews after its opening in 1945.  According to Hischak, reviews were not as exuberant as for ''Oklahoma!'' as the critics were not taken by surprise this time.  John Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' termed it &quot;one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;h39&quot;&gt;Hischak, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'''s reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that &quot;Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who can do no wrong, have continued doing no wrong in adapting ''Liliom'' into a musical play.  Their ''Carousel'' is on the whole delightful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Lewis.

When the musical returned to New York in 1949, ''The New York Times'' reviewer [[Brooks Atkinson]] described ''Carousel'' as &quot;a conspicuously superior musical play&amp;nbsp;... ''Carousel'', which was warmly appreciated when it opened, seems like nothing less than a masterpiece now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Brooks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Carousel'' has no comment to make on anything of topical importance.  The theme is timeless and universal:  the devotion of two people who love each other through thick and thin, complicated in this case by the wayward personality of the man, who cannot fulfill the responsibilities he has assumed. &amp;nbsp;... Billy is a bum, but ''Carousel'' recognizes the decency of his motives and admires his independence.  There are no slick solutions in ''Carousel''.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Brooks.

Stephen Sondheim noted the duo's ability to take the innovations of ''Oklahoma!'' and apply them to a serious setting: &quot;''Oklahoma!'' is about a picnic, ''Carousel'' is about life and death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Another view was advanced by critic and writer [[Eric Bentley]], who disliked the ending, stating, &quot;the last scene of ''Carousel'' is an impertinence:  I refuse to be lectured to by a musical comedy scriptwriter on the education of children, the nature of the good life, and the contribution of the American small town to the salvation of souls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Block (ed.), pp.161–62&lt;/ref&gt;

''New York Times'' critic [[Frank Rich]] said of the 1992 London production: &quot;What is remarkable about Mr. Hytner's direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, is its ability to make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rich&quot;&gt;Rich, Frank.

Rodgers considered ''Carousel'' his favorite of all his musicals and wrote, &quot;it affects me deeply every time I see it performed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;r243&quot;/&gt;  In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in its &quot;Best of the Century&quot; list, named ''Carousel'' the Best Musical of the 20th century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein &quot;set the standards for the 20th century musical, and this show features their most beautiful score and the most skillful and affecting example of their musical storytelling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993039-2,00.html.&quot;The best of the century&quot;].  ''Time'', December 31, 1999.   Retrieved on December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammerstein's grandson, Oscar Andrew Hammerstein, in his book about his family, suggested that the wartime situation made ''Carousel'''s ending especially poignant to its original viewers, &quot;Every American grieved the loss of a brother, son, father, or friend&amp;nbsp;... the audience empathized with &lt;nowiki&gt;[Billy's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; all-too-human efforts to offer advice, to seek forgiveness, to complete an unfinished life, and to bid a proper good-bye from beyond the grave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  Author and composer [[Ethan Mordden]] agreed with that perspective:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If ''Oklahoma!'' developed the moral argument for sending American boys overseas, ''Carousel'' offered consolation to those wives and mothers whose boys would only return in spirit.  The meaning lay not in the tragedy of the present, but in the hope for a future where no one walks alone.&lt;ref&gt;Block (ed.), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian alternative rock''' is a form of [[alternative rock]] music that is lyrically grounded in a [[Christianity|Christian]] worldview. Some critics have suggested that unlike [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] and older [[Christian rock]], Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guila_6_50&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gulla |first=Bob |title=The Greenwood Encycloepdia of Rock History, Volume Six |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=[[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], [[Connecticut]] |isbn=0-313-32981-8 |pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.

==History==
Christian alternative music has its roots in the early 1980s, as the earliest efforts at [[Christian punk]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] were recorded by artists like [[Daniel Amos]], [[Andy McCarroll and Moral Support]], [[Undercover (band)|Undercover]], [[The 77s]], [[Adam Again]], [[Quickflight]], Youth Choir (later renamed [[The Choir (alternative rock band)|The Choir]]), [[Lifesavers Underground]], [[Michael Knott]], [[The Altar Boys]], [[Breakfast with Amy]], [[Steve Taylor]], [[4-4-1]], [[David Edwards]], [[Black Carnation]] and [[Vector (band)|Vector]]. By the 1990s, many of these bands had disbanded, no longer performing, or were being carried by independent labels because their music tended to be more lyrically complex (and often more controversial) than mainstream [[Christian pop music|Christian pop]]. These early labels (most now-defunct) included [[Blonde Vinyl]], [[Frontline Records|Frontline]], [[Exit Records|Exit]], and [[Refuge Records|Refuge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guila_6_50&quot;/&gt; The modern market is currently supported by labels such as [[Tooth &amp; Nail Records|Tooth &amp; Nail]], [[Gotee Records|Gotee]] and [[Floodgate Records|Floodgate]]. These companies are often children of or partially owned by general market labels such as [[Warner Music Group|Warner]], [[EMI]], and [[Capitol Records]], giving successful artists an opportunity to &quot;cross over&quot; into mainstream markets. The style is sometimes mixed with [[alternative metal]] and [[rap-rock]] influences, in cases such as [[Pillar (band)|Pillar]].

'''Clive Barker''' (born 5 October 1952) is an [[England|English]] [[author]], [[film director]] and [[visual artist]] best known for his work in both [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]]. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of [[short stories]] which established him as a leading young horror writer. He has since written many [[novel]]s and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into motion pictures, notably the ''[[Hellraiser (film series)|Hellraiser]]'' and ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' series.

==Personal life==
Clive Barker was born in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], the son of Joan Rubie (née Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/Clive-Barker.html Clive Barker Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022056/bio Clive Barker Biography – Yahoo! Movies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Educated at [[Dovedale Primary School]] and [[Quarry Bank High School]], he studied English and Philosophy at [[Liverpool University]] and his picture now hangs in the entrance hallway to the Philosophy Department. It was in Liverpool in 1975 that he met his first partner, John Gregson, with whom he lived until 1986. Gregson was a major influence in Barker's early artistic life and provided the support mechanisms that enabled Barker to indulge in his love of theatre and writing novels. Volume 2 of 'The Books of Blood' and 'The Damnation Game' are dedicated to him. Barker now lives in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

In 2003, Clive Barker received The Davidson/Valentini Award at the [[15th GLAAD Media Awards]]. This award is presented &quot;to an openly lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individual who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for any of those communities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/publications/resource_doc_detail.php?id=3545 The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Web Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While Barker is critical of organized religion, he has identified himself as a [[Christian]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HBOMaher2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode

Clive Barker had said, &quot;I want to be remembered as an imaginer, someone who used his imagination as a way to journey beyond the limits of self, beyond the limits of flesh and blood, beyond the limits of even perhaps life itself, in order to discover some sense of order in what appears to be a disordered universe. I'm using my imagination to find meaning, both for myself and, I hope, for my readers.&quot;

Fans have noticed of late that Barker's voice has become gravelly and coarse. He says in a December 2008 online interview (published March 2009) that this is due to polyps in his throat which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in ten percent of the air he was supposed to have been getting. He has had two surgeries to remove them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior to the surgeries. He said he did not have cancer and has given up cigars.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.strangehorizons.com/2009/20090316/snyder-a.shtml Art and the Artist: An Interview with Clive Barker]'' Strange Horizons interview&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2010, Barker underwent surgery yet again to remove new polyp growths from his throat. According to his website, the surgery went well and was without complications.

==Writing career==
Barker is one of the leading authors of contemporary [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], writing in the horror genre early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in ''[[Books of Blood]]'' 1 – 6), and the [[Faustian]] novel ''[[The Damnation Game (novel)|The Damnation Game]]'' ([[1985 in literature|1985]]). Later he moved towards modern-day fantasy and [[urban fantasy]] with horror elements in ''[[Weaveworld]]'' ([[1987 in literature|1987]]), ''[[The Great and Secret Show]]'' ([[1989 in literature|1989]]), the world-spanning ''[[Imajica]]'' ([[1991 in literature|1991]]) and ''[[Sacrament (novel)|Sacrament]]'' ([[1996 in literature|1996]]), bringing in the deeper, richer concepts of reality, the nature of the mind and dreams, and the power of words and memories. 

Barker's distinctive style is characterized by the notion of hidden fantastical worlds coexisting with our own, the role of sexuality in the [[supernatural]] and the construction of coherent, complex and detailed universes. Barker has referred to this style as &quot;[[dark fantasy]]&quot; or the &quot;fantastique&quot;. His stories are notable for a deliberate blurring of the distinction between binary opposites such as hell and heaven, or pleasure and pain (the latter particularly so in ''The Hellbound Heart'').

When the ''Books of Blood'' were first published in the [[United States]] in [[paperback]], [[Stephen King]] was quoted on the book covers: &quot;I have seen the future of horror, his name is Clive Barker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivebarker.info/newsstephenking.html&lt;/ref&gt; Critical studies of Barker's work include ''Clive Barker's Short Stories'' (1994) by [[Gary Hoppenstand]],&lt;ref&gt;
''Clive Barker's Short Stories: Imagination as Metaphor in the Books of Blood and other works'' by Gary Hoppenstand. McFarland, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and an essay in [[S. T. Joshi]]'s ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001). As for influences on his writing, Barker lists [[Herman Melville]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivebarker.info/influences.html&lt;/ref&gt;
