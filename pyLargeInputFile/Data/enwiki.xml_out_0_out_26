 Moses excoriates him for not paying his bills, for seducing Jenny (who presents herself as a plaintiff) to commit a &quot;carnal act&quot; with him for money, and for inciting the crowd with &quot;an illegal joyous song&quot; on the night of the typhoon. Billy, with the chorus’s support, counters that, in committing the latter act, Jimmy discovered the laws by which Mahagonny lives. Moses argues that Jim hastened his friend Joe’s death in a prizefight by betting on him, and Billy counters by asking who actually killed Joe. Moses does not reply. But there is no answer for the main count against him. Jim gets short sentences for his lesser crimes, but for having no money, he is sentenced to death. Begbick, Fatty and Moses, rising to identify themselves as the injured parties, proclaim &quot;in the whole human race / there is no greater criminal / than a man without money&quot;. As Jim is led off to await execution, everyone sings the &quot;Benares Song&quot;, in which they long for that exotic city &quot;where the sun is shining.&quot; But Benares has been destroyed by an earthquake. &quot;Where shall we go?&quot; they ask.

''Scene 19: At the gallows''

Jim says a tender goodbye to Jenny, who, dressed in white, declares herself his widow. He surrenders her to Billy, his last remaining companion from Alaska. When he tries to delay the execution by reminding the people of Mahagonny that God exists, they play out for him, under Moses’s direction, the story of &quot;God in Mahagonny&quot;, in which the Almighty condemns the town and is overthrown by its citizens, who declare that they can’t be sent to Hell because they are already in Hell. Jim, chastened, asks only for a glass of water, but is refused even this as Moses gives the signal for the trap to be sprung.

''Scene 20''

A caption advises that, after Jim’s death, increasing hostility among the city’s various factions has caused the destruction of Mahagonny. To a potpourri of themes from earlier in the opera, groups of protesters are seen on the march, in conflict with one another, while the city burns in the background. Jenny and the whores carry Jim’s clothing and accessories like sacred relics; Billy and several men carry his coffin. In a new theme, they and the others declare, &quot;Nothing you can do will help a dead man&quot;. Begbick, Fatty and Moses appear with placards of their own, joining the entire company in its march and declaring &quot;Nothing will help him or us or you now,&quot; as the opera ends in chaos.

==Themes==
{{Original research|date=March 2008}}
;Satire of opera

To an extent, ''Mahagonny'' is an opera that satirizes operas. Brecht said that &quot;[i]t attacks the society that needs operas of such a sort&quot; and Weill said that it &quot;pays conscious tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Unwin (director)|Unwin, Stephen]]. ''A Guide to the Plays of Bertolt Brecht'' Methuen, London. 2005. pp. 120–122. ISBN 978-0-413-77416-3&lt;/ref&gt; Both thought operas had become too full of ritual and bereft of substance, and ''Mahagonny'' in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free to do what they want, and naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around like giant slabs of meat and the &quot;love&quot; is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The &quot;Mandalay Song&quot; also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about the whole business. In ''Mahagonny'', operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.

Another trope of operas is the ''[[deus ex machina]]'', in which the protagonist is saved at the last minute by divine intervention. This is a useful technique to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In ''Mahagonny'', though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a ''deus ex machina''; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems just in time for the end of the opera, but ''Mahagonny'''s god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.

;Mahagonny as capitalism

Mahagonny as a city was also intended to be a parable of [[capitalism]] stripped of its veneer of bourgeois respectability, as it &quot;arose to meet the needs and desires of the people, and it was these same needs and desires that brought about its destruction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Ronald. ''Kurt Weill: Composer in a Divided World'' Northeastern University Press, Boston. 1991. p. 161. ISBN 978-1-55553-147-8&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this was also intended as a commentary on the state of Weimar Germany; underneath that facade of prosperity and happiness, lay corruption and savagery. Under Brecht's (and to some extent Weill's) Marxist-influenced view of capitalism, it is created to provide people the goods and services they need, but it does so at the expense of reducing everything to a mere commodity. Furthermore, since obtaining wealth in capitalism is a cutthroat enterprise, the powerful are no better than a gang of bandits, and the law in turn is run by such thugs.

The city of Mahagonny embodies many of these characteristics. Mahagonny was originally created to provide people with useful services; the gold prospectors wanted a relaxation spot, and the three criminals needed to stay there. However, this led to the commodification of everything the tourists desired, especially love. In the end, nobody could buy true happiness; Alaska Wolf Joe and Jacob Schmidt died, the city is burning down, and Jimmy declared before his death that &quot;[t]he happiness I bought was no happiness&quot;. His death was also ordered by the court of law, which was run by the three criminals. To make matters even more farcical, they let a murderer bribe his way to freedom while Jimmy is sentenced to death for petty crimes. The parallels between the events of ''Mahagonny'' and the Marxist view of capitalism are clear.

To make the comparison more obvious, the opera is set in a pseudo-Wild West America, with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization. America was the land of unbridled capitalism, the frontier just as much so. The only difference is that bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier, and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct. In ''Mahagonny'', the characters are prostitutes, lumberjacks, criminals, and the like. Not one of them comes from the moneyed class, and yet the same system of exploitation was set up, but in a more naked manner. Instead of seducing a woman's love with power and influence, the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute. But in ''Mahagonny'', poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves, but a crime to be punished. Thus, Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be.

==Musical and dramatic elements==
{{Original research|date=March 2008}}
;Gebrauchsmusik
Though Kurt Weill was not a vocal proponent of the ''[[Gebrauchsmusik]]'' movement in Germany, many of his works, including the music for ''Mahagonny'', share many of its characteristics. Loosely defined, ''Gebrauchsmusik'' is the idea that music can be more than just pure music. For example, music that accompanies a silent film is perfectly respectable, so long as it is done well. Also, simple music to be performed by amateurs is also acceptable. Weill's musical setting of ''Mahagonny'' exemplifies many of these characteristics. In the first place, this is music composed for the stage and not for the concert hall, and Weill intentionally chose that so. He wished to make his music speak out to as many people as possible, so throughout his career his mostly wrote music for the stage, and all the while in Europe he was considered a real composer and not just some hack pandering to the playwright to make a living.

For example, in act 1, scene 2, the scenario is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; just a simple solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, nor is it a Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, it is not surprising that the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.

Elsewhere Weill uses other such non-classical instruments as the accordion, and he uses other popular influences, including those of his native Germany. The most enduring feature of ''Gebrauchsmusik'' in ''Mahagonny'', however, are the tunes. This reflects Weill's greatest desire to create simple music that would go straight to the heart of the audience. Many of the songs in ''Mahagonny'' are very simple and accessible. The &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot;, for example, can be picked up absentmindedly and hummed. And while it seems carefree, something seems wrong with it, despite or perhaps because of its simplicity.

;Verfremdungseffekt
Since Mahagonny was co-produced by Brecht, there is a prominent display of the ''[[Verfremdungseffekt]]'', often translated as the &quot;alienation effect&quot;. Brecht and Weill wished to replace the old dramatic theater and its emphasis on emotions with [[epic theatre]] and its emphasis on reason. In the case of Brecht, it was more as a didactic tool for communist philosophy, but for Weill, it was more of a social scheme, a way to get people involved and thinking. The general scheme was to shake up people's preconceived notions and make them think about what is happening on stage, or to emotionally distance the audience from the action thus making logical evaluation of the play's events easier. Brecht and Weill used different methods to achieve this effect.

One of the most noticeable methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions at the beginning of most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on what is going on in the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.

Weill also contributed greatly to the ''Verfremdungseffekt'' by his music. Often the music would intentionally be unsuited for the onstage action, preventing the audience from getting carried away by the onstage emotion. For example, in act 2, scene 13, the hurricane has spared Mahagonny, and the people feel free to do whatever makes them happy. For Jacob Schmidt, this means eating a lot. He sings of how he has not had his fill yet with such lines as &quot;Not enough by half! / I may eat myself for supper.&quot; And yet, the music betrays the seeming unbridled ecstasy of Jacob; he is singing to a discordant melody, and the accordion accompaniment sounds stark and rather macabre. The intention is that the audience realizes that all this is very wrong; Jacob claims to be having a great time, but the music suggests all may not be well, thus the audience needs to pay attention and think about what is really going on. To further this point, Jacob then dies and the chorus sings of how happy he was while dragging out his corpse. This last twist of welcoming death is unexpected and contributes to the alienation.

Another example of ''Verfremdungseffekt'' in the music is in the &quot;Alabama Song&quot;. This time, instead of the music sounding deeply disturbing compared to the stage action, it is the reverse. When the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; first appears, the women are going to Mahagonny. The second time the song appears is near the end of the opera, after Jimmy has been executed. Mahagonny is in decline, and there are street protests. The entire stage is singing about how rotten the world and man are, when all of a sudden Jenny and the prostitutes come walking through singing the &quot;Alabama Song&quot;, a total departure from the previous mood. What is more, they are carrying Jimmy's corpse through the stage. The music refuses to set and keep the audience in a particular mood, and the conflict between the lighthearted &quot;Alabama Song&quot; and the imagery of the funeral procession is confusing. This tension serves to distance the audience from the action, even at an exceptionally powerful moment of the opera, giving the audience one last chance to digest all the contradictions and perversions of Mahagonny.

==In other media==
The 2005 movie ''[[Manderlay]]'', directed by [[Lars von Trier]], contains several references to the plot of ''Mahagonny''. The most notable of these is the threat of a hurricane approaching the city during the first act. Von Trier's earlier movie ''[[Dogville]]'', to which Manderlay is a sequel, was for a large part based on a song from Brecht's ''Threepenny Opera'' (&quot;Pirate Jenny&quot;). In the brothel scene in act 2 of ''Mahagonny'', the choir sings a &quot;Song von Mandelay&quot;. The play ''Happy End'' (1929) by [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], Brecht and Weill, also contains a song called &quot;Der Song von Mandelay&quot;, which uses the same refrain as in the brothel scene of ''Mahagonny''. Brecht's use of the name Mandelay/Mandalay was inspired by [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem &quot;[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]&quot;.

'''James Avery Hopwood''' (May 28, 1882 - July 1, 1928), was one of the most successful playwrights of the Jazz Age, having four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the [[University of Michigan]] (1905), 

Hopwood started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, ''Clothes'' (1906), produced on Broadway. He became known as &quot;The Playboy Playwright&quot;&lt;ref name=imdbbio&gt;Jim Beaver [http://imdb.com/name/nm0394479/bio Biography for Avery Hopwood] at [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué  at the time.  One play, ''The Demi-Virgin'' in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, &quot;Stripping Cupid&quot;, where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.  The case was dismissed.

His many plays included ''Nobody's Widow'' (1910), starring Blanche Bates; ''Fair and Warmer'' (1915), starring Madge Kennedy (filmed in 1919); ''The Gold Diggers'' (1919), starring Ina Claire (filmed in 1923 as ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'', in 1928 as ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' and also as ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]''); ''Ladies Night (in a Turkish Bath)'' (with Charlton Andrews), 1920, starring [[Charlie Ruggles]] (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play ''The Bat'' (with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]), 1920 (filmed in [[The Bat (1926 film)|1926]], [[The Bat Whispers|1930]] and [[The Bat (1959 film)|1959]]); ''Getting Gertie's Garter'' (with Wilson Collison), 1921, starring Hazel Dawn (filmed in 1927 and 1945); ''The Demi-Virgin'', 1921, also starring Hazel Dawn; ''The Alarm Clock'', 1923; ''The Best People'' (with David Gray), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as ''[[Fast and Loose (film)|Fast and Loose]]'' in 1930), the song-farce ''Naughty Cinderella'', 1925, starring [[Irene Bordoni]] and ''The Garden of Eden'' in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as ''[[The Garden of Eden (1928 film)|The Garden of Eden]])''. A clever, adroit, masterful craftsman who wrote to the tastes of his public, Hopwood was inexhaustible in his work ethic.  Although the press reported that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer Rose Rolanda in 1924, Hopwood's close friend Carl Van Vechten confirmed in later years that it was all a publicity stunt.  Rolanda would later marry caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias.

Sadly, personal troubles related to his [[homosexuality]] and his inability to break from the formula writing that made him a success led to his early death at age 46.  While swimming at [[Juan-les-Pins]] on the French Riviera, July 1, 1928, he suffered a heart attack and died. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio, next to his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). ''Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols &amp; Stories''. Cleveland, OH: Gray &amp; Company, Publishers. ISBN 978-1-59851-025-6&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Hopwood worked on a novel that he hoped would &quot;expose&quot; the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published. 

The terms of Hopwood's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the [[Hopwood Award|Avery Hopwood and Jule [his mother] Hopwood Creative Writing Awards]]. The bequest stipulated: &quot;It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged.&quot; Famous Hopwood award winners include [[Robert Hayden]], [[Marge Piercy]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Betty Smith]], [[Lawrence Kasdan]], [[John Ciardi]], [[Mary Gaitskill]], [[Nancy Willard]], [[Frank O’Hara]], and [[Steve Hamilton (author)|Steve Hamilton]].

      <comment>r2.7.1) (robot Adding: [[ja:フェリクス2世 (対立教皇)]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antipope Felix II''' was installed as Pope in 355 after the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantius II]] banished the reigning Pope, [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]], for refusing to subscribe the sentence of condemnation against [[Athanasius|Saint Athanasius]]. In May 357 the Roman laity, which had remained faithful to Liberius, demanded that Constantius, who was on a visit to Rome, should recall Liberius. The Emperor planned to have Felix and Liberius rule jointly, but when Liberius returned Felix was forced to retire to Porto, near Rome, where, after making an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself again in Rome, he died on 22 November 365.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/203964/Felix-II Encyclopaedia Britannica: ''Felix (II)'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/avellana-1-english The Papal Schism between Liberius and Felix], 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

This Felix was later confused with a Roman martyr named Felix, with the result that he was included in lists of the Popes as Felix II and that the succeeding Popes of the same name ([[Pope Felix III]] and [[Pope Felix IV]]) were given wrong numerals, as was [[Antipope Felix V]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2008 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 ISBN 978-88-209-8021-4), p. 9*&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1909) called this confusion a &quot;distortion of the true facts&quot; and suggested that it arose because the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which at this point may be registering a reliable tradition, says that this Felix built a church on the [[Via Aurelia]], which is where the Roman martyr of an earlier date was buried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06030a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: ''Felix II'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent source says that of the martyr Felix nothing is known except his name, that he was a martyr, and that he was buried in the cemetery on the [[Via Portuensis]] that bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Encyclopedia remarked that &quot;the real story of the antipope was lost and he obtained in local Roman history the status of a saint and a confessor. As such he appears in the Roman Martyrology on 29 July.&quot; At that time (1909) the Roman Martyrology had the following text: {{quote|At Rome, on the Aurelian Way, St. Felix II, pope and martyr. Being expelled from his See by the Arian emperor Constantius for defending the Catholic faith, and being put to the sword privately at Cera in Tuscany, he died gloriously. His body was taken away from that place by clerics, and buried on the Aurelian Way. It was afterwards brought to the Church of the Saints Cosmas and Damian, where, under the Sovereign Pontiff Gregory XIII, it was found beneath the altar with the relics of the holy martyrs Mark, Marcellian, and Tranquillinus, and with the latter was put back in the same place on the 31st of July. In the same altar were also found the bodies of the holy martyrs Abundius, a priest, and Abundantius, a deacon, which were shortly after solemnly transferred to the church of the Society of Jesus, on the eve of their feast.}} This entry was based on what the Catholic Encyclopedia called later legends that confound the relative positions of Felix and Liberius. More recent editions of the Roman Martyrology&lt;ref name=Martyrology&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ISBN 88-209-7210-7)&lt;/ref&gt; have instead: {{quote|At Rome, at the third milestone on the Via Portuensis, in the cemetery dedicated to his name, Saint Felix, martyr.}}

The [[feast day]] of the Roman martyr Felix is 29 July.&lt;ref name=Martyrology/&gt; The antipope Felix died, as stated above, on a 22 November, and his death was not a martyr's,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Felix_II 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica: ''Felix II'']&lt;/ref&gt; occurring when the [[Peace of the Church|Peace of Constantine]] had been in force for half a century.

As well as the Roman Martyrology, the [[Roman Missal]] identified the Saint Felix of 29 July with the antipope. This identification, still found in the 1920 typical edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal, with feasts updated to the late 1920s]&lt;/ref&gt; does not appear in the 1962 typical edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/missale62.pdf 1962 typical edition of the Roman Missal]&lt;/ref&gt; To judge by the Marietti printing of 1952, which omits the numeral &quot;II&quot; and the word &quot;Papae&quot;, the correction had already been made by then.

'''Alkaloids''' are a group of naturally occurring [[chemical compound]]s which mostly contain [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[nitrogen]] atoms. This group also includes some related compounds with neutral&lt;ref name=&quot;goldbook.iupac.org&quot;&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00220.html IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology], 2nd ed.

CRC Press, 1998, p. 51 ISBN 1-56670-223-2&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]], alkaloids may also contain [[oxygen]], [[sulfur]] and more rarely other elements such as [[chlorine]], [[bromine]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;XimE: alkaloidy&quot;&gt;[http://www.xumuk.ru/encyklopedia/119.html Chemical Encyclopedia: alkaloids]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms, including [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s and are part of the group of [[natural product]]s (also called [[secondary metabolite]]s). Many alkaloids can be purified from crude extracts by [[acid-base extraction]]. Many alkaloids are [[toxicity|toxic]] to other organisms. They often have [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effects and are used as [[medication]]s, as [[recreational drug]]s, or in [[entheogenic]] rituals. Examples are the [[local anesthetic]] and [[stimulant]], [[cocaine]]; the stimulant, [[caffeine]]; [[nicotine]]; the [[analgesic]], [[morphine]]; the antibacterial, [[berberine]]; the anticancer compound, [[Vincristine|vincrinstine]]; the antihypertension agent, [[Reserpine|resepine]]; the cholinomimeric, [[Galantamine|galatamine]]; the spasmolysis agent,  [[atropine]]; the vasodilator, [[vincamine]]; the anti-arhythmia compound, [[quinidine]]; the anti-asthma therapeutic, [[ephedrine]]; and the [[antimalarial drug]], [[quinine]].
Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke a [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitter taste]].&lt;ref name=Rhoades1979&gt;{{cite book|year=1979 |author=Rhoades, David F |chapter=Evolution of Plant Chemical Defense against Herbivores |editor=Rosenthal, Gerald A., and Janzen, Daniel H|title=Herbivores: Their Interaction with Secondary Plant Metabolites |place=New York |publisher=Academic Press |page=41 |isbn=0-12-597180-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
[[File:Meissner alkalod definition article 1819.png|thumb|150px|The article which introduced the concept of &quot;alkaloid&quot;.]]

The name &quot;alkaloids&quot; ({{lang-de|Alkaloide}}) was introduced in 1819 by the German chemist Carl F.W. Meissner,&lt;ref&gt;Biographical information about German pharmacist Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Meißner (1792-1853) is available in the German Wikipedia:  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Wilhelm_Mei%C3%9Fner  (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from late Latin root ''{{lang-la|alkali}}'' (which, in turn, comes from the Arabic ''al qualja'' - &quot;ashes of plants&quot;) and the suffix ''{{lang-el|ειδοσ}}'' - &quot;like&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;In the penultimate sentence of his article [W. Meissner (1819) &quot;Über Pflanzenalkalien: II. Über ein neues Pflanzenalkali (Alkaloid)&quot; (On plant alkalis: II. On a new plant alkali (alkaloid)), ''Journal für Chemie und Physik'', vol. 25, pp. 377–381] Meissner wrote &quot;Überhaupt scheint es mir auch angemessen, die bis jetzt bekannten Pflanzenstoffe nicht mit dem Namen Alkalien, sondern Alkaloide zu belegen, da sie doch in manchen Eigenschaften von den Alkalien sehr abweichen, sie würden daher in dem Abschnitt der Pflanzenchemie vor den Pflanzensäuren ihre Stelle finden.&quot; (In general, it seems appropriate to me to impose on the known plant substances not the name &quot;alkalis&quot; but &quot;alkaloids&quot;, since they differ greatly in some properties from the alkalis; among the chapters of plant chemistry, they would therefore find their place before plant acids [since &quot;Alkaloid&quot; would precede &quot;Säure&quot; (acid)].)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term came into wide use only after the publication of a review article by O. Jacobsen in the chemical dictionary of [[Albert Ladenburg]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no unique method of naming alkaloids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 5&quot;&gt;Hesse, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Many individual names are formed by adding the suffix &quot;-ine&quot; to the species or generic alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;The suffix &quot;-ine&quot; is a Greek feminine patronymic suffix and thus means &quot;daughter of&quot;; hence, for example, &quot;atropine&quot; means &quot;daughter of Atropa (belladonna)&quot;.  See:  https://webspace.yale.edu/chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html  .&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[atropine]] is isolated from the plant [[Atropa belladonna]], [[strychnine]] is obtained from the seed of [[Strychnine tree]].&lt;ref name=&quot;XimE: alkaloidy&quot;/&gt; If several alkaloids are extracted from one plant then their names often contain suffixes &quot;-idine&quot;, &quot;-anine&quot;, &quot;-aline&quot;, &quot;-inine&quot;, etc. There are also at least 86 alkaloids containing the root &quot;vin&quot; (extracted from the [[Vinca]] plant).&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Alkaloid-containing plants were used by humans since ancient times for therapeutic and recreational purposes. For example, medicinal plants have been known in the [[Mesopotamia]] at least around 2000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aniszewski 182&quot;&gt;Aniszewski, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Odyssey]]'' of [[Homer]] referred to a gift given to Helen by the Egyptian queen, a drug bringing oblivion. It is believed that the gift was an opium-containing drug.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese book on houseplants written in 1st-3rd centuries BC mentioned a medical use of [[Ephedra]] and [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[coca]] leaves were used by [[South America]]n Indians since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Extracts]] from plants containing toxic alkaloids, such as [[aconitine]] and [[tubocurarine]], were used since antiquity for poisoning arrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aniszewski 182&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertuerner.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Friedrich Sertürner]], the German chemist who first isolated [[morphine]] from [[opium]].]]
Studies of alkaloids began in the 19th century. In 1804, the German chemist [[Friedrich Sertürner]] isolated from opium a &quot;soporific principle&quot; ({{lang-la|principium somniferum}}), which he called &quot;morphium&quot; in honor of [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] god of dreams; in German and some other Central-European languages, this is still the name of the drug. The term &quot;morphine&quot;, used in English and French, was given by the French physicist [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]]). 

A significant contribution to the chemistry of alkaloids in the early years of its development was made by the French researchers [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]] who discovered [[quinine]] (1820) and [[strychnine]] (1818). Several other alkaloids were discovered around that time, including [[xanthine]] (1817), [[atropine]] (1819), [[caffeine]] (1820), [[coniine]] (1827), [[nicotine]] (1828), [[colchicine]] (1833), [[sparteine]] (1851) and [[cocaine]] (1860).&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, pp. 313–316&lt;/ref&gt;

The first complete synthesis of an alkaloid was achieved in 1886 by the German chemist [[Albert Ladenburg]]. He produced [[coniine]] by reacting 2-methylpyridine with [[acetaldehyde]] and reducing the resulting 2-propenyl pyridine with [[sodium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BSE: koniin&quot;&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00036/77600.htm TSB: Coniine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the chemistry of alkaloids was accelerated by the emergence of [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] and [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] methods in the 20th century, so that by 2008 more than 12,000 alkaloids had been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Begley ''Encyclopedia of Chemical Biology: Natural Products in Plants, Chemical Diversity of&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
[[File:Bufotenin.svg|thumb|160px|[[Bufotenin]], a poison from some toads, contains an [[indole]] core and is produced in living organisms from the amino acid [[tryptophan]].]]
[[File:Nicotine.svg|thumb|160px|The [[nicotine]] molecule contains both [[pyridine]] (left) and [[pyrrolidine]] rings (right).]]

Compared with most other classes of natural compounds, alkaloids are characterized by a great structural diversity and there is no uniform classification of alkaloids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref15&quot;&gt;Hesse, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, first classification methods combined alkaloids by the common natural source, e.g., a certain type of plants. This classification was justified by the lack of knowledge about the chemical structure of alkaloids and is now considered obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;XimE: alkaloidy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orekhov, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent classifications are based on similarity of the carbon skeleton (e.g., [[indole]], [[isoquinoline]] and [[pyridine]]-like) or biogenetic precursor ([[ornithine]], [[lysine]], [[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]], etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;XimE: alkaloidy&quot;/&gt; However, they require compromises in borderline cases;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref15&quot; /&gt; for example, [[nicotine]] contains a pyridine fragment from [[nicotinamide]] and [[pyrrolidine]] part from ornithine&lt;ref&gt;Aniszewski, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore can be assigned to both classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref19&quot;&gt;Dewick, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkaloids are often divided into the following major groups:&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

# &quot;True alkaloids&quot;, which contain [[nitrogen]] in the [[heterocycle]] and originate from [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref21&quot;&gt;Plemenkov, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Their characteristic examples are [[atropine]], [[nicotine]] and [[morphine]]. This group also includes some alkaloids which beside nitrogen heterocycle contain [[terpene]] (e.g. [[evonine]]&lt;ref&gt;Aniszewski, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;) or peptide fragments (e.g. [[ergotamine]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ref23&quot;&gt;Hesse, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;). This group also includes piperidine alkaloids [[coniine]] and [[coniceine]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ref24&quot;&gt;Hesse, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not originate from amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref25&quot;&gt;Dewick, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;Protoalkaloids&quot;, which contain [[nitrogen]] and also originate from amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref21&quot; /&gt; Examples include [[mescaline]], [[adrenaline]] and [[ephedrine]].
# Polyamine alkaloids – derivatives of [[putrescine]], [[spermidine]] and [[spermine]].
# Peptide and cyclopeptide alkaloids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref27&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author = Dimitris C. Gournelif, Gregory G. Laskarisb and Robert Verpoorte|title = Cyclopeptide alkaloids|doi = 10.1039/NP9971400075|journal = Nat. Prod. Rep.|year = 1997|volume = 14|pages = 75–82|pmid = 9121730|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pseudalkaloids – alkaloid-like compounds which do not originate from amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;Aniszewski, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; This group includes, [[terpene]]-like and [[steroid]]-like alkaloids,&lt;ref&gt;Plemenkov, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[purine]]-like alkaloids such as [[caffeine]], [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref30&quot;&gt;Aniszewski, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors classify as pseudoalkaloids such compounds such as [[ephedrine]] and [[cathinone]]. Those originate from the amino acid [[phenylalanine]], but acquire their nitrogen atom not from the amino acid but through [[transamination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref30&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref31&quot;&gt;Dewick, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Some alkaloids do not have the carbon skeleton characteristic of their group. So, [[galantamine]] and homoaporphines do not contain [[isoquinoline]] fragment, but are generally attributed to isoquinoline alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, pp. 44, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Main classes of monomeric alkaloids are listed in the table below:

Most alkaloids contain oxygen; those compounds are usually colorless crystals at ambient conditions. Oxygen-free alkaloids, such as [[nicotine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00052/84600.htm TSB: Nicotine]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[coniine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BSE: koniin&quot;/&gt; are typically volatile, colorless, oily liquids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref222&quot;&gt;Grinkevich, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Some alkaloids are colored, like [[berberine]] (yellow) and [[sanguinarine]] (orange).&lt;ref name=&quot;ref222&quot; /&gt;

Most alkaloid are weak bases, but some are [[amphoteric]], for example [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ref225&quot;&gt;G. A. Spiller [http://books.google.com/books?id=Rgs_rVOceZwC&amp;pg=PA140 ''Caffeine''], CRC Press, 1997 ISBN 0-8493-2647-8&lt;/ref&gt; Most alkaloids are poorly soluble in water but readily dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s, such as [[diethyl ether]], [[chloroform]] and [[1,2-dichloroethane]]. However, [[caffeine]] dissolves well in boiling water.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref225&quot; /&gt; With [[acid]]s, alkaloids form salts of various strengths. Those salts are usually soluble in water and [[alcohol]] and poorly soluble in most organic solvents. Exceptions include [[scopolamine]] hydrobromide which is soluble in organic solvents and water-soluble quinine sulfate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref222&quot; /&gt;

Most alkaloids have a bitter [[flavor]]. It is believed that plants evolved the ability to produce these bitter substances, many of which are poisonous, in order to protect themselves from animals; however, animals in turn evolved the ability to detoxify alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;Fattorusso, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  Some alkaloids can produce developmental defects in the offspring of animals that consume them but cannot detoxify them.  A characteristic example is the alkaloid [[cyclopamine]], which is present in the leaves of [[Veratrum californicum|corn lily]]. During the 1950s, up to 25% lambs born by sheep that had grazed on corn lily suffered serious facial defects. Those defects ranged from deformed jaws to [[cyclopia]] (see picture). After decades of research, in 1980s, the substance that was responsible for the deformities was identified as the alkaloid 11-deoxyjervine, which was renamed cyclopamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=362|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nixyqfGIGHcC&amp;pg=PA362|title=Poisonous plants and related toxins, Volume 2001|author=Thomas Acamovic, Colin S. Stewart, T. W. Pennycott|publisher=CABI|year= 2004|isbn=0851996140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution in nature==
[[File:Koeh-266.jpg|thumb|[[Strychnine tree]]. Its seeds are rich in [[strychnine]] and [[brucine]].]]

Alkaloids are [[anabolism|generated]] by various living organisms, especially by [[Vascular plant|higher plants]] – about 10 to 25% of those contain alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;Aniszewski, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orekhov, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the past the term &quot;alkaloid&quot; was associated with plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 4&quot;&gt;Hesse, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The alkaloids content in plants is usually within a few percent and is inhomogeneous over the plant tissues. Depending on the type of plants, the maximum concentration is observed in the leaves ([[black henbane]]), [[fruit]]s or [[seed]]s ([[Strychnine tree]]), root ([[Rauwolfia serpentina]]) or bark ([[cinchona]]).&lt;ref&gt;Grinkevich, pp. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, different tissues of the same plants may contain different alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;Orekhov, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside plants, alkaloids are found in certain types of [[fungi]], such as [[psilocybin]] in the fungus of the genus [[Psilocybe]], and in animals, such as [[bufotenin]] in the skin of some toads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 5&quot; /&gt; Many marine organisms also contain alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;Fattorusso, p. XVII&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[amines]], such as [[adrenaline]] and [[serotonin]], which play an important role in higher animals, are similar to alkaloids in their structure and biosynthesis and are sometimes called alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;Aniszewski, pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraction==
[[File:Piperine crystals.jpg|thumb|Crystals of [[piperine]] extracted from [[black pepper]].]]

Because of the structural diversity of alkaloids, there is no single method of their extraction from natural raw materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;&gt;Hesse, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Most methods exploit the property of most alkaloids to be soluble in organic solvents but not in water, and the opposite tendency of their salts. 

Most plants contain several alkaloids. Their mixture is extracted first and then individual alkaloids are separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref236&quot;&gt;Grinkevich, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are thoroughly ground before extraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinkevich, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Most alkaloids are present in the raw plants in the form of salts of organic acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;/&gt; The extracted alkaloids may remain salts or change into bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref236&quot; /&gt; Base extraction is achieved by processing the raw material with alkaline solutions and extracting the alkaloid bases with organic solvents, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, diethyl ether or benzene. Then, the impurities are dissolved by weak acids; this converts alkaloid bases into salts which are washed away with water. If necessary, an aqueous solution of alkaloid salts is again made alkaline and treated with an organic solvent. The process is repeated until the desired purity is achieved.

In the acidic extraction, the raw plant material is processed by a weak acidic solution (e.g., [[acetic acid]] in water, ethanol or methanol). A base is then added to convert alkaloids to basic forms which are extracted with organic solvent (if the extraction was performed with alcohol, it is removed first, and the remainder is dissolved in water). The solution is purified as described above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinkevich, pp. 132-134&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkaloids are separated from their mixture using their different solubility in certain solvents and different reactivity with certain reagents or by [[distillation]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinkevich, pp. 134-136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis ==
Biological precursors of most alkaloids are [[amino acid]]s, such as [[ornithine]], [[lysine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]], [[histidine]], [[aspartic acid]] and [[anthranilic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plemenkov 253&quot;&gt;Plemenkov, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicotinic acid]] can be synthesized from tryptophan or aspartic acid. Ways of alkaloid biosynthesis are too numerous and can not be easily classified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Begley&quot;/&gt; However, there are a few typical reactions involved in the biosynthesis of various classes of alkaloids, including synthesis of [[Schiff bases]] and [[Mannich reaction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plemenkov 253&quot;/&gt;

=== Synthesis of Schiff bases===
{{Main|Schiff base}}

Schiff bases can be obtained by reacting amines with ketones or aldehydes.&lt;ref&gt;Plemenkov, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions are a common method of producing C=N bonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dewick 19&quot;&gt;Dewick, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schiff base formation.svg|center]]

In the biosynthesis of alkaloids, such reactions may take place within a molecule,&lt;ref name=&quot;Plemenkov 253&quot;/&gt; such as in the synthesis of piperidine:&lt;ref name=&quot;ref19&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Schiff base formation intramolecular.svg|center]]

===Mannich reaction ===
{{Main|Mannich reaction}}

An integral component of the Mannich reaction, in addition to an amine and a [[carbonyl]] compound, is a [[carbanion]], which plays the role of the nucleophile in the [[nucleophilic addition]] to the ion formed by the reaction of the amine and the carbonyl.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dewick 19&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Mannich.png|center]]

The Mannich reaction can proceed both intermolecularly and intramolecularly:&lt;ref&gt;Plemenkov, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dewick, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mannich reaction intramolecular.svg|center]]

==Dimer alkaloids ==

In addition to the described above monomeric alkaloids, there are also [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]ic, and even [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]]ic and [[tetramer]]ic alkaloids formed upon condensation of two, three and four monomeric alkaloids. Dimeric alkaloids are usually formed from monomers of the same type through the following mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, pp. 91–105&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mannich reaction]], resulting in, e.g., voacamine
* [[Michael reaction]] (villalstonine).
* Condensation of aldehydes with amines (toxiferine).
* Oxidative addition of phenols (dauricine, tubocurarine).
* [[Lactone|Lactonization]] (carpaine).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==The biological role ==

The role of alkaloids for living organisms which produce them is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Aniszewski, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was assumed that the alkaloids are the final products of [[nitrogen]] [[metabolism]] in plants, and [[urea]] in mammals. Later it was shown that alkaloid concentrations varies over time and this hypothesis was refuted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers&quot;/&gt;

Most of the known functions of alkaloids are related to protection. For example, [[aporphine]] alkaloid [[liriodenine]] produced by the [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]] protects it from parasitic mushrooms. In addition, presence of alkaloids in the plant prevents insects and [[chordate]] animals from eating it. However, some animals adapted to alkaloids and even use them in their own metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, pp. 283-291&lt;/ref&gt; Such alkaloid-related substances as [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]] and [[histamine]] are important [[neurotransmitter]]s in animals. Alkaloids are also known to regulate plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;Aniszewski, pp. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
===In medicine ===
Medical use of alkaloid plants has a long history, and thus when the first alkaloids were synthesized in the 19th century, they immediately found application in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Many alkaloids are still used in medicine, usually in the form of salts, including the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, pp. 303-309&lt;/ref&gt;:

Many synthetic and semisynthetic drugs are structural modifications of the alkaloids, which were designed to enhance or change the primary effect of the drug and reduce unwanted side effects.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[naloxone]], an [[opioid receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]], is a derivative of [[thebaine]] which is present in [[opium]].&lt;ref&gt;Dewick, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== In agriculture ===
Prior to the development of a wide range of relatively low-toxic synthetic [[pesticide]]s, some alkaloids, such as salts of nicotine and [[anabasine]], were used as [[insecticide]]s. Their use was limited by their high toxicity to humans.&lt;ref&gt;György Matolcsy, Miklós Nádasy, Viktor Andriska [http://books.google.com/books?id=fPiRSsUOpLEC&amp;pg=PA21 ''Pesticide chemistry''], Elsevier, 2002, pp. 21-22 ISBN 0-444-98903-X&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use as psychoactive drugs ===
Preparations of plants containing alkaloids and their extracts, and later pure alkaloids have long been used as [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]]. [[Cocaine]] and [[cathinone]] are [[stimulant]]s of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;Veselovskaya, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mescaline]] and many of indole alkaloids (such as [[psilocybin]], [[dimethyltryptamine]] and [[ibogaine]]) have [[hallucinogen]]ic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Veselovskaya, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Cordell ''The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology''. Volume 56, Elsevier, 2001, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morphine]] and [[codeine]] are strong narcotic pain killers.&lt;ref&gt;Veselovskaya, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

There are alkaloids that do not have strong psychoactive effect themselves, but are [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]]s for semi-synthetic psychoactive drugs. For example, [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] are used to produce [[methcathinone]] (ephedrine) and [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Veselovskaya, pp. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Adventism}}{{Christianity|expand-protestant=yes}}

'''Adventism''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] movement which began in the 19th century, in the context of the [[Second Great Awakening]] revival in the [[United States]]. The name refers to belief in the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming (or &quot;Second Advent&quot;) of Jesus Christ]]. It was started by [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], whose followers became known as [[Millerism|Millerites]]. Today, the largest church within the movement is the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

The Adventist family of churches are regarded today as conservative [[Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;&quot;Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches&quot; section (p. 256–276) in Frank S. Mead, Samuel S. Hill and Craig D. Atwood, ''Handbook of Denominations in the United States'', 12th edn. Nashville: Abingdon Press&lt;/ref&gt; While they hold much in common, their [[Christian theology|theology]] differs on whether the [[intermediate state]] is [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is [[annihilationism|annihilation]] or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected, and whether the sanctuary of {{bibleverse||Daniel|8|NKJV}} refers to the one in [[heavenly sanctuary|heaven]] or on earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; The movement has encouraged the examination of the [[New Testament]], leading them to observe the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]].

==History==
{{See also|Millerites|Great Disappointment}}
Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Miller's predictions of Christ's return. After the &quot;[[Great Disappointment]]&quot; of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.  Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent ([[second coming]] of Jesus). Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but &quot;spiritually&quot;, and consequently were known as &quot;spiritualizers&quot;. A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted. This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Knight, ''A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- did any continue setting dates? A small minority only? --&gt;

===Albany Conference===
The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement. Following this meeting, the &quot;Millerites&quot; then became known as &quot;Adventists&quot; or &quot;Second Adventists&quot;. However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.  Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the [[Advent Christian Church]], and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

The largest group organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death. They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies. It has diminished to almost non-existence today. Their main publication was the ''Advent Herald'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventistarchives.org/documents.asp?CatID=146&amp;SortBy=1&amp;ShowDateOrder=True partial archives]&lt;/ref&gt; of which [[Sylvester Bliss]] was the editor until his death in 1863. It was later called the ''Messiah’s Herald''. 

The Life and Advent Union was founded by [[George Storrs]] in the year of 1863. He had established ''The Bible Examiner'' in 1842. It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964. 

The [[Advent Christian Church]] officially formed in 1861, and grew rapidly at first. It declined a little over the 20th century.  The Advent Christians publish the four magazines ''The Advent Christian Witness'', ''Advent Christian News'', ''Advent Christian Missions'' and ''Maranatha''. They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a Bible College at Lennox, Massachusetts.  The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] officially formed in 1863.  It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.  It published the ''Adventist Review and Sabbath Herald''.  It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.

Miller did not join any of the movements, and spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.

==Denominations==
The ''Handbook of Denominations in the United States'', 12th edn., describes the following churches as &quot;Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches&quot;:

===Christadelphians===
{{Main|Christadelphians}}
The Christadelphians, were founded in 1844 and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches in 2000 in America.

===Advent Christian Church===
{{Main|Advent Christian Church}} 
The '''Advent Christian Church''' was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.  It is a &quot;first-day&quot; body of Adventist Christians founded on the teachings of William Miller. They adopted the &quot;conditional immortality&quot; views of Charles F. Hudson and [[George Storrs]] formed the &quot;Advent Christian Association&quot; in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in 1860.

====Primitive Advent Christian Church====
{{Main|Primitive Advent Christian Church}}
The '''Primitive Advent Christian Church''' is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church. They differ from the parent body mainly in two points. They observe feet washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized). This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.

===Seventh-day Adventist===
{{Main|Seventh-day Adventist Church}}
The '''Seventh-day Adventist Church''', founded in 1863, and had 16,600,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/2010/10/-about-2900-people-j.html Secretary: Now 16.6 million members, but challenging regions loom large]&lt;/ref&gt; is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]] and is the appropriate day for worship.

====Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement====
{{Main|Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement}}
The '''Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement''' is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members from the Seventh-day Adventist Church caused by disagreement over military service on the Sabbath day during [[World War I]].

====Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association====
{{Main|Shepherd's Rod}}
The '''Davidians''' (originally named '''Shepherd's Rod''') is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still referred to as such.  The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by their founder, [[Victor Houteff]], in 1929.

=====Branch Davidians=====
The [[Branch Davidian]]s were a split (&quot;branch&quot;) from the Davidians. Many of them perished in the infamous [[Waco Siege]] of 1993.

===Church of God (Seventh Day)===
{{Main|General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day)}} 
The '''Church of God (Seventh-Day)''' founded 1863 with an estimated 11,000 members in 185 churches in 1999 in America.  They separated in 1858 from those Adventists associated with Ellen White who later organized as Seventh-day Adventists in 1863. &lt;!-- However, I think some CoG churchmembers claim otherwise. Need to check --&gt; The [[Worldwide Church of God]] splintered from this.&lt;!-- Also need to check this one for variant POVs --&gt; The [[Church of God (7th Day)]] split off in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Church of God and Saints of Christ''' was founded 1896 and had an estimated 40,000 members in approximately 200 congregations in 1999 in America.

===Church of God General Conference===
Many denominations known as &quot;[[Church of God (disambiguation)|Church of God]]&quot; have Adventist origins.

{{Main|Church of God General Conference}}
The '''Church of God General Conference''' was founded in 1921 and had 7,634 members in 162 churches in 2004 in America. It is an Adventist Christian body which is also known as the ''Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith'' and the ''Church of God General Conference (Morrow, GA)''.

====United Seventh-Day Brethren====
{{Main|United Seventh-Day Brethren}}
The '''United Seventh-Day Brethren''' is a small Sabbatarian Adventist body.
In 1947, several individuals and two independent congregations within the Church of God Adventist movement formed the ''United Seventh-Day Brethren'', seeking to increase fellowship and to combine their efforts in evangelism, publications, and other ministries.

===Worldwide Church of God===
{{Main|Worldwide Church of God}}
The '''Worldwide Church of God''' was founded 1933 and had an estimated 63,000 members worldwide in 2004.

====United Church of God====
Following massive doctrinal changes in the Worldwide Church of God, numerous groups split off to retain a more traditional system. The [[United Church of God]] founded in 1995 is the largest such offshoot.

===Other minor Adventist groups===
* '''[[True and Free Adventists]]''', a [[Soviet Union]] offshoot
* At least two denominations and numerous individual churches with a [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] or [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]-type bent have been influenced by or were offshoots from Seventh-day Adventists – see '''[[charismatic Adventism]]''' generally
* '''[[United Sabbath-Day Adventist Church]]''', an [[African-American]] offshoot of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in [[New York City]]
* '''Celestia''', a Christian communal town near [[Laporte, Pennsylvania|Laporte]] in [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]], [[Pennsylvania]], founded by Millerite Peter E. Armstrong. It disintegrated before the end of the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://h0bbes.wordpress.com/2006/10/13/celestia/ Celestia]&quot; blog by Jeff Crocombe, October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other relationships===
The [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students movement]] founded by [[Charles Taze Russell]] had in its early development close connections with the Millerite movement and stalwarts of the Adventist faith, including George Storrs and [[Joseph Seiss]]. The various groupings of Bible Students currently have a cumulative membership of less than 20,000 worldwide. Although the Jehovah's Witnesses (who emerged in 1931 following a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the Bible Students movement that began in 1917) and remaining Bible Students are not generally regarded as part of the Millerite Adventist movement, Russell attended and eventually led an Adventist oriented Bible study church from 1870–74.  Avowing his indebtedness to Adventism, he &quot;was deeply influenced by Adventist thought.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook'', p268&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2008 there were approximately 7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Anglicanism}}

The '''Archbishop of Canterbury''' is the senior [[bishop]] and principal leader of the [[Church of England]], the symbolic head of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], and the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]]. In his role as head of the Anglican Communion, the archbishop leads the third largest group of Christians in the world.

The current archbishop is the [[Most Reverend]] [[Rowan Williams]]. He is the [[list of Archbishops of Canterbury|104th in a line]] that goes back more than 1400 years to [[St Augustine of Canterbury]], the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot;, who founded the Catholic and Orthodox Church in England in the year 597. From the time of St Augustine until the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in [[full communion]] with the [[See of Rome]] and thus received the [[pallium]]. During the [[English Reformation]] the Church of England broke away from the authority of the [[Pope]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], at first temporarily under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI]] and later permanently during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]].

In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other [[bishop]]s.  At various times the choice was made by the [[canon (priest)|canons]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], the [[King of England]], or the Pope. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a [[state church]] and the choice is legally that of the [[British crown]]; today it is made in the name of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], from a shortlist of two selected by an ''ad hoc'' committee called the [[Crown Nominations Commission]].

==Present roles and status==
Today the archbishop fills four main roles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/104 Archbishop's Roles and Responsibilities], Archbishop of Canterbury website . Retrieved 8 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

#He is the diocesan bishop of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], which covers the [[East Kent|east]] parts of the County of [[Kent]]. Founded in 597, it is the oldest [[episcopal see|see]] in the English church.
#He is the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]] of the [[Province of Canterbury]], which covers the southern two-thirds of [[England]].
#As '''Primate of All England''', he is the senior [[primate (religion)|primate]] and chief religious figure of the Church of England (the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British sovereign]] is the &quot;[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme governor]]&quot; of the church). Along with his colleague the [[Archbishop of York]] he chairs the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] and sits or chairs many of the church's important boards and committees; power in the church is not highly centralised, however, so the two archbishops can often lead only through persuasion. The Archbishop of Canterbury plays a central part in national ceremonies such as [[coronation of the British monarch|coronations]]; due to his high public profile, his opinions are often in demand by the [[news media]].
#As spiritual leader of the [[Anglican Communion]], the archbishop, although without legal authority outside England, is recognised by convention as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (first among equals) of all [[Anglican]] [[primate (religion)|primates]] worldwide. Since 1867 he has convened more or less decennial meetings of worldwide Anglican bishops, the [[Lambeth Conferences]].

In the last two of these functions he has an important [[ecumenical]] and [[interfaith]] role, speaking on behalf of Anglicans in England and worldwide.
[[Image:Rowan Williams - by Brian.jpg|thumb|left|115px|The current Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Rowan Williams]].]]
The archbishop's main residence is [[Lambeth Palace]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. He also has lodgings in the Old Palace, [[Canterbury]], located beside [[Canterbury Cathedral]], where the [[Chair of St. Augustine]] sits.

As holder of one of the &quot;five great sees&quot; (the others being [[Archbishop of York|York]], [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]), the Archbishop of Canterbury is ''ex officio'' one of the [[Lords Spiritual]] of the [[House of Lords]]. He is one of the highest-ranking men in England and the highest ranking non-royal in the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|United Kingdom's order of precedence]].

Since [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with [[Rome]], the Archbishops of Canterbury have been selected by the English (British since the Act of Union in 1707) monarch.  Today the choice is made in the name of the monarch by the prime minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad-hoc committee called the [[Crown Nominations Commission]]. Since the twentieth century, the appointment of Archbishops of Canterbury conventionally alternates between more moderate [[Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Evangelicals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofyork.org/154?q=archbishops The Archbishop of Canterbury], website of the Archbishop of York. Retrieved 31 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current archbishop, the Most Reverend and Right Honourable Rowan Douglas Williams, is the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury.  He was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 27 February 2003.  As archbishop he signs himself as ''+ Rowan Cantuar''. Immediately prior to his appointment to Canterbury he was the [[Bishop of Monmouth]] in Wales.  Whilst at Monmouth he was later, for a shorter period, also the [[Archbishop of Wales]].

===Additional roles===
In addition to his office, the archbishop also holds a number of other positions; for example, he is Joint President of [[the Council of Christians and Jews]] in the United Kingdom. Some positions he formally holds ''[[ex officio]]'' and others virtually so (the incumbent of the day, although appointed personally, is appointed because of his office). Amongst these are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldreg/reg06.htm| title = Register of Lords' interests | accessdate = 15 August 2007 | publisher = [[House of Lords]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:Angl-Canterbury-Arms.svg|thumb|right|150px|Arms of the [[episcopal see|see]] of Canterbury. Nearly 500 years after the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], the arms still depict the [[pallium]], a symbol of the authority of the [[Pope]] and metropolitan archbishops.]]
It has been suggested that the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] had four archbishops, seated at [[London]], [[York]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Cirencester]].&lt;ref&gt;Wacher, J., ''The Towns of Roman Britain'', Batsford, 1974, especially pp. 84-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 5th and 6th centuries Britannia began to be overrun by [[paganism|pagan]], [[Germanic peoples]] who came to be known collectively as the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. Of the kingdoms they created, [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] arguably had the closest links with European politics, trade and culture, because it was conveniently sited for communication with the Continent. In the late 6th century, King [[Æthelberht of Kent]] married a Christian [[Franks|Frankish]] princess named [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], possibly before becoming king, and certainly a number of years before the arrival of the first Christian mission to England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02519a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Bertha&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; He permitted the preaching of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bede]], ''[[Ecclesiastical History]]'', i, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Archbishop of Canterbury was [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] (not to be confused with St Augustine of Hippo), who arrived in Kent in 597 AD, having been sent by [[Pope Gregory I]] on a mission to the English. He was accepted by King Æthelbert, on his conversion to Christianity, about the year 598. It seems that Pope Gregory, ignorant of recent developments in the former Roman province, including the spread of the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian heresy]], had intended the new archiepiscopal sees for England to be established in London and York.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', i, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Canterbury was chosen instead of London, owing to political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, N., ''The Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', Leicester University Press, 1984, pp. 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Archbishops of Canterbury have been referred to as occupying the [[Chair of St. Augustine]].

A Gospel Book believed to be directly associated with St. Augstine's mission survives in the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]], [[Cambridge University]], England. Catalogued as Cambridge '''''Manuscript 286''''', it has been positively dated to sixth century Italy and this bound book, the [[St Augustine Gospels]], is still used during the swearing-in ceremony of new archbishops of Canterbury.

Before the break with papal authority in the 16th century, the Church of England was an integral part of the Western European church. Since the break the Church of England, an established national church, still considers itself part of the broader Western Catholic tradition as well as being the &quot;mother church&quot; of the worldwide Anglican Communion.

==Province and Diocese of Canterbury==
The Archbishop of Canterbury exercises metropolitical (or supervisory) jurisdiction over the [[Province of Canterbury]], which encompasses thirty of the forty-four dioceses of the Church of England, with the rest falling within the Province of York.  The four dioceses of Wales were formerly also under the Province of Canterbury until 1920 when they were transferred from the established Church of England to the disestablished [[Church in Wales]].

[[Image:CanterburyCathedral.png|thumb|right|225px|View of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west circa 1890-1900.]]
The Archbishop of Canterbury has a ceremonial provincial ''curia'', or court, consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/events/EnthronementofRW2003.pdf Order of Service from the Enthronement of the 104th Archbishop in 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishop of London]]&amp;mdash;the most senior cleric of the church with the exception of the two archbishops&amp;mdash;serves as Canterbury's provincial [[Dean (Church)|dean]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] as [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] as vice-chancellor, the [[Bishop of Salisbury]] as [[precentor]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] as [[chaplain]] and the [[Bishop of Rochester]] as [[crucifer|cross-bearer]].

Along with [[Primacy of Canterbury|primacy over the Archbishop of York]], the Archbishop of Canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other bishops of the Anglican Communion.  He is recognised as ''primus inter pares'', or first amongst equals.  He does not, however, exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England.

At present the archbishop has three [[suffragan]] bishops:
*The [[Bishop of Dover]] is given the additional title of &quot;Bishop in Canterbury&quot; and empowered to act almost as if he were the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], since the archbishop is so frequently away fulfilling national and international duties.
*Two further suffragans, the [[Bishop of Ebbsfleet]] and the [[Bishop of Richborough]], are [[provincial episcopal visitor]]s for the whole [[Province of Canterbury]], licensed by the archbishop as &quot;flying bishops&quot; to visit parishes throughout the province who are uncomfortable with the ministrations of their local bishop who has participated in the ordination of women.

The [[Bishop of Maidstone]] was previously a second ''actual'' suffragan bishop working in the diocese, until it was decided at the diocesan synod of November 2010 that a new bishop will not be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canterburydiocese.org/diocesansynodnews/index.htm Canterbury Diocese — Synod News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and privileges==
The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York are both styled as &quot;The Most Reverend&quot;; retired archbishops are styled as &quot;The Right Reverend&quot;.  Archbishops are, by convention, appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and may, therefore, also use the style of &quot;[[The Right Honourable]]&quot; for life (unless they are later removed from the council).  In formal documents, the Archbishop of Canterbury is referred to as &quot;The Most Reverend Father in God, [[Given name|Forenames]], by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan&quot;.  In debates in the House of Lords, the archbishop is referred to as &quot;The Most Reverend Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;.  &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; is not used in either instance.  He may also be formally addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;&amp;mdash;or, more often these days, simply as &quot;Archbishop&quot;, &quot;Father&quot; or (in the current instance) &quot;Dr Williams&quot;.
[[Image:Lambeth Palace London 240404.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|The Archbishop of Canterbury's official London residence is Lambeth Palace, photographed looking east across the [[River Thames]].]]

The surname of the Archbishop of Canterbury is not always used in formal documents; often only the first name and see are mentioned.  The archbishop is legally entitled to sign his name as &quot;Cantuar&quot; (from the [[Latin]] for Canterbury).  The right to use only a title as a legal signature is only permitted to bishops, [[Peers of the Realm]] and peers by courtesy.  The current Archbishop of Canterbury usually signs as &quot;+Rowan Cantuar:&quot;.

In the English order of precedence, the Archbishop of Canterbury is ranked above all individuals in the realm, with the exception of the Sovereign and members of the Royal Family.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', 2008, p43 - (Precedence, England and Wales)&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately below him is the [[Lord Chancellor]] and then the Archbishop of York.

==Residences==
The Archbishop of Canterbury's official residence in London is [[Lambeth Palace]].
He also has a residence next to [[Canterbury Cathedral]] on the site of the medieval Archbishop's Palace.
The archbishops had palaces on the periphery of London and on the route between London and Canterbury.

Former palaces of the archbishops include
* [[Croydon Palace]]: the summer residence of the Archbishops from the 15th to the 18th centuries.
* [[Addington Palace]]: purchased as a replacement for Croydon Palace in 1807; sold in 1897.
* [[Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone]] : constructed in the 1390s, the palace was seized by the Crown at the time of the Reformation.
* [[Otford Palace]]: a medieval palace, rebuilt by Archbishop Warham c. 1515 and forfeited to the Crown by Thomas Cranmer in 1537.
* [[Archbishop's Palace, Charing]] : a palace existed from at least the 13th century; seized by the Crown after the Dissolution.
* [[Knole House]]: built by Archbishop Bourchier in the second half of the 15th century, it was forfeited to the Crown by Archbishop Cranmer in 1538.
* The Old Palace, Bekesbourne, built c. 1552 for Archbishop Cranmer&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/philipdavis/English%20sites/4000.html&lt;br /&gt;Tim Tatton Brown, ''Lambeth Palace: A History of the Archbishops of Canterbury and Their Houses'' (2000) p.73-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albion''' is a city in [[Calhoun County, Michigan|Calhoun County]] in the south central region of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] of the [[US state]] of [[Michigan]]. The population was 9,144 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]] and is part of the [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]] [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. From the time that the earliest English-speaking settlers arrived, the area has also been known as ''The Forks'', because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the [[Kalamazoo River]]. The ''Festival of the Forks'' has been held annually since 1967 to celebrate Albion's ethnic heritage.

The presence of several major manufacturers since the 19th century has given Albion the reputation of a factory town. This has changed with the closure of several manufacturers, and Albion's culture is changing to that of a college town with a strong interest in technology and sustainability issues.  [[Albion College]] is a private liberal arts college with a student population of about 1,750. Albion is a [[sister city]] with [[Noisy-le-Roi]], France.

Albion is the birthplace of food writer [[M. F. K. Fisher]].

==History==
The first European-American settler, Tenney Peabody, arrived in 1833 along with his brother-in-law Charles Blanchard, and a young man named Clark Dowling. Peabody's family followed soon after. In 1835, the Albion Company, a land development company formed by [[Jesse Crowell]], [[plat]]ted a village and Peabody's wife was asked to name the settlement. She considered the name &quot;Peabodyville&quot;, but &quot;Albion&quot; was selected instead, after the former residence of Jesse Crowell. Crowell became the first postmaster in 1838. Albion incorporated as a village in 1855 and as a city in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/000910.shtml#TOP &quot;Festival of the Forks&quot;], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 10, 2000, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/960909.shtml &quot;The Passing Scene&quot;], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 9, 2001, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] settlers established [[Albion College]], which was known by a few other names before 1861 when the college was fully authorized to confer four-year degrees on both men and women. The first classes were held in Albion in 1843.

The forks of the Kalamazoo River provided power for [[Watermill|mills]], and Albion quickly became a mill town as well as an agricultural market. A railroad line arrived in 1852, fostering the development of other industries.

In 1973 Albion was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] by the [[National Civic League]]. It celebrated winning the award on May 15, 1974 when the Governor of Michigan, [[William Milliken]], and many dignitaries came to town. However, in 1975 the closure of a major factory cut the celebration short and new challenges were created overnight.

Since that time citizens have mobilized, with support from the Albion Community Foundation founded in 1968, and the Albion Volunteer Service Organization, founded in the 1980s with support from Albion College, to address the challenge of diminishing economic opportunity.

'''Anointing of the Sick''' is distinguished from other forms of religious [[anointing]] or &quot;unction&quot; (an older term with the same meaning) in that it is intended, as its name indicates, for the benefit of a sick person. Other religious anointings occur in relation to other [[sacrament]]s, in particular [[baptism]], [[confirmation]] and [[ordination]], and also in the [[coronation]] of a [[monarch]].&lt;ref name=ODCC&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3), article &quot;unction&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Since 1972, the Roman Catholic Church uses the name '''Anointing of the Sick''' both in the English translations issued by the [[Holy See]] of its official documents in [[Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19721130_sacram-unctionem_en.html Apostolic Constitution ''Sacram Unctionem Infirmorum''], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c2a5.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3J.HTM Code of Canon Law], [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/general-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19930325_directory_en.html Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism], [http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html motu proprio ''Summorum Pontificum'', etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the English official documents of [[Episcopal conference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.usccbpublishing.org/client/client_pages/USCCAAFF.cfm#Sacraments United States Catholic Catechism for Adults]&lt;/ref&gt; It does not, of course, forbid the use of other names, for example the more archaic term &quot;Unction of the Sick&quot; or the term &quot;Extreme Unction&quot;. Cardinal [[Walter Kasper]] used the latter term in his intervention at the 2005 Assembly of the [[Synod of Bishops]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/sinodo/documents/bollettino_21_xi-ordinaria-2005/02_inglese/b13_02.html#-_H._Em._Card._Walter_KASPER,_President_of_the_Pontifical_Council_for_the_Promotion_of_Christian_Unity_(VATICAN_CITY)_ Holy See Press Office bulletin]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Church declared that &quot;'Extreme unction' ... may also ''and more fittingly'' be called 'anointing of the sick'&quot; (emphasis added),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html Constitution on the Liturgy], 73&lt;/ref&gt; and has itself adopted the latter term, while not outlawing the former. This is to emphasize that the sacrament is available, and recommended, to all those suffering from any serious illness, and to dispel the common misconception that it is exclusively for those at or very near the point of death.

'''Extreme Unction''' was the usual name for the sacrament in the West from the late twelfth century until 1972, and was thus used at the [[Council of Trent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/early/Trent/CT14UNCT.html Fourteenth Session]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1913 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05716a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)]: article &quot;Extreme Unction&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Lombard]] (died 1160) is the first writer known to have used the term,&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; which did not become the usual name in the West till towards the end of the twelfth century, and never became current in the East.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; The word &quot;extreme&quot; (final) indicated either that it was the last of the sacramental unctions (after the anointings at Baptism, Confirmation and, if received, Holy Orders) or because at that time it was normally administered only when a patient was ''in extremis''&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt;

Other names used in the West include '''the unction or blessing of consecrated oil''', '''the unction of God''', and '''the office of the unction'''.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

In the Greek Church the sacrament is called '''Euchelaion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Εὐχέλαιον, from εὐχή, &quot;prayer&quot;, and ἔλαιον, &quot;oil&quot;).&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; Other names are also used, such as ἅγιον ἔλαιον (holy oil), ἡγιασμένον ἔλαιον (consecrated oil), and χρῖσις or χρῖσμα (anointing).&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

The [[Community of Christ]] uses the term '''administration to the sick'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/default.asp Community of Christ: The Sacraments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;[[last rites]]&quot; refers to administration to a dying person not only of this sacrament but also of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] and [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]], the last of which, when administered in such circumstances, is known as &quot;[[Viaticum]]&quot;, a word whose original meaning in [[Latin]] was &quot;provision for the journey&quot;. The normal order of administration is: first Penance (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given), then Anointing, then Viaticum (if the person can receive it).

==Biblical texts==
The chief [[Bible|Biblical]] text concerning the rite is {{Bibleverse||James|5:14-15}}: &quot;Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.&quot; (RSV)

{{Bibleverse||Matthew|10:8}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|10:8-9}} and {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:13}} are also quoted in this regard.

==Sacramental Beliefs ==
The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/5_unction_sick.html Sacrament of Unction of the Sick]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/liturgy/old_catholic_ritual/unction.html Unction of the Sick]; etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Churches consider this anointing to be a sacrament. Other Christians too, in particular [[Anglican]]s, Lutherans and some [[Protestant]] and other Christian communities use a rite of anointing the sick, without necessarily classifying it as a sacrament.

In the Churches mentioned here by name, the oil used (called &quot;oil of the sick&quot; in both West and East)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/easternorthodox_4.shtml Sacred Mysteries (sacraments)]&lt;/ref&gt; is blessed specifically for this purpose.

=== Roman Catholic Church ===
{{main|Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)}}
An extensive account of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Anointing of the Sick is given in [http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt2art5.shtml ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1499&amp;ndash;1532.]

Anointing of the Sick is one of the seven [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|Sacraments]] recognized by the Catholic Church, and is associated with not only bodily healing but also forgiveness of sins. Only [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|ordained priests]] can administer it,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Every priest, but only a priest, can validly administer the anointing of the sick&quot; ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3K.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1003 §1])&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;any priest may carry the holy oil with him, so that in a case of necessity he can administer the sacrament of anointing of the sick.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3K.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1003 §3])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sacramental graces====
&lt;!--Will move to Catholic Specific Article--&gt;
The Catholic Church sees the effects of the sacrament as follows. As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish at the thought of death and the struggle of death; it prevents from losing Christian [[hope]] in God's justice, truth and salvation.

The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects:
*the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and that of the whole Church;
*the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian manner the sufferings of illness or old age;
*the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of penance;
*the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul;
*the preparation for passing over to eternal life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1532]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sacramental Oil====
The duly blessed oil used in the sacrament is, as laid down in the Apostolic Constitution [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19721130_sacram-unctionem_en.html Sacram unctionem infirmorum], pressed from olives or from other plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4K.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1513]&lt;/ref&gt; It is blessed by the bishop of the diocese at the [[Chrism]] Mass he celebrates on [[Holy Thursday]] or on a day close to it. If oil blessed by the bishop is not available, the priest administering the sacrament may bless the oil, but only within the framework of the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3J.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 999]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current liturgical form (1972)====
The [[Roman Rite]] Anointing of the Sick, as revised in 1972, puts greater stress than in the immediately preceding centuries on the sacrament's aspect of healing, and points to the place sickness holds in the normal life of Christians and its part in the redemptive work of the Church.&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; Canon law permits its administration to any Catholic who has reached the age of reason and is beginning to be put in danger by illness or old age,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The anointing of the sick can be administered to any member of the faithful who, having reached the use of reason, begins to be in danger by reason of illness or old age&quot; ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3L.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1004 §1]).&lt;/ref&gt; unless the person in question obstinately persists in a manifestly grave sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3L.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1007]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;If there is any doubt as to whether the sick person has reached the use of reason, or is dangerously ill, or is dead, this sacrament is to be administered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3L.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1005]&lt;/ref&gt; There is an obligation to administer it to the sick who, when they were in possession of their faculties, at least implicitly asked for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3L.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1006]&lt;/ref&gt; A new illness or a renewal or worsening of the first illness enables a person to receive the sacrament a further time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3L.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1004 §2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacrament can be administered within [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], which is the preferred manner.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 26&lt;/ref&gt; If the celebration takes place outside of Mass, it can be held in the home, in a hospital or institution, or in church.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 111&lt;/ref&gt; The rite begins with a greeting by the priest, followed by sprinkling of all present with holy water, if deemed desirable, and a short instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 115-117&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a penitential act, as at the beginning of Mass.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 118&lt;/ref&gt; If the sick person wishes to receive the sacrament of penance, it is preferable that the priest make himself available for this during a previous visit; but if the sick person must confess during the celebration of the sacrament of anointing, this confession replaces the penitential rite&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 113&lt;/ref&gt; A passage of Scripture is read, and the priest may give a brief explanation of the reading, a short litany is said, and the priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person and then says a prayer of thanksgiving over the already blessed oil or, if necessary, blesses the oil himself.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 119-123&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual anointing of the sick person is done on the forehead, with the prayer &quot;Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit&quot;, and on the hands, with the prayer &quot;May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up&quot;. To each prayer the sick person, if able, responds: &quot;Amen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 124&quot;&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  It is permitted, in accordance with local culture and traditions and the condition of the sick person, to anoint other parts of the body in addition, such as the area of pain or injury, but without repeating the sacramental form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 124&quot;/&gt;  In case of emergency, a single anointing, not necessarily on the forehead, is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Care of the Sick, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historic liturgical form====
From the early [[Middle Ages]] until after the Second Vatican Council the sacrament was administered, within the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]], only when [[death]] was approaching and, in practice, bodily recovery was not ordinarily looked for,&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; giving rise, as mentioned above to the name '''Extreme Unction''' (i.e. final anointing). The form used in the [[Roman Rite]] included anointing of seven parts of the body while saying (in [[Latin]]): &quot;Through this holy unction and His own most tender mercy may the Lord pardon thee whatever sins or faults thou hast committed [quidquid deliquisti] by sight [by hearing, smell, taste, touch, walking, carnal delectation]&quot;, the last phrase corresponding to the part of the body that was touched; however, in the words of the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, &quot;the unction of the loins is generally, if not universally, omitted in English-speaking countries, and it is of course everywhere forbidden in case of women&quot;.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; Use of this form is still permitted under the conditions mentioned in article 9 of the 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html Summorum Pontificum, art. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, both Western and Eastern, other than the Roman, have a variety of other forms for celebrating the sacrament.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
The teaching of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on the [[sacrament|Holy Mystery]] (sacrament) of Unction is similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church. However, the reception of the Mystery is not limited to those who are enduring physical illness. The Mystery is given for healing (both physical and spiritual) and for the forgiveness of sin. For this reason, it is normally required that one go to [[Confession]] before receiving Unction. Because it is a Sacred Mystery of the Church, only Orthodox Christians may receive it.

The solemn form of Eastern Christian anointing requires the ministry of seven priests. A table is prepared, upon which is set a vessel containing [[wheat]]. Into the wheat has been placed an empty shrine-lamp, seven candles, and seven anointing brushes. Candles are distributed for all to hold during the service. The rite begins with reading [[Psalm 51|Psalm 50]] (the great penitential psalm), followed by the chanting of a special [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. After this, the senior priest (or bishop) pours pure olive oil and a small amount of wine into the shrine lamp, and says the &quot;Prayer of the Oil&quot;, which calls upon God to &quot;...sanctify this Oil, that it may be effectual for those who shall be anointed therewith, unto healing, and unto relief from every passion, every malady of the flesh and of the spirit, and every ill...&quot; Then follow seven series of [[Epistle]]s, [[Gospel]]s, long prayers, [[Ektenia]]s (litanies) and anointings. Each series is served by one of the seven priests in turn. The afflicted one is anointed with the [[sign of the cross]] on seven places: the forehead, the nostirls, the cheeks, the lips, the breast, the palms of both hands, and the back of the hands. After the last anointing, the [[Gospel Book]] is opened and placed with the writing down upon the head of the one who was anointed, and the senior priest reads the &quot;Prayer of the Gospel&quot;. At the end, the anointed kisses the Gospel, the Cross and the right hands of the priests, receiving their blessing.

Anointing is considered to be a public rather than a private sacrament, and so as many of the faithful who are able are encouraged to attend. It should be celebrated in the church when possible, but if this is impossible, it may be served in the home or hospital room of the afflicted.

Unction in the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and Churches of Hellenic custom ([[Melkite]], [[Antiochian Orthodox]], etc.) is usually given with a minimum of ceremony.

Anointing may also be given during [[Clean Monday|Forgiveness Vespers]] and [[Holy Week|Great Week]], on [[Holy Wednesday|Great and Holy Wednesday]], to all who are prepared. Those who receive Unction on Holy Wednesday should go to [[Holy Communion]] on [[Maundy Thursday]]. The significance of receiving Unction on Holy Wednesday is shored up by the hymns in the [[Triodion]] for that day, which speak of the sinful woman who anointed the feet of Christ ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:6-16|KJV}}). Just as her sins were forgiven because of her penitence, so the faithful are exhorted to repent of their sins. In the same narrative, Jesus says, &quot;in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial&quot; (Id., v. 12), linking the unction with Christ's death and resurrection.

In some [[diocese]]s of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] it is customary for the bishop to visit each parish or region of the diocese some time during [[Great Lent]] and give Anointing for the faithful, together with the local clergy.

=== Liberal Catholic Church ===
The purpose of the Service of Healing is twofold; first, to bring spiritual upliftment to those who are in sore need thereof; secondly, to give some relief, when possible, to those who are suffering from various physical ills.

During the anointing and the laying on of hands the attitude of the patient should be that of love for our Lord Jesus Christ and confidence in His mighty power. The whole nature should be opened to the downpouring spiritual influence, even as a flower opens its petals to the sun. The less the thoughts of a person are centered upon himself/herself at this moment, the more the depths of his nature are responsive to the compassionate presence of the Christ, and the greater is the possibility of cure.

The greatest means of spiritual aid and physical healing is now given to the patient in the Holy Communion. No greater help both for body and soul can be offered than this, for with the reception of the sacred Host the human body becomes for a few hours a veritable shrine, radiating the glowing love and power of Jesus Christ.

===Anglican churches===
The 1552 and later editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] omitted the form of anointing given in the original (1549) version in its Order for the Visitation of the Sick, but most twentieth-century Anglican prayer books do have anointing of the sick.&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt;

Some [[Anglican]]s accept that anointing of the sick has a sacramental character and is therefore a channel of God's grace, seeing it as an &quot;outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace&quot; which is the definition of a sacrament. The Catechism of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America includes Unction of the Sick as among the &quot;other sacramental rites&quot; and it states that unction can be done with oil or simply with laying on of hands.&lt;ref&gt;Episcopal Church, 1979 Book of Common Prayer, p.860&lt;/ref&gt; The rite of anointing is included in the Episcopal Church's &quot;Ministration to the Sick&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Episcopal Church, 1979 Book of Common Prayer, p.456&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 25 of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], speaking of the sacraments, says: &quot;Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#25 Thirty-Nine Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Christian Communities===
Among Protestants, anointing is provided in a wide variety of formats but, for the most part, however, it has fallen into disuse.  Protestant communities generally vary widely on the sacramental character of anointing. Most Mainline Protestants recognize only two sacraments, the [[Eucharist]] and [[Baptism]] (though some Lutherans add [[confession]]), deeming Anointing only a humanly-instituted rite. Non-traditional Protestant communities generally use the term &quot;[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinance]]&quot; rather than &quot;Sacrament&quot;.

====Mainline beliefs====
[[Liturgical]] or [[Mainline Protestant]] communities (e.g. [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]]/[[United Church of Christ]], [[Methodist]], [[Lutheran]], etc.) all have official yet often optional liturgical rites for the anointing of the sick partly on the model of [[Latin Rite|Western]] pre-Reformation rites. Anointing need not be associated with grave illness or imminent danger of death.  [[Lutheran]] communities in particular have the practice of anointing the sick, or have always offered the rite since the [[Protestant Reformation]] with varying degrees of frequency.

====Charismatic and Pentecostal beliefs====
In [[Charismatic (Christians)|Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostal]] communities, anointing of the sick is a frequent practice and has been an important ritual in these communities since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who need not be a pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing and so there is often great expectation or at least great hope that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.

====Evangelical and fundamentalist beliefs ====
In [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalist]] communities, anointing of the sick is performed with varying degrees of frequency, although laying on of hands may be more common than anointing. The rite would be similar to that of Pentecostals in its simplicity, but would usually not have the same emotionalism attached to it. Unlike Pentecostals, Evangelicals and Fundamentalists generally do not believe that physical healing is within the anointing. Therefore, God may or may not grant physical healing to the sick. The healing conferred by anointing is thus a spiritual event that may not result in physical recovery.

====Use of Catholic rite among Protestants====
Some Protestant US military chaplains carry the [[Roman Rite]] version of the Anointing of the Sick with them for use if called upon to assist wounded or dying soldiers who are Catholics. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider invalid ''as a sacrament'' the administration of Anointing of the Sick by such chaplains, who in the eyes of those Churches are not validly ordained priests. The rite performed by them is thus seen as having the same by no means negligible value of any other form of prayer offered for the sick or dying.

=== Latter Day Saints and Restorationists===
[[Latter Day Saint]]s—who consider themselves [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationists]] rather than Protestants—also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing. Members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] often, but not exclusively consider anointing to be an [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] (see [[:category:Latter Day Saint ordinances, rituals, and symbolism]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Curriculum/home%20and%20family.htm/gospel%20art%20picture%20kit.htm/600%20%20gospel%20in%20action.htm/613%20administering%20to%20the%20sick.htm 613 Administering to the Sick]&quot;, ''LSD.org Gospel Topics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Community of Christ]], an independent group within the Latter Day Saints movement, [[Sacraments (Community of Christ)#Administration to the sick|Administration to the sick]] is one of the eight [[Sacraments (Community of Christ)|sacraments]]. In the Community of Christ the sacrament of administration to the sick has also been known to be used for people seeking spiritual, emotional or mental healing.

In [[computing]], an '''abstract data type''' ('''ADT''') is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] model for a certain class of [[data structure]]s that have similar behavior; or for certain [[data type]]s of one or more [[programming languages]] that have similar [[semantics]].  An abstract data type is defined indirectly, only by the operations that may be performed on it and by mathematical constraints on the effects (and possibly [[computational complexity|cost]]) of those operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;liskov&quot;&gt;[[Barbara Liskov]], Programming with Abstract Data Types, in Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Very High Level Languages, pp. 50--59, 1974, Santa Monica, California&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, an abstract [[stack data structure]] could be defined by three operations: &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;, that inserts some data item onto the structure, &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;, that extracts an item from it (with the constraint that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet), and &lt;code&gt;peek&lt;/code&gt;, that allows data on top of the structure to be examined without removal.  When [[analysis of algorithms|analyzing the efficiency]] of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.

Abstract data types are purely theoretical entities, used (among other things) to simplify the description of abstract algorithms, to classify and evaluate data structures, and to formally describe the [[type system]]s of programming languages.  However, an ADT may be [[implementation|implemented]] by specific [[data type]]s or [[data structure]]s, in many ways and in many programming languages; or described in a [[formal specification language]].  ADTs are often implemented as [[modular programming|modules]]: the module's [[interface (computer science)|interface]] declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, sometimes with [[comment (computer programming)|comments]] that describe the constraints. This [[information hiding]] strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the [[client (computing)|client]] programs.  

The term '''abstract data type''' can also be regarded as a generalised approach of a number of algebraic structures, such as lattices, groups, and rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rudolf Lidl | title=Abrtract Algebra| publisher=Springer | year=2004 | isbn=81-8128-149-7}}, Chapter 7,section 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be treated as part of subject area of [[Artificial intelligence]]. The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of [[data abstraction]], important in [[object-oriented programming language|object-oriented programming]] and [[design by contract]] methodologies for [[software engineering|software development]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

==Defining an abstract data type (ADT)==
An Abstract Data type is defined as a mathematical model  of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects.
There are no standard conventions for defining them. A broad division may be drawn between &quot;imperative&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; definition styles.

=== Imperative abstract data type definitions ===

In the &quot;imperative&quot; view, which is closer to the philosophy of [[imperative programming]] languages, an abstract data structure is conceived as an entity that is ''mutable'' — meaning that it may be in different ''states'' at different times. Some operations may change the state of the ADT; therefore, the order in which operations are evaluated is important, and the same operation on the same entities may have different effects if executed at different times — just like the instructions of a computer, or the commands and procedures of an imperative language. To underscore this view, it is customary to say that the operations are ''executed'' or ''applied'', rather than ''evaluated''.  The imperative style is often used when describing abstract algorithms.This is described by Donald E.Knuth and can be referenced from here [[The Art of Computer Programming]].

==== Abstract variable ====
Imperative ADT definitions often depend on the concept of an ''abstract variable'', which may be regarded as the simplest non-trivial ADT.  An abstract variable ''V'' is a mutable entity that admits two operations:
*&lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''V'',''x'') where ''x'' is a ''value'' of unspecified nature; and
*&lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;(''V''), that yields a value;
with the constraint that
*&lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;(''V'') always returns the value ''x'' used in the most recent &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''V'',''x'') operation on the same variable ''V''.
'''
As in many programming languages, the operation &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''V'',''x'') is often written ''V'' ← ''x'' (or some similar notation), and &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;(''V'') is implied whenever a variable ''V'' is used in a context where a value is required. Thus, for example, ''V'' ← ''V'' + 1 is commonly understood to be a shorthand for &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''V'',&lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;(''V'') + 1).

In this definition, it is implicitly assumed that storing a value into a variable ''U'' has no effect on the state of a distinct variable ''V''.  To make this assumption explicit, one could add the constraint that
*if ''U'' and ''V'' are distinct variables, the sequence { &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''U'',''x''); &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''V'',''y'') } is equivalent to { &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''V'',''y''); &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;(''U'',''x'') }.

More generally, ADT definitions often assume that any operation that changes the state of one ADT instance has no effect on the state of any other  instance (including other instances of the same ADT) — unless the ADT axioms imply that the two instances are connected ([[aliasing (computer science)|aliased]]) in that sense.  For example, when extending the definition of abstract variable to include abstract [[record (computer science)|records]], the operation that selects a field from a record variable ''R'' must yield a variable ''V'' that is aliased to that part of ''R''.

The definition of an abstract variable ''V'' may also restrict the stored values ''x'' to members of a specific set ''X'', called the ''range'' or ''type'' of ''V''.  As in programming languages, such restrictions may simplify the description and [[analysis of algorithms]], and improve their readability.

Note that this definition does not imply anything about the result of evaluating &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;(''V'') when ''V'' is ''un-initialized'', that is, before performing any &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; operation on ''V''.  An algorithm that does so is usually considered invalid, because its effect is not defined.  (However, there are some important algorithms whose efficiency strongly depends on the assumption that such a &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; is legal, and returns some arbitrary value in the variable's range.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}})

==== Instance creation ====
Some algorithms need to create new instances of some ADT (such as new variables, or new stacks).  To describe such algorithms, one usually includes in the ADT definition a &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;() operation that yields an instance of the ADT, usually with axioms equivalent to
* the result of &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;() is distinct from any instance ''S'' in use by the algorithm.
This axiom may be strengthened to exclude also partial aliasing with other instances.  On the other hand, this axiom still allows implementations of &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;() to yield a previously created instance that has become inaccessible to the program.

==== Preconditions, postconditions, and invariants ====
In imperative-style definitions, the axioms are often expressed by ''preconditions'', that specify when an operation may be executed; ''postconditions'', that relate the states of the ADT before and after the execution of each operation; and ''invariants'', that specify properties of the ADT that are ''not'' changed by the operations.

==== Example: abstract stack (imperative) ====
As another example, an imperative definition of an abstract stack could specify that the state of a stack ''S'' can be modified only by the operations
*&lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'' ,''x''), where ''x'' is some ''value'' of unspecified nature; and
*&lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''S''), that yields a value as a result;
with the constraint that
*For any value ''x'' and any abstract variable ''V'', the sequence of operations { &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''x''); ''V'' ← &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''S'') } is equivalent to { ''V'' ← ''x'' };

Since the assignment { ''V'' ← ''x'' }, by definition, cannot change the state of ''S'', this condition implies that { ''V'' ← &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''S'') } restores ''S'' to the state it had before the { &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''x'') }.  From this condition and from the properties of abstract variables, it follows, for example, that the sequence
: { &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''x''); &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''y''); ''U'' ← &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''S''); &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''z''); ''V'' ← &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''S''); ''W'' ← &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''S''); }
where ''x'',''y'', and ''z'' are any values, and ''U'', ''V'', ''W'' are pairwise distinct variables, is equivalent to 
: { ''U'' ← ''y''; ''V'' ← ''z''; ''W'' ← ''x'' }

Here it is implicitly assumed that operations on a stack instance do not modify the state of any other ADT instance, including other stacks; that is,
*For any values ''x'',''y'', and any distinct stacks ''S'' and ''T'', the sequence { &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''x''); &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''T'',''y'') } is equivalent to { &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''T'',''y''); &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''x'') }.

A stack ADT definition usually includes also a [[Boolean value|Boolean]]-valued function &lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt;(''S'') and a &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;() operation that returns a stack instance, with axioms equivalent to
* &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;() ≠ ''S'' for any stack ''S'' (a newly created stack is distinct from all previous stacks)
* &lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;()) (a newly created stack is empty)
* &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''x'')) (pushing something into a stack makes it non-empty)

==== Single-instance style ====
Sometimes an ADT is defined as if only one instance of it existed during the execution of the algorithm, and all operations were applied to that instance, which is not explicitly notated.  For example, the abstract stack above could have been defined with operations &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''x'') and &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(), that operate on &quot;the&quot; only existing stack.  ADT definitions in this style can be easily rewritten to admit multiple coexisting instances of the ADT, by adding an explicit instance parameter (like ''S'' in the previous example) to every operation that uses or modifies the implicit instance.

On the other hand, some ADTs cannot be meaningfully defined without assuming multiple instances. This is the case when a single operation takes two distinct instances of the ADT as parameters. For an example, consider augmenting the definition of the stack ADT with an operation &lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;(''S'',''T'') that checks whether the stacks ''S'' and ''T'' contain the same items in the same order.

=== Functional ADT definitions ===
Another way to define an ADT, closer to the spirit of [[functional programming]], is to consider each state of the structure as a separate entity.  In this view, any operation that modifies the ADT is modeled as a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] that takes the old state as an argument, and returns the new state as part of the result.  Unlike the &quot;imperative&quot; operations, these functions have no [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s. Therefore, the order in which they are evaluated is immaterial, and the same operation applied to the same arguments (including the same input states) will always return the same results (and output states).

In the functional view, in particular, there is no way (or need) to define an &quot;abstract variable&quot; with the semantics of imperative variables (namely, with &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; operations).  Instead of storing values into variables, one passes them as arguments to functions.

==== Example: abstract stack (functional) ====

For example, a complete functional-style definition of a stack ADT could use the three operations:
* &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;: takes a stack state and an arbitrary value, returns a stack state;
* &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;: takes a stack state, returns a value;
* &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;: takes a stack state, returns a stack state;
with the following axioms:
* &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''s'',''x'')) = ''x''  (pushing an item onto a stack leaves it at the top)
* &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''s'',''x'')) = ''s''  (&lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; undoes the effect of &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;)

In a functional-style definition there is no need for a &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; operation. Indeed, there is no notion of &quot;stack instance&quot;.  The stack states can be thought of as being potential states of a single stack structure, and two stack states that contain the same values in the same order are considered to be identical states.  This view actually mirrors the behavior of some concrete implementations, such as [[linked list]]s with [[hash cons]].

Instead of &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;(), a functional definition of a stack ADT may assume the existence of a special stack state, the ''empty stack'', designated by a special symbol like Λ or &quot;()&quot;; or define a &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;() operation that takes no aguments and returns this special stack state. Note that the axioms imply that 
* &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(Λ,''x'') ≠ Λ
In a functional definition of a stack one does not need an &lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt; predicate: instead, one can test whether a stack is empty by testing whether it is equal to Λ.

Note that these axioms do not define the effect of &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;(''s'') or &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''s''), unless ''s'' is a stack state returned by a &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; leaves the stack non-empty, those two operations are undefined (hence invalid) when ''s'' = Λ.  On the other hand, the axioms (and the lack of side effects) imply that &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''s'',''x'') = &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''t'',''y'') [[if and only if]] ''x'' = ''y'' and ''s'' = ''t''.

As in some other branches of mathematics, it is customary to assume also that the stack states are only those whose existence can be proved from the axioms in a finite number of steps. In the stack ADT example above, this rule means that every stack is a ''finite'' sequence of values, that becomes the empty stack (Λ) after a finite number of &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;s. By themselves, the axioms above do not exclude the existence of infinite stacks (that can be &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;ed forever, each time yielding a different state) or circular stacks (that return to the same state after a finite number of &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;s). In particular, they do not exclude states ''s'' such that &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''s'') = ''s'' or &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;(''s'',''x'') = ''s'' for some ''x''. However, since one cannot obtain such stack states with the given operations, they are assumed &quot;not to exist&quot;.

== Typical operations ==

Some operations that are often specified for ADTs (possibly under other names) are

* &lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;(''s'',''t''), that tests whether two structures are equivalent in some sense;
* &lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt;(''s''), that computes some standard [[hash function]] from the instance's state;
* &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;(''s'') or &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt;(''s''), that produces a human-readable representation of the structure's state.

In imperative-style ADT definitions, one often finds also

* &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;(), that yields a new instance of the ADT;
* &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt;(''s''), that prepares a newly-created instance ''s'' for further operations, or resets it to some &quot;initial state&quot;;
* &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt;(''s'',''t''), that puts instance ''s'' in a state equivalent to that of ''t'';
* &lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt;(''t''), that performs ''s'' ← &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;(),  &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt;(''s'',''t''), and returns ''s'';
* &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;(''s'') or &lt;code&gt;destroy&lt;/code&gt;(''s''), that reclaims the memory and other resources used by ''s'';

The &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; operation is not normally relevant or meaningful, since ADTs are theoretical entities that do not &quot;use memory&quot;.  However, it may be necessary when one needs to analyze the storage used by an algorithm that uses the ADT. In that case one needs additional axioms that specify how much memory each ADT instance uses, as a function of its state, and how much of it is returned to the pool by &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;.

== Examples ==
Some common ADTs, which have proved useful in a great variety of applications, are
&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:4; column-count:4;&quot;&gt;
*[[Container (data structure)|Container]]
*[[Deque]]
*[[List (computing)|List]]
*[[Associative array|Map]]
*[[Multimap]]
*[[Set (computer_science)#Multiset|Multiset]]
*[[Priority queue]]
*[[Queue (data structure)|Queue]]
*[[Set (computer science)|Set]]
*[[Stack (data structure)|Stack]]
*[[String (computer science)|String]]
*[[Tree (computer science)|Tree]]
&lt;/div&gt;

Each of these ADTs may be defined in many ways and variants, not necessarily equivalent.  For example, a stack ADT may or may not have a &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; operation that tells how many items have been pushed and not yet popped. This choice makes a difference not only for its clients but also for the implementation.

== Implementation ==
Implementing an ADT means providing one [[subroutine|procedure or function]] for each abstract operation. The ADT instances are represented by some concrete [[data structure]] that is manipulated by those procedures, according to the ADT's specifications. 

Usually there are many ways to implement the same ADT, using several different concrete data structures.  Thus, for example, an abstract stack can be implemented by a [[linked list]] or by an [[Array data structure|array]].

An ADT implementation is often packaged as one or more [[module (programming)|modules]], whose interface contains only the signature (number and types of the parameters and results) of the operations.  The implementation of the module — namely, the bodies of the procedures and the concrete data structure used — can then be hidden from most clients of the module.  This makes it possible to change the implementation without affecting the clients. 

When implementing an ADT, each instance (in imperative-style definitions) or each state (in functional-style definitions) is usually represented by a [[handle (computing)|handle]] of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Sedgewick | title=Algorithms in C | publisher=Addison/Wesley | year=1998 | isbn=0-201-31452-5}}, definition 4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern object-oriented languages, such as [[C++]] and [[Java programming language|Java]], support a form of abstract data types. When a class is used as a type, it is a abstract type that refers to a hidden representation. In this model an ADT is typically implemented as [[class (computer science)|class]], and each instance of the ADT is an [[object (computer science)|object]] of that class.  The module's interface typically declares the constructors as ordinary procedures, and most of the other ADT operations as [[method (computer science)|methods]] of that class. However, such an approach does not easily encapsulate multiple representational variants found in an ADT. It also can undermine the extensibility of object-oriented programs.
In a pure object-oriented program that uses interfaces as types, types refer to behaviors not representations.

=== Example: implementation of the stack ADT ===
&lt;!-- This section should be moved to [[stack data structure]] or a new [[abstract stack]] article. --&gt;
As an example, here is an implementation of the stack ADT above in the C programming language.&lt;!-- Replace &lt;pre&gt; by &lt;source &quot;lang=c&quot;&gt; after the color scheme has been fixed. The light green paentheses on gray background, in particular, are unreadable (and silly, IMHO). Text must always have substantial *lightness* (CIE Y) contrast. This complaint should be moved to the technical village pump or some such. --&gt;

''' Imperative-style interface '''

An imperative-style interface might be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;        /* Type: instance representation (an opaque record). */
typedef stack_Rep *stack_T;                /* Type: handle to a stack instance (an opaque pointer). */
typedef void *stack_Item;                  /* Type: value that can be stored in stack (arbitrary address). */

stack_T stack_create(void);                /* Create new stack instance, initially empty. */
void stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item e);  /* Add an item at the top of the stack. */
stack_Item stack_pop(stack_T s);           /* Remove the top item from the stack and return it . */
int stack_empty(stack_T ts);               /* Check whether stack is empty. */
&lt;/source&gt;

This implementation could be used in the following manner:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stack.h&gt;            /* Include the stack interface. */
stack_T t = stack_create();   /* Create a stack instance. */
int foo = 17;                 /* An arbitrary datum. */
t = stack_push(t, &amp;foo);        /* Push the address of 'foo' onto the stack. */
…
void *e = stack_pop(t);       /* Get the top item and delete it from the stack. */
if (stack_empty(t)) { … }     /* Do something if stack is empty. */
…
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface can be implemented in many ways. The implementation may be arbitrarily inefficient, since the formal definition of the ADT, above, does not specify how much space the stack may use, nor how long each operation should take.  It also does not specify whether the stack state ''t'' continues to exist after a call ''s'' ← &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;(''t'').

In practice the formal definition should specify that the space is proportional to the number of items pushed and not yet popped; and that every one of the operations above must finish in a constant amount of time, independently of that number. To comply with these additional specifications, the implementation could use a linked list, or an array (with dynamic resizing) together with two integers (an item count and the array size)

==== Functional-style interface ====

Functional-style ADT definitions are more appropriate for functional programming languages, and vice-versa.  However, one can provide a functional style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;          /* Type: stack state representation (an opaque record). */
typedef stack_Rep *stack_T;                  /* Type: handle to a stack state (an opaque pointer). */
typedef void *stack_Item;                    /* Type: item (arbitrary address). */

stack_T stack_empty(void);                   /* Returns the empty stack state. */
stack_T stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); /* Adds x at the top of s, returns the resulting state. */
stack_Item stack_top(stack_T s);             /* Returns the item currently at the top of s. */
stack_T stack_pop(stack_T s);                /* Remove the top item from s, returns the resulting state. */
&lt;/source&gt;
The main problem is that C lacks garbage collection, and this makes this style of programming impractical; moreover, memory allocation routines in C are slower than allocation in a typical garbage collector, thus the performance impact of so many allocations is even greater.

===ADT libraries===
Many modern programming languages,such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.

===Built-in abstract data types===
The specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain [[built-in data type]]s, defining only the operations that can be done on them.  Therefore, those types can be viewed as &quot;built-in ADTs&quot;.  Examples are the arrays in many scripting languages, such as [[Awk]], [[Lua programing language|Lua]], and [[Perl]], which can be regarded as an implementation of the Map or Table ADT.

The '''American Football League (AFL)''' was a major [[Professional Football]] league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the established [[National Football League]] (NFL). The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence. Though downplayed by the NFL as inferior, the AFL signed half of the [[1960 NFL Draft|NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960]], including All-American [[Billy Cannon]], perennial All-Star [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]], and Hall of Famer [[Ron Mix]]. Overall, AFL teams signed 75% of the league's draft choices that first year. It continued to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, well before the [[Common Draft]] which began in 1967. 

In 1966, [[AFL-NFL merger|a merger]] between the two leagues was announced, but was not finalized until [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. During its final two years of existence, the AFL teams won upset victories over the NFL teams in [[Super Bowl III]] and [[Super Bowl IV|IV]], the former considered one of the biggest upsets in American sports history. When the merger took place, all ten AFL franchises became part of the merged league's new [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), with three teams from the original 16-team NFL (the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]]) joining them. The remaining 13 original NFL teams became the inaugural members of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). The AFL logo was incorporated into the newly minted AFC logo, although the color of the &quot;A&quot; was changed from blue and white to red. The NFL retained its old name and logo and claims the rights to all AFL products including the eagle logo.

==League history==
The [[National Football League]] had grown to become one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States. One franchise that did not share in the success of the league was the [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], who were overshadowed by the more popular [[Chicago Bears]]. The team was reportedly for sale (with the intent of relocation), and one of the men who approached the Cardinals was [[Lamar Hunt]], son and heir of [[Texas]] millionaire oilman [[H. L. Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], where he had grown up. While Hunt negotiated with Cardinals ownership, similar offers were made by [[Bud Adams]], [[Bob Howsam]], and [[Max Winter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hunt, Adams, and Howsam were each unable to secure a controlling interest in the Chicago Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner [[Bert Bell]] and proposed the addition of [[expansion team]]s. Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; On his return flight to Dallas, Hunt conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals. He contacted Adams, Howsam, and Winter (as well as Winter's business partner, Bill Boyer) to gauge their interest in starting a new league. Hunt's first meeting with Adams was held in March 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced Adams to join and found his team in [[Houston]]. Hunt next secured an agreement from Howsam to bring a team to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Winter and Boyer agreed to start a team in [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], the new league had its first four teams. Hunt also approached Willard Rhodes of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], but that effort failed when Rhodes was turned down by [[Husky Stadium]] and had no place for his team to play.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Going Long'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt also sought franchises in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] and [[New York City]]. During the summer of 1959 he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry. Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation, Hunt received commitments from [[Barron Hilton]] and [[Harry Wismer]] to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;chiefsafl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |title=Kansas City Chiefs History - AFL Origins |accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070205213037/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 1959, the first league meeting was held in Chicago, and charter memberships were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-Saint Paul. On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League. The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier [[All-America Football Conference]] (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league. AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones. Only the party from Minneapolis accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year; the Minneapolis group joined [[Ole Haugsrud]] in the new NFL team's ownership group, with Haugsrud dubbing the team the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; (The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team &amp;ndash; the [[Dallas Cowboys]] &amp;ndash; actually started play in 1960, and the Vikings began play in 1961.)

Two more cities were awarded AFL franchises later in the year. [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.|Ralph Wilson]], who owned a minority interest in the NFL's [[Detroit Lions]], announced he was placing a team in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]] after he had been rejected by [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. Buffalo was officially awarded a franchise on October 28. During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] (led by [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]]) was awarded the AFL's eighth team.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorana, ''Relentless'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 1959, [[Joe Foss]], a [[World War II]] [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[fighter ace]] and former governor of [[South Dakota]], was named the AFL's first commissioner. Foss commissioned a friend of Harry Wismer's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo. Hunt was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960.

===The AFL Draft===
{{see|American Football League Draft}}

The AFL's first [[American Football League Draft|draft]] took place the same day Boston was awarded its franchise, and lasted 33 rounds. The league held a second draft on December 2, which lasted for 20 rounds. Since the Raiders joined after the AFL draft, they inherited Minnesota's selections (read next section).&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nflhistoryone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960 |title=NFL History, 1951–1960 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special ''[[1960 American Football League Draft|allocation draft]]'' was held in January, 1960, to allow the Raiders to stock their team, as some of the other AFL teams had already signed some of Minneapolis' original draft choices.

===Crisis and success (1960–61)===
In November 1959, Minneapolis owner Max Winter announced his intent to leave the AFL to accept a franchise offer from the NFL. In 1961, his team began play in the NFL as the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles Chargers]] owner Barron Hilton demanded that a replacement for Minnesota be placed in California, to reduce his team's operating costs and to create a rivalry. After a brief search, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] was chosen and an ownership group led by local real estate developer Chet Soda was formed. After initially being called the Oakland ''&quot;Señores&quot;'', the [[Oakland Raiders]] officially joined the AFL on January 30, 1960.

The AFL's first major success came when the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] signed [[Billy Cannon]], the All-American and 1959 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner from [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]. Cannon signed a $100,000 contract to play for the Oilers, despite having already signed a $50,000 contract with the NFL's [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]]. The Oilers filed suit and claimed that Rams general manager [[Pete Rozelle]] had unduly manipulated Cannon. The court upheld the Houston contract, and with Cannon the Oilers appeared in the AFL's first three championship games (winning two).&lt;ref name=&quot;loup&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Rich |last=Loup |title=The AFL: A Football Legacy (Part One) |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_1/ |publisher=CNNSI.com |date=2001-01-22 |accessdate=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Al |last=Carter |title=Oilers leave rich legacy of low-budget absurdity |url=http://texnews.com/texsports97/oilers063097.html |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=1997-06-30 |accessdate=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which brought in revenues of approximately [[United States dollar|$]]2,125,000 per year for the entire league. On June 17, the AFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, which was dismissed in 1962 after a two-month trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;loup&quot; /&gt; The AFL began regular-season play (a night game on Friday, September 9, 1960) with eight teams in the league — the [[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]], [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Houston Oilers]], [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles Chargers]], [[New York Jets|New York Titans]], and [[Oakland Raiders]]. Raiders co-owner [[F. Wayne Valley|Wayne Valley]] dubbed the AFL ownership &quot;The Foolish Club,&quot; a term Lamar Hunt subsequently used on team photographs he sent as Christmas gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;herskowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Mickey |last=Herskowitz |title=The Foolish Club |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/5_the_foolish_club.pdf |publisher=Pro Football Weekly |year=1974 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605071618/http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/5_the_foolish_club.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oilers became the first-ever league champions by defeating the Chargers, 24-16, in the AFL Championship on January 1, 1961. Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL. Whereas the more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game, AFL attendance generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;attendance&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1960a.pdf |title=1960 AFL box scores |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=The NFL History Network|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the low attendance came financial losses. The Raiders, for instance, lost $500,000 in their first year and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner Ralph Wilson.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders - The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation. In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].

On August 8, 1961, the AFL, desperate to prove its legitimacy, challenged the [[Canadian Football League]] to an exhibition game. It was decided that the game would be between [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] and the [[Buffalo Bills]]. The Bills, who had finished near the bottom of the league in 1960, and Ticats, one of the best teams in the CFL at the time, were chosen because they were geographically close to one another (less than 65 miles apart). It was thought that beating a CFL team would prove that the AFL was at least the second-best football league in North America. After all, the NFL had sent several teams against teams from the CFL and had won every game so it was thought that victory against the CFL would be easy. Playing at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], the game proved to be a disaster for the AFL as the Ticats defeated the Bills 38-21 playing a mix of AFL and CFL rules. The Bills returned to Buffalo and it marked the only time a pro football team from [[Canada]] defeated a pro football team from the United States. No team from a U.S.-based football league has since competed with a team from a [[Canada]]-based league (U.S./Canadian professional ''team'' matchups within one league, however, have happened, such as the [[Toronto Rifles]] of the 1960s, the [[Montreal Machine]] of the early 1990s and the [[CFL USA]] of the mid-1990s).

===Movement and instability (1962–63)===
While the Oilers found instant success in the AFL, other teams did not fare as well. The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans struggled on and off the field during their first few seasons in the league. Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses their first season.&lt;ref name=&quot;nflhistorytwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970 |title=NFL History, 1961–1970 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]—which already had an established NFL team (the [[San Francisco 49ers]])—but the product on the field was also to blame. After winning six games their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons. Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good. They participated in another such draft in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;loup&quot; /&gt;

The Titans fared a little better on the field but had their own financial troubles. Attendance was so low for home games that team owner Harry Wismer had fans move to seats closer to the field to give the illusion of a fuller stadium on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;jetsencyc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nyj/jets.html |title=New York Jets history |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=Sports Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Wismer could no longer afford to meet his payroll, and on November 8, 1962 the AFL took over operations of the team. The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership group headed by [[Sonny Werblin]] on March 28, 1963, and in April the new owners changed the team's name to the [[New York Jets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jetsone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1962 |title=Jets history - 1962 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NewYorkJets.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061114025135/http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1962 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jetstwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1963 |title=Jets history - 1963 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NewYorkJets.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061114025303/http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history?year=1963 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raiders and Titans both finished last in their respective divisions in the 1962 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;sixtytwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1962.htm |title=1962 standings |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=Pro-Football-Reference.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texans and Oilers, winners of their divisions, faced each other for the 1962 AFL Championship on December 23. The Texans dethroned the two-time champion Oilers, 20-17, in a double-[[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] contest that was, at the time, Professional Football's longest-ever game.&lt;ref name=&quot;loup&quot; /&gt;

In 1963, the Texans became the second AFL team to relocate. Lamar Hunt felt that despite winning the league championship in 1962, the Texans could not succeed financially competing in the same market as the [[Dallas Cowboys]], which entered the NFL as an expansion team in 1960. After meetings with [[New Orleans]], [[Atlanta]] and [[Miami]], Hunt announced on May 22 that the Texans' new home would be [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. Kansas City mayor [[Harold Roe Bartle]] (nicknamed &quot;Chief&quot;) was instrumental in his city's success in attracting the team. Partly to honor Bartle, the franchise officially became the Kansas City Chiefs on May 26.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcsixties&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ |title=Chiefs timeline - 1960s |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=KCChiefs.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070124191953/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Diego Chargers, under head coach [[Sid Gillman]], won a decisive 51-10 victory over the Boston Patriots for the 1963 AFL Championship. Confident that his team was capable of beating the NFL-champion [[Chicago Bears]] (he had the Chargers' rings inscribed with the phrase &quot;World Champions&quot;), Gillman approached NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and proposed a final championship game between the two teams. Rozelle declined the offer; however, the game would be instituted three seasons later.&lt;ref name=&quot;gillman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6101341 |title=Gillman laid foundation for all who followed |accessdate=2007-02-08 |last=Barber |first=Phil |work=NFL.com}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watershed years (1964–65)===
A series of events throughout the next few years demonstrated the AFL's ability to achieve a greater level of equality with the NFL. On January 29, 1964, the AFL signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with [[NBC]] (beginning in the 1965 season), which gave the league money it needed to compete with the NFL for players. Upon hearing this news, an NFL owner was quoted as saying to then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle: &quot;They (The AFL) don't have to call us 'Mister' anymore&quot;. A single-game attendance record was set on November 8, 1964, when 61,929 fans packed [[Shea Stadium]] to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.&lt;ref name=&quot;sixtyfour&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nflhistory.net/linescores/pdf/1964a.pdf |title=1964 box scores |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=NFL History Network|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bidding war for players between the AFL and NFL escalated in 1965. The Chiefs drafted Kansas star [[Gale Sayers]] in the first round of the 1965 draft (held November 28, 1964), while the Chicago Bears did the same in the NFL draft. Sayers eventually signed with the Bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcsixties&quot; /&gt; A similar situation occurred when the New York Jets and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals both drafted University of Alabama quarterback [[Joe Namath]]. In what was viewed as a key victory for the AFL, Namath signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets on January 2, 1965 (the deal included a new car). It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player, and is cited as a contributing factor to the eventual merger between the two leagues.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Silverman |title=The 'Other' League |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/11_the_other_league.pdf |publisher=Pro Football Weekly |date=1994-11-07 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605071617/http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/11_the_other_league.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1965, Minneapolis lawyer [[Joseph Robbie|Joe Robbie]] met with Commissioner Foss to inquire about an expansion franchise. On May 6, Robbie secured an agreement to bring a team to [[Miami]], [[Florida]], from Miami Mayor Robert King High. League expansion was approved at a meeting held on June 7, and on August 16 the AFL's ninth franchise was officially awarded to Robbie and television star [[Danny Thomas]]. The [[Miami Dolphins]] joined the league for a fee of $7.5 million and started play in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolphins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights.asp |title=Miami Dolphins Historical Highlights |accessdate=2007-02-08 |work=MiamiDolphins.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escalation and merger (1966–67)===
{{Details|AFL-NFL Merger}}
In 1966, the rivalry between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak. On April 7, Joe Foss resigned as AFL commissioner. His successor was Oakland Raiders head coach and general manager [[Al Davis]], who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise. No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under Davis started to recruit players already on NFL squads. Davis's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Davis's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues.

The same month Davis was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm, secretly approached Lamar Hunt and other AFL owners and asked the AFL to merge. They held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching. Hunt and Schramm completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced. Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft. The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues. The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, and NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] would remain as commissioner of the merged league. Rozelle is erroneously given credit for the merger, which was brokered without his knowledge or that of Al Davis. The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years. In protest, Davis resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and [[Milt Woodard]] was named President of the AFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cross&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=B. Duane |last=Cross |title=The AFL: A Football Legacy (Part Two) |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |publisher=CNNSI.com |date=2001-01-22 |accessdate=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 1967, the first-ever World Championship Game between the champions of the two separate professional football leagues, the AFL-NFL Championship Game (retroactively referred to as [[Super Bowl I]]), was played in Los Angeles. After a close first half, the NFL champion [[Green Bay Packers]] overwhelmed the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs, 35-10. The loss reinforced for many the notion that the AFL was an inferior league. Packers head coach [[Vince Lombardi]] stated after the game, &quot;I do not think they are as good as the top teams in the National Football League.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;silverman&quot; /&gt;

The second AFL-NFL Championship ([[Super Bowl II]]) yielded a similar result. The Oakland Raiders—who had easily beaten the Houston Oilers to win their first AFL championship—were overmatched by the Packers, 33-14. The more experienced Packers capitalized on a number of Raiders miscues and never trailed. Green Bay defensive tackle [[Henry Jordan]] offered a compliment to Oakland and the AFL, when he said, &quot;...the AFL is becoming much more sophisticated on offense. I think the league has always had good personnel, but the blocks were subtler and better conceived in this game.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sbtwo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Tex |last=Maule |title=Green Bay, Handily |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/2/ |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=1968-01-22 |accessdate=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL added its tenth and final team on May 24, 1967, when it awarded the league's second expansion franchise to an ownership group from [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], headed by NFL legend [[Paul Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nflhistorytwo&quot; /&gt; Although Brown had intended to join the NFL, he agreed to join the AFL when he learned that his team would be included in the NFL once the merger was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''PB - The Paul Brown Story''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cincinnati Bengals]] began play in the 1968 season, finishing last in the Western Division.

===Legitimacy and the end of an era (1968-70)===
While many AFL players and observers believed their league was the equal of the NFL, the first two Super Bowls did little to prove it. That perception changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]]. The Colts, who entered the contest favored by as many as 18 points, had completed the [[1968 NFL season]] with a 13-1 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34-0 dismantling of the Cleveland Browns. Led by their stalwart defense—which allowed a record-low 144 points—the 1968 Colts were considered one of the best-ever NFL teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.jsp?release_id=822 |title=He guaranteed it |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=Pro Football Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baltse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/balticolts/baltcolts.html |title=Baltimore Colts history |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=Sports Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the Jets had allowed 280 points, the highest total for any division winner in the two leagues. They had also only narrowly beaten the favored Oakland Raiders in the AFL championship game. Jets quarterback [[Joe Namath]] recalled that in the days leading up to the game, he grew increasingly angry when told New York had no chance to beat Baltimore. Three days before the game, a frustrated Namath responded to a [[heckler]] at the Touchdown Club in Miami by declaring, &quot;We're going to win Sunday, I'll guarantee you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;silverman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cross&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jackman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Jackman |title=Lifetime guarantee; Jets-Colts |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-mackey011299,0,4077047.story?coll=bal-sports-football |publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=1999-01-12 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930014536/http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-mackey011299,0,4077047.story?coll=bal-sports-football &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Namath and the Jets made good on his guarantee as they held the Colts scoreless until late in the fourth quarter. The Jets won, 16-7, in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in American sports history.&lt;ref name=&quot;pagetwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/010523upset.html |title=Page 2's List for top upset in sports history |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=[[Page2]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wankel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Wankel |title=Eagles can win with right strategy |url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/columnists/cxww020105a.htm |publisher=[[The Courier-Post]] |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2007-02-09 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hornet&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Gooden |title=Can Hornets match greatest all-time upsets? |url=http://media.www.statehornet.com/media/storage/paper1146/news/2003/11/19/Sports/Can-Hornets.Match.Greatest.AllTime.Upsets-2422553.shtml?sourcedomain=www.statehornet.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |publisher=The State Hornet |date=2003-11-19 |accessdate=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shamsky, ''The Magnificent Seasons'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; With the win, the AFL finally achieved parity with the NFL and legitimized the merger of the two leagues.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof&quot; /&gt; That notion was reinforced one year later in [[Super Bowl IV]], when the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs upset the NFL champion [[Minnesota Vikings]], 23-7, in the last championship game to be played between the two leagues.

The last game in AFL history was the [[AFL All-Star Game]], held in Houston's [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]] on January 17, 1970. The Western All-Stars, led by Chargers quarterback [[John Hadl]], defeated the Eastern All-Stars, 26-3. Hadl was named the game's [[Most Valuable Player]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allstarhadl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmbolding.com/BSR/The_1970_AFL_All-Star_Game.htm |title=1970 AFL All-Star Game recap |accessdate=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the start of the [[1970 NFL season]], the merged league was organized into two conferences of three divisions each. All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new [[American Football Conference]]. To avoid having 16 teams in one conference and 10 in the other, the leagues voted to move three NFL teams to the AFC. Motivated by the prospect of an [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|intrastate rivalry]] with the Bengals as well as by personal animosity toward [[Paul Brown]], Cleveland Browns owner [[Art Modell]] quickly offered to include his team in the AFC. He helped persuade the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] ([[Browns–Steelers rivalry|the Browns' archrivals]]) and Baltimore Colts (who shared the [[Baltimore]]/[[Washington, D.C.]] market with the [[Washington Redskins]]) to follow suit, and each team received US $3 million to switch.&lt;ref name=&quot;switch&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Gordon |last=Forbes |title=This time, realignment will be cool breeze |url=http://lists.rollanet.org/pipermail/rampage/Week-of-Mon-20010319/001092.html |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2001-03-22 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928150211/http://lists.rollanet.org/pipermail/rampage/Week-of-Mon-20010319/001092.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;modell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6085 |title=Moment 26: Enter Art |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=ClevelandBrowns.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071010070953/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6085 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the other NFL squads became part of the [[National Football Conference]].

[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] receiver [[Charlie Joiner]], who started his career with the [[Houston Oilers]] ([[1969 AFL season|1969]]), was the last AFL player active in professional football, retiring after the 1986 season, when he played for the [[San Diego Chargers]].

==Legacy==
===Overview===
The American Football League stands as the only professional football league to successfully compete against the NFL. When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL. Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL—the three previous leagues named &quot;American Football League&quot; and the [[All-America Football Conference]] before the merger and the [[United States Football League]]; the [[World Football League]]; and the [[XFL]] after it—folded completely. From an earlier AFL (1936–1937), only the [[St. Louis Rams|Cleveland Rams]], and from the AAFC, Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers joined the NFL and are currently operating (a third AAFC team, the [[Baltimore Colts (1947-1950)|Baltimore Colts]], is not related to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise: the original Colts played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season).&lt;ref name=&quot;cross&quot; /&gt;

===Rule changes===
The NFL eventually adopted many ideas introduced by the AFL. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a [[stopwatch]] used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the [[two-point conversion]] to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the ''AFL'' than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States.

===Television===
The NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts, first with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later with [[NBC]]). With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs. It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]] and the defending champion [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]]. At the time it was the longest [[Professional American football championship games|professional football championship game]] ever played. The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play, compared to the more conservative game of the NFL. Long passes (&quot;bombs&quot;) were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as [[John Hadl]], [[Daryle Lamonica]] and [[Len Dawson]].

Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks. For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL. It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.

===Expanding and reintroducing the sport to more cities===
The AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises. Hunt's vision not only brought a new professional football league to [[California]] and [[New York State|New York]], but introduced the sport to [[Colorado]], restored it to [[Texas]] and later to fast-growing [[Florida]], as well as bringing it to [[New England]] for the first time in 12 years. Buffalo, having lost its [[Buffalo (NFL)|original NFL franchise]] in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|1950]]) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger.

Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Vikings, who were awarded to Max Winter in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Falcons, whose franchise went to Rankin Smith to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's [[Miami Dolphins]]; and the Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians. Further, the success of the expansion process engendered by the AFL-NFL conflict (as well as later expansion pressures created by the WFL, USFL, and even the [[CFL USA|CFL]]) certainly led to more expansion, ultimately to the thirty-two team league as it exists at the end of the 2010 season. Had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the [[Houston Texans]] also would probably not exist today. Thus, if not for the AFL, at least 15 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and the five instigated by the AFL's presence.

The AFL also ended up radically altering the fortunes of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams. Constantly lacking the money to build a quality team, the Steelers had only posted eight winning seasons, and just one playoff appearance, since their first year of existence in 1933. They also finished with [[1969 NFL season|a 1-13 record in 1969]], tied with the [[Chicago Bears]] for the worst record in the NFL. The $3 million relocation fee that the Steelers received for joining the AFC after the merger helped them rebuild into a contender, drafting eventual-[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs like [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]], and ultimately winning four Super Bowls in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/super-bowl/the-game/20110201-sherrington-dallas-meeting-in-66-saved-steelers-from-stinking.ece | title=Dallas meeting in '66 saved Steelers from stinking | first=Kevin | last=Sherrington | work=Dallas Morning News | date=2011-02-01 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on players===
Perhaps the greatest social legacy of the AFL was the [[domino effect]] of its policy of being more liberal than the entrenched NFL in offering opportunity for [[Black players in American professional football|black players]]. While the NFL was still emerging from thirty years of segregation influenced by Washington Redskins' owner [[George Preston Marshall]], the AFL actively recruited from small and predominantly black colleges. The AFL's color-blindness led not only to the explosion of black talent on the field, but to the eventual entry of blacks into scouting, coordinating, and ultimately head coaching positions, long after the league ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[James &quot;Jim&quot; Acho|Jim Acho]] | title=The &quot;Foolish Club&quot; | publisher=Gridiron Press | year=1997 | id={{OCLC|38596883}}}} Foreword by [[Miller Farr]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Charles K. Ross | title=Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the National Football League | publisher=New York University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-8147-7495-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL's free agents came from several sources. Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the [[Canadian Football League]]. In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.

In the league's first years, men like the Oilers' [[George Blanda]], the Chargers/Bills' [[Jack Kemp]], the Texans' [[Len Dawson]], the Titans' [[Don Maynard]], the Raiders/Patriots/Jets' [[Babe Parilli]], the Pats' [[Bob Dee]] proved to be AFL standouts. Other players such as the Broncos' [[Frank Tripucka]], the Pats' [[Gino Cappelletti]], the Bills' [[Cookie Gilchrist]] and the Chargers' [[Tobin Rote]], [[Sam DeLuca]] and [[Dave Kocourek]] also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly needed credibility. Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true &quot;free agents&quot;, the walk-ons and the &quot;wanna-be's&quot;, who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional football.

After the AFL-NFL merger agreement in 1966, and after the AFL's [[New York Jets|Jets]] defeated the &quot;best team in the history of the NFL&quot;, the Colts, a popular misconception fostered by the NFL and spread by media reports was that the AFL defeated the NFL because of the [[Common Draft]] instituted in 1967. This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft. But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of &quot;common draftees&quot;. Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days. As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the &quot;common draft&quot;.

Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included [[Lance Alworth]] and [[Ron Mix]] of the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]], who had also been drafted by the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] respectively. Both eventually were elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions. Among specific teams, the 1964 [[Buffalo Bills]] stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a 14-game schedule.

Another example is cited by the [[University of Kansas]] website, which describes the 1961 [[Bluebonnet Bowl]], won by KU, and goes on to say ''&quot;Two Kansas players, quarterback [[John Hadl]] and fullback [[Curtis McClinton]], signed professional contracts on the field immediately after the conclusion of the game. Hadl inked a deal with the ''[AFL]'' [[San Diego Chargers]], and McClinton went to the ''[AFL]'' [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]].&quot;'' Between them, in their careers Hadl and McClinton combined for an [[American Football League Rookies of the Year|American Football League Rookie of the Year]] award, seven [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] selections, two Pro Bowl selections, a team MVP award, two [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star Game]] MVP awards, two [[American Football League playoffs#1962 Championship|AFL championships]], and a [[Professional American football championship games|World Championship]]. And these were players selected by the AFL long ''before'' the &quot;Common Draft&quot;.

In 2009, a five-part series, ''[[Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League]]'', on the ''[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] Network'', refuted many of the long-held misconceptions about the AFL. In it, [[Abner Haynes]] tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the Haynes home; the NFL Cowboys' Tex Schramm is quoted as saying that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], they would very likely have lost; [[George Blanda]] makes a case for more AFL players being inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of Famer [[Willie Brown (American football)|Willie Brown]] was cut by the [[Houston Oilers]] because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker [[Charlie Hennigan]] in practice. Later, when Brown was with the Broncos, Hennigan needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break [[Lionel Taylor]]'s Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season. Hennigan caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by Brown: Blanda's point being that if Hennigan could do so well against a Hall of Fame db, he deserves induction, as well.

===Influence on professional football coaching===
The AFL also spawned coaches whose style and techniques profoundly affect the play of professional football until this day. In addition to AFL greats like [[Hank Stram]], [[Lou Saban]], [[Sid Gillman]] and [[Al Davis]] were eventual hall of fame coaches such as [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]], a protegé of Davis with the AFL [[Oakland Raiders]]; and [[Chuck Noll]], who worked for Gillman and the AFL [[San Diego Chargers|LA/San Diego Chargers]] from 1960 through 1965. Others include [[Buddy Ryan]] (AFL's [[New York Jets]]), [[Chuck Knox]] (Jets), [[Walt Michaels]] (Jets), and [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] (AFL's [[Oakland Raiders]]). Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including [[Sam Wyche]] ([[Cincinnati Bengals]]), [[Marty Schottenheimer]] ([[Buffalo Bills]]), [[Wayne Fontes]] (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner [[Tom Flores]] ([[Oakland Raiders]]). Flores also has a Super Bowl ring as a player ([[1969 AFL season|1969]] [[Kansas City Chiefs]]).

Walsh is often cited for an impressive &quot;coaching tree&quot; of assistants who went on to become head coaches. But since Walsh was an assistant to Davis, who in turn learned the trade from Gillman, Walsh's [[coaching tree]] is thus an offshoot of ''Gillman's'' coaching tree. Besides Davis, others who coached for Gillman included [[Dick Vermeil]], Knox, and [[George Allen (coach)|George Allen]], as well as Noll, the only head coach to win four Super Bowls. The numbers on Gillman's coaching tree indicate the Super Bowls won by his coaching &quot;descendants&quot;, a total of twenty.

==AFL 50th Anniversary Celebration==
[[File:AFL 50th logo.jpg|thumb|185px|right|AFL 50th Anniversary Logo]]{{main|2009 NFL season}}
As the influence of the AFL continues through the present, the 50th anniversary of its launch was celebrated during [[2009 NFL season|2009]]. The season-long celebration began in August with the 2009 [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] in [[Canton, Ohio]] between two AFC teams (as opposed to the AFC-vs-NFC format the game first adopted in 1971). The opponents were two of the original AFL franchises, the [[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Tennessee Titans]] (the former [[Houston Oilers]]). Bills' owner [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]] (a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee) and Titans' owner [[Bud Adams]] are the only surviving members of the [[Foolish Club]], the eight original owners of AFL franchises.

The Hall of Fame Game was the first of several &quot;Legacy Weekends,&quot; during which each of the &quot;original eight&quot; AFL teams sported uniforms from their AFL era. Each of the 8 teams took part in at least two such &quot;legacy&quot; games. [[List of American Football League officials|On-field officials]] also wore red-and-white-striped AFL uniforms during these games.

In the fall of 2009, the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] pay-cable network premiered ''[[Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League]]'', a 5-part documentary series produced by [[NFL Films]] that features vintage game film and interviews as well as more recent interviews with those associated with the AFL.

The NFL sanctioned a variety of ''&quot;Legacy&quot;'' gear to celebrate the AFL anniversary, such as &quot;throwback&quot; jerseys, t-shirts, signs, pennants and banners, including items with the logos and colors of the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], [[Houston Oilers]], and [[New York Jets|New York Titans]], the three of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL teams which have changed names or venues. A December 5, 2009 story by Ken Belson in the ''[[New York Times]]'' quotes league officials as stating that AFL ''&quot;Legacy&quot;'' gear made up twenty to thirty percent of the league's annual $3 billion merchandise income. Fan favorites were the [[Denver Broncos]]' vertically striped socks, which could not be re-stocked quickly enough.

Today, two of the NFL's eight divisions are composed entirely of former AFL teams, the [[AFC West]] ([[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]], and [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]]) and the [[AFC East]] ([[Buffalo Bills|Bills]], [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]], [[New York Jets|Jets]], and [[New England Patriots|Patriots]]). Additionally, the [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]] now play in the [[AFC North]] and the [[Tennessee Titans]] (formerly the Oilers) play in the [[AFC South]].

==AFL playoffs==
{{Details|American Football League playoffs}}
From 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single-elimination playoff game between the winners of its two divisions.The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969). In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 7-6-1 in the AFL East Division. There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December. The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 26-8. The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 51-10 victory. A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 12-2 in the AFL West Division. The Raiders beat the Chiefs 41-6 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game. In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first &quot;[[Wild card (sports)|wild card]]&quot; playoffs were conducted. A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division. The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 17-7 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played. The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term &quot;wildcard&quot; was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.

==AFL All-Star games==
{{Details|American Football League All-Star game}}

The AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960, but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons. All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965. That season, the league champion Buffalo Bills played all-stars from the other teams.

After the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star game had been scheduled for early 1965 in [[New Orleans]]' Tulane Stadium. After numerous black players were refused service by a number of area hotels and businesses, black and white players alike called for a [[boycott]]. Led by Bills players such as [[Cookie Gilchrist]], the players successfully lobbied to have the game moved to Houston's [[Jeppesen Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boycott&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1950/Black_football_players_boycott_AFL_AllStar_game |title=Black football players boycott AFL All-Star game |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=The African American Registry |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061225020026/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1950/Black_football_players_boycott_AFL_AllStar_game &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Associazione Sportiva Roma''', ({{ISE|IT0001008876|ASR}}, {{lse|0DMN}}) commonly referred to as simply '''Roma''', is a professional [[Football in Italy|Italian football club]] based in [[Rome]]. Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence but one season in the early 50s ([[Serie B 1951-52|1951–52]]). For their 59th season in a row (78th overall), Roma are competing in [[Serie A]] for [[2010–11 Serie A|2010–11]].

Roma have won [[Serie A]] three times, first in [[Serie A 1941-42|1941–42]] then in [[Serie A 1982-83|1982–83]] and again in [[Serie A 2000-01|2000–01]], as well as winning nine [[Coppa Italia]] titles and two [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles. On the [[UEFA|European stage]] Roma won an [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960-61|1960–61]], coming close to [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] victory in [[European Cup 1983-84|1983–84]] (lost the [[1984 European Cup Final|one-legged final played at home]] against [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] after a penalty shootout), and  finishing as runners-up in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] for [[UEFA Cup 1990-91|1990–91]] ([[1991 UEFA Cup Final|two-legged aggregate defeat]] against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]]). 

Home games are currently played at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], a venue they share with city rivals [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the [[List of football stadiums in Italy|second largest]] of its kind in Italy, with only [[San Siro]] able to seat more. In September 2009 the club unveiled plans to build a [[Stadio Franco Sensi|new 55,000-capacity stadium]] in the western suburbs of Rome. Its design will be modeled after [[Football in England|English football]] stadiums with the objective being to give fans a closer view of the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=680854&amp;cc=3888|publisher=soccernet.com|title=Roma stadium to be inspired by English Model|date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of A.S. Roma}}
[[File:ASRoma1927.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Historic first ever Roma club shot.]]
A.S. Roma was founded in the summer of 1927 by Italo Foschi,&lt;ref name = lastoria/&gt; who initiated the merger of three older [[Italian Football Championship]] clubs from the city of Rome; [[Roman F.C.|Roman FC]], [[S.S. Alba-Audace Roma|SS Alba-Audace]] and [[Fortitudo-Pro Roma S.G.S.|Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS]].&lt;ref name = lastoria/&gt; The purpose of the merger was to give the Eternal City a strong club to rival that of the more dominant [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] clubs of the time.&lt;ref name=lastoria&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asroma.it/DocList.aspx?Categoria=42|publisher=ASRoma.it|title=La Storia|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only major Roman club to resist the merger was [[S.S. Lazio]] because of the intervention of the Fascist Militia General Vaccaro, member of the club and executive of Italian Football Federation.
The club played its earliest seasons at the ''Motovelodromo Appio'' stadium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://albionroad.com/club-profiles/roma.html|publisher=AlbionRoad.com|title=A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; before settling in the working-class streets of [[Testaccio]], where it built an all-wooden ground ''Campo Testaccio''; this was opened in November 1929.&lt;ref name = &quot;Testaccio&quot; /&gt; An early season in which Roma made a large mark was the [[Serie A 1930-31|1930–31]] championship, the club finished as runners-up behind [[Juventus]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; Captain [[Attilio Ferraris]] along with [[Guido Masetti]], [[Fulvio Bernardini]] and [[Rodolfo Volk]] were highly important players during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

===First title victory and decline ===
After a slump in league form and the departure of high key players, Roma eventually rebuilt their squad adding goalscorers such as the Argentine [[Enrique Guaita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stars&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=calciatoriG.htm|publisher=Viva la Roma|title=Tutti i calciatori dell'A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the management of [[Luigi Barbesino]], the Roman club came close to their first title in [[Serie A 1935-36|1935–36]]; finishing just one point behind champions [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/35-36.html|publisher=ASRomaUltras.it|title=1935–'36: Io Faccio I Gol Non La Guerra! |date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ASRoma1941-42.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Serie A winners in [[Serie A 1941-42|1941–42]].]]
Roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s; Roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the [[Serie A 1941-42|1941–42]] season by winning their first ever'' scudetto'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=campionato4142.htm|publisher=ASRTalenti|title=Campionato 1941–42 – Roma campione d'Italia|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteen goals scored by local player [[Amedeo Amadei]] were essential to the [[Alfréd Schaffer]] coached Roma side winning the title. At the time Italy was involved in World War II and Roma were playing at the ''[[Stadio Nazionale PNF|Stadio del Partito Nazionale Fascista]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/soprannomi.html|publisher=ASRomaUltras.it|title=I Campi da Gioco|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years just after the war, Roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s.  Roma finished in the lower half of Serie A for five seasons in a row, before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to [[Serie B]] at the end of the [[Serie A 1950-51|1950–51]] season;&lt;ref name = league/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital52.html|publisher=RSSSF.com|title=Italy 1951–52 – Serie B|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; around a decade after their championship victory. Under future [[Italy national football team|national team]] manager [[Giuseppe Viani]], promotion straight back up was achieved.&lt;ref name = &quot;managers&quot; /&gt;

After returning to the Serie A, Roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top half club again with players such as [[Egisto Pandolfini]], [[Dino Da Costa]] and Dane [[Helge Bronée]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; Their best finish of this period was under the management of Englishman [[Jesse Carver]], when in [[Serie A 1954-55|1954–55]] they finished as runners-up, after [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] who originally finished second were relegated for corruption.&lt;ref name = league/&gt;
Although Roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade, they did achieve some measure of cup success. Their first honour outside of Italy was recorded in [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960-61|1960–61]] when Roma won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] by beating [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 4–2 in the finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html#icfc|publisher=RSSSF.com|title=Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960–61|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later Roma won their first [[Coppa Italia]] trophy in 1963–64, by beating [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] 1–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;coppaitalia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vilacom.net/football/coppa.php|publisher=Vilacom Sports|title=TIM Cup – Coppa Italia|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their lowest point came during the 1964–65 season when manager [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] announced that the club could not pay its players and was unlikely to be able to afford to travel to [[Vicenza]] to fulfil its next fixture. Supporters kept the club going with a fundraiser at the Sistine Theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president [[Franco Evangelisti (politician)|Franco Evangelisti]].

Their second Coppa Italia trophy was won in 1968–69 when it was competed in a small league like system.&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; [[Giacomo Losi]] set a Roma appearance record during 1969 with 450 appearances in all competitions, the record he set would last for 38 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://asroma.hunsport.hu/?us=23|publisher=ASRoma Hunsports|title=Rekordok, statisztikák|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time of mixed fortunes===
[[File:Pruzzo 78-79.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Roberto Pruzzo|Pruzzo]] with Roma and a ''[[scudetto]]'' patch.]]
Roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972, with a 3–1 victory over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/angloit72.html|publisher=RSSSF.com|title=Anglo-Italian Cup 1972|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During much of the 1970s Roma's appearance in the top half of Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in [[Serie A 1974-75|1974–75]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders [[Giancarlo De Sisti]] and [[Francesco Rocca]].

The dawning of a newly successful era in Roma's footballing history was brought in with another Coppa Italia victory, they beat [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] on penalties to win the 1979–80 cup.&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; Roma would reach heights in the league which they had not touched since the 1940s by narrowly and [[Turone's goal|controversially]] finishing as runners-up to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in [[Serie A 1980-81|1980–81]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=420526|publisher=Goal.com|title=Roma – Juventus: A Historical Look|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] player [[Nils Liedholm]] was the manager at the time, with players such as [[Bruno Conti]], [[Agostino Di Bartolomei]], [[Roberto Pruzzo]] and [[Falcão]].&lt;ref name = &quot;legends&quot; /&gt;

The second ''scudetto'' did not elude Roma for much longer; in [[Serie A 1982-83|1982–83]] the Roman club won the title for the first time in 41 years, amidst  celebrations in the capital.&lt;ref name=officialtitles&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lega-calcio.it/ita/atim_albo.shtml| title=Campionato Serie A – Albo D'oro| work=Lega Calcio | accessdate=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Serie A 1983-84|following season]] Roma finished as runners-up in Italy&lt;ref name = league/&gt; and collected a Coppa Italia title,&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; they also finished as runners-up in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final of [[1984 European Cup Final|1984]].&lt;ref name = &quot;liverpoolfinal&quot; /&gt; The European Cup final with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] ended in a 1–1 draw with a goal from Pruzzo, but Roma eventually lost the penalty shoot-out.&lt;ref name=&quot;liverpoolfinal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro84.html|publisher=European Cup History|title=Season 1983–84|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma's successful run in the 1980s would finish with a runners-up spot in [[Serie A 1985-86|1985–86]]&lt;ref name = league/&gt; and a Coppa Italia victory, beating out [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] 3–2.&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt;

After that a comparative decline began in the league, one of the few league highs from the following period being a third place finish in [[Serie A 1987-88|1987–88]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; At the start of the 1990s the club was involved in an all-Italian [[UEFA Cup]] final, where they lost 2–1 to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] in [[UEFA Cup 1990-91|1991]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=428273|publisher=Goal.com|title=Roma – Inter: A Historical Look|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same season the club won its [[Coppa Italia 1990-91|seventh]] Coppa Italia trophy&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; and ended runners-up to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in the [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. Aside from finishing runners-up to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in a Coppa Italia final,&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; the rest of the decade was largely sub-par in the history of Roma; especially in the league where the highest they could manage was fourth in [[Serie A 1997-98|1997–98]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; The early 1990s also saw the emergence of homegrown striker [[Francesco Totti]] who would go on to be an important member of the team and the club's iconic captain.

===In the new millennium===
==== 2000–2010 ====
[[File:curva sud roma campione.jpg|thumb|right|250px|17 June 2001 – Roma-Parma 3–1: Roma won its third Italian championship in its history. Fans of the [[Curva (stadia)|Curva]] Sud are overjoyed]]
Roma returned to form in the 2000s, starting the decade in great style by winning their third ever Serie A title in [[Serie A 2000-01|2000–01]]; the ''scudetto'' was won on the last day of the season by beating [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] 3–1, edging out Juventus by two points.&lt;ref name = league/&gt; The club's captain, [[Francesco Totti]] was a large reason for the title victory and he would become one of the main heroes in the club's history,&lt;ref name = &quot;legends&quot; /&gt; going on to break several [[A.S. Roma statistics and records|club records]].&lt;ref name = &quot;legends&quot; /&gt; Other important players during this period included [[Aldair]], [[Cafu]], [[Gabriel Batistuta]], and [[Vincenzo Montella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/argomenti/altro/calcio/roma/roma.htm|publisher=Italica RAI|title=A.S. Roma 2000–2001|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club attempted to defend the title in the [[Serie A 2001-02|following season]] but ended as runners-up to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] by just one point.&lt;ref name = league/&gt; This would be the start of Roma finishing as runners-up many times in both Serie A and [[Coppa Italia]] during the 2000s; they lost out 4–2 to [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] in the Coppa Italia final of [[Coppa Italia 2002-03|2003]]&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; and lost out to Milan again by finishing second in [[Serie A]] for the [[Serie A 2003-04|2003–04]] season.&lt;ref name=league&gt;{{cite book| first = Panini Edizioni | last = Modena| title = Almanacco Illustrato del Calcio – La Storia 1898–2004| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club also re-capitalized several time in 2003–04 season. In November 20003 €37.5 million was injected by &quot;Roma 2000&quot; to cover the half year loss and loss carried from previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://109.75.174.100/~asroma/downloads/corporate_investor/1287661113.pdf|title=INFORMATIVA ROMA 2000 S.R.L.|date=12 November 2003|accessdate=18 April 2011|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on 30 June for €44.57 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://109.75.174.100/~asroma/downloads/corporate_investor/1287664872.pdf|title=APPROVAZIONE SITUAZIONE MENSILE AL 31 MAGGIO 2004&lt;br/&gt;Roma 2000 sottoscrive l’aumento di capitale per 44,57 milioni di euro|date=30 June 2004|accessdate=18 April 2011|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through stock market, a further €19.850 million of new shares issued, and at the year end, the share capital was €19.878 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://109.75.174.100/~asroma/downloads/corporate_investor/1287640447.pdf|title=AS ROMA Spa. RELAZIIONE SEMESTRALE AL 31 DIICEMBRE 2004|date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 April 2011|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which unchanged as of 2011. The following season also saw the departure of [[Walter Samuel]] for €25 million and [[Emerson Ferreira da Rosa|Emerson]] for €28 million, which decreased the strength of the squad, thus ''Giallorossi'' finished as the eighth place, one of the worst of recent season.

[[File:Coppa Italia 2008 premiazione.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francesco Totti]], current captain, with the [[Coppa Italia 2007-08|2007–08 Coppa Italia]]]]
A [[2006 Serie A scandal|Serie A scandal]] was revealed during 2006 and Roma were one of the teams not involved; after punishments were handed out, Roma was re-classified as runners-up for [[Serie A 2005-06|2005–06]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5215178.stm|publisher=BBC.co.uk|title=Punishments cut for Italian clubs|date=24 June 2007 | accessdate=5 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same season in which they finished second in the Coppa Italia losing to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; In the [[Serie A 2006-07|two]] [[Serie A 2007-08|following seasons]], Roma finished as Serie A runners-up, meaning that in the 2000s Roma have finished in the top two positions more than any other decade in their history &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/serie_a_2007/index.shtml|publisher=Gazzetta.it|title=Serie A 2006–07|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in the [[UEFA Champions League]] during both of these seasons, they reached the quarter-finals before going out to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].  Despite the sloppy start in [[UEFA Champions League 2008–09]], Roma managed to reach the knockout stage ahead of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in their group, thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage. However, the ''Giallorossi'' would lose to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the knockout stage on penalty kicks, ending their Champions League campaign.

After a disappointing start to the 2009–10 season, [[Claudio Ranieri]] replaced [[Luciano Spalletti]] as head coach. At the time of the switch, Roma lay bottom of the Serie A table after losses to Juventus and Genoa. Despite this setback, Roma would later embark on an incredible unbeaten streak of 24 matches in the league – with the last of the 24 being a 2–1 win over rivals Lazio, whereby Roma came from 1–0 down at half-time to defeat their city rivals after Ranieri courageously substituted both Totti and De Rossi at the interval.&lt;ref&gt;http://roma.theoffside.com/team-news/a-tribute-to-claudio-ranieris-coconuts.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Giallorossi were on top of the table at one point, before a loss to U.C. Sampdoria later in the season. Roma would finish runners-up to Inter yet again in both Serie A and the Coppa Italia. This rounded out a highly successful decade in Roma's history, following somewhat mediocre results of the 1990s. During the 2000s, Roma had finally recaptured the Scudetto, two Coppa Italia trophies, and their first two Supercoppa Italiana titles. Other notable contributions to the club's history have included a return to the UEFA Champions League Quarter-finals (in the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 editions) since 1984, six runners up positions in the league, four Coppa Italia finals and three Supercoppa finals – marking Roma's greatest ever decade.

====End of the Sensi Era====
In the summer of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of AS Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement. This brought an end to the presidential reign of the Sensi family who had presided over the club since 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi would continue her directorial role of the club. The 2010-11 season had once again seen Roma start off with mixed fortunes on both a domestic and European level. These included losses against teams like Cagliari, Brescia and a 2-0 defeat against Bayern Munich in the group stages of the Champions League (a match which saw manager Claudio Ranieri openly criticised by his own players). However, these were accompanied by victories against Inter Milan and a sensational victory against Bayern Munich in the return fixture, which saw Roma fight back from 0-2 down at half-time to emerge as 3-2 winners. Following a series of poor results which saw Roma engage in a winless-streak of five consecutive matches, Claudio Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker Vincenzo Montella was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon, Francesco Totti, scored his 200th Serie A goal against Fiorentina in March of 2011 - becoming only the sixth ever player to achieve such a feat.

On 16 April 2011, the takeover contract was signed. [[Thomas R. DiBenedetto]], through &quot;DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC&quot;, would acquired 67.1% shares of A.S. Roma Spa (the club itself, valued €60.3 million), entire ownership of &quot;ASR Real Estate S.r.l.&quot; and &quot;Brand Management S.r.l.&quot; from Sensi's &quot;Roma 2000 S.r.l.&quot; (a subsidiary of [[Italpetroli]]) for a total of €70.3 million. The new holding company, was a joint venture of &quot;DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC&quot; and [[Unicredit]] S.p.A., in a 60-40 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://109.75.174.100/~asroma/downloads/corporate_investor/1302909742_Comunicato_stampa_congiunto_-_finale_15_aprile_2011.pdf|title=CONCLUSO CONTRATTO PER L’ACQUISTO DELLA PARTECIPAZIONE DI CONTROLLO DI AS ROMA S.P.A.|date=16 April 2011|work=Di Benedetto AS Roma LLC, Compagnia Italpetroli S.p.A. &amp; Unicredit S.p.A.|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction date was scheduled on 31 July 2011.

==Presidential history==
Roma have had numerous presidents over the course of their history, some of which have been the owners of the club, others have been honorary presidents. [[Franco Sensi]] was the chairman until his death in 2008, with his daughter Rosella Sensi in place as honorary president.&lt;ref name = president/&gt; Here is a complete list of Roma presidents from 1927 until the present day.&lt;ref name=president&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=presidenti.htm|publisher=Viva la Roma|title=I presidenti dell'A.S.

{{main|A.S. Roma statistics and records}}
[[File:ASRomapositions09.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Historical A.S. Roma positions in Serie A]] 
[[Francesco Totti]] holds Roma's official appearance record, having made 496 (as of March 2008) appearances in all competitions, over the course of 15 seasons from 1992 until the present day.&lt;ref name = uefa/&gt; He also holds the record for [[Serie A]] appearances with 388, as he passed  [[Giacomo Losi]] on 1 March 2008, during a home match against [[Parma F.C.|Parma]].&lt;ref name=Yahoo!&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080301/sp_soccer_afp/fblita|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|title=Comedy of errors helps Roma keep title hopes alive|date=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including all competitions, [[Francesco Totti]] is the all-time leading  goalscorer for Roma, with 195 goals since joining the club, 159 of which were scored in [[Serie A]] (another Roma record).&lt;ref name = uefa/&gt; [[Roberto Pruzzo]], who was the all-time topscorer since 1988 comes in second in all competitions with 136. In the 1930–31 season, [[Rodolfo Volk]] scored 29 goals in [[Serie A]] over the course of a single season, not only was he the league's topscorer that year, but he set a Roma record for most goals scored in a season, which still lasts today.&lt;ref name = uefa/&gt;

Its major founders Fortitudo and Alba having been relegated at the end of 1926–27 campaign, new-founded Roma had to take part to Southern First Division championship (Serie B) for its inaugural season; nevertheless FIGC decided a special enlargement of first level division re-admitting AS Roma as SSC Napoli. The first ever official game participated in by Roma was in the [[Divisione Nazionale|National Division]], the predecessor of [[Serie A]], of [[Divisione Nazionale 1927–28|1927–28]], against [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]]; Roma won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=campionato2829.htm|publisher=ASRTalenti|title=Campionato 1928–29 A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest ever victory recorded by Roma was 9–0 against [[U.S. Cremonese|Cremonese]] during the Serie A season of [[Serie A 1929-30|1929–30]].&lt;ref name = uefa/&gt; The highest defeat Roma have ever suffered is 7–1, this has happened three times; first against [[Juventus]] during [[Serie A 1931-32|1931–32]], then against [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in [[Serie A 1947-48|1947–48]] and most recently against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|2006–07]].&lt;ref name=uefa&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/printoutfiles/competitions/ucl/2006/e/e_1116385_pk.pdf|publisher=UEFA|title=FC Shakhtar Donetsk v A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colours, badge and nicknames==
Roma's colours of maroon red with a golden yellow trim represents the traditional colours of the [[Eternal City]], the official seal of the ''[[Comune di Roma]]'' features the same colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/058/091/stemma.html|publisher=Comuni-Italiani|title=Stemma Comune di Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gold symbolizes God in Roman Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newfoundationspubl.org/househld.htm|publisher=New Foundations|title=The Great Household of God|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the maroon represents [[Roman Empire|imperial]] dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.123football.com/clubs/italy/roma/index.htm|publisher=123football.com|title=A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; White shorts and black socks are usually worn with the maroon red shirt, however in particularly high key games the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.viewimages.com/Search.aspx?mid=56943226&amp;epmid=2&amp;partner=Google|publisher=ViewImages.com|title=Roma – Lazio: February 2006|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ASRomaOldBadge.png|thumb|right|125px|Roma's crest used from 1979 to 1997, also used for their 2009/10 third kit.]]
The kit itself was originally worn by ''[[Roman F.C.|Roman Football Club]]''; one of the three clubs who merged to form the current incarnation in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/roman.html|publisher=ASRomaUltras.it|title=Il Roman – La storia (tratta da &quot;La Roma&quot;)|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the colours they wear, Roma are often nicknamed ''i giallorossi'' meaning the yellow-reds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footballinitaly.com/roma.html|publisher=Football In Italy|title=A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma's away kit is traditionally white, with a third kit changing colour from time to time.

Maybe because of modern sport marketing, the last few years have seen the golden trim and details substituted by light orange. Modern alternate kits have included all orange and orange-maroon versions.

A popular nickname for the club is ''i lupi'' (the wolves), the animal has always featured on the club's badge in different forms throughout their history. Currently the emblem of the team is the one which was used when the club was first founded. It portrays the female wolf with the two infant brothers [[Romulus and Remus]], illustrating the [[Founding of Rome|myth of the creation of Rome]],&lt;ref name = &quot;rom&quot; /&gt; superimposed on a bipartite golden yellow over maroon red shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query_id=21223833&amp;page=2&amp;brand_id=30492|publisher=BrandsoftheWorld.com|title=Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the myth from which the club take their nickname and logo, the twins (sons of [[Mars (god)|Mars]] and [[Rhea Silvia]]) are thrown into the [[River Tiber]] by their uncle [[Amulius]], a she-wolf saved the twins and looked after them.&lt;ref name = &quot;rom&quot; /&gt; Eventually the two twins took revenge on Amulius, before falling out themselves; [[Romulus]] killed [[Remus]] and as thus was made king of a new city named in his honour, Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;rom&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/Reticulum/NORTHERNFRONTIER/WeCameWeSawWeConq/WhereDidTheyComeFrom/Story.htm|publisher=Museums.ncl.ac.uk|title=The Legend of Romulus and Remus|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters and rivalries==
[[File:ASRomaOlimpico.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Roma fans at the Stadio Olimpico.]]
Roma is the fifth most supported football club in Italy behind [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], [[FC Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[AC Milan|Milan]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] with around 6% of Italian football fans supporting the club (according to the Doxa Institute-L'Espresso’s research of April 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio-archivio/163496|publisher=L'Expresso|title=''L'altra metà del pallone'': Supporters of football clubs in Italy|date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the largest section of Roma supporters in the city of Rome have come from the [[Inner city|inner-city]],  especially [[Testaccio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Testaccio&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=campo_testaccio.htm|publisher=Viva la Roma|title=Campo Testaccio|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[ultras]] group of the club was ''Commando Ultrà Curva Sud''&lt;ref name = &quot;fans&quot; /&gt; commonly abbreviated as ''CUCS''; this group was founded by the merger of many smallers groups and was considered one of the most historic in the history of [[European football]].&lt;ref name = &quot;fans&quot; /&gt; However, by the mid-1990s ''CUCS'' had been usurped by rival factions and ultimately broke up. Since that time, the ''[[Curva (stadia)|Curva]] Sud'' of the [[Stadio Olimpico]] has been controlled by more right-wing groups;&lt;ref name = &quot;fans&quot; /&gt; ''A.S. Roma Ultras'', ''Boys'', ''Giovinezza'' and others. The oldest group ''Fedayn'' is [[apolitical]] however and politics is not the ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' of Roma, just a part of their overall identity. In September 2009 the club unveiled plans to build a new [[Stadio Franco Sensi|55,000-capacity stadium]] in Rome's western suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSLT15248220090929|title=Soccer-Roma plan new English-style stadium|date=29 Sep 2009|publisher=Reuters|author=Meadows, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OlimpicoRoma.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Stadio Olimpico]] during a Roma match]]
The most known club anthem and motto is ''Roma,Roma,Roma''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-US/Squadra.aspx?IdSquadra=7&amp;SEOTeamName=AS+Roma|publisher=Goal.com|title=Roma Profile|date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by local singer [[Antonello Venditti]]. The title roughly means &quot;Roma is not to be questioned, it is to be loved&quot; and is sung before each match, the song ''Grazie Roma'', by the same singer, is played at the end of victorious home games. Recently, the main riff of [[The White Stripes]] song ''[[Seven Nation Army]]'' has also become widely popular at games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indie-rock.it/news_look.php?id=408|publisher=Indie-Rock.it|title= 'Seven Nation Army' coro dei tifosi romanisti|date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italian football]] Roma are a club with many rivalries; first and foremost is their rivalry with [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], the club who they share the Stadio Olimpico stadium with. The [[Local derby|derby]] between the two is called the ''[[Derby della Capitale]]'', it is amongst the most heated and emotional [[Major football rivalries|footballing rivalries]] in the world. The fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past including the death of [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] fan, Vincenzo Paparelli in [[Serie A 1979-80|1979–80]] as a result of an [[Flare gun|emergency flare]] fired from the Curva Sud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ultraslazio.it/ukstory.htm|publisher=UltrasLazio.it|title=Ultras History|date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the abandonment of a game in march [[Serie A 2003-04|2004]], following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;derby&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footballinrome.co.uk/news.html|publisher=FootballInRome.co.uk|title=22&amp;nbsp;March: Derby confusion|date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

With [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], Roma also compete in the ''[[Derby del Sole]]'' rivalry meaning the &quot;Derby of the Sun&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footballderbies.com/index.php?country=2
|publisher=FootballDerbies.com|title= Football Derby matches in Italy|date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays fans also consider other Serie A giants like [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (rivalry born especially in the 1980s), [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] (increased in recent years) among their rivals as these four compete for the top four spots in the league table to secure a spot in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fans&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://website.lineone.net/~view_from_the_terrace/italsce.html

===Conflict with English fans===
There have been a number of instances of conflict in recent years between some Roma supporters and fans of English clubs, pointing to an apparent dislike for English fans in some Giallorossi supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soccer: Roma Therapy&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Soccer: Roma Therapy |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2004/01/07/story931987514.asp |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=7 January 2004 |accessdate=5 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason forwarded for this is the defeat to Liverpool in the [[1984 European Cup Final]] at the Stadio Olimpico,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soccer: Roma Therapy&quot; /&gt; and the subsequent violence outside the stadium which saw a number of Liverpool fans stabbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times call for final move&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/thegame/2009/03/ahead-of-the-14.html|title=Times call for final move|date=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there have been further instances of some English supporters being attacked and stabbed in Rome, including incidents in 2001 when Liverpool visited Roma twice and subsequent clashes with Middlesbrough fans in 2006 and Manchester United fans in 2007. In March 2009, a coach carrying Arsenal supporters was attacked by a group of Roma &quot;Ultras&quot; just outside the Stadio Olimpico. The coach's windows were smashed and at least one person entered the vehicle, letting off a flare and stabbed a supporter in the knee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times call for final move&quot; /&gt;

==Associazione Sportiva Roma as a company==
Since 1999, during Franco Sensi's period in charge, Associazione Sportiva Roma has been a ''[[joint stock company]]''. Currently Roma's [[share (finance)|share]]s are distributed between; 67.1% to Compagnia Italpetroli SpA (the Sensi family ''[[Holding company|holding]]''), 2.7% to [[Monte dei Paschi di Siena|Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena]] SpA, 2.5% to Danilo Coppola and 27.7% to other shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.consob.it/mainen/issuers/listed_companies/index.html?codconsob=117470|publisher=Consob|title= A.S.

Along with [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], ''i Lupi'' is one of only three Italian clubs quotated in [[Borsa Italiana]] (Italian stock exchange). According to [[Deloitte Football Money League|The Football Money League]] published by consultants [[Deloitte]], in the season 2005–06, Roma was the twelfth highest earning football club in the world with an [[Deloitte Football Money League#Full listing|estimated revenue]] of €127 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/press_release/0,1014,sid%253D2834%2526cid%253D145152,00.html|publisher=Deloitte UK|title= Real Madrid stays at the top|date=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, after months of speculation, [[George Soros]] was confirmed by Rosella Sensi, CEO of [[Italy|Italian]] [[Serie A]] [[association football]] club A.S. Roma, to be bidding for a takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Roma/Primo_Piano/2008/04_Aprile/18/puntoroma.shtml |language=Italian |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=18 April 2008| title=La stretta finale di Soros distrae lo sprint della Roma}}&lt;/ref&gt; The takeover bid was successively rejected by the Sensi family, who instead preferred to maintain the club's ownership. On August&amp;nbsp;17, 2008 club chairman and owner [[Franco Sensi]] died after a long illness; his place at the chairmanship of the club was successively taken by his daughter Rosella.

===Superleague Formula===
{{Main|A.S. Roma (Superleague Formula team)}}

A.S. Roma has a team in the new [[Superleague Formula]] race car series where teams are sponsored by football clubs. A.S. Roma's current driver is ex [[IndyCar Series]] driver [[Franck Perera]]. The team has posted 3 podiums and is currently operated by [[Alan Docking Racing]]

[[File:Antibody.svg|thumb|255px|Each antibody binds to a specific antigen; an interaction similar to a lock and key.]]

An '''antibody''', also known as an '''immunoglobulin''', is a large Y-shaped [[protein]] used by the [[immune system]] to identify and neutralize foreign objects like [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es. The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, termed an [[antigen]].&lt;ref name=Janeway5&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Charles Janeway|Janeway CA, Jr.]] ''et al''  | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 | id = [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=imm.TOC&amp;depth=10 (electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf)] ISBN 0-8153-3642-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8450761&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Litman GW, Rast JP, Shamblott MJ, Haire RN, Hulst M, Roess W, Litman RT, Hinds-Frey KR, Zilch A, Amemiya CT | title = Phylogenetic diversification of immunoglobulin genes and the antibody repertoire | journal = Mol.

Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can ''tag'' a [[microbe]] or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the [[humoral immune system]].&lt;ref name=Pier&gt;{{cite book | author =  Pier GB, Lyczak JB, Wetzler LM | title = Immunology, Infection, and Immunity | edition = | publisher = ASM Press| year = 2004 | isbn = 1-55581-246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibodies are produced by a type of [[white blood cell]] called a [[plasma cell]].   Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound form that is attached to the surface of a [[B cell]] and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR).  The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called [[plasma cell]]s, or [[memory B cell]]s that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17337763&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borghesi L, Milcarek C | title = From B cell to plasma cell: regulation of V(D)J recombination and antibody secretion | journal = Immunol.

Antibodies are [[glycoprotein]]s belonging to the [[immunoglobulin superfamily]]; the terms ''antibody'' and ''immunoglobulin'' are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=Rhoades&gt;{{cite book | author =  Rhoades RA, Pflanzer RG | title = Human Physiology | edition = 4th | publisher = Thomson Learning | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-534-42174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large [[heavy chain]]s and two small [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chains]]. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different ''[[isotype (immunology)|isotypes]]'' based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Market&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Market E, Papavasiliou FN | title = V(D)J recombination and the evolution of the adaptive immune system | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = E16 | year = 2003 | month = October | pmid = 14551913 | pmc = 212695 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000016 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar,  a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the ''hypervariable region''. Each of these variants can bind to a different target, known as an [[antigen]].&lt;ref name=Janeway5&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Charles Janeway|Janeway CA, Jr]] ''et al.'' | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=imm.TOC&amp;depth=10 | isbn = 978-0-8153-3642-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.&lt;ref name=Rhoades&gt;{{cite book | author =  Rhoades RA, Pflanzer RG | title = Human Physiology| edition = 4th | publisher = Thomson Learning | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-534-42174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of [[gene]] segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or ''paratopes''), followed by random [[mutation]]s in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity.&lt;ref name=Market/&gt;&lt;ref name=diaz&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diaz M, Casali P |title=Somatic immunoglobulin hypermutation |journal=Curr Opin Immunol |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=235–40 |year=2002 |pmid=11869898 |doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(02)00327-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called [[Immunoglobulin class switching|class switching]] that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.

==Forms==
Surface immunoglobulin (Ig) is attached to the membrane of the effector B cells by its transmembrane region, while antibodies are the secreted form of Ig and lack the trans membrane region so that antibodies can be secreted into the bloodstream and body cavities.  As a result, surface Ig and antibodies are identical except for the transmembrane regions. Therefore, they are considered two forms of antibodies: soluble form or membrane-bound form (Parham 21-22).

The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a ''surface immunoglobulin'' (sIg) or a ''membrane immunoglobulin'' (mIg).  It is part of the ''B cell receptor'' (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Antibodies can come in different varieties known as [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]] or classes.  In [[eutheria|placental]] mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. They are each named with an &quot;Ig&quot; prefix that stands for immunoglobulin, another name for antibody, and differ in their biological properties, functional locations and ability to deal with different antigens, as depicted in the table.&lt;ref name = woof&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woof J, Burton D |title=Human antibody-Fc receptor interactions illuminated by crystal structures |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=89–99 |year=2004 |pmid=15040582 |doi=10.1038/nri1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antibody isotype of a [[B cell]] changes during cell [[Pre-pre B cell|development]] and activation.  Immature B cells,  which have never been exposed to an antigen, are known as naïve B cells and express only the IgM isotype in a cell surface bound form.  B cells begin to express both IgM and IgD when they reach maturity—the co-expression of both these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell 'mature' and ready to respond to antigen.&lt;ref name=Goding&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goding J |title=Allotypes of IgM and IgD receptors in the mouse: a probe for lymphocyte differentiation |journal=Contemp Top Immunobiol |volume=8 |issue= |pages=203–43 |year= 1978|pmid=357078}}&lt;/ref&gt;  B cell activation follows engagement of the cell bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into an antibody producing cell called a [[plasma cell]].  In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a [[secrete]]d form rather than a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound form.  Some [[daughter cell]]s of the activated B cells undergo [[isotype switching]], a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.

== Structure ==
Antibodies are heavy (~150&amp;nbsp;k[[Dalton (unit)|Da]]) [[globular protein|globular]] [[plasma protein]]s.  They have sugar chains added to some of their [[amino acid]] residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mattu T, Pleass R, Willis A, Kilian M, Wormald M, Lellouch A, Rudd P, Woof J, Dwek R |title=The glycosylation and structure of human serum IgA1, Fab, and Fc regions and the role of N-glycosylation on Fc alpha receptor interactions |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=273 |issue=4 |pages=2260–72 |year=1998 |pmid=9442070 |doi=10.1074/jbc.273.4.2260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, antibodies are ''[[glycoprotein]]s''.  The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) [[monomer]] (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies can also be [[protein dimer|dimeric]] with two Ig units as with IgA, [[tetramer protein|tetrameric]] with four Ig units like [[teleost fish]] IgM, or [[pentamer]]ic with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM.&lt;ref name = roux&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roux K |title=Immunoglobulin structure and function as revealed by electron microscopy |journal=Int Arch Allergy Immunol |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=85–99 |year=1999 |pmid=10545762 |doi=10.1159/000024226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antibody IgG2.png|thumb|right|Several immunoglobulin domains make up the two heavy chains (red and blue) and the two light chains (green and yellow) of an antibody. The immunoglobulin domains are composed of between 7 (for constant domains) and 9 (for variable domains) [[β-strand]]s. ]] The variable parts of an antibody are its V regions, and the constant part is its C region.

===Immunoglobulin domains===

The Ig monomer is a &quot;Y&quot;-shaped molecule that consists of four [[polypeptide]] chains; two identical ''heavy chains'' and two identical ''light chains'' connected by [[disulfide bond]]s.&lt;ref name = woof/&gt;
Each chain is composed of [[structural domain]]s called [[immunoglobulin domain]]s.  These domains contain about 70-110 [[amino acid]]s and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or IgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barclay A |title=Membrane proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains--a master superfamily of interaction molecules |journal=Semin Immunol |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=215–23 |year=2003 |pmid=14690046 |doi=10.1016/S1044-5323(03)00047-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a characteristic [[immunoglobulin fold]] in which two [[beta sheet]]s create a “sandwich” shape, held together by interactions between conserved [[cysteine]]s and other charged amino acids.

===Heavy chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin heavy chain}}
There are five types of mammalian Ig [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]] denoted by the [[Greek letters]]: α, δ, ε, γ, and μ.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; The type of heavy chain present defines the ''class'' of antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively.&lt;ref name=Rhoades/&gt; Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids, while μ and ε have approximately 550 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt;
[[File:Immunoglobulin basic unit.svg|thumb|1. [[Fragment antigen binding|Fab region]]&lt;br /&gt;2. [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc region]]&lt;br /&gt;3. [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|Heavy chain]] (blue) with one variable (V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) domain followed by a constant domain (C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1), a hinge region, and two more constant (C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 and C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3) domains.&lt;br /&gt;4. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|Light chain]] (green) with one variable (V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and one constant (C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) domain&lt;br /&gt;5. Antigen binding site (paratope)&lt;br /&gt;6. Hinge regions.]]

In [[bird]]s, the major serum antibody, also found in yolk, is called [[Immunoglobulin Y|IgY]]. It is quite different from mammalian IgG. However, in some older literature and even on some commercial life sciences product websites it is still called &quot;IgG&quot;, which is incorrect and can be confusing.

Each heavy chain has two regions, the ''constant region'' and the ''variable region''.  The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of ''three'' tandem (in a line) Ig [[Structural domain|domains]], and a hinge region for added flexibility;&lt;ref name = woof/&gt; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of ''four'' immunoglobulin domains.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt;  The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or [[Clone (B-cell biology)|B cell clone]]. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.

===Light chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin light chain}}
In mammals there are two types of [[immunoglobulin light chain]], which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ).&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals.  Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in lower [[vertebrate]]s like [[Chondrichthyes]] and [[Teleostei]]..

===CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc Regions===&lt;!-- several redirects lead here --&gt;

Some parts of an antibody have unique functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind two antigens (in general identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the ''[[Fab region|Fab (fragment, antigen binding) region]]''. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.&lt;ref name= putnam79&gt;{{cite journal |author=Putnam FW, Liu YS, Low TL |title=Primary structure of a human IgA1 immunoglobulin. IV. Streptococcal IgA1 protease, digestion, Fab and Fc fragments, and the complete amino acid sequence of the alpha 1 heavy chain|journal= J Biol Chem|volume=254 |issue=8 |pages=2865–74|year=1979 |pmid=107164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[paratope]] is shaped at the [[N-terminal end|amino terminal end]] of the antibody [[monomer]] by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is also referred to as the F&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. More specifically, variable loops of β-strands, three each on the light (V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and heavy (V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the [[complementarity determining region]]s (CDRs).
The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al.
&lt;ref name= Chothia1997&gt;

In the framework of the [[immune network theory]], CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.

The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity.  This region is called the ''[[Fc region|Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region]]'', and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of [[Fc receptor]]s, and other immune molecules, such as [[Complement system|complement]] proteins. By doing this, it mediates different [[physiological]] effects including recognition of [[opsonization|opsonized]] particles, [[lysis]] of cells, and [[degranulation]] of [[mast cells]], [[basophils]] and [[eosinophils]].&lt;ref name = woof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heyman B |title=Complement and Fc-receptors in regulation of the antibody response |journal=Immunol Lett |volume=54 |issue=2-3 |pages=195–9 |year=1996 |pmid=9052877 |doi=10.1016/S0165-2478(96)02672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[prenatal]] and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by [[passive immunization]] from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one [[antigen]] (an example is a [[virus]] [[capsid|capsid protein]] fragment). Antibodies contribute to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in three ways: they prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by [[macrophages]] and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other [[immune response]]s such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].&lt;ref name=Ravetch&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ravetch J, Bolland S |title=IgG Fc receptors |journal=Annu Rev Immunol |volume=19 |issue= 1|pages=275–90 |year=2001 |pmid=11244038 |doi=10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IgM white background.png|thumb|left|The secreted mammalian [[IgM]] has five Ig units. Each Ig unit (labeled 1) has two epitope binding [[Fab region]]s, so IgM is capable of binding up to 10 epitopes.]]

===Activation of complement===
Antibodies that bind to surface antigens on, for example, a bacterium attract the first component of the [[complement cascade]] with their [[Fv region|Fc region]] and initiate activation of the &quot;classical&quot; complement system.&lt;ref name=Ravetch/&gt;  This results in the killing of bacteria in two ways.&lt;ref name=Pier/&gt;  First, the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks the microbe for ingestion by [[phagocyte]]s in a process called [[opsonization]]; these phagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the complement cascade.  Secondly, some complement system components form a [[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack complex]] to assist antibodies to kill the  bacterium directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rus H, Cudrici C, Niculescu F |title=The role of the complement system in innate immunity |journal=Immunol Res |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=103–12 |year=2005 |pmid=16234578 |doi=10.1385/IR:33:2:103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activation of effector cells===
To combat pathogens that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, causing them to [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinate]]. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.&lt;ref name=Pier/&gt;

Those cells which recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors which, as the name suggests, interacts with the [[Fc region]] of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies.  The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s will [[degranulation|degranulate]], [[natural killer cell]]s will release [[cytokine]]s and [[cytotoxic]] molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt;

===Natural antibodies===
Humans and higher primates also produce “natural antibodies” which are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or [[passive immunization]]. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide [[galactose]] α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on [[glycosylated]] cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Racaniello, Vincent| url=http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ |date=2009-10-06 |title=Natural antibody protects against viral infection |work=Virology Blog |accessdate=2010-01-22|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uJzysytc |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of [[Organ xenotransplantation|xenotransplantated organs]] is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milland J, Sandrin MS |title=ABO blood group and related antigens, natural antibodies and transplantation |journal=Tissue Antigens |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=459–66 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17176435 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00721.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immunoglobulin diversity ==
Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among  antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mian I, Bradwell A, Olson A |title=Structure, function and properties of antibody binding sites |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=217 |issue=1 |pages=133–51 |year=1991 |pmid=1988675 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(91)90617-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated  that humans generate about 10&amp;nbsp;billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8612345&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fanning LJ, Connor AM, Wu GE |title=Development of the immunoglobulin repertoire |journal=Clin.

Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.&lt;ref name = namazee&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nemazee D |title=Receptor editing in lymphocyte development and central tolerance |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=728–40 |year=2006 |pmid=16998507 |doi=10.1038/nri1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain variability===
[[File:Complementarity determining regions.PNG|thumb|250px|right|The complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain are shown in red ({{PDB|1IGT}})]]
The region (locus) of a chromosome that encodes an antibody is large and contains several distinct genes for each domain of the antibody—the locus containing heavy chain genes ([[IGH@]]) is found on [[chromosome 14]], and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes ([[IGL@]] and [[IGK@]]) are found on chromosomes [[chromosome 22|22]] and [[chromosome 2|2]] in humans.  One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells.  Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops   known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or [[complementarity determining region]]s (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3).  CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions.  The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs.  Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability.  This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Parham. &quot;The Immune System. 2nd ed. Garland Science: New York, 2005. pg.47-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===V(D)J recombination===
{{details|V%28D%29J recombination}}
[[File:VDJ recombination.png|thumb|250px|right|Simplistic overview of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains]]
Somatic recombination of immunoglobulins, also known as ''V(D)J recombination'', involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments. These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments.&lt;ref name = namazee/&gt;  V, D and J segments are found in [[immunoglobulin heavy chain|Ig heavy chains]], but only V and J segments are found in [[Immunoglobulin light chain|Ig light chains]]. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the [[genome]]s of [[mammal]]s. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain).  As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different [[wikt:paratope|paratopes]], and thus different antigen specificities.&lt;ref name=Market/&gt;

After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as [[allelic exclusion]]) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bergman Y, Cedar H |title=A stepwise epigenetic process controls immunoglobulin allelic exclusion |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=753–61 |year=2004 |pmid=15459667 |doi=10.1038/nri1458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation===
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Somatic hypermutation]] and [[Affinity maturation]]''

Following activation with antigen, B cells begin to [[Cell division|proliferate]] rapidly.  In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of [[point mutation]], by a process called ''somatic hypermutation'' (SHM). SHM results in approximately one [[nucleotide]] change per variable gene, per cell division.&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt;  As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight [[amino acid]] differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.

This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody’s antigen-binding [[Chemical affinity|affinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Honjo T, Habu S |title=Origin of immune diversity: genetic variation and selection |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=54 |issue= 1|pages=803–30 |year=1985 |pmid=3927822 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.54.070185.004103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity).&lt;ref name=orguil&gt;{{cite journal |author=Or-Guil M, Wittenbrink N, Weiser AA, Schuchhardt J |title=Recirculation of germinal center B cells: a multilevel selection strategy for antibody maturation |journal=Immunol.

The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called ''affinity maturation''. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from [[helper T cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Neuberger M, Ehrenstein M, Rada C, Sale J, Batista F, Williams G, Milstein C |title=Memory in the B-cell compartment: antibody affinity maturation |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=355 |issue=1395 |pages=357–60 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10794054 |pmc=1692737 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immunoglobulin class switching|Isotype or class switching]] is a [[biological process]] occurring after activation of the B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG).&lt;ref name=Market/&gt; The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naïve B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function, therefore, after activation, an antibody with a IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stavnezer J, Amemiya CT |title=Evolution of isotype switching |journal=Semin. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=257–75 |year=2004 |pmid=15522624 |doi=10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved [[nucleotide]] motifs, called ''switch (S) regions'', found in [[DNA]] upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a series of [[enzyme]]s at two selected S-regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Durandy A |title=Activation-induced cytidine deaminase: a dual role in class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation |journal=Eur.

This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lieber MR, Yu K, Raghavan SC |title=Roles of nonhomologous DNA end joining, V(D)J recombination, and class switch recombination in chromosomal translocations |journal=DNA Repair (Amst.) |volume=5 |issue=9-10 |pages=1234–45 |year=2006 |pmid=16793349 |doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2006.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical applications==
===Disease diagnosis and therapy===
Detection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical [[medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], and applications such as [[serology]] depend on these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elispot-analyzers.de/english/elisa-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in [[ELISA]] assays |accessdate=2007-05-08 |work=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK00Qems |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elispot-analyzers.de/english/elispot-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in [[ELISPOT]] assays |accessdate=2007-05-08 |work=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK00pHh5 |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[titer]] of antibodies directed against [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[Lyme disease]] is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected, or the infection occurred a ''very'' long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed. In [[clinical immunology]], levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by [[nephelometry]] (or turbidimetry) to characterize the antibody profile of patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stern P |title=Current possibilities of turbidimetry and nephelometry |journal=Klin Biochem Metab |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=146–151 |year=2006| url= http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/kbm0603-146.pdf|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK01zkxp |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of [[liver]] damage in patients whom the diagnosis is unclear.&lt;ref name=Rhoades/&gt; For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic [[cirrhosis]], elevated IgM indicates [[viral hepatitis]] and [[primary biliary cirrhosis]], while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, [[autoimmune hepatitis]] and cirrhosis. [[Autoimmune disorder]]s can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own [[epitope]]s; many can be detected through [[blood test]]s.  Antibodies directed against [[red blood cell]] surface antigens in immune mediated [[hemolytic anemia]] are detected with the [[Coombs test]].&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book |last=Dean |first=Laura  |title= Blood Groups and Red Cell Antigens| year= 2005|publisher=National Library of Medicine (US), |location=NCBI Bethesda (MD) |isbn= |chapter= Chapter 4: Hemolytic disease of the newborn |chapterurl= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=rbcantigen.chapter.ch4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in [[blood transfusion]] preparation and also for antibody screening in [[antenatal]] women.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;
Practically, several immunodiagnostic methods based on detection of complex antigen-antibody are used to diagnose infectious diseases, for example [[ELISA]], [[immunofluorescence]], [[Western blot]], [[immunodiffusion]], [[immunoelectrophoresis]], and [[magnetic immunoassay]]. Antibodies raised against [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.

===Prenatal therapy===
[[Rhesus factor]], also known as Rhesus D (RhD) antigen, is an antigen found on [[red blood cell]]s; individuals that are Rhesus-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rhesus-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal [[childbirth]], delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a [[fetus]] can enter the mother's system.  In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the [[pregnancy]], and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Urbaniak S, Greiss M |title=RhD haemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn |journal=Blood Rev |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=44–61 |year=2000 |pmid=10805260 |doi=10.1054/blre.1999.0123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rho(D) immune globulin]] antibodies are specific for human Rhesus D (RhD) antigen.&lt;ref name= Fung&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fung Kee Fung K, Eason E, Crane J, Armson A, De La Ronde S, Farine D, Keenan-Lindsay L, Leduc L, Reid G, Aerde J, Wilson R, Davies G, Désilets V, Summers A, Wyatt P, Young D |title=Prevention of Rh alloimmunization |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Can |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=765–73 |year=2003 |pmid=12970812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-RhD antibodies are administered as part of a [[prenatal care|prenatal treatment regimen]] to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rhesus-negative mother has a Rhesus-positive fetus.  Treatment of a mother with Anti-RhD antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother's system from the fetus.  Importantly, this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to &quot;remember&quot; Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rhesus antigens of the current or subsequent babies.  Rho(D) Immune Globulin treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to [[Rh disease]], but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself.&lt;ref name= Fung/&gt;

Specific antibodies are produced by injecting an [[antigen]] into a [[mammal]], such as a [[mouse]], [[rat]] or [[rabbit]] for small quantities of antibody, or [[goat]], [[sheep]], or [[horse]] for large quantities of antibody.  Blood isolated from these animals contains ''[[polyclonal antibodies]]''—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the [[Blood plasma|serum]], which can now be called [[antiserum]]. Antigens are also injected into [[chicken]]s for generation of polyclonal antibodies in [[egg yolk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tini M, Jewell UR, Camenisch G, Chilov D, Gassmann M |title=Generation and application of chicken egg-yolk antibodies |journal=Comp.

In research, purified antibodies are used in many applications. They are most commonly used to identify and locate [[intracellular]] and [[extracellular]] proteins.

==Structure prediction==

The importance of antibodies in health care and the [[biotechnology]] industry demands knowledge of their structures at [[Image resolution|high resolution]].  This information is used for [[protein engineering]], modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. [[X-ray crystallography]] is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal since they do not produce empirical structures.

==History==

The first use of the term &quot;antibody&quot; occurred in a text by [[Paul Ehrlich]]. The term ''Antikörper'' (the German word for ''antibody'') appears in the conclusion of his article &quot;Experimental Studies on Immunity&quot;, published in October 1891, which states that &quot;if two substances give rise to two different antikörper, then they themselves must be different&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lindenmann&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindenmann, Jean  |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119531625/PDFSTART |title=Origin of the Terms 'Antibody' and 'Antigen' |journal=Scand.

Further work concentrated on characterizing the structures of the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by [[Gerald Edelman]] and [[Joseph Gally]] of the antibody [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edelman GM, Gally JA |title=The nature of Bence-Jones proteins.

'''Alessandro Scarlatti''' (2 May 1660 &amp;ndash; 24 October 1725) was an Italian [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[composer]] especially famous for his [[opera]]s and chamber [[cantata]]s.  He is considered the founder of the [[Neapolitan school]] of opera.  He was the father of two other composers, [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and [[Pietro Filippo Scarlatti]].

==Life==
Scarlatti was born in [[Palermo]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. He is generally said to have been a pupil of [[Giacomo Carissimi]] in [[Rome]], and some theorize that he had some connection with northern Italy because his early works seem to show the influence of [[Alessandro Stradella|Stradella]] and [[Giovanni Legrenzi|Legrenzi]]. The production at Rome of his opera ''Gli Equivoci nell sembiante'' (1679) gained him the support of Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] (who at the time was living in Rome), and he became her ''Maestro di Cappella''. In February 1684 he became '''Maestro di Cappella'' to the [[viceroy]] of [[Naples]], perhaps through the influence of his sister, an opera singer, who might have been the mistress of an influential Neapolitan noble. Here he produced a long series of operas, remarkable chiefly for their fluency and expressiveness, as well as other music for state occasions. 

In 1702 Scarlatti left Naples and did not return until the Spanish domination had been superseded by that of the Austrians. In the interval he enjoyed the patronage of [[Ferdinando (III) de' Medici|Ferdinando de' Medici]], for whose private theatre near [[Florence]] he composed operas, and of [[Cardinal Ottoboni]], who made him his ''maestro di cappella'', and procured him a similar post at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome in 1703. 

After visiting [[Venice]] and [[Urbino]] in 1707, Scarlatti took up his duties in Naples again in 1708, and remained there until 1717. By this time Naples seems to have become tired of his music; the Romans, however, appreciated it better, and it was at the [[Teatro Capranica]] in Rome that he produced some of his finest operas (''Telemaco'', 1718; ''Marco Attilio Regolò'', 1719; ''[[La Griselda]]'', 1721), as well as some noble specimens of church music, including a [[mass (music)|mass]] for chorus and orchestra, composed in honor of [[Saint Cecilia]] for [[Cardinal Acquaviva]] in 1721.   His last work on a large scale appears to have been the unfinished [[serenata]] for the marriage of the prince of [[Stigliano]] in 1723. He died in Naples in 1725.

==Scarlatti's music==
Scarlatti's music forms an important link between the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] Italian vocal styles of the 17th century, with their centers in Florence, Venice and [[Rome]], and the classical school of the 18th century. Scarlatti's style, however, is more than a transitional element in Western music; like most of his Naples colleagues he shows an almost modern understanding of the psychology of modulation and also frequently  makes use of the ever-changing phrase lengths so typical of the Napoli school. His early operas (''Gli equivoci nel sembiante'' 1679; ''L’honestà negli amori'' 1680, containing the famous aria &quot;Già il sole dal Gange&quot;; ''Il Pompeo'' 1683, containing the well-known airs &quot;O cessate di piagarmi&quot; and &quot;Toglietemi la vita ancor,&quot; and others down to about 1685) retain the older cadences in their [[recitatives]], and a considerable variety of neatly constructed forms in their charming little arias, accompanied sometimes by the string quartet, treated with careful elaboration, sometimes with the continuo alone. By 1686 he had definitely established the &quot;Italian overture&quot; form (second edition of ''Dal male il bene''), and had abandoned the [[ostinato|ground bass]] and the [[binary form]] air in two stanzas in favour of the [[ternary form]] or [[da capo]] type of air.  His best operas of this period are ''La Rosaura'' (1690, printed by the [[Gesellschaft für Musikforschung]]), and ''Pirro e Demetrio'' (1694), in which occur the arias &quot;Le Violette&quot;, and &quot;Ben ti sta, traditor&quot;.

From about 1697 onwards (''La caduta del Decemviri''), influenced partly perhaps by the style of [[Giovanni Bononcini]] and probably more by the taste of the viceregal court, his opera arias become more conventional and commonplace in rhythm, while his scoring is hasty and crude, yet not without brilliance (''L'Eraclea'', 1700), the [[oboe]]s and [[trumpet]]s being frequently used, and the [[violin]]s often playing in unison. The operas composed for Ferdinando  de' Medici are lost; they might have given a more favourable idea of his style as his correspondence with the prince shows that they were composed with a very sincere sense of inspiration. 

''Mitridate Eupatore'', accounted his masterpiece, composed for Venice in 1707, contains music far in advance of anything that Scarlatti had written for Naples, both in technique and in intellectual power. The later Neapolitan operas (''L'amor volubile e tiranno'' 1709; ''La principessa fedele'' 1710; ''Tigrane'', 1714, &amp;c.) are showy and effective rather than profoundly emotional; the instrumentation marks a great advance on previous work, since the main duty of accompanying the voice is thrown upon the string quartet, the harpsichord being reserved exclusively for the noisy instrumental [[ritornello|ritornelli]]. In his opera ''Teodora'' (1697) he originated the use of the orchestral ''ritornello''.  

His last group of operas, composed for Rome, exhibit a deeper poetic feeling, a broad and dignified style of melody, a strong dramatic sense, especially in accompanied recitatives, a device which he himself had been the first to use as early as 1686 (''Olimpia vendicata'') and a much more modern style of orchestration, the horns appearing for the first time, and being treated with striking effect.

Besides the operas, [[oratorio]]s (''Agar et Ismaele esiliati'', 1684; ''Christmas Oratorio'', c. 1705; ''S. Filippo Neri'', 1714; and others) and serenatas, which all exhibit a similar style, Scarlatti composed upwards of five hundred chamber-cantatas for solo voice. These represent the most intellectual type of chamber-music of their period, and it is to be regretted that they have remained almost entirely in manuscript, since a careful study of them is indispensable to anyone who wishes to form an adequate idea of Scarlatti's development. 

{{listen|filename=Scarlatti - Toccata 3.ogg|title=Toccata 3|description=Performed by Sylvia Kind on a harpsichord of the type made in the early 20th century|format=[[ogg]]}}
His few remaining masses (the story of his having composed two hundred is hardly credible) and church music in general are comparatively unimportant, except the great ''St Cecilia Mass'' (1721), which is one of the first attempts at the style which reached its height in the great masses of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. His instrumental music, though not without interest, is curiously antiquated as compared with his vocal works.

== History ==
[[Image:Aston Martin 2-Litre 2 4-Seater Sports 1937.jpg|thumb|Aston Martin 2-Litre 2/4-Seater Sports 1937]]
Aston Martin was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Walker Birch Martin (1878 – 14 October 1945) was a [[Cornishman]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Bamford]]. The two had joined forces as Bamford &amp; Martin the previous year to sell cars made by [[Singer (car)|Singer]] from premises in Callow Street, London where they also serviced [[GWK (car)|GWK]] and [[Calthorpe cars|Calthorpe]] vehicles. Martin raced specials at [[Aston Hill]] near [[Aston Clinton]], and the pair decided to make their own vehicles. &lt;ref&gt;E.M. Inman-Hunter, Notes on the Original Aston-Martin Company, ''Motor Sport'', May 1944, Page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first car to be named ''Aston Martin'' was created by Martin by fitting a four-cylinder [[Coventry-Simplex]] engine to the chassis of a 1908 [[Isotta-Fraschini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

They acquired premises at Henniker Place in [[Kensington]] and produced their first car in March 1915.  Production could not start because of the outbreak of [[World War I]], and Martin joined the [[Admiralty]] and Bamford the [[Royal Army Service Corps]]. All machinery was sold to the [[Sopwith Aviation Company]].

=== Inter war years ===
After the war the company was refounded at Abingdon Road, Kensington and a new car designed to carry the Aston-Martin name. Bamford left in 1920 and the company was revitalised with funding from [[Count Louis Zborowski]]. In 1922, Bamford &amp; Martin produced cars to compete in the [[French Grand Prix]], and the cars set world speed and endurance records at [[Brooklands]]. Three works Team Cars with 16 valve [[:Image:Bla 5mr.jpg|twin cam engines]] were built for racing and record breaking: chassis number 1914, later developed as the Green Pea; chassis number 1915, the [[Razor Blade]] record car; and chassis number 1916, later developed as the [[Halford Special]].  Approximately 55 cars were built for sale in two configurations, [[:Image:Side valve.jpg|long chassis]] and short chassis. The company went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by Lady Charnwood, who put her son John Benson on the board. The company failed again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926, with Lionel Martin leaving.

Later that year, Bill Renwick, Augustus (Bert) Bertelli and a number of rich investors, including Lady Charnwood, took control of the company and renamed it Aston Martin Motors, and moved it to the former Whitehead Aircraft Limited works in Feltham.
Renwick and Bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead cam 4 cylinder engine, using Renwick's patented combustion chamber design, and had tested it in an Enfield Allday chassis. It was the only 'Renwick and Bertelli' motor car made. It was known as 'Buzzbox' and survives to this day.

They had planned to sell this engine to motor manufacturers, but having heard that the Aston Martin car was no longer in production they realised that they could capitalise on the reputation of the Aston Martin name (what we would now call the brand) to give themselves a head start in the production of a completely new car.

Between the years 1926 and 1937 Bertelli was the technical director of Aston Martin, and the designer of all subsequent Aston Martin cars during this period, these being known as the 'Bertelli cars'. They included the 1½ litre 'T-type', the 'International, the 'Le Mans, the 'MKII' its racing derivative the 'Ulster, and the 2 litre 15/98 and its racing derivative the 'Speed Model'.

Mostly open two seater sports cars and mostly bodied by Bert Bertelli's brother Enrico (Harry)a small number of long chassis four seater tourers, dropheads and saloons were also produced.

Bertelli was very keen to race his cars and he was a very competent driver. One of the very few motor manufacturers to actually sit in and race the cars he designed and built, the competition no doubt 'improved the breed' and the 'LM' team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at Le Mans and the Mille Miglia.

Financial problems reappeared in 1932 and the company was rescued by L. Prideaux Brune who funded the company for the following year before passing the company on to Sir Arthur Sutherland.  In 1936, the company decided to concentrate on road cars. Car production had always been on a small scale and until the advent of [[World War II]] halted work only about 700 had been made. During the war years aircraft components were produced.

=== The David Brown era ===
[[Image:1958-aston-martin-archives.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1958 Aston Martin DB Mark III]]
In 1947, [[David Brown Limited]] bought the company under the leadership of managing director Sir [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]]—its &quot;post-war saviour&quot;. David Brown also acquired [[Lagonda]] that year, and both companies shared resources and workshops. In 1955, David Brown bought the [[Tickford]] coachbuilding company and its site at Tickford Street in [[Newport Pagnell]], and that was the beginning of the classic series of cars bearing the initials &quot;DB&quot;. In 1950, the company announced the [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]], followed by the [[Aston Martin DB2/4|DB2/4]] in 1953, the [[Aston Martin DB2/4|DB2/4 MkII]] in 1955, the [[Aston Martin DB Mark III|DB Mark III]] in 1957 and the Italian-styled 3.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]] in 1958. All the cars established a good racing pedigree for the firm, but the DB4 was the key to establishing the company's reputation, which was cemented by the famous [[Aston Martin DB5|DB5]] in 1963. The company continued developing the &quot;grand touring&quot; style with the [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] (1965–70), and the [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]] (1967-1972).

=== 1970s—Changing ownership ===
Despite the cars' appreciation in value, the company was often financially troubled. In 1972, the company was sold to another company called Company Developments Ltd., backed by a [[Birmingham]]-based consortium, and chaired by [[chartered accountant]] and company director [[William Willson (MBE)|William Willson]], MBE.&lt;ref name=Autocar1972&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Unsigned| title = News and Comment: Aston Martin changes hands| series = 136| journal = [[Autocar]]| volume = (nbr 3960)| page = 2 |date = date 9 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company was resold, following a further bankruptcy event, by the Receiver in 1975 to North American businessmen Peter Sprague and George Minden for £1.05 million.&lt;ref name=Car197809&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Mel Nicols| title = The Aston Miracle| journal = [[Car Magazine]]| volume = | page = pages 35–362 |date = date September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A successful turn-around strategy led to the recruitment of 360 new employees and, by 1977, a trading profit of £750,000.&lt;ref name=Car197809/&gt;  The new owners pushed the company into modernising its line, producing the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]] in 1977, the convertible [[Aston Martin V8|Volante]] in 1978, and the one-off [[William Towns]]-styled [[Aston Martin Bulldog|Bulldog]] in 1980. Towns also styled the futuristic new [[Aston Martin Lagonda|Lagonda]] saloon, based on the V8 model.

In 1980 Aston-Martin had plans, which did not materialize, to buy [[MG (car)|MG]], which they would have utilized as a sister marque, probably building smaller sports cars. Ideas were plotted to design a new model and they revealed to the press their approach to an &quot;updated&quot; &quot;1981&quot; model [[MG MGB|MGB]].

The company was badly hit by the economic contraction of the early 1980s as worldwide sales of Aston Martin shrank to three per week and chairman [[Alan Curtis]] together with fellow shareholders American [[Peter Sprague]] and Canadian [[George Minden]] came close to shutting down the production side of the business, to concentrate on service and [[Automotive restoration|restoration]]. At this point Curtis attended the 1980 Pace sponsored [[Stirling Moss]] benefit day at [[Brands Hatch]], and met fellow [[Farnham]] resident [[Victor Gauntlett]].

=== 1980s—Victor Gauntlett ===
Gauntlett bought a 12.5% stake in Aston Martin for £500,000 via [[Pace Petroleum]] in 1980, with [[Tim Hearley]] of [[CH Industrials]] taking a similar share. Pace and CHI took over as joint 50/50 owners at the beginning of 1981, with Gauntlett as executive chairman. Gauntlett also led the sales team, and after some development and a lot of publicity when it became the world’s fastest 4-seater production car, was able to sell with success the [[Aston Martin Lagonda]] into Persian Gulf states, particularly Oman, Kuwait and Qatar.&lt;ref name=VGOBIT&gt;{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030409/ai_n12682539|title= Obituary: Victor Gauntlett |publisher= Independent, The (London) |accessdate=2008-02-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080203121039/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030409/ai_n12682539 |archivedate = February 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding that it would take some time to develop new Aston Martin products, they created an engineering service subsidiary  [[Tickford]] to develop automotive products for other companies. Products included a Tickford [[Austin Metro]], a Tickford [[Ford Capri]] and even Tickford train interiors, particularly on the [[Jaguar XJS]].&lt;ref name=VGOBIT/&gt; Pace continued sponsoring racing events, and now sponsored all Aston Martin Owners Club events, taking a Tickford engined Nimrod Group C car owned by AMOC President [[Viscount Downe]], which came third in the Manufacturers Championship in both 1982 and 1983. It also finished seventh in the [[1982 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race. However, sales of production cars were now at an all time low of 30 cars produced in 1982.&lt;ref name=VGOBIT/&gt;

As trading became tighter in the petroleum market, and Aston Martin was requiring more time and money, Gauntlett agreed to sell Hays/Pace to the [[Kuwait Investment Office]] in September 1983. As Aston Martin required greater investment, he also agreed to sell his share holding to American importer and Greek shipping tycoon [[Peter Livanos]], who invested via his joint venture company with [[Nick Papanicalou|Nick]] and [[John Papanicalou]], ALL Inc. Gauntlett remained chairman of the AML company 55% owned by ALL, with Tickford a 50/50 venture between ALL and CHI. The uneasy relationship was ended when ALL exercised options to buy  a larger share in AML; CHI's residual shares were exchanged for CHI's complete ownership of Tickford, which retained development of existing Aston Martin projects. In 1984, Titan the main shipping company of the Papanicolaou’s was in trouble, so Livanos's father George bought out the Papanicolaou's shares in ALL, while Gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25% holding in AML. The deal valued Aston Martin/AML at £2 million, the year it built its 10,000th car.&lt;ref name=VGOBIT/&gt;

Although as a result Aston Martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant, Gauntlett bought a stake in Italian styling house [[Zagato]], and resurrected its collaboration with Aston Martin. David Martin gained part ownership in 1997.
[[Image:Aston Martin Volante.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Aston Martin V8 Vantage from ''[[The Living Daylights]]'']]
In 1986, Gauntlett negotiated the return of fictional British secret agent [[James Bond]] to Aston Martin. [[Cubby Broccoli]] had chosen to recast the character using actor [[Timothy Dalton]], in an attempt to re-root the Bond-brand back to a more [[Sean Connery]]-like feel. Gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|Vantage]] for use in the filming of ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and sold a Volante to Broccoli for use at his home in America. Gauntlett turned down the role of a [[KGB]] colonel in the film, however: &quot;I would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldpress.html |title=TLD - Press (Allies/MI6) |publisher=thegoldengun.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the company was doing well, Gauntlett knew it needed extra funds to survive in the long term. In May 1987, Gauntlett and [[Prince Michael of Kent]] were staying at the home of Contessa Maggi, the wife of the founder of the original [[Mille Miglia]], while watching the revival event. Another house guest was [[Walter Hayes]], vice-President of [[Ford of Europe]]. Despite problems over the previous acquisition of [[AC Cars]], Hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in [[Ford]] taking a share holding in September 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicdriver.com/upload/classicinside/archive/CIUK2003-14.htm |title=ClassicInside - The ClassicDriver Newsletter |publisher=Classicdriver.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, having produced some 5,000 cars in 20 years, a revived economy and successful sales of limited edition [[Aston Martin Vantage|Vantage]], and 52 [[Aston Martin V8 Zagato|Volante Zagato]] coupes at £86,000 each; the company finally retired the ancient V8 and introduced the [[Aston Martin Virage|Virage]] range—the first new Aston launched in 20 years.

Although Gauntlett was contractually to stay as chairman for two years, his racing interests took Aston back into sports car racing in 1989 with limited European success. However, with engine rule changes for the 1990 season and the launch of the new [[Aston Martin Volante]] model, Ford provided the limited supply of [[Cosworth]] engines to the [[Jaguar cars]] racing team. As the [[Aston Martin DB7|&quot;small Aston&quot; DB7]] would require a large engineering input, Ford agreed to take full control of Aston Martin, and Gauntlett handed over the company chairmanship to Hayes in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/13/1050172472030.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Keeping the best of British running | date=2003-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Aston Martin Virage#Vantage|Vantage]] version was announced, and the following year the company renewed the DB range by announcing the [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]].

=== The Ford era ===
Ford placed Aston in the [[Premier Automotive Group]], substantially invested in new manufacturing and quickly ramped up production. In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in [[Bloxham]]. In 1995, the company produced a record 700 vehicles.  Until the Ford era cars had been produced by hand coachbuilding craft methods, such as the [[English wheel]]. In 1998 the 2,000th DB7 was built, and in 2002 the 6,000th, exceeding production of all previous DB models. The DB7 range was boosted by the addition of [[Aston Martin DB7|V12 Vantage]] models in 1999, and in 2001 the company introduced the V12-engined [[Aston Martin Vanquish]].

At the North American International Auto Show in [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 2003, Aston Martin introduced the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|AMV8 Vantage]] concept car. Expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005, the Vantage brought back the classic V8 engine to allow the company to compete in a larger market. 2003 also saw the opening of the [[Gaydon]] factory, the first purpose-built factory in Aston Martin's history. Also introduced in 2003 was the [[Aston Martin DB9|DB9]] coupé, which replaced the ten-year-old [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]]. A [[Roadster|convertible]] version of the DB9, the [[DB9 Volante]], was introduced at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show.

In October 2004, the company set up the dedicated {{convert|12500|m2}} [[Aston Martin Engine Plant|AMEP]] engine production plant within the [[Ford Germany]] [[Niehl, Cologne]] plant. With capacity to produce up to 5000 engines a year by 100 especially trained personnel, like traditional Aston Martin engine production from Newport Pagnell, assembly of each unit is entrusted to a single technician from a pool of 30, with V8 and V12 variants assembled in under 20 hours. By bringing engine production back to within the company, the promise was that Aston Martin would be able to produce small runs of higher performance variants engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astonmartins.com/factory/amep.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded engine capacity allowed in 2006, the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|V8 Vantage]] sports car to enter production at the Gaydon factory, joining the DB9 and DB9 Volante.

In December 2003 Aston Martin announced it would return to motor racing in 2005. A new division was created, called [[Aston Martin Racing]], which became responsible, together with [[Prodrive]], for the design, development, and management of the DBR9 program. The DBR9 competes in the GT class in [[sports car racing|sports car races]], including the world-famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].

==== Sale by Ford ====
In 2006, an internal review of costs and realisable value on investment led Ford to consider divesting itself of parts of its [[Premier Automotive Group]]. After suggestions of selling [[Jaguar Cars]], [[Land Rover]] or [[Volvo Cars]], Ford appointed [[UBS AG]] to sell all or part of Aston Martin by auction and announced the fact in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez J [http://www.motorauthority.com/cars/aston-martin/aston-martin-the-past-the-present-and-tomorrow/ motorauthority.com Ford confirms Aston Martin is for sale] at MotorAuthority, 31 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007—A new era begins ===
On 12 March 2007 a consortium led by [[Prodrive]] chairman [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] purchased Aston Martin for £475m/$848m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1254955,00.html |title=00-Heaven!

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford will keep a stake in the company (valued at [[Pound sterling|£]]&amp;nbsp;40&amp;nbsp;million / [[United States dollar|$]]&amp;nbsp;70&amp;nbsp;million). The consortium also consisted of John Sinders, an Aston Martin collector; and two Kuwaiti investment companies, Investment Dar and Adeem Investment Co.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''{{main|Asian Highway Network#First Car Crossing}}''
Between June and August 2007, the first east-west crossing of the full new [[Asian Highway Network|Asian Highway]] was achieved by Britons Richard Meredith and Phil Colley driving a [[V8 Vantage]]. Following the [[AH1]] and the [[AH5]] from [[Tokyo]] (the highway’s eastern terminus) to [[Istanbul]] at the western end, they drove a total of 12089&amp;nbsp;km (7512 miles) (at about 250 kilometres per day) before joining the European motorway network for another 3259&amp;nbsp;km (2025 miles) to London. The objective of the event was to demonstrate the durability of the V8 Vantage across hazardous terrain—and also to publicize the car in China. The exercise was so successful that the company had opened dealerships in [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]] within three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

On 19 July 2007, the [[Newport Pagnell]] plant rolled out its last car, a Vanquish S.  Nearly 13,000 cars had been made there since 1955. The Tickford Street factory remains in Aston Martin ownership as the restoration and service department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; U.K. production is subsequently concentrated at Gaydon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astonmartins.com/factory/gaydon.htm Aston Martin Gaydon] at Tim Cottingham's Aston Martins (non-official) site&lt;/ref&gt; on the former RAF V-bomber airfield. On 4 March 2008, in announcing a partnership with [[Magna Steyr]] to outsource manufacture of 2000+ cars annually at Graz, Austria, the company stated &lt;blockquote&gt; The continuing growth and success of the company is based upon Gaydon as the focal point and heart of the business, with the design and engineering of all Aston Martin products continuing to be carried out there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astonmartin.com/thecompany/news?a=203a26c4-47e1-4667-9a0c-3ddb9415aa1f Statement by Aston Martin's CEO, Dr Ulrich Bez] Official site, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aston Martin has also boosted its worldwide appeal by opening more dealers in Europe, as well as branches in China for the first time in its 93 year history in [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]]. This has brought their dealership programme to 120 dealers in 28 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aston Martin News - Aston Martin arrives in China|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/eng/thecompany/news?a=a7e62136-48fa-487b-8065-fe2a12e60af1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2008, Aston Martin announced the revival of the [[Lagonda]] marque. A concept will be shown in 2009, coinciding with the brand's 100th anniversary. The first production cars should come in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aston Martin News - Aston Martin CEO confirms the revival of the Lagonda Marque|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/thecompany/news?a=007b120b-8120-4ad9-80f9-60da21ed0c01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Aston Martin announced that it would cut its 1850 workforce by 600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7759239.stm |title=England &amp;#124; Third of jobs go at Aston Martin |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009—Return to Le Mans ===
{{main|Aston Martin Racing}}
In January 2009, it was announced that the company was entering the 2009 [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 Hours]] race as a factory team in the prestigious LMP1 division. After competing throughout the 2008 season with a [[Lola B08/60]] LMP1 Coupe under the Charouz Racing banner, Aston Martin used a slightly modified Lola LMP1 design for their programme, the [[Lola-Aston Martin B09/60]]. Three Lola-Aston Martins were entered in the 2009 and 2010 Le Mans 24 Hours by Aston Martin Racing. Aston Martin also competed in the complete Le Mans series with the Lola-Aston Martin LMP cars, starting the season at Barcelona in early April. The 2009 programme got off to an unfortunate start at the pre season Paul Ricard test on March 8 when Tomas Enge destroyed the 007 car in an accident. Aston Martin Racing subsequently took delivery of a new Lola to replace the written off chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What economic downturn?

== Aston Martins in film and culture ==
{{In popular culture|date=March 2011}}
*Author [[Ian Fleming]] gave his [[James Bond]] hero a [[Aston Martin DB Mark III|DB Mark III]] in the seventh novel, ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]''. A long association between 007 and the marque began on screen with the silver [[Aston Martin DB5|DB5]] that appears in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965). This was James Bond's company car, and in ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995) and ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997) appeared to have become his private car. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969) a metallic-green [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]] appears at the beginning and end of the movie. After an interlude with [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]], Aston Martins were again used: a charcoal-grey V8 Volante and Vantage in ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987). After switching to [[BMW]] for several films, the Vanquish appeared in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002).  In ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006), James Bond drives both the classic DB5 which becomes his personal vehicle after winning a poker game, and the new DBS which is revealed to be his new company car.
*[[Tippi Hedren]]'s character in the 1963 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' drove a silver [[Aston Martin DB2/4]] drophead coupe (convertible).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/trivia&lt;/ref&gt;
*A silver/grey convertible DB4 was driven by [[Michael Caine]]'s character in the original 1969 version of ''[[The Italian Job]]''.
*A Bahama Yellow Aston Martin DBS is driven by [[Sir Roger Moore]] in the 1971 TV series ''[[The Persuaders!]]''. A [[DBS V8]] was to be used in the series, however no V8 car was ready, so a six-cylinder DBS was modified and badged to look like a DBS V8 for use in the show.
*A DBS and V8 Vantage Roadster is featured in the [[Aston Martin Music]] (2010) music video, which was produced by [[J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]]. The song was recorded by rapper [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]] and featured rapper [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] and singer [[Chrisette Michele]].

'''Albert Pike''' (December 29, 1809–April 2, 1891) was an [[Lawyer|attorney]], Confederate officer, writer, and [[freemasonry|Freemason]]. Pike is the only [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] military officer or figure to be honored with an outdoor statue in [[Washington, D.C.]] (in [[Judiciary Square]]) mostly due to his masonic connection with [[President Andrew Johnson]], who pardoned Pike for treason after the [[American Civil War]].

==Biography==
Pike was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], son of Ben and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in [[Byfield, Massachusetts|Byfield]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. His colonial ancestors included [[John Pike (settler)|John Pike]] (1613-1688/1689), the founder of [[Woodbridge, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert's descent from his immigrant ancestor John Pike is as follows: John Pike (1572–1654); John Pike (1613–1688/89); Joseph Pike (1638–1694); Thomas Pike (1682–1753/4); John Pike (1710–1755); Thomas Pike (1739–1836); Benjamin Pike (1780–?); Albert Pike (1809–1891).&lt;/ref&gt; He attended school in Newburyport and [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] until he was 15. In August 1825, he passed entrance exams at [[Harvard University]], though when the college requested payment of tuition fees for the first two years which he had successfully challenged by examination, he chose not to attend. He began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Bedford, Massachusetts|North Bedford]], [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]] and Newburyport.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbell, Jay B. ''The South in American Literature: 1607-1900''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1954: 640.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, Pike left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and later moving on to [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Missouri]]. In Independence, he joined an expedition to [[Taos, New Mexico]], hunting and trading. During the excursion his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the [[Llano Estacado]] in New Mexico and [[Texas]]. Trapping was minimal and, after traveling about 1300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name= hbtx&gt;''Handbook of Texas Online'', s.v. &quot;Pike, Albert,&quot; http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/fpi18.html (accessed December 15, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Settling in Arkansas in 1833, he taught school and wrote a series of articles for the [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] ''Arkansas Advocate'' under the [[pen name]] of &quot;Casca.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopediaofarkansas.net&quot;&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1737&lt;/ref&gt; The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the staff of the newspaper. Later, after marrying Mary Ann Hamilton, he purchased part of the newspaper with the [[dowry]]. By 1835, he was the ''Advocate''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sole owner.&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; Under Pike's administration the ''Advocate'' promoted the viewpoint of the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]] in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopediaofarkansas.net&quot;/&gt; 

He then began to study law and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1837, selling the ''Advocate'' the same year. He was the first reporter for the Arkansas supreme court and also wrote a book (published anonymously), titled ''The Arkansas Form Book'', which was a guidebook for lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Additionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects and continued producing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts. His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten.&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; Several volumes of his works were self-published posthumously by his daughter. In 1859, he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard,&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Phoenix,&quot; Manly P. Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

Pike died in [[Washington, D.C.]], aged 81, and was buried at [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] (against his wishes—he had left instructions for his body to be cremated).&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; In 1944, his remains were moved to the [[House of the Temple]], headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite.

==Military career==
[[File:Albert Pike statue, Washington (558221844).jpg|thumb|Statue at [[Judiciary Square]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

When the [[Mexican-American War]] started, Pike joined the cavalry and was commissioned as a troop commander, serving in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]].&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; He and his commander, [[John Selden Roane]], had several differences of opinion. This situation led finally to a [[duel]] between Pike and Roane. Although several shots were fired in the duel, nobody was injured, and the two were persuaded by their seconds to discontinue it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

After the war, Pike returned to the practice of law, moving to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] for a time beginning in 1853.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} He wrote another book, ''Maxims of the Roman Law and some of the Ancient French Law, as Expounded and Applied in Doctrine and Jurisprudence''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Although unpublished, this book increased his reputation among his associates in law. He returned to Arkansas in 1857, gaining some amount of prominence in the legal field and becoming an advocate of [[slavery]], although retaining his affiliation with the Whig party. When that party dissolved, he became a member of the [[United States Know-Nothing Party|Know-Nothing]] party. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he was firmly against [[secession]], but when the war started he nevertheless took the side of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; At the [[Southern Commercial Convention]] of 1854, Pike said the South should remain in the Union and seek equality with the North, but if the South &quot;were forced into an inferior status, she would be better out of the Union than in it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Morris Potter, Don Edward. The impending crisis, 1848-1861. HarperCollins, 1976. (Page 467)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also made several contacts among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the area, at one point negotiating an $800,000 settlement between the [[Creek (people)|Creek]]s and other tribes and the federal government. This relationship was to influence the course of his Civil War service.&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; At the beginning of the war, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one of the most important being with [[Cherokee]] chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], which was concluded in 1861.&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt;

Pike was commissioned as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on November 22, 1861, and given a command in the [[Indian Territory]].&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; With Gen. [[Benjamin McCulloch|Ben McCulloch]], Pike trained three Confederate [[regiment]]s of [[Indian cavalry]], most of whom belonged to the &quot;[[Five Civilized Tribes|civilized tribes]]&quot;, whose loyalty to the Confederacy was variable. Although initially victorious at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] (Elkhorn Tavern) in March, Pike's unit was defeated later in a counterattack, after falling into disarray.&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt; Also, as in the previous war, Pike came into conflict with his superior officers, at one point drafting a letter to [[Jefferson Davis]] complaining about his direct superior.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

After Pea Ridge, Pike was faced with charges that his troops had [[scalping|scalped]] soldiers in the field. Maj. Gen. [[Thomas C. Hindman]] also charged Pike with mishandling of money and material, ordering his arrest.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Both these charges were later found to be considerably lacking in evidence; nevertheless Pike, facing arrest, escaped into the hills of Arkansas, sending his resignation from the Confederate Army on July 12.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} He was at length arrested on November 3 under charges of [[insubordination]] and [[treason]], and held briefly in [[Warren, Texas]], but his resignation was accepted on November 11 and he was allowed to return to Arkansas.&lt;ref name=hbtx/&gt;

==Freemasonry==
{{Freemasonry2}}

He first joined the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] in 1840 then had in the interim joined a [[Masonic Lodge]] and become extremely active in the affairs of the organization, being elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the [[Scottish Rite]]'s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} He remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the remainder of his life (a total of thirty-two years), devoting a large amount of his time to developing the rituals of the order.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Notably, he published a book called ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'' in 1871, of which there were several subsequent editions.

Pike is still regarded in America as an eminent&lt;ref name=Pikeeminent&gt;[http://www.freemason.org/cfo/mar_apr_2002/pike.htm ALBERT PIKE AND FREEMASONRY], March–April 2002 edition, California Freemason On-Line&lt;/ref&gt; and influential&lt;ref name=&quot;Pikeinfluence&quot;&gt;[http://www.masonicinfo.com/pike.htm Albert Pike], masonicinfo.com&lt;/ref&gt; Freemason.

==Poetry==

As a young man, Pike wrote poetry which he continued to do for the rest of his life. At 23, he published his first poem, “Hymns to the Gods.” Later work was printed in literary journals like Blackwood’s ''Edinburgh Magazine'' and local newspapers. His first collection of poetry, ''Prose Sketches and Poems Written in the Western Country'', appeared in 1834. He later gathered many of his poems and republished them in ''Hymns to the Gods and Other Poems'' (1872). After his death these appeared again in ''Gen. Albert Pike’s Poems'' (1900) and ''Lyrics and Love Songs'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;

'''''ALF Tales''''' is an animated [[United States|American]] series that ran on the [[NBC]] television network on Saturdays from August 1988 to December 1989. The show was a spinoff from the series ''[[ALF: The Animated Series]]''. The show had characters from that series play various characters from [[fairy tale]]s. The fairy tale was usually altered for comedic effect in a manner relational to [[Fractured Fairy Tales]].

Each story also typically spoofed a film genre, such as the &quot;Cinderella&quot; episode done as an Elvis movie. Some episodes featured a &quot;fourth wall&quot; effect where ALF is backstage preparing for the episode, and Rob Cowan would appear drawn as a TV executive (who introduced himself as &quot;Roger Cowan, network executive&quot;) to try and brief ALF on how to improve this episode. For instance Cowan once told ALF who was readying for a [[medieval]] themed episode that &quot;less than 2% of our audience lives in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]&quot;.

{{History of Afghanistan}}
'''Abdul Rashid Dostum''' ('Abd al-Raszhid Dostum or Dostam) (born 1954) is a former pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fighter during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] and is considered by many to be the leader of Afghanistan's [[Uzbek people|Uzbek community]] and the party [[Junbish-e Milli-yi Islami-yi Afghanistan]]. He joined the Afghan military in 1978, fighting with the Soviets and against the [[Mujahideen#Mujahideen of Afghanistan|mujahideen]] throughout the 1980s before joining the mujahideen in 1992, after the Soviet withdrawal, to assist in the capture of Kabul.  He is a general and the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the [[Afghan National Army]] a role often viewed as ceremonial.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date= 10 May 2007|url = http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1acb5330-dfe8-4f0e-8a1b-4f581478244f&amp;k=44800&amp;p=1|title = Former Afghan warlord says he can defeat Taliban|publisher = CanWest News Service| accessdate = 2008-04-22 | last=David Pugliese |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008 he was removed from his army role because of the [[Abdul Rashid Dostum#Akbar Bai kidnapping|Akbar Bai kidnapping incident]].

==Military career==
===Early life===
Dostum was born in Khvajeh Do Kuh, Afghanistan. In 1970 he began to work in a state-owned gas refinery in [[Sheberghan]], [[Jowzjan Province]], participating in [[Trade union|union]] [[politics]], as the new [[government]] started to arm the staff of the workers in the [[petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] [[refineries]]. The reason for this was to create &quot;groups for the defense of the [[Saur Revolution|revolution]]&quot;. Because of the new [[communist]] ideas entering Afghanistan in the 1970s, he enlisted himself in the army. Dostum received his basic [[military training]] in Jalalabad. His [[Squadron (army)|squadron]], in response to increasing conflict, was deployed in the rural areas around [[Sheberghan]], under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalsecurity&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/dostum.htm |title=Abdul Rashid Dostum |publisher=Global Security | language=| accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1980s his [[platoon (military unit)|platoon]] had grown in stature, reaching a [[Company (military unit)|company level]] and by the mid-1980s he was in command of over 20,000 [[militia]] and had reached a [[regiment|regimental level]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1563344.stm |title=Profile: General Rashid Dostum |publisher=BBC News | language=| accessdate=2009-03-18 | date=2001-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the unit recruited throughout Jowzjan and had a relatively broad base, many of its early troops and [[commander]]s came from Dostum's home village, [[Khoja Dukoh]], and these represented the core of the unit at that juncture and again when it was reconstituted after the [[United States|American]] [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Invasion of Afghanistan in 2001]]. He left the army after the purge of [[Parcham]]is, but returned after the [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] occupation began.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalsecurity&quot;/&gt;

===Soviet war in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Soviet war in Afghanistan}}
As the situation in the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]] deteriorated with massive uprising occurring all over the country, the then [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|prime minister]] [[Hafizullah Amin]], seized control when he overthrew [[President of Afghanistan|president]] [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]]. The [[KGB]] reported that Amin sought to cut ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and instead ally itself with the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Pakistan]]. This prompted the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan and assassinate president Amin in 1979. [[Soviet military]] commander announced to [[Radio Kabul]] that Afghanistan had been &quot;liberated&quot; from Amin's rule.

[[Mujahideen]] attacks were still a problem in the country. By this time Dostum was commanding a [[militia]] [[battalion]] to fight and [[rout]] [[Rebellion|rebel]] forces. This eventually became a regiment and later became incorporated into the [[Afghan National Army|defense forces]] as the 53rd Infantry Division. Dostum and his new [[Division (military)|division]] reported directly to then-President [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. Later on he became the commander of the [[military unit]] 374 in [[Jowzjan]]. He defended the [[communist]] [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]] against the [[United States|American]] and [[Pakistan]]i-backed mujahideens in the 1980s. While he was only a [[Commander|regional commander]], he had largely raised the militia he fought with by himself. The Jowzjani militia Dostum controlled was one of the few militia forces in the country which was able to be outside of its region. The militia forces were deployed in the city [[Qandahar]] in 1988 when [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviet forces withdrew in 1989]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.islamicrepublicofafghanistan.com/abdul-rashid-dostum/ |title=Abdul Rashid Dostum |publisher=''Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'' | language=| accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 the [[communist regime]] faced economic problems. The new [[Russia]]n [[Government of Russia|government]] did not want anything to do with their old communist allies. So they stopped sending supplies to the country, which began an [[economic crisis]] in the country. The Soviet Union was Afghanistan's main trading partner from the start in 1978. This eventually led to government officials swapping allegiances and would eventually lead to [[Mohammad Najibullah]]s governments fall in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistanunion&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0119) |title=The Demise of the Soviet Union |publisher=''lcweb2.loc.gov/'' | language=| accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dostum army forces would become an important factor in the [[Siege of Kabul|fall of Kabul]] in 1992. On 18 April 1992 the mujahideen began their revolt against the government of Najibullah. He allied himself with [[mujahideen]] commander [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], [[Sayed Jafar Naderi]],&lt;ref&gt;Vogelsang (2002), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; the head of the [[Isma'ili]] community and [[Baghlan]] Province, and together they captured the city of [[Kabul]].

After the siege in 1992 he and Masoud fought in a coalition against [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot;/&gt; Masoud and Dostum's forces joined together to defend Kabul against Hekmatyar, with some 4000-5000 of his troops, units of his Shiberghan-based 53rd Division and Balkh-based Guards Division garrisoning [[Bala Hissar]] fort, Maranjan Hill, and [[Kabul International Airport|Khwaja Rawash International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Davis, 'The Battlegrounds of Northern Afghanistan,' [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], July 1994, p.323-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
[[File:Abdul Rashid Dostum and Hamid Karzai December 24 2001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Abdul Rashid Dostum and [[Hamid Karzai]], December 24, 2001]]
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)}}
In 1994, Dostum allied himself with the forces of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. Again, Dostum was laying a [[Second Siege of Kabul (1995-1997)|siege on Kabul]] which started in 1995 and ended in 1997. This time he was fighting against the government [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot;/&gt;

Following the rise of the [[Taliban]] and their capture of [[Herat]] and [[Kabul]], Dostum aligned himself with Rabbani against the Taliban. Dostum however retreated to the city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot;/&gt;

At this point he is said to have had a force of some 50,000 men supported by both aircraft and tanks. He was supported by all opponents of the Taliban including Russia, Iran and India. He ruled what was, in effect, an independent region. He printed his own Afghan currency and ran a small airline named [[Balkh Air]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogelsang (2002), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1996 Dostum came to an agreement with Massoud to form the anti-Taliban coalition that outside Afghanistan became known as the ''[[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]]''. They vowed to set up a non-fundamentalist government in the nine northern provinces under their control. Their pact was also signed by [[Abdul Karim Khalily]], leader of the Shiite Muslim minority in Afghanistan, whose forces controlled a 10th province. The Taliban controlled all the other 19 Afghan provinces, except a part of [[Parwan Province]] north of Kabul that was held by the Massoud forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/11/world/2-afghan-factions-sign-pact-to-fight-new-kabul-rulers.html &quot;2 Afghan factions sign pact to fight new Kabul rulers&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/14/world/afghan-fights-islamic-tide-as-a-savior-or-a-conqueror.html &quot;Afghan Fights Islamic Tide: As a Savior or a Conqueror?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like other northern alliance leaders, Dostum also faced infighting within his group and was later forced tor retreat from power thanks to his [[General (rank)|General]] [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]]. Initially, Malik was one of Dostum's subordinates, but in 1996 he blamed Dostum for the murder of his brother Rasoul. He then entered into secret negotiations with the Taliban, who promised to respect his authority over much of Northern Afghanistan, in exchange for the capture of [[Ismail Khan]], one of their most powerful enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Ponfilly, Christophe(2001); ''Massoud l'Afghan''; Gallimard; ISBN 2-07-042468-5; p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, on 25 May 1997 he arrested Khan and handed him over and let the Taliban enter [[Mazari Sharif]], giving them control over most of Northern Afghanistan. Because of this treason, Dostum was forced to flee to [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardcastle_Book&quot;&gt;page 6-8 - {{Cite book| last = Nate Hardcastle| authorlink = Nate Hardcastle| title = American Soldier: Stories of Special Forces from Grenada to Afghanistan|edition= 2002|pages= 364 | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press| isbn= 1560254386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However Malik quickly realized that the Taliban were not going to keep their promises as they started to disarm his men. He then rejoined forces with the [[Northern Alliance]], and turned against his erstwhile allies, helping to drive them from Mazar-i-Sharif. In October 1997, Dostum returned from exile and defeated Malik, briefly regaining control of Mazar-i-Sharif, and forcing Malik to escape to [[Iran]]. But in 1998 he was forced to flee to Turkey again.&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Dostum returned in 2001. At this time Massoud had used his CIA funds to fly Dostum and his commanders back to open a new front in the campaign against Taliban. Along with General [[Mohammed Fahim]] and [[Ismail Khan]], Dostum was one of three leaders of the ''Northern Alliance''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

===US invasion of Afghanistan===
{{Main|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Battle of Qala-i-Jangi}}
In November 2001, with the beginning of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]], and against the wishes of the [[CIA]] who distrusted Dostum, a team including [[Johnny Micheal Spann]] landed to set up communications in the Dariya Suf. A few hours later 23 men of [[Operational Detatchment Alpha|Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595]] landed to begin the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|year=2007 |url = http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0203/story.html#story_3|title = The Legend of Heavy D &amp; the Boys:In the Field With an Afghan Warlord|publisher = [[national geographic]]| accessdate = 2008-04-22 | author=Robert Young Pelton }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODA595&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|year=2007 |url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/interviews/595.html|title = ODA 595|publisher = [[PBS]]| accessdate = 2008-04-22 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2000, 300 [[Taliban]] soldiers retreated after the [[Siege of Kunduz]] by [[United States Army|American]] and [[Afghan National Army|Aghan military forces]]. The taliban laid down their weapons a few miles from the city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. They eventually surrendered peacefully to Dostum.

A small group of armed foreign fighters drove to Mazar-i-Sharif and were moved to the 19th century [[Prison|prison fortress]], [[Qala-i-Jangi]]. These fighters would use concealed weapons start the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] against the Northern Alliance and later [[United Kingdom|British]] and American forces. The uprising eventually overpowered the Northern Alliance soldiers placed to defend the prison.

There were unproven allegations in 2001 that Dostum and his forces, who were fighting jointly with US Special Forces, suffocated as many as 2,000 prisoners in container trucks following the Taliban [[Siege of Kunduz|surrender of Kunduz]] in an incident that has become known as the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Political career==
===Afghan Government===
Dostum served as a deputy defense minister for Karzai in the national government in Kabul.  In March 2003, Dostum established a [[North Zone of Afghanistan]], against the wishes of interim president [[Hamid Karzai]].   On 20 May 2003, after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt, Dostum assumed the position of &quot;Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces&quot;.

In the aftermath of the Taliban's removal from northern Afghanistan, forces loyal to Dostum frequently clashed with forces loyal to [[Tājik people|Tajik]] General [[Ustad Atta Mohammed Noor]] after Atta'smen kidnapped and killed a number of Dostum's men and constantly agitated to gain control of Mazar i Sharif.  Through the political mediations of the Karzai regime, the U.S.-led international military coalition, and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, as well as the UN-run Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration program, the Dostum-Atta feud has largely ended.  The two are now generally politically allied as part of a broader ideological effort to protect the interests of Afghanistan's war veterans and to preserve their own power.  On 1 March 2005 President [[Hamid Karzai]] appointed him Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief.

===Akbar Bai Incident===
On 2 February 2008, about 50 of Dostum's fighters reportedly attacked [[Akbar Bai]], a former ally of Dostum who had become his rival.&lt;ref name=RadioFreeEurope20080206&gt;

Early on 3 February, Dostum's house was surrounded by police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/world/africa/03iht-03afghan.9704363.html &quot;Afghan police lay siege to home of former warlord&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bai and the three others were freed and hospitalized.&lt;ref name=Wafa/&gt; According to the authorities, the stand-off at Dostum's home between his fighters and the police ended with Dostum's agreement to cooperate with the authorities in an investigation of the incident.&lt;ref name=Suspended&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPkTQBuRJubEU-RPStnSF3thYGbw &quot;Feared Afghan strongman suspended from government post&quot;], AFP, 19 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'' reported on 6 February 2008 that [[Afghan Attorney-General]] [[Abdul Jabar Sabit]] said charges against Dostum were pending.,&lt;ref name=RadioFreeEurope20080206/&gt; Sabit said that the political and security situation would make it difficult to prosecute Dostum. The charges, according to Sabit, included [[kidnapping]], [[burglary|breaking and entering]], and [[assault]]. They were dropped by mutual consent and Dostum was reinstated by President Karzai.

{{quote|&quot;These are not political accusations -- it is a criminal case ... Anyone who commits a criminal act must be brought to justice,&quot; Sabit says. But in reality, I must admit that there will be some difficulties. In this war situation, in many cases, it is difficult for us to implement the law ... seven or eight [northern provinces could slide into civil war] if anyone touches even one hair on Dostum's head.|[[Mohammad Alem Sayeh]]&lt;ref name=RadioFreeEurope20080206/&gt;}}

According to a spokesman for the [[United National Front of Afghanistan]], [[Sayed Hussain Sancharaki]] says that General Dostum has a high profile among his people and is one of the famous political and military figures of Afghanistan. He is Karzai's chief of staff for the armed forces and he is a senior member of the United Front of Afghanistan. It is natural that any kind of action against him will have repercussions. The consequences will be very dangerous—catastrophic—for the stability of Afghanistan.&quot;&lt;ref name=RadioFreeEurope20080206/&gt;

Human Rights Watch spokesmen [[Sam Zia-Zarifi]], called the charges a sign of Afghanistan's &quot;growing balkanization&quot;.&lt;ref name=RadioFreeEurope20080206/&gt;  He asserted that the size of warlords private armies was increasing, fueled by illicit profits from [[Afghanistan's Opium trade]].

On 19 February, it was announced that Sabit had suspended Dostum from his position as Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief after he failed to appear when summoned for the investigation. According to Dostum, this was &quot;not in line with the law&quot;, and he said that he would request Karzai's intervention. Three allies of Dostum&amp;mdash;[[Latif Pedram]] and two members of parliament&amp;mdash;were also summoned for the investigation.&lt;ref name=Suspended/&gt;

===Time in Turkey===
Some media reports beginning 4 December said that Dostum was &quot;seeking political asylum&quot; in Turkey &lt;ref name=http://xrl.us/ozw7p&gt;&quot;Dostum seeking asylum in Turkey - media reports,&quot; Quqnoos.com, 6 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while others said he was exiled.&lt;ref name=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/244638,afghan-general-rashid-dostum-flies-to-exile-in-turkey.html&gt;&quot;Afghan general Rashid Dostum flies to exile in Turkey,&quot; Deutsche Presse-Agentur via earthtimes.org, 4 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One Turkish media outlet said Dostum was visiting after flying there with Turkey's Foreign Minister Ali Babacan during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).&lt;ref name=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=160690&amp;bolum=102&gt;&quot;Afghan warlord in Turkey but not in exile, official says,&quot; Today's Zaman, 5 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most rumors spread about Dostum, it turned out to much less dramatic: Dostum was visiting his Ankara-based wife and children during the holiday of Eid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He continues to maintain strong ties with Turkey.

===Political and social views===
In most ethnic-Uzbek dominated areas in which Dostum has control or influence, he encourages women to live and work freely, as well as encouraging music, sports and allowing for freedom of religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} While Dostum was ruling northern Afghanistan before the Taliban takeover in 1998, women were able to go about unveiled, alcohol was sold freely, and the cinemas showed Indian films.&lt;ref&gt;Vogelsang (2002) p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

He views the NATO attempt to crush the Taliban as ineffective and has gone on record saying that he could mop up the Taliban &quot;in six months&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot;/&gt; if allowed to raise a 10,000 strong army of Afghan veterans.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot;/&gt;  Senior [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] government officials do not trust Dostum as they show great concern that Dostum is covertly rearming his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot;/&gt;

===Return to Afghanistan===
Late at night on 16 August 2009, Dostum made a requested return from exile to Kabul to support President [[Hamid Karzai]] in his bid for re-election. The next day, the last day of campaigning, he flew by helicopter to his northern stronghold of [[Sheberghan]], where he was greeted by 20,000 supporters in the local stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article6799717.ece Times Online. &quot;Afghan warlord General Dostum returns to boost Karzai’s campaign.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently made overtures to the United States, promising he could &quot;destroy the Taliban and al Qaeda&quot; if supported by the U.S., saying that &quot;the U.S. needs strong friends like Dostum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/22/afghan-warlords-will-fight-if-us-gives-aid/?feat=home_headlines&amp;|title=Afghan warlords will fight if U.S. gives weapons|last=Motlagh|first=Jason|coauthors=Carter, Sara A. |date=2009-09-22|work=[[Washington Times]]|accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andhra Pradesh lies between 12°41' and 22°N latitude and 77° and 84°40'E longitude, and is bordered by [[Maharashtra]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Odisha]] in the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the East, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the south and [[Karnataka]] to the west.  Andhra Pradesh is historically called the &quot;''Rice Bowl of India''&quot;.  More than 77% of its crop is rice; Andhra Pradesh produced 17,796,000 tonnes of rice in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rough rice production (000 t) in India, by state, 1961–2006|url= http://www.irri.org/science/ricestat/data/may2008/WRS2008-Table07.pdf |date= May 2008|publisher=International Rice Research Institute |accessdate=25 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two major rivers, the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and the [[Krishna River|Krishna]], run across the state.

==History==
Main : [[History of Andhra Pradesh|History Of Andhra Pradesh]]

An Andhra tribe was mentioned in the [[Sanskrit epics]] such as [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (800 BCE) and [[Mahabharata]] (400 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/history.html |title=History and Culture-History |publisher=APonline |date=|accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Natya Shastra]] written by [[Bharata Muni|Bharatha]] (1st century BCE) also mentions the Andhra people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teluguuniversity.ac.in/Language/prachina_telugu_note.html |title=TeluguUniversity.ac.in |publisher=TeluguUniversity.ac.in |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of the [[Telugu language]] have been seen on inscriptions found near the [[Guntur]] district&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/20/stories/200712204820600.htm|title=Andhra Pradesh News : Telugu is 2,400 years old, says ASI |publisher=The Hindu |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from others dating to the rule of Renati Cholas in the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Epigraphy, R. Saloman, [[Oxford University Press]], 1998,
ISBN 0-19-509984-2, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Megasthenes]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] traveller and geographer who visited the Court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (322–297 BCE), mentioned that the region had three fortified towns and an army of 100,000 infantry, 200 cavalry, and 1,000 elephants{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.[[Buddhist]] books reveal that Andhras established their huts or tents near the [[Godavari River]] at that time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Inscriptional evidence shows that there was an early kingdom in [[coastal Andhra]] (Guntur District) ruled first by Kuberaka and then by his son Varun, with Pratipalapura ([[Bhattiprolu]]) as the capital. Around the same time, Dhanyakatakam/[[Dharanikota]] (present day [[Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]]) appears to have been an important place, which was visited by [[Gautama Buddha]]. According to the ancient [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] scholar [[Taranatha]]: &quot;On the full moon of the month [[Chaitra]] in the year following his enlightenment, at the great [[stupa]] of Dhanyakataka, the Buddha emanated the [[mandala]] of 'The Glorious Lunar Mansions' ([[Kalachakra]])&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helmutt Hoffmann, &quot;Buddha's Preaching of the Kalachakra [[Tantra]] at the Stupa of Dhanyakataka,&quot; ''German Scholars on India'', Vol. I. PP. 136–140. (Varanasi, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalacakra.org/history/khistor2.htm |title=Kalacakra.org |publisher=Kalacakra.org |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kakateeya Sculpture.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]] sculpture at [[Warangal]]]]
Literary evidence shows that long before Satavahanas, a legendary king named [[Āndhra Viṣhṇu]] ruled in and around the [[Diviseema]] region of Andhra Pradesh. After his reign, people came to believe that he had an amsa of the divine savior Lord Maha Vishnu himself. Perhaps in his honor, people dedicated a new temple now located at [[Srikakulam Village|Srikākuḷam]], [[Krishna District]]. The lord of the temple is known as Āndhra Viṣhṇu or Srikākuḷāndhra Viṣhṇu.

The [[Maurya Empire|Mauryans]] extended their rule over Andhra in the 4th century BC. With the fall of the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BC, the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] became independent. After the decline of the Satavahanas in 220 CE, the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]], [[Pallava]]s, [[Ananda Gotrika]]s, [[Rashtrakuta]]s, [[Vishnukundina]]s, [[Eastern Chalukyas]], and [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]] ruled the land. During this period, Telugu emerged as a popular language, supplanting [[Prakrit]] and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphica Indica, 27: 220–228&lt;/ref&gt; Telugu was made the official language by the [[Vishnukundina]] kings (5th and 6th centuries), who ruled from their capital city of [[Vengi]]. Eastern [[Chalukyas]] ruled for a long period after the decline of Vishnukundinas; their capital was also Vengi. As early as the 1st century CE, Chalukyas were mentioned as being vassals and chieftains under the Satavahanas and later under the Ikshvakus. The Chalukya ruler [[Rajaraja Narendra]] ruled [[Rajahmundry]] around 1022 CE.

The battle of [[Palnadu]] (1182) resulted in the weakening of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty and led to the emergence of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in the 12th and 13th centuries CE. The Kakatiyas were at first vassals of the Rashtrakutas, and ruled over a small territory near Warangal. Eventually all the Telugu lands were united by the Kakatiyas. In 1323 CE, [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultan]] [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] sent a large army under Ulugh Khan to conquer the Telugu country and captured Warangal. King Prataparudra was taken prisoner. [[Musunuri Nayaks]] recaptured Warangal from the Delhi Sultanate in 1326 CE and ruled for fifty years. Inspired by their success, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], one of the greatest empires in the history of Andhra Pradesh and India, was founded by [[Harihara]] and [[Bukka]], who served as treasury officers of the Kakatiyas of Warangal.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sewell, ''A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A contribution to the history of India'', Chapter 2 [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/fevch10.txt Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1347 CE, an independent Muslim state, the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], was established in [[south India]] by [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]] in a revolt against the Delhi Sultanate. The [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] held sway over the Andhra country for about two hundred years from the early part of the 16th century to the end of the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
In [[Colonial India]], [[Northern Circars]] became part of the British [[Madras Presidency]]. Eventually this region emerged as the [[Coastal Andhra]] region. Later the [[Nizam]] rulers of Hyderabad ceded five territories to the British which eventually emerged as [[Rayalaseema]] region. The Nizams retained control of the interior provinces as the [[Princely state]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy. Meanwhile, the [[French colonial empire|French]] occupied [[Yanam (India)|Yanam]], in the Godavari delta, and (save for periods of British control) would hold it until 1954.

[[Indian independence movement|India became independent]] from the United Kingdom in 1947. The Nizam wanted to retain the independence of the Princely Hyderabad State from India, but the people of the region launched a movement to join the Indian Union. The state of Hyderabad was forcibly joined to the Republic of India with [[Operation Polo]] in 1948.

In an effort to gain an independent state  based on the lingustic and protect the interests of the Andhra (telugu speaking) people of [[Madras State]], [[Potti Sreeramulu]] fasted until death in 1952. After his death, Andhra attained statehood on 1 November 1953, with [[Kurnool]] as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2626/stories/20100101262602100.htm |title=Reorganisation, then and now |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 1956, the [[States Reorganization Act]] merged the Telugu-speaking areas of the former Hyderabad state with the Telugu-speaking areas of the former Madras state to form the state of Vishalandhra, which is named as Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Know Hyderabad&quot; /&gt; The city of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], the former capital of the Hyderabad State, was made the capital of the new state. There were several movements to disintigrate Andhra Pradesh into two States viz. Andhra and Telengana in the late 1960 which are continuing till date.

Geographically, Andhra Pradesh is composed of most of the eastern half of the [[Deccan plateau]] and the plains to the east of the [[Eastern Ghats]]. Andhra Pradesh is divided into three regions. The northern part of the plateau is the [[Telangana]] region and the southern part is known as [[Rayalaseema]]. These two regions are separated by the [[River Krishna]]. The third region is [[Coastal Andhra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtraweb.com/AndhraPradesh/AndhraPradeshgeography.htm |title=Andhra Pradesh Geography |publisher=Maharashtraweb.com |date=|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plains to the east of Eastern Ghats form the [[Eastern coastal plains]]. The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous and individual sections have local names. The Kadapa Basin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dae.gov.in/amd/regions/scr_cud.htm ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed by two arching branches of the Eastern Ghats is a mineral rich area. The coastal plains are for the most part delta regions formed by the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[River Krishna|Krishna]], and[[Penner River|Penner]] rivers. The Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line in the state's geography. The Ghats become more pronounced towards the south and extreme north of the coast. The Eastern Ghat region is home to dense tropical forests, while the vegetation becomes sparse as the Ghats give way to the Deccan Plateau, where shrub vegetation is more common. Most of the coastal plains are put to intense agricultural use. The west and southwest parts of Andhra Pradesh have semi-arid conditions.

The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Monsoons play a major role in determining the climate of the state. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20 °C and 41 °C.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourisminap.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Aptdc, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|url=http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php |title=APTDC – Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|publisher=Tourisminap.com|date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

July to September is the seasons for tropical rains in Andhra Pradesh. The state receives heavy rainfall from Southwest Monsoon during these months. About one third of the total rainfall in Andhra Pradesh is brought by the [[Monsoon#Northeast Monsoon|Northeast Monsoon]]. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the Northeast Monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state. November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12 °C to 30 °C.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourisminap.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] is the capital and, along with the adjoining twin city [[Secunderabad]], is the largest city in the state.[[Visakhapatnam]], Andhra Pradesh's main seaport, is the second largest city and is home to the [[Indian Navy]]'s Eastern Naval Command.  Due to its location and proximity to major rail and road routes, [[Vijayawada]] is a major trading center. It is the third largest city of the state, [[Warangal]] the historical city of Andhra Pradesh, comprised of [[Warangal]], [[Hanamkonda]] and [[Kazipet]], which is also called Tri City, is the fourth largest city of Andhra Pradesh followed by [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]], [[Rajahmundry]], [[Kakinada]] and [[Guntur]]. Other important cities of the state are [[Karimnagar]], [[Nellore]], [[Nizamabad]], [[Kurnool]], [[Kadapa]], and [[Srikakulam]].

Until 1962, the CPI, along with socialist parties, played an important role as opposition parties.
Parties namely Praja Socialist Party and Krishi Lok Party played important role in 1950's. In the 1967 state assembly elections all socialist parties were eliminated and CPI lost opposition party status. N.G. Ranga's Swatantra Party became the Opposition Party. They also failed to hold control later and became defunct. In 1978  Jalagam Vengal Rao and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy formed the Reddy Congress and contested against Congress (I) but lost.

In 1983 the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) won the State elections and [[N.T. Rama Rao]] (NTR) became the chief minister of the state for the first time. This broke the long time single party monopoly enjoyed by the INC from 1956 until 1982. A few months after the election, [[Nadendla Bhaskara Rao]] usurped power when NTR was away in the United States for medical treatment. After coming back, NTR campaigned for a comeback by demonstrating the support of the majority of the elected MLAs. The  governor [[Thakur Ram Lal]] was ousted by [[Indira Gandhi]] and in his place she appointed [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]]. NTR was reinstated as Chief Minister. Within a month NTR recommended the dissolution of the assembly and called for fresh elections. Gandhi was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] on 31 October 1984 by her Sikh bodyguard and [[Rajiv Gandhi]] was made Prime Minister by President Giani [[Zail Singh]]. In the ensuing elections for Lok Sabha and the AP Assembly, the Telugu Desam Party won in Andhra Pradesh and NTR came back to power.

The 1989 elections ended the rule of NTR, with the INC party returning to power with [[Marri Chenna Reddy]] at the helm. He was replaced by[[Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy|Janardhan Reddy]] in 1990, who was replaced by [[Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy]] in 1992.

In 1994, Andhra Pradesh gave a mandate to the Telugu Desam Party again, and NTR became the chief minister again. [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu]], the son-in-law of NTR, usurped power with the backing of a majority of the MLAs. The Telugu Desam Party won both the assembly and Lok Sabha election in 1999 under the leadership of [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu|Chandrababu Naidu]]. There was an assassination attempt on Naidu in 2003 in Tirupathi; he survived the attack. In the ensuing elections the party lost power to a resurgent Congress Party and its allies. Congress on its own won 185 seats in 294 assembly, and with its allies won 226 seats; [[Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy]] became the Chief Minister.

[[Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy]] became the CM again by fending off the [[Praja Rajyam Party]] and a major alliance of TDP, TRS, CPI and CPM. He died on 2 September 2009 in a helicopter crash. [[Konijeti Rosaiah]], a senior statesman and former State Finance Minister, became the Chief Minister of AP on 3 September 2009. On 24 November 2010, Rosaiah submitted his resignation on the grounds of increased work pressure. [[Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy]] Reddy was sworn in as the new CM on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article91229.ece?homepage=true thehindu.com]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Andhra cuisine}}
[[File:India food.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hyderabad biryani]] served with other [[Indian cuisine|Indian dishes]]]]
The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh is one of the spiciest of all [[Indian cuisine]]s. There are many variations to the cuisine (all involving rice) depending on geographical regions, caste, and traditions. [[Indian pickle|Pickles]] and [[chutney]]s, called ''thoku''  also called as ''pachadi'' in Telugu, are particularly popular in Andhra Pradesh and many varieties of pickles and chutneys are unique to the State. Chutneys are made from practically every vegetable including tomatoes, [[Eggplant|brinjals]] (eggplant), and [[roselle (plant)|roselle]] (''[[Gongura]]'').''Avaakaya'' (mango) is probably the best known of the Andhra Pradesh pickles.

Rice is the [[staple food]] and is used in a wide variety of ways. Typically, rice is either boiled and eaten with [[curry]], or made into a [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] for use in a [[Crêpe|crepe]]-like dish called ''attu'' (''[[pesarattu]]'' is made of a mixture of this batter and mung beans) or'' [[dosa]]s'', a crepe filled with black beans or lentils.

Meat, vegetables and greens are prepared with different spices ([[masala]]) into a variety of strongly flavored dishes such as Hyderabadi Biryani, fish curry, [[brinjal]] curry,  and'' Gongura pachadi'' the most popular dish of andhra pradesh.An Andhra dish is recognized with the dish being listed in the menu.The coastal region is even more well versed with the varieties in sea food &quot;chapala purulusulu&quot;specially known for ''&quot;Bommidala pulusu&quot;,&quot;Koramenu kura&quot;''. Especially Hyderabadi cuisine is influenced by the Muslims who arrived in Telangana in the 14th century. Much of the cuisine revolves around meat. It is rich and aromatic, with a liberal use of exotic spices and ''[[ghee]]'' (clarified butter). Lamb, chicken, and fish are the most widely used meats in the non-vegetarian dishes. [[biryani|Biriyani]] is perhaps the most distinctive and popular dish of Hyderabadi cuisine.

Railways are a major means of transport connecting all major cities and towns. The history of railways in Andhra Pradesh dates back to the time of[[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. Most of Andhra Pradesh falls under the auspices of the [[South Central Railway]], founded in 1966 with its headquarters at[[Secunderabad]]. The [[East Coast Railway]] serves Srikakulam, Vizianagaram District, and part of Visakhapatnam district including Visakhapatnam City. Vijayawada Railway Station is the one of the  busiest railway junctions in India.5th largest Railway station  in South.

===Air===
[[Hyderabad International Airport]], also known as Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, is the international airport for the city of Hyderabad. It is the largest airport in the state and one of the busiest airports nationwide.

Other airports in the state are [[Visakhapatnam Airport]], [[Vijayawada Airport]], [[Rajahmundry Airport]], and [[Tirupati Airport]]. The government also has plans to start airports in eight other cities: [[Guntur]], [[Ongole]], [[Nellore]], [[Warangal]], [[Kadapa]], [[Tadepalligudem]], [[Kurnool]] and  [[Karimnagar,Ramagundam]] and [[Kothagudem]].

===Sea===
Andhra Pradesh has two of the major ports of India at [[Visakhapatnam]] and [[Kakinada]] and three minor ports at [[Krishnapatnam]] ([[Nellore]]), [[Machilipatnam]], and [[Nizampatnam]] ([[Guntur]]). A private port is being developed at [[Gangavaram Port|Gangavaram]], near Visakhapatnam. This deep seaport can accommodate ocean liners up to 200,000–250,000 [[Deadweight tonnage|DWT]].

The '''Accelerated Graphics Port''' (often shortened to '''AGP''') is a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a [[video card]] to a [[computer]]'s [[motherboard]], primarily to assist in the acceleration of [[3D computer graphics]]. Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of [[PCI Express]]. As of mid-2009, PCIe cards dominate the market, but new AGP cards and motherboards are still available for purchase, though [[Original_equipment_manufacturer|OEM]] driver support is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/AGP-Almost-at-the-End-of-the-Road-87316.shtml AGP almost at the end, Softpedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages over PCI==
As computers became increasingly graphically oriented, successive generations of graphics adapters began to push the limits of [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], a [[computer bus|bus]] with shared bandwidth. This led to the development of AGP, a &quot;bus&quot; dedicated to graphics adapters.

The primary advantage of AGP over PCI is that it provides a dedicated pathway between the slot and the processor rather than sharing the PCI bus.  In addition to a lack of contention for the bus, the point-to-point connection allows for higher clock speeds.  AGP also uses sideband addressing, meaning that the [[address bus|address]] and [[data bus]]es are separated so the entire packet does not need to be read to get addressing information. This is done by adding eight extra 8-bit [[computer bus|buses]] which allow the graphics controller to issue new AGP requests and commands at the same time with other AGP data flowing via the main 32 address/data (AD) lines. This results in improved overall AGP data throughput. 

In addition, to load a texture, a PCI graphics card must copy it from the system's RAM into the card's [[framebuffer]], whereas an AGP card is capable of reading textures directly from system RAM using the [[Graphics Address Remapping Table]] (GART). GART reapportions main memory as needed for [[Texture mapping|texture]] storage, allowing the graphics card to access them directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sysopt.com/features/mboard/article.php/3549951 What is AGP?], SysOpt, September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum amount of system memory available to AGP is defined as the AGP [[Aperture (computer memory)|aperture]].

==History==
[[Image:AGP-Video-Card.jpg|thumb|An AGP card]]
The AGP slot first appeared on [[x86]] compatible system boards based on [[Socket 7]] Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] and [[Slot 1]] [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium II]] processors. Intel introduced AGP support with the i[[440LX]] [[Slot 1]] chipset on the 26th of August 1997 and a flood of products followed from all the major system board vendors.&lt;ref name=Intel440LXdata&gt;[http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/290564.htm Intel 440LX AGPset], Intel, accessed October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Socket 7 chipsets to support AGP were the [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] Apollo VP3, [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] 5591/5592, and the [[Acer Laboratories Incorporated|ALI]] Aladdin V. Intel never released an AGP-equipped Socket 7 chipset. [[First International Computer|FIC]] demonstrated the first Socket 7 AGP system board in November 1997 as the ''FIC PA-2012'' based on the VIA Apollo VP3 chipset, followed very quickly by the ''EPoX P55-VP3'' also based on the VIA VP3 chipset which was first to market.&lt;ref&gt;Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=155&amp;p=1 Chipset Guide (Socket 7)], Anandtech, August 1, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early video chipsets featuring AGP support included the [[Rendition (company)|Rendition]] Vérité V2200, [[3dfx]] [[3dfx#Voodoo Banshee|Voodoo Banshee]], [[Nvidia]] [[RIVA 128]], [[3Dlabs]] PERMEDIA 2, [[Intel740|Intel i740]], [[ATI Rage|ATI Rage series]], [[Matrox]] Millennium II, and [[S3 ViRGE|S3 ViRGE GX/2]]. Some early AGP boards used graphics processors built around PCI and were simply bridged to AGP. This resulted in the cards benefiting little from the new bus, with the only improvement used being the 66 MHz bus clock, with its resulting doubled bandwidth over PCI, and bus exclusivity. Examples of such cards were the Voodoo Banshee, Vérité V2200, Millennium II, and S3 ViRGE GX/2. Intel's i740 was explicitly designed to exploit the new AGP feature set. In fact it was designed to texture only from AGP memory, making PCI versions of the board difficult to implement (local board RAM had to emulate AGP memory.)

Microsoft first introduced AGP support into ''[[Windows 95]] OEM Service Release 2'' (OSR2 version 1111 or 950B) via the ''USB SUPPLEMENT to OSR2'' patch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000145.htm Which version of Windows 95 supports AGP?], ComputerHope, accessed October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After applying the patch the Windows 95 system became ''Windows 95 version 4.00.950 B''. The first Windows NT-based operating system to receive AGP support was [[Windows NT 4.0]] with [[service pack]] 3, introduced in 1997. [[Linux]] support for AGP enhanced fast data transfers was first added in 1999 with the implementation of the [[AGPgart]] kernel module.

==Versions==
Intel released the first version of AGP, titled “AGP specification 1.0,” in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playtool.com/pages/agpcompat/agp10.pdf Accelerated Graphics Port Interface Specification Rev. 1.0], Intel, accessed October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It included both the 1x and 2x speeds.&lt;ref name=Intel440LXdata /&gt;  Specification 2.0 documented AGP 4X&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/g0801/35x01/04g01.asp AGP 4X: Faster Data Transfer &amp; Better-Quality Images], Smart Computing, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.0 documented 8X.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/agp30.pdf AGP 3.0 Specification], Intel, accessed October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Available versions include:

*AGP version 3.5 is only publicly mentioned by Microsoft under ''Universal  Accelerated Graphics Port (UAGP)'',  which specifies mandatory supports of extra registers once marked  optional under AGP 3.0. Upgraded registers include PCISTS, CAPPTR,  NCAPID, AGPSTAT, AGPCMD, NISTAT, NICMD. New required registers include  APBASELO, APBASEHI, AGPCTRL, APSIZE, NEPG, GARTLO, GARTHI.

There are various physical interfaces (i.e. shape of slots), as explained in the '''Compatibility''' section below.

===Official extensions===
[[File:NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti 4600 Mac.jpg|thumb|AGP graphics card ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]])]]
[[File:Quadro ELSA GLoria II Pro.jpg|thumb|AGP Pro graphics card]]
====AGP Pro====
It is an official extension for cards that required more electrical power. It is a longer slot with additional pins for that purpose. AGP Pro cards were usually workstation-class cards used to accelerate professional [[computer-aided design]] applications employed in the fields of architecture, machining, engineering, simulations, and similar fields.
====64-bit AGP====
A [[64-bit]] channel was once proposed as an optional standard for AGP 3.0 in draft documents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20010613041316/www.intel.com/technology/agp/downloads/agp8x_v091R_042401.pdf Draft AGP8X Interface Specification Rev. 0.91R]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was dropped in the final version of the standard. 

The standard allows 64-bit transfer for AGP8X Reads, Writes, and Fast Writes; 32-bit transfer for PCI operations.

===Unofficial variations===
A number of non-standard variations of the AGP interface have been produced by manufacturers.

====Internal AGP interface====
;Ultra-AGP, Ultra-AGPII: It is an internal AGP interface standard used by [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] for the north bridge controllers with integrated graphics. The original version supports same bandwidth as AGP 8x, while Ultra-AGPII has maximum 3.2GB/s bandwidth.

====PCI-based AGP ports====
:;AGP Express: Not a true AGP interface, but rather a way to allow an AGP card to be connected over the legacy [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI bus]] on a [[PCI Express]] motherboard. It is a technology found on [[Elitegroup Computer Systems|ECS]] motherboards, and is used as a selling point for AGP card owners who want a new motherboard but do not want to be forced to buy a PCIe graphics card as well (most new motherboards do not provide AGP slots, only PCIe slots). An &quot;AGP Express&quot; slot is basically a PCI slot (with the electrical power of two) in the AGP form factor. While it offers backward compatibility with AGP cards, its disadvantages include [http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051216142008/www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWeb/Support/agp.aspx?MenuID=0&amp;LanID=0 incomplete support] (some AGP cards do not work with AGP Express) and reduced performance—the card is forced to use the shared PCI bus at its lower bandwidth, rather than having exclusive use of the faster AGP.
:;AGI: The ASRock Graphics Interface (AGI) is a proprietary variant of the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard. Its purpose is to provide AGP-support for those ASRock motherboards that use chipsets lacking native AGP support. However, it's not fully compatible and several video card chipsets are known to not be supported.
:;AGX: The [[Epox|EpoX]] Advanced Graphics eXtended (AGX) is also a proprietary variant of the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard. It shares the same problems with the AGI port explained above. User manuals even recommend not using AGP 8X ATI cards with AGX slots.
:;XGP: The [[Biostar]] Xtreme Graphics Port is also a variant of the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard. It is similar to the two standards above, in that it supports AGP cards with chipsets that do not support AGP. Also like the above, it has support issues with many AGP cards.

====PCIe based AGP ports====
:;AGR: The [[Advanced Graphics Riser]] is a variation of the AGP port used in some PCIe motherboards made by [[MSI]] to offer a limited backwards compatibility with AGP. It is, effectively, a modified PCIe slot allowing for performance comparable to an AGP 4x/8x slot,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=1806&amp;page=2 MSI K8N Neo3-F Motherboard Review—What's an AGR video slot?]&lt;/ref&gt; but with limited support of AGP cards. The manufacturer has published a non-exhaustive compatibility list of cards and chipsets that do work with the modified slot.

==Compatibility==
[[Image:AGP &amp; AGP Pro Keying.svg|right|thumb|300px|Compatibility, AGP Keys on card (top), on slot (bottom)]]

AGP cards are [[Backward compatibility|backward]] and [[Forward compatibility|forward compatible]] within limits. 1.5 V-only keyed cards will not go into 3.3 V slots and vice versa, though &quot;Universal&quot; cards exist which will fit into either type of slot. There are also unkeyed &quot;Universal&quot; slots that will accept either type of card. When an AGP Universal card is plugged-into an AGP Universal slot, only the 1.5 V portion of the card is used. Some cards, like Nvidia's [[GeForce 6]] series (except the 6200) or ATI's [[Radeon X800]] series, only have keys for 1.5 V to prevent them from being installed in older mainboards without 1.5 V support. Some of the last modern cards with 3.3 V support were the Nvidia [[GeForce FX]] series (FX 5200, FX 5500, FX 5700, some FX 5800, FX 5900 and some FX 5950) and the ATI [[Radeon R300|Radeon 9500/9700/9800(R350)]] (but not 9600/9800(R360)).  Some Geforce 6200 cards will function with AGP 1.0 (3.3v) slots.

AGP Pro cards will not fit into standard slots, but standard AGP cards will work in a Pro slot. Motherboards equipped with a Universal AGP Pro slot will accept a 1.5 V or 3.3 V card in either the AGP Pro or standard AGP configuration, a Universal AGP card, or a Universal AGP Pro card. 

It is important to check voltage compatibility as some cards incorrectly have dual notches and some motherboards incorrectly have fully open slots. Furthermore, some poorly designed older 3.3 V cards incorrectly have the 1.5 V key. Inserting a card into a slot that does not support the correct signaling voltage may cause damage.

There are some proprietary exceptions to this rule. For example, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Power Macintosh]] computers with the [[Apple Display Connector]] (ADC) have an extra connector which delivers power to the attached display. Additionally, moving cards between computers of various [[CPU design|CPU architectures]] may not work due to [[firmware]] issues.

==Use today==
{{As of|2011}}, few new motherboards feature AGP slots. No new motherboard chipsets are equipped with AGP support, but motherboards continue to be produced with older chipsets that have AGP support. [[PCI Express]] allows for higher data transfer rates, has more robust [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]] support, and also supports other devices.

All new graphics processors are designed for PCI-Express.  To create AGP graphics cards, those chips require an additional PCIe to AGP bridge chip to convert PCIe signals to and from AGP signals. This incurs additional board costs due to the need for the additional bridge chip and for a separate AGP-designed circuit board.

Various manufacturers of graphics cards continue to produce AGP cards for the shrinking AGP user-base. The first bridged cards were the GeForce 6600 and ATI Radeon X800 XL boards, released during 2004-5.&lt;ref&gt;Gasior, Geoff. [http://techreport.com/articles.x/7624 Nvidia's GeForce 6600 GT AGP graphics card: Bridging backwards], Tech Report, November 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasior, Geoff. [http://techreport.com/articles.x/8344 ATI's new AGP Radeons: A bridge is born], Tech Report, May 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, AGP cards from Nvidia have a ceiling of the [[GeForce 7 Series]]. As of 2009, [[DirectX]] 10-capable AGP cards from ATI include the [[Radeon R600|Radeon HD 2400, 2600, 3650, and 3850]] and the [[Radeon R700|Radeon HD 4650, 4670]].

'''Andreas Aagesen''' (5 August 1826&amp;nbsp;– 26 October 1879) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] jurist.

He was educated for the law at Christiania (now [[Oslo]]) and [[Copenhagen]], and interrupted his studies in 1848 to take part in the [[First Schleswig War]], in which he served as the leader of a reserve battalion. In 1855 he became a professor of [[jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1870 he was appointed a member of the commission  for drawing up a maritime and commercial code, and the navigation  law of 1882 is mainly his work. In 1879 he was elected a member of the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] (one of two chambers of the Danish Parliament, the [[Rigsdagen]]); but it is as a teacher at the university that he won his reputation. Among his numerous juridical works may be mentioned: ''Bidrag til Læren om Overdragelse af Ejendomsret, Bemærkinger om Rettigheder over Ting'' (Copenhagen, 1866, 1871-1872); ''Fortegnelse over Retssamlinger, Retslitteratur i Danmark, Norge, Sverige'' (Copenhagen, 1876). Aagesen was [[Carl Christian Hall]]'s successor as lecturer on [[Roman law]] at the university, and in this department his researches were epoch-making.

'''Aalen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaːlən}}) is a [[city]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], about {{convert|70|km|mi}} east of [[Stuttgart]] and  {{convert|48|km|mi}}&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/233/Aalen Aalen], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''; retrieved May 5, 2011, from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''&lt;/ref&gt; north of [[Ulm]]. It is the seat of the [[Ostalbkreis]] district, and its largest city, as well as the largest city within the [[Ostwürttemberg]] region. In [[spatial planning]], Aalen is designated a ''Mittelzentrum'' (“medium-level centre”). Since 1 April 1956, Aalen has the status of [[Große Kreisstadt]] (“major district town”).

With an area of 146.63&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Aalen is ranking position 7 in Baden-Württemberg and position 2 within the [[Stuttgart (region)|Government Region of Stuttgart]], after Stuttgart. With a population of about 66,000, Aalen is on position 15 within Baden-Württemberg.

Aalen is not to be confused with the identically-pronounced city of [[Ahlen]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

== Geography ==
=== Situation ===
[[File:Aalen Luftbild.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of the city district of Unterkochen (the city center is partly covered and in the background), the Aalen lowlands well perceptible in the back]]
Aalen is situated on the upper reaches of the river [[Kocher]], at the foot of the [[Swabian Jura]] to the south and south-east and close to the hilly landscape of the [[Ellwanger Berge]] to the north.

In terms of [[natural region]]s, the west of Aalen’s territory is on the foreland of the eastern Swabian Jura, and the north and north-west is on the Swabian-Franconian Uplands, both being part of the [[Swabian Keuper-Lias Plains]]. The south-west is part of the [[Albuch]], the east is part of the [[Härtsfeld]], these two both being parts of the Swabian Jura.&lt;ref&gt;''Naturräume Baden-Württembergs''. Landesanstalt für Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kocher enters the city’s territory from [[Oberkochen]] on the south, crosses the city district of Unterkochen, then the city centre, where the ''Aal'' flows into it. The ''Aal'' is a small river stretching only on the town's territory. Next, the Kocher crosses the city district of Wasseralfingen, then leaves the city for [[Hüttlingen, Baden-Württemberg|Hüttlingen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gisserver.de/aalen/start.html Geographical information system of the town of Aalen]&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers originating near Aalen are the [[Rems]] (near [[Essingen]], west of Aalen) and the [[Jagst]] (near [[Unterschneidheim]], east of Aalen), both being subsidiaries of the [[Neckar]], just like the Kocher.

The elevation in the centre at market square is 430 meters relative to [[Normalhöhennull]]. The territory’s lowest point is at the [[Lein (Kocher)|Lein]] river near Rodamsdörfle, the highest point is the Grünberg’s peak near Unterkochen at 733&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer9&quot;/&gt;

=== Geology ===
Aalen’s territory ranges over all [[Group (stratigraphy)|lithostratigraphic groups]] of the south-German [[Jurassic]]: Aalen’s south and the ''Flexner'' massif are on top of the ''Weißer Jura'' (White Jurassic) , the city center is on the ''Brauner Jura'' (Brown Jurassic), and a part of Wasseralfingen is on the ''Schwarzer Jura'' (Black Jurassic). Therefore, the city advertises itself as a “Geologist’s Mecca”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.urweltmuseum-aalen.de/aalenium.html Ulrich Sauerborn: ''Das Aalenium''] on ''urweltmuseum-aalen.de'', retrieved 24 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erdgeschichte.de/aalen/index.html ''Erlebnis Erdgeschichte in Baden-Württemberg'', „Mekka der Geologen“] on ''erdgeschichte.de'', retrieved 24 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most part of the territory is on the ''Opalinuston-Formation'' (Opalinum Clay [[Formation (stratigraphy)|Formation]]) of the [[Aalenian]] subdivision, which is named after Aalen. On the ''Sandberg'', the ''Schnaitberg'' and the ''Schradenberg'' hills, all in the west of Aalen, the ''Eisensandstein'' (Iron Sandstone) Formation emerges to surface. On the other hills of the city, [[sand]]s ''(Goldshöfer Sande)'', [[gravel]] and residual [[rubble]] prevail.
The historic centre of Aalen and the other areas in the Kocher valley are founded completely on [[Holocene|holocenic]] [[floodplain]] [[loam]] ''(Auelehm)'' and riverbed gravel that have filled in the valley.

Most parts of Dewangen and Fachsenfeld are founded on formations of ''Jurensismergel'' (Jurensis [[Marl]]), ''Posidonienschiefer'' (cf. [[Posidonia Shale]]), ''Amaltheenton'' (Amalthean Clay), ''Numismalismergel'' (Numismalis Marl) and ''Obtususton'' (Obtusus Clay, named after [[Asteroceras]] obtusum) succeeding from south to north, all belonging to the Jurassic. They are at last succeeded by the ''Trossingen Formation'' already belonging to the [[Late Triassic]].

On the ''Braunenberg'' hill, until 1939 [[iron ore]] was mined (see [[#Tiefer Stollen|Tiefer Stollen]] section).

=== Extent of the city’s territory ===
The maximum extent of the city’s territory amounts to {{convert|18|km|mi}} in north-south dimension and {{convert|25|km|mi}} in east-west dimension. The area is 14,662.8 [[hectar]]es, which includes 42.2 % (6,186.2 hectares) agriculturally used area and 37.7 % (5,534.9 hectares) of forest. 11.5 % (1,692.3 hectares) are built up or vacant, 6.4 % (932.8 hectares) is used by traffic infrastructure. Sporting and recreation grounds and parks comprise 1 % (152.7 hectares), other areas 1.1 % (163.9 hectares).&lt;ref name=&quot;stat. Jahrbuch&quot;&gt;Statistisches Jahrbuch der Stadt Aalen 2007/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adjacent towns ===
The following [[municipality|municipalities]] border on Aalen. They are listed clockwise, beginning south, with their respective linear distances to Aalen city centre given in brackets:

[[Oberkochen]] ({{convert|6|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Essingen (Württemberg)|Essingen]] ({{convert|6|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Heuchlingen]] ({{convert|11|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Abtsgmünd]] ({{convert|9|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Neuler]] ({{convert|10|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Hüttlingen (Württemberg)|Hüttlingen]] ({{convert|6|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Rainau]] ({{convert|10|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Westhausen (Württemberg)|Westhausen]] ({{convert|9|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Lauchheim]] ({{convert|12|km|mi|disp=comma}}), [[Bopfingen]] ({{convert|20|km|mi|disp=comma}}) and [[Neresheim]] ({{convert|20|km|mi|disp=comma}}), all in the [[Ostalbkreis]] district, furthermore [[Heidenheim an der Brenz]] ({{convert|18|km|mi|disp=comma}}) and [[Königsbronn]] ({{convert|10|km|mi|disp=comma}}), both in [[Heidenheim (district)|Heidenheim district]].

=== Boroughs ===
[[File:Aalen Stadtbezirke.png|thumb|Map of Aalen’s boroughs ''(Stadtbezirke)'']]
Aalen’s territory consists of the city centre ''(Kernstadt)'' and the municipalities
[[Merger (politics)|merged]] to between 1938 (Unterrombach) and 1975 (Wasseralfingen, see [[#Mergings|mergings]] section).
The municipalities merged in the course of the latest municipal reform of the 1970s are also called ''[[Stadtbezirk]]e'' (city districts), and are ''Ortschaften'' (“settlements”) in terms of Baden-Württemberg’s ''[[Gemeindeordnung]]'' (municipal code), which means, each of them has its own council elected by its respective residents ''(Ortschaftsrat)'' and is presided by a spokesperson ''(Ortsvorsteher)''.

The city centre itself and the merged former municipalities consist of numerous villages ''(Teilorte&lt;!-- sic! --&gt;)'', mostly separated by open ground from each other and having their own independent and long-standing history. Some however have been created as [[Planned community|planned communities]], which were given proper names, but no well-defined borders.

=== Spatial planning ===
Aalen forms a ''Mittelzentrum'' (“medium-level centre”) within the [[Ostwürttemberg]] region. It’s designated [[catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] includes the following municipalities of the central and eastern Ostalbkreis district: [[Abtsgmünd]], [[Bopfingen]], [[Essingen (Württemberg)|Essingen]], [[Hüttlingen (Württemberg)|Hüttlingen]], [[Kirchheim am Ries]], [[Lauchheim]], [[Neresheim]], [[Oberkochen]], [[Riesbürg]] and [[Westhausen (Württemberg)|Westhausen]], and is interwoven with the catchment area of [[Nördlingen]], situated in [[Bavaria]], {{convert|30|km|mi}} east of Aalen.

=== Climate ===
As Aalen’s territory sprawls on escarpments of the Swabian Jura, on the Albuch and the Härtsfeld landscapes, and transcends a difference in elevation of 355 metres, the climate varies from district to district.

The [[weather station]] the following data originate from is located between the city centre and Wasseralfingen at about {{Coord|48|51|02|N|10|05|44|E|name=weather station|display=inline}} and is operative since 1991.

The sunshine duration is about 1800 hours per year, which averages to 4.93 hours per day. So Aalen is above the German average of 1550 hours per year. However, with 167 days of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], Aalen’s region also ranks above the German average of 138. The annual rainfall is 807 millimetres, which puts Aalen into the moderate middle within Baden-Württemberg.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www2.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/public/abt5/klimaatlas_bw/klima/karten/nied/niederschlag_jahr.html Precipitation map of Baden-Württemberg, by ''Landesamt für Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz''].&lt;/ref&gt;
Mean fluctuations in temperature of up to -11.6&amp;nbsp;°C in January and 32.7&amp;nbsp;°C in July result in an annual mean temperature of 9.9&amp;nbsp;°C. Here Aalen as well ranks above the German average of 8.2&amp;nbsp;°C and the Baden-Württemberg average of 8.1&amp;nbsp;°C.

== History ==
=== Civic history ===
==== First settlements ====
Tools made of [[flint]] and traces of human settlement of the [[Mesolithic]] dated between the 8th and 5th millennium BC were found on several sites on the margins of the Kocher and Jagst valleys. On the ''Schloßbaufeld'' plateau (appr. 650 by 350 metres), situated behind ''Kocherburg'' castle near Unterkochen, a hill-top settlement was found, with the core being attributed to the [[Bronze Age]]. In the ''Appenwang'' forest near Wasseralfingen, in Goldshöfe and in Ebnat, [[Tumulus|tumuli]] of the [[Hallstatt culture]] were found. In Aalen and Wasseralfingen, Golden and silver coins left by the [[Celts]] were found, who also fortified the Schloßbaufeld settlement with sectional embankments and a stone wall. Near Heisenberg (Wasseralfingen), a celtic [[nemeton]] is situated.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer25&quot;/&gt;

==== Roman era ====
[[File:Limesmuseum Aalen principia.jpg|thumb|The Roman fort’s excavated foundation walls]]
Around 150 [[Anno Domini|AD]], Aalen’s territory became part of the [[Roman Empire]], in direct vicinity of the [[Rhaetian Limes]]. The Romans erected a [[castrum]] to house the [[cavalry]] unit ''[[Ala (Roman military)|Ala]] II Flavia milliaria''; it’s remains are known today as ''Kastell Aalen'' (”Aalen roman fort“). The site is west of today’s city centre at the bottom of the ''Schillerhöhe'' hill. With about 1,000 horsemen and nearly as many [[groom (horse)|groom]]s, it was the greatest fort of [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] along the Rhaetian Limes. Civilian settlements were adjacent on the south and the east. Around 260, the Romans gave up the fort as they withdrew their frontier to unoccupied [[Germania]] back to the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers, and the [[Alamanni]] took over the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;ostalbkreis_315&quot;&gt;{{cite_book|editor= Diethelm Winter |title= Der Ostalbkreis |publisher= Theiss, Stuttgart, Germany |isbn= 3-8062-0891-3 | edition= 2nd |year= 1992 |pages= 315–320 |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aalen-antike&quot;&gt;[http://www.aalen.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=44429&amp;_bereich=6 ''Das Aalener Stadtgebiet in der Antike''], Stadt Aalen.&lt;/ref&gt; Inferred from coins found related to the late 3rd and the 4th century, the civilian settlement continued to exist for the time being. However, a continuous inhabitation between the Roman era and the [[middle ages]] is not detectable.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer25&quot;/&gt;

==== Foundation of the city ====
Archeologists regard findings of alamannic graves originating from the 7th century as the root of the village of Aalen. In the northern and western walls of St. John’s church, which is located directly adjacent to the eastern gate of the Roman fort, Roman stones were incorporated. The building existing today probably dates to the 9th century.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the first time a place today being part of Aalen was mentioned was 839, when emperor [[Louis the Pious]] permitted the [[Fulda monastery]] to exchange estate in the Hammerstadt village, then known as ''Hamarstat''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ostalbkreis_123&quot;&gt;{{cite_book|editor= Diethelm Winter |title= Der Ostalbkreis |publisher= Theiss, Stuttgart, Germany |isbn= 3-8062-0891-3 | edition= 2nd |year= 1992 |pages= 123 |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aalen itself was first mentioned in an inventory list of [[Ellwangen Abbey]], dated ca. 1136, as the village ''Alon'', along with a lower nobleman named Conrad of Aalen. This gender probably had its ancestral castle at a site south of today’s city centre and were probably first subject to Ellwangen abbey, later to the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], and at last to the [[House of Oettingen]]. 1426 was the last time a member of that house was attested in connection with Aalen.
Middle-aged documents indicate that the city of Aalen was founded by the Hohenstaufen between 1241 and 1246, but at a different site than the like-named village, which is supposed destroyed in 1388 in the course of the war between the Alliance of Swabian Cities and the Dukes of Bavaria.
Later, the counts of Oettingen were rulers of the city, which is attested for the first time for 1340.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt;
They pawned the city to the [[House of Württemberg]] in 1359.

==== Imperial city ====
===== Designation as Imperial City =====
In the war of the Holy Roman Empire against Württemberg, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] took the city after a siege without a fight. On 3 December 1360, he declared Aalen an [[Imperial City]], a city responsible only to the emperor (often misreferred to as [[Imperial Free City]]), a title it kept until 1803. In 1377, Aalen joined the Alliance of Swabian Cities. 1385, for the first time the term ''civitas'' appeared in the city’s seal. 1398, it was granted the right to hold markets, in 1401 a proper jurisdiction. However, Aalen could not acquire a large territory, it consisted only of the city itself and a few villages.

[[File:Aalen 1528.jpg|thumb|City view of 1528]]
The oldest preserved city view was made in 1528. It was made as the basis of a lawsuit of the city versus the Counts of Oettingen at the [[Reichskammergericht]] in Speyer. It shows Aalen surrounded by walls, towers and double moats. The situation of the moats, which had an embankment belt between them, is recognizable by today’s street names of ''Nördlicher, Östlicher, Südlicher'' and ''Westlicher Stadtgraben'' (Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Moat respectively). The wall was about 6 metres tall, 1518 [[Pace (unit)|single paces]] (990 metres) long and enclosed an area of 5.3 hectares. On its foundation, the city had two [[city gate]]s: The ''Upper'' or ''[[Ellwangen]] Gate'' in the east, and St. Martin’s gate in the south. Due to frequent floods, St. Martin’s gate was bricked up in the 14th century and replaced by the ''Lower'' or ''[[Schwäbisch Gmünd|Gmünd]] Gate'' built in the west before 1400. Later, several minor side gates were build. The central street market took place on the ''Wettegasse'' (today called ''Marktplatz'', “market square”) and the ''Reichsstädter Straße''. So the market course was, as usual by then, from one gate to the other, however in Aalen it was bent L-like between southern (St. Martin’s) gate and eastern (Ellwangen) gate.

Around 1500, the civic graveyard was relocated from the city church to St. John’s Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt; In 1514, the ''Vierundzwanziger'' (“Group of 24”) was the first assembly constituted by the citizens.

===== Reformation =====
Delegated by Württemberg’s Duke [[Louis III, Duke of Württemberg|Louis III]], on 28 June 1575, nealy 30 years after [[Martin Luther]]’s death, [[Jakob Andreae]], professor and chancellor of the [[University of Tübingen]], arrived in Aalen. The sermon he held the following day convinced the mayor, the council and the citizens to adopt the [[reformation]] in the city. Andreae stayed in Aalen for four weeks to help with adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt; This brought along enormous changes, so the council forbade the Roman Catholic priest to celebrate masses and sermons. However, after victories of the imperial armies at the beginning of the [[Thirty Year's War]], the [[Prince-Provost]]ry of Ellwangen, which still held the [[Jus patronatus|right of patronage]] in Aalen, were able to temporarily restitute Catholicism in Aalen.
After military successes of the [[Protestant Union]], protestant church practices were instituted again.

===== City fire of 1634 =====
In the night of 5 September 1634,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gav-aalen.de/index.php?id=6 Im Rückspiegel], Geschichts- und Altertumsverein Aalen, retrieved 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; two ensigns of the army of [[Bernard of Saxe-Weimar]] fighting in the alliance of the Swedes and retreating after the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]] set afire two powder carriages, lest ceding the war material to Croatian soldiers already entering the city and to prevent their advance. The result was a [[conflagration|city fire]]. About its extent, differing evaluations exist. According to 17th century accounts, the church and all the city’s buildings, except of the ''Schwörturm'' tower, were casualties of the fire, and only nine families survived. 19th century research by Hermann Bauer, Lutheran pastor and local historian, evaluated this as not coherent and exaggerated, but it is beyond question that the city church and buildings in a “rather large” circumcircle around it were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the city [[archive]] accommodated in an addition to the church, with all of its documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt; After the fire, soldiers of both armies went through the city looting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa-history.de/AA-30J_Krieg_Text.html Aalen im dreißigjährigen Krieg], retrieved 19 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It took nearly 100 years for the city to re-approach its population of 2,000.

French troops traversed Aalen in 1688 in the course of the [[Nine Years' War]], however, unlike at other places, without leaving severe damages. The French pulled through again in 1702 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and in 1741 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt; the latter also caused imperial troops to traverse in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:de:Beschreibung des Oberamts Aalen/Kapitel A 7|Beschreibung des Oberamts Aalen, Chapter A 7]] on [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The City Church’s tower collapsed in 1765, presumably because statics was not taken into account well enough at the reconstruction after the city fire of 1634. The collapsing tower struck two children of the tower watchman who died of their injuries, and destroyed the nave, leaving only the altar cross intact. The remaining walls had to be knocked down due to the great damage. Reconstruction began the same year, creating the building still existing today.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt;

On 22 November 1749, in Aalen, being an imperial and thus neutral city, the ''Aalen protocol'' was signed by the Duchy of Württemberg and the Prince-Provostry of Ellwangen, regulating cohabitation of Lutherans and Roman Catholics in the jointly-ruled place of Oberkochen.

===== Napoleonic era =====
[[File:Angriff auf Aalen 1796.jpg|thumb|French attack on Aalen of 1796]]
In the [[War of the First Coalition]], Aalen was severely looted in 1796.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt; The War of the Second Coalition concluded in 1801 to the [[Treaty of Lunéville]], which led to the [[German Mediatisation]] of 1803 that assigned most imperial cities to the neighbouring principalities. Aalen was assigned to the [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of Württemberg (later to become the Kingdom of Württemberg) and became seat of the District (“Oberamt”) of Aalen. During the [[War of the Third Coalition]], on 6 October 1805, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] arrived in Aalen, carrying along an army of 40,000. This event, along with Bavarian and Austrian troops moving in some days later, caused miseries that according to the city clerk “no feather could describe”.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer145&quot;/&gt;

In 1811, the municipality of Unterrombach was formed out of some villages previously belonging to Aalen, some to the Barons of Wöllwarth, and the eastern villages were assigned to the municipality of Unterkochen.

In the age of the Napoleonic wars, the [[city wall]]s were no longer of use. In the 18th century, the maintenance of walls, gates and towers was neglected more and more, so ever more components of the wall went into a state of disrepair. For thorough repairs, funds were lacking, not at least in the face of the enormous war expenditures. Starting in 1800, most towers were demolished, the other buildings followed soon, so the fortifications today are nearly completely vanished.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer145&quot;/&gt;

==== Industrial revolution ====
[[File:Aalen nach 1861.jpg|thumb|Train station and city after 1861]]
In Aalen, the [[industrial revolution]] became noticeable only slowly. A first peak were the 1840s, when three factories for [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] and some other factories emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer122&quot;/&gt; It was the link with the railway network, by the opening of the [[Rems Railway]] from [[Bad Cannstatt]] to Wasseralfingen in 1861, that brought along an industrial rise in Aalen, along with the royal [[steel mill]] (later ''Schwäbische Hüttenwerke'') in Wasseralfingen. The Rems Railway’s extension to Nördlingen in 1863, the opening of the [[Brenz Railway]] in 1864 and of the [[Upper Jagst Railway]] in 1866 turned Aalen’s station into a [[railway hub]]. Furthermore, between 1901 and its shutdown in 1972, the [[Härtsfeld Railway]] connected Aalen with [[Dillingen an der Donau]] via [[Neresheim]]. A maintenance facility, a [[roundhouse]], an administrative office, two track maintenance shops and a freight station with an industrial [[branch line]] shaped the city scape, so that Aalen in that historical context is labelled by today’s historians as a “railwayman’s city”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hafner Stadtführer&quot;&gt;Eugen Hafner: ''Aalen. Der Stadtführer.'' P. 5 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the Aalen [[gasworks]] was opened and [[gas lighting]] was introduced. In 1870, a modern [[water supply]] system was started and in 1912 the [[mains electricity]]. In 1935 at last, the first electrically-powered [[street light]]s were installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer122&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Aalen-um-1900.jpg|thumb|left|Aalen by 1900]]
To fight housing shortage during and after [[World War I]], the city set up the barracks settlement areas at the ''Schlauch'' and ''Alter Turnplatz'' grounds. In spite of the industry being crippled by the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the public baths at the Hirschbach creek where modernized, extended and re-opened in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hafner Stadtführer&quot; /&gt;

==== Nazi era ====
In the [[German federal election, November 1932|federal election of 1932]], the [[Nazi Party]] performed below average in Aalen with 25.8 % of votes compared to 33.1 % on the national level, thus being second to the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] which resulted in 26.6 % (11.9 % nation-wide) and ahead of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with 19.8 % (20.4 %). However, until the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 federal elections]], this setting had changed: The Nazi Party resulted still below German average with 34.1 % (43.9 % nation-wide), but became the by far strongest party in Aalen, followed by the Centre party unaltered at 26.6 % (11.3 %) and the Social Democrats (18.6 %/18.3 %).&lt;ref name=&quot;Biedert 273&quot;/&gt;

During [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule in Germany]], in 1936 a [[military district (Germany)|military district]] riding and driving school was deployed in Aalen, as well as an army replenishment office ''(Heeresverpflegungsamt)'', a branch arsenal office ''(Heeresnebenzeugamt)'' and a branch army ammunitions institute ''(Heeresnebenmunitionsanstalt)''.

In 1935, [[Merger (politics)|mergers]] of neighbouring towns began. In 1938, the Oberamt was transformed into the [[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]] of Aalen and the municipality of Unterrombach was disbanded. Its territory was mostly added to Aalen, with the exception of Hammerstadt, which was added to the municipality of Dewangen. Forst, Rauental and Vogelsang were added to Essingen (in 1952 the entire former municipality of Unterrombach was merged into Aalen, with the exception of Forst, which is part of Essingen until present).

In September 1944, the ''Wiesendorf'' [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], a [[List of subcamps of Natzweiler-Struthof|subcamp]] of [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], was put up. It was designated for between 200 and 300 prisoners who were held to [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor in industrial businesses]] nearby. Until the camp’s dissolution in February 1945, 60 prisoners died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schätzle&quot;/&gt; Between 1946 and 1957, the camp buildings were torn down, its foundations are still in place in house ''Moltkestraße 44/46''. Besides, several labour camps existed where prisoners of war and women and men from countries occupied by Germany were pooled, who had to work for the arms industry in major businesses like ''Schwäbische Hüttenwerke'' and the ''Alfing Keßler'' machine factory.&lt;ref name=&quot;gedenkstaetten&quot;/&gt;

Aalen was mostly spared of combat activity in [[World War II]]. It was only in the last weeks of the war that Aalen became target of [[Air warfare of World War II|air warfare]], which led to destruction and severe damage of parts of the city, the train station and other railway installations. A series of air attacks lasting for more than three weeks had its peak on 17 April 1945, when [[United States Army Air Forces]] planes bombed the branch arsenal office and the train station. 59 people were killed, more than half of them buried by debris, and more than 500 lost their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aalen Luftangriffe&quot;/&gt; 33&amp;nbsp;residential buildings, 12&amp;nbsp;other buildings and 2&amp;nbsp;bridges were destroyed; 163&amp;nbsp;buildings, including 2&amp;nbsp;churches, were damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer145&quot;/&gt; Five days later, the Nazi rulers of Aalen were unseated by the US forces.

==== Post-war era ====
Upon foundation of the State of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952, Aalen became part of that state. With the Baden-Württemberg territorial reform of 1973, the District of Aalen was merged into the [[Ostalbkreis]] district. Aalen became seat of that district. In 1975, the city territory attained its present dimension ([[#Mergings|see below]]).

The population of Aalen exceeded the limit of 20,000, the requirement for the status of [[Große Kreisstadt]] (“major district town“) in 1946. On 1 August 1947, Aalen was declared ''Unmittelbare Kreisstadt'' (“immediate district town”), and with the coming into effect of the [[Gemeindeordnung]] (municipal code) of Baden-Württemberg on 1 April 1956, it was declared ''Große Kreisstadt''.

=== Religions ===
On 31&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;2008, 51.1&amp;nbsp;percent of the entire city’s inhabitants were members of the [[Catholic Church]], 23.9&amp;nbsp;percent were members of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg|Evangelical-Lutheran Church]]. About 25&amp;nbsp;percent belong to other or no religious community or gave no information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalen.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=975&amp;_bereich=6 ''Religion''] ''aalen.de'', retrieved 29 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The city district of Waldhausen was the district with the highest percentage of Roman Catholic inhabitants 75.6&amp;nbsp;percent, the central district was the one with the highest percentage of Evangelical-Lutheran inhabitants (25.6&amp;nbsp;percent) as well as those adhering to other or no religious communities (32.5&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref name=&quot;stat. Jahrbuch&quot;/&gt;

==== Protestantism ====
Aalen’s population originally was subject to the [[jus patronatus]] of Ellwangen Abbey, and thus subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg]].

By the help of the Duke of Württemberg, in 1575 the [[reformation]] was implemented in Aalen. Subsequently, Aalen had been a predominantly Protestant city for centuries, with the exception of the years from 1628 until 1632 (see [[#Reformation|reformation]] section). Being an imperial city, Aalen could govern its clerical matters on its own. Clerics, organists and choir masters were direct subjects to the city council, which thus exerted [[bishop]]-like power; even a proper hymn book for Aalen did exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer82&quot;/&gt; After the transition to Württemberg in 1803, Aalen became seat of a [[deanery]], with the dean church being the City Church (with the building of constructed from 1765 to 1767, existing until present). Another utilized church is [[John the Baptist|St. John’s]] Church, located on the cemetery, refurbished in 1561.

As Aalen’s population grew in the 20th century, more parishes were founded: [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark’s]] parish with its church building of 1967 and [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin’s]] parish with its church of 1974. In the borough of Unterrombach, Aalen had implemented the reformation as well, but the community remained a [[chapel of ease|chapel-of-ease]] of Aalen.

==== Catholicism ====
[[File:Salvatorkirche aalen.jpg|thumb|upright|Salvator’s Church]]
The few Catholics of today's central district were covered by the parish of Unterkochen until the 19th century, a situation which continued for some years even after completion of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary's]] Church in 1868 constructed by [[Georg Morlok]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer145&quot;/&gt; However, in 1872 Aalen got its proper parish again, and in 1913, a second Catholic church was completed, Salvator’s Church, and in 1969 the Holy Cross Church. In 1963, a second parish had already been set up, which in 1972 got a new Church, the new St. Mary’s Church, which has been erected in place of the old St. Mary’s church, which had been torn down in 1968. Another church of the second parish was St. Augustine’s Church, completed in 1970. In 1976 at last, St. Elisabeth’s Church was completed. Furthermore, in 1963 the St. Michael pastoral care office is existing since 1963.

Hofherrnweiler is also having its own Catholic church, [[Saint Boniface|St. Boniface’s]], since 1904. The villages of Dewangen, Ebnat, Hofen, Waldhausen and Wasseralfingen had remained Catholic after reformation, so old parishes and churches persist there. The ''Assumption of Mary'' Church in Dewangen has an [[Gothic art|early Gothic]] tower and a new-build nave of 1875. Today’s building of the [[Immaculate Conception|Mary’s Immaculate Conception]] Church in Ebnat was constructed in 1723, but the church was first mentioned in 1298.

[[File:Marienwallfahrtskirche Unterkochen.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Mary, Unterkochen]]
Hofen’s [[Saint George]]’s Church is a [[fortified church]], whose present nave was built from 1762 to 1775.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirchengemeinde-hofen.de/?page=Die%20Geschichte%20der%20St.%20Georgskirche%20mit%20Bildern... Die Geschichte der St. Georgskirche mit Bildern...], Kirchengemeinde Hofen, retrieved 11 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Beside the church, the Late Gothic [[Odile of Alsace|St. Odile’s]] Chapel is standing, whose entrance has the year 1462 engraved. Foundations of predecessor buildings were dated to the 11th and 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirchengemeinde-hofen.de/?page=Ottilienkapelle Ottilienkapelle], Kirchengemeinde Hofen, retrieved 11 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Mary’s Church of Unterkochen was first mentioned in 1248, and for long time served the Catholics of Aalen. Waldhausen’s parish church of [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]] was built from 1699 until 1716. Wasseralfingen at first was a chapel-of-ease of Hofen, but had an old church, [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]], which was extended in 1832. In 1834, a proper parish was established, which built a new church in 1883. Fachsenfeld got its own church as well, [[Sacred Heart]] of 1895. All Catholic parishes within Aalen are today incorporated into four pastoral care units within the ''Ostalb'' Deanery of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]], but these some of these units also comprise some parishes outside of Aalen. Pastoral Care Unit two comprises the parishes of Essingen, Dewangen and Fachsenfeld, unit four comprises Hofen and Wasseralfingen, unit five comprises both parishes of Aalen’s centre and Hofherrnweiler, unit five comprises Waldhausen, Ebnat, Oberkochen and Unterkochen.

==== Other christian communities ====
Besides the two major christian denominations, in Aalen there are also [[free church]]es and other communities, including the [[United Methodist Church]], the [[Baptists]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[New Apostolic Church]].

==== Other religions ====
Until the late 19th century, no [[Jew]]s are testified in Aalen. It was not before 1886 that four Jews were living in Aalen, a number that rose to ten in 1900, fell to seven in 1905, and remained so until 1925. Upon the Nazis’ rise to power in 1933, seven Jews, including two children, lived in Aalen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juden 1984&quot;/&gt; During the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the vitrines of the three Jewish shops in the city were smashed and their proprietors imprisoned for several weeks. After their release, most Aalen Jews emigrated. The last Jew of Aalen, Fanny Kahn, was forcibly resettled to [[Oberdorf am Ipf]], which had a large Jewish community. Today, a street of Aalen is named after her. The Jew Max Pfeffer returned from Brussels to Aalen in 1948 to continue his shop, but emigrated to Italy in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juden 1984&quot;/&gt;

In Aalen, there is an Islamic [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs|Ditib]] community, which maintains the ''D.I.T.I.B. Mosque of Aalen (Central Mosque)'' located at Ulmer Straße.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscheesuche Ditib&quot;/&gt; The mosque’s construction started on 30 August 2008. The [[Millî Görüş]] organisation maintains the [[Mehmed II|Fatih]] Mosque, as well at Ulmer Straße.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscheesuche IGMG&quot;/&gt;

==== Mergings ====
Today’s city of Aalen was formed on 21 June 1975 by unification of the cities of Aalen and Wasseralfingen, with the initial name of ''Aalen-Wasseralfingen'', with a territory one third larger than Aalen’s prior territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; Already on 1 July 1975, it was renamed to ''Aalen''. Before, the former city of Aalen had already merged the following municipalities:
* 1938: Unterrombach
* 1 January 1970: Waldhausen
* 1 July 1972: Ebnat
* 1 January 1973: Dewangen, Fachsenfeld (including the village of Hangendenbach, which was transferred from Abtsgmünd in 1954) and Unterkochen. The merging of Dewangen nearly doubled the territory of Aalen.

=== Population’s progression and structure ===
[[File:Population development Aalen.png|thumb|upright=2|Progression of Aalen’s population]]
During the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], Aalen was just a small city with a few hundred inhabitants. The population grew slowly and doubled back over and again due to numerous wars, famines and epidemics. It was the beginning of the [[industrialisation]] in the 19th century that accelerated growth. While in 1803, only 1,932 inhabited the city, in 1905 it were already 10,442. The number continued to rise and amounted to 15.890 in 1939.

The influx of refugees and [[Heimatvertriebene|ethnic Germans]] from Germany’s former eastern territories after [[World War II]] pushed up the city’s population to 31,814 in 1961. The merger with Wasseralfingen on 21 June 1975 added 14.597 persons and resulted in 65.165 inhabitants. On 30 June 2005, the population figure determined officially by the [[List of statistical offices in Germany|Statistical Office of Baden-Württemberg]] by updating and by matching with other statistical offices amounted to an unprecedented 67,125 (accounting only [[Hauptwohnsitz|main domiciles]]).

The following overview shows the population figures of the city territory of the respective year. Until 1823, the figures are mostly estimates, thereafter [[census]] results or official updates by the state statistical office. Until 1871, the figures were determined by non-uniform elicitation methods, since 1871 they refer to the “population present at the place”, since 1925 to the resident population and since 1987 to the “population at the place of main domicile”.

=== Mayors ===
Since 1374, the [[mayor]] and the council form the head of the city. In the 16th century, the city had two, later three mayors. In 1552, the council had 13 members. Later, the head of administration was reorganised several times. In the Württemberg era, initially the mayor’s title was called ''Bürgermeister'', from 1819 it was [[Schultheiß]], and since 1947 it is ''Oberbürgermeister''. The mayor is elected for a term of eight years. He is chairman and member of the city council and has the right to vote there. He has one deputy with the official title of ''Erster Bürgermeister'' (“first mayor”) and one with the official title of ''Bürgermeister'' (“mayor”).

=== Coat of arms and flag ===
[[File:Aalen Flag.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of the City of Aalen]]
[[File:Stadtwappen Aalen 1766.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Coat of arms of 1766 with eagle and eel]]
Aalen’s [[coat of arms]] depicts a black eagle with a red tongue on golden background, having a red shield on his breast with a silver bent [[eel]] on it. Eagle and eel were first testified as Aalen’s heraldic aminals in the city seal of 1385, with the eagle representing the city’s [[imperial immediacy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer9&quot;/&gt; After the territorial reform, it was newly bestowed by the [[Stuttgart (region)|Administrative District of Stuttgart]] on 16 November 1976.

The coat of arms’ [[blazon]] reads: “In gold, the black imperial eagle, with a red breast shield applied to it, therein a bent silver eel” ''(In Gold der schwarze Reichsadler, belegt mit einem roten Brustschild, darin ein gekrümmter silberner Aal)''.

Aalen’s flag is striped in red and white and contains the coat of arms.

The origin of the city’s name is uncertain. [[Matthäus Merian]] (1593–1650) assumed the name to stem from the city’s situation at the Kocher river, where ”frequently eels are caught”, while ''Aal'' is German for “eel”. Other explanations point to Aalen as the garrison of an [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|ala]] during the Roman empire, respectively to an abridgement of the Roman name  “Aquileia” as a potential name of the Roman fort, a name that nearby [[Heidenheim an der Brenz]] bore as well. Another interpretation points to a Celtic word including the meaning “water”.&lt;ref name=&quot;bauer9&quot;/&gt;

'''Aloysius &quot;Alois&quot; Alzheimer''', ({{IPA-de|ˈaːloˌis  ˈalts.haɪmɐ}}; 14 June 1864 – 19 December 1915) was a [[Germany|German]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[neuropathologist]] and a colleague of [[Emil Kraepelin]]. Alzheimer is credited with identifying the first published case of &quot;presenile dementia&quot;, which Kraepelin would later identify as [[Alzheimer's disease]].

==Biography==
Alzheimer was born in [[Marktbreit]], [[Bavaria]].

His father served in the office of notary public in the family's hometown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marktbreit.de/kultur_bildung/alzheimer_engl.htm &quot;Marktbreit: Alzheimer´s Birthplace&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Alzheimer attended  [[Aschaffenburg]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[Berlin]], and [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] universities. He received a medical degree at Würzburg University in 1887. In the following year, he spent five months assisting mentally ill women, before he took an office in the city mental asylum in [[Frankfurt am Main]]: the Städtische Anstalt für Irre und Epileptische (Asylum for lunatics and epileptics). [[Emil Sioli]] was the dean of that asylum (1852–1922). Another neurologist, [[Franz Nissl]] (1860–1919), began to work in that same asylum with Alzheimer, and they knew each other.
Much of Alzheimer's later work on brain pathology made use of Nissl's method of silver staining of the [[histological]] sections. Alzheimer was the co-founder and co-publisher of the journal ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie''. He never wrote a book that he could call his own.
[[File:Auguste D aus Marktbreit.jpg|thumb|left|Auguste Deter.]]
In 1901, Alzheimer observed a patient at the Frankfurt Asylum named [[Auguste Deter]]. The 51-year-old patient had strange behavioral symptoms, including a loss of short-term memory. This patient would become his obsession over the coming years. In April 1906, Mrs. Deter died and Alzheimer had the patient records and the brain brought to Munich where he was working at Kraepelin's lab.  Together with two Italian physicians, he would use the staining techniques to identify [[amyloid]] plaques and [[neurofibrillary tangles]]. A speech given on 3 November 1906 would be the first time the pathology and the clinical symptoms of presenile dementia would be presented together.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlzBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author =Maurer K., Maurer U. | title = Alzheimer: The Life of a Physician and Career of a Disease | publisher = Columbia University Press| year = 2003 | location = New York | isbn = 0-231-11896-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through extremely fortunate circumstances the original microscope preparations on which Alzheimer based his description of the disease were rediscovered some years ago in Munich and his findings could thus be reevaluated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graeber&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graeber MB, Koesel S, Egensperger R, Banati RB, Mueller U, Bise K, Hoff P, Moeller HJ, Fujisawa K, Mehraein P | title = Rediscovery of the case described by Alois Alzheimer in 1911: historical, histological and molecular genetic analysis | journal = Neurogenetics | volume = 1 | pages = 73–80 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1007/s100480050011 | pmid = 10735278 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Alzheimer-ffm001.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Alzheimer's grave in Frankfurt]]

Since [[German language|German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of science (and especially of psychiatry) at that time, Kraepelin's use of Alzheimer's disease in a textbook would make the name famous. By 1911, his description of the disease was being used by European physicians to diagnose patients in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlzBook&quot;/&gt;

In mid-December 1915, Alzheimer fell ill on the train on his way to the University of Breslau, where he had been appointed professor of psychiatry in 1912. Most probably he had a [[streptococcal]] infection and subsequent [[rheumatic fever]] and [[kidney failure]]. He died of [[heart failure]] at the age of 51 in [[Breslau]], Silesia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Roman government}}
'''Aedile''' ({{lang-la|'''Aedilis'''}}, from ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]], aedis'' &quot;temple building&quot;) was an office of the [[Roman Republic]].  Based in [[Rome]], the aediles were responsible for maintenance of public buildings and regulation of public [[festival]]s.  They also had powers to enforce public order. There were two pair of aediles. Two aediles were from the ranks of [[plebeian]]s and the other were called ''curule aediles'' (''aediles curules''). The office of the curule aedile was open to plebeians and patricians, and they were considered [[Magistratus Curulis|curule magistrates]].

The office was generally held by young men intending to follow the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' to high political office, traditionally after their [[quaestor]]ship but before their [[praetor]]ship.  It was not a compulsory part of the cursus, and hence a former quaestor could be elected to the praetorship without having held the aedileship. However, it was an advantageous position to hold because it demonstrated the aspiring politician's commitment to public service, as well as giving him the opportunity to hold public festivals and games, an excellent way to increase his name recognition and popularity.

==History of the office==

They were created in the same year as the [[Tribune|Tribunes of the People]] (494 BC). Originally intended as assistants to the tribunes, they exercised certain police functions, were empowered to inflict fines and managed the plebeian and Roman games. Their duties at first were simply ministerial. They were the assistants to the tribunes in whatever matters that the tribunes would entrust to them, although most matters with which they were entrusted were of minimal importance. Around 446 BC, they were given the authority to care for the decrees of the senate (''senatus consulta''). When a ''senatus consultum'' was passed, it would be transcribed into a document, and deposited in the public treasury, the ''[[Aerarium]]''. They were given this power because the [[Roman consul|Roman Consuls]], who had held this power before, arbitrarily suppressed and altered the documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liv. III.55&quot;&gt;Liv. III.55&lt;/ref&gt; They also maintained the acts of the [[Plebeian Council]] (popular assembly), the &quot;plebiscites&quot;. Plebiscites, once passed, were also transcribed into a physical document for storage. While their powers grew over time, it is not always easy to distinguish the difference between their powers, and those of the [[Roman censor|Roman Censors]]. Occasionally, if a Censor was unable to carry out one of his tasks, an Aedile would perform the task instead.

According to [[Livy]] (vi. 42), after the passing of the [[Lex Licinia Sextia|Licinian rogation]]s in 367 BC, an extra day was added to the Roman games; the aediles refused to bear the additional expense, whereupon the patricians offered to undertake it, on condition that they were admitted to the aedileship.  The plebeians accepted the offer, and accordingly two ''curule'' aediles were appointed—at first from the patricians alone, then from patricians and plebeians in turn, lastly, from either—at the [[Tribal Assembly]] under the presidency of the consul. Curule Aediles, as formal magistrates, held certain honors that Plebeian Aediles (who were not technically magistrates), did not hold. Besides having the right to sit on a [[Curule Chair]] (''sella curulis'') and to wear a [[toga|toga praetexta]], the Curule Aediles also held the power to issue edicts (''jus edicendi''). These edicts often pertained to matters such as the regulation of the public markets, or what we might call &quot;economic regulation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. Verr. V.14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livy]] suggests, perhaps incorrectly, that both Curule as well as Plebeian Aediles were sacrosanct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liv. III.55&quot;/&gt; Although the curule aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian, their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical. Within five days after the beginning of their terms, the four Aediles (two Plebeian, two Curule) were required to determine, by lot or by agreement among themselves, what parts of the city each should hold jurisdiction over.&lt;ref&gt;Tabul. Heracl. ed. Mazoch&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a distinction between the two sets of Aediles when it came to public festivals. Some festivals were Plebeian in nature, and thus were under the superintendence of Plebeian Aediles.&lt;ref&gt;Liv. XXXI.56&lt;/ref&gt; Other festivals were supervised exclusively by the Curule Aediles,&lt;ref&gt;Liv. XXXI.50&lt;/ref&gt; and it was often with these festivals that the Aediles would spend lavishly. This was often done so as to secure the support of voters in future elections. Because Aediles were not reimbursed for any of their public expenditures, most individuals who sought the office were independently wealthy. Since this office was a stepping stone to higher office and the senate, it helped to ensure that only wealthy individuals (mostly landowners) would win election to high office. These extravagant expenditures began shortly after the end of [[Second Punic War]], and increased as the spoils returned from Rome's new eastern conquests. Even the decadence of the emperors rarely surpassed that of the Aediles under the republic, as could have been seen during [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] Aedileship.&lt;ref&gt;Plut. Caesar, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election to the office==

Plebeian Aediles were elected by the [[Plebeian Council]] (popular assembly), usually while under the presidency of a [[Plebeian Tribune]]. Curule Aediles were elected by the [[Tribal Assembly]], usually while under the presidency of a [[Roman Consul]]. Since the Plebeian Aediles were elected by the [[Plebeians]] (commoners), rather than by all of the [[SPQR|People of Rome]] (Plebeians as well as members of the [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|Patrician]] aristocracy), they were not technically [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]]. Before the passage of the ''lex annalis'', individuals could run for the Aedileship by the time they turned twenty-seven. After the passage of this law in 180 BC, a higher age was set, probably thirty-five.&lt;ref&gt;Liv. XL.44&lt;/ref&gt; By the first century BC, Aediles were elected in July, and took office on the first day in January.

==Powers of the office==

[[Cicero]] ([[de Legibus|Legg.]] iii. 3, 7) divides these functions under three heads:

(1) Care of the city: the repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; 
regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of [[sumptuary]] laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions.  They also punished those who had too large a share of the [[ager publicus]], or kept too many cattle on the state pastures. 

(2) Care of provisions: 
investigation of the quality of the articles supplied and the 
correctness of weights and measures; the purchase of corn for 
disposal at a low price in case of necessity. 

(3) Care of 
the games: superintendence and organization of the public 
games, as well as of those given by themselves and private 
individuals (e.g. at funerals) at their own expense.  
Ambitious persons often spent enormous sums in this manner to 
win the popular favor with a view to official advancement.

==Under the empire==

In [[44 BC]] [[Julius Caesar]] added two plebeian aediles, called ''Cereales'', whose special duty was the care of the cereal (corn) supply.  
Under [[Augustus]] the office lost much of its importance, its judicial functions and the care of the games being transferred to the praetor, while its city responsibilities were limited by the appointment of a [[praefectus urbi]]. Augustus took for himself its powers over various religious duties. By stripping it of its powers over temples, Augustus effectively destroyed the office, by taking from it its original function. After this point, few people were willing to hold such a powerless office, and Augustus was even known to compel individuals into holding the office. Augustus accomplished this by randomly selecting former tribunes and quaestors for the office.&lt;ref&gt;Dion Cassius LV.24&lt;/ref&gt; Future emperors would continue to dilute the power of the office by transferring its powers to newly created offices. However, the office did retain some powers over licentiousness and disorder, in particular over the baths and brothels, as well as the registration of prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Tacit. Annal. II.85&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century AD it disappeared altogether. 

Under the empire, Roman colonies and cities often had officials with powers similar to those of the republican aediles, although their powers widely varied. It seems as though they were usually chosen annually.&lt;ref&gt;De Aedil. Col., &amp;c. Otto. Lips. 1732&lt;/ref&gt; Today in [[Portugal]] the county mayor can still be referred to as 'edil' (e.g. 'O edil de Coimbra', meaning 'the mayor of [[Coimbra]]').

==Shakespeare==

In his play [[Coriolanus]], Shakespeare references the aediles. However, they are minor characters, and their chief job is being policemen.&lt;ref&gt;

'''American Airlines, Inc.''' ('''AA''') is the [[world's largest airlines|world's fourth-largest airline]] in passenger miles transported,&lt;ref name=&quot;awst&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|work=Aviation Week and Space Technology|date=January 15, 2007|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; passenger fleet size, and operating revenues. American Airlines is a [[subsidiary]] of the [[AMR Corporation]] and is headquartered in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]] adjacent to its largest hub at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. American operates an extensive international and domestic network, with scheduled flights throughout North America, Latin and South America, Europe, Asia/Pacific and the Caribbean.

American Airlines was listed at #120 on the [[Fortune 500]] list of companies in 2010 and is a founding member of the [[Oneworld]] [[airline alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Airlines|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/member-airlines/american-airlines|publisher=Oneworld|accessdate= 26-May-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, American served 260 cities (excluding [[Codeshare agreement|codeshares]] with partner airlines) with 655 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;fleetstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com/content/amrcorp/corporateInformation/facts/fleet.jhtml|title=Fleet Statistics|work=AA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; American carries more passengers between the US and Latin America (12.1 million in 2004) than any other airline, and is also strong in the transcontinental and domestic markets.

American has five hubs: [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]] (DFW), [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]] (ORD), [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] (MIA), [[New York]] (JFK), and [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] (LAX).&lt;ref name=&quot;aa.mediaroom.com&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/corporateResponsibility/profile/flightplan-2020.jsp |publisher=American Airlines |year=2009 |title=Flight Plan 2020 - Get To Know Who We Are, in late 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]] is the airline's largest hub, with AA operating 85 percent of flights at the airport and traveling to more destinations than from its other hubs. [[LaGuardia Airport|New York-LaGuardia]] serves as a focus city. American currently operates maintenance bases at [[Tulsa International Airport|Tulsa]] (TUL) and [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport|Fort Worth Alliance]] (AFW). American closed its maintenance base at [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City]] (MCI) on September 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/DN-aabase_25bus.ART.State.Edition1.248c7c3.html American Airlines closes former TWA base in Kansas City | News for Dallas, Texas | Dallas Morning News | Dallas Business News].

== History ==
===Formation===
American Airways was developed from a conglomeration of 82 small airlines through acquisitions and reorganizations: initially, '''American Airways''' was a common brand by a number of independent carriers. These included Southern Air Transport in Texas, Southern Air Fast Express (SAFE) in the western US, Universal Aviation in the Midwest (which operated a transcontinental air/rail route in 1929), Thompson Aeronautical Services (which operated a Detroit-Cleveland route beginning in 1929) and Colonial Air Transport in the Northeast.

On January 25, 1930, American Airways was incorporated as a single company, based in [[New York City|New York]], with routes from [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and from Dallas to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The airline operated wood and fabric-covered [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker Trimotor]]s and all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]]s. In 1934 American began flying [[Curtiss Condor]] biplanes with sleeping berths.

===American Airlines before World War II===
[[File:American DC-3.jpg|thumb|[[DC-3]] &quot;Flagship&quot;, American's chief aircraft type during the World War II period.]]
In 1934, American Airways Company was acquired by [[E.L. Cord]], who renamed it &quot;American Air Lines&quot;. Cord hired Texas businessman [[C. R. Smith|C.R. (Cyrus Rowlett) Smith]] to run the company.

Smith worked with [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]] to develop the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], which American Airlines started flying in 1936. With the DC-3, American began calling its aircraft &quot;[[Flagships]]&quot; and establishing the Admirals Club for valued passengers. The DC-3s had a four-star &quot;admiral's pennant&quot; outside the cockpit window while the aircraft was parked, one of the most well-known images of the airline at the time.

American Airlines was first to cooperate with [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] to build an airport in New York City, and partly as a result became owner of the world's first [[Airport lounge|airline lounge]] at the new [[LaGuardia Airport]] (LGA), which became known as the [[Admirals Club]]. Membership was initially by invitation only, but a discrimination suit decades later changed the club into a paid club, creating the model for other airline lounges.

===Postwar developments===
[[File:Boeing 707 of American Airlines at Basle - April 1976.jpg|[[Boeing 707]] freighter at [[EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg]] in France (near [[Basel]]) in 1976|thumb]]
After World War II, American acquired American Export Airlines, renaming it as [[American Overseas Airlines]], to serve Europe; AOA was sold to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] in 1950. AA launched another subsidiary, Líneas Aéreas Americanas de Mexico S.A., to fly to Mexico and built several airports there. American Airlines provided advertising and free usage of its aircraft in the 1951 film ''[[Three Guys Named Mike]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCMProfile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=90488&amp;mainArticleId=160793|title=Aviation in Film:Three Guys Named Mike|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until Capital merged into United in 1961, AA was the largest American airline, which meant second largest in the world, after Aeroflot.

American Airlines introduced the first transcontinental jet service using [[Boeing 707]]s on January 25, 1959. With its 707s American shifted to nonstop coast-to-coast flights, although it maintained feeder connections to cities along its old route using smaller [[Convair 990]]s and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|Lockheed Electras]]. American invested $440 million in jet aircraft up to 1962, launched the first electronic booking system ([[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]]) with [[IBM]], and built an upgraded terminal at Idlewild (now [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]]) Airport in New York City which became the airline's largest base.&lt;ref name=&quot;timejets&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810685,00.html|title=Jets Across the U.S.|work=TIME|date=November 17, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Mattel]] released a series of ''American Airlines stewardess'' [[Barbie]] dolls, signifying their growing commercial success.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Vignelli Associates designed the AA eagle logo in 1967. Vignelli attributes the introduction of his firm to American Airlines to Henry Dreyfuss, the legendary AA design consultant. The logo is still in use today.

By September 1970, American Airlines was offering its first long haul international flights from the West Coast to [[Honolulu]] and on to [[Sydney]] and [[Auckland]] via [[American Samoa]] and [[Nadi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://airchive.com/html/timetable-and-route-maps/american/1970-september-14/4734 Timetables &amp; Route Maps - American - 1970 - September 14]. Airchive. Retrieved on 2010-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fictitious &quot;American Airlines Space Freighter&quot;, the ''Valley Forge'', was the setting for the 1971 [[science fiction]] movie ''[[Silent Running]]'', starring [[Bruce Dern]] and directed by [[Douglas Trumbull]]. The freighter featured the then-new &quot;AA&quot; logo on the hull, along with the crew uniforms and several set pieces.

On 30 March 1973 AA became the first major airline to employ a female pilot when Bonnie Tiburzi was hired to fly Boeing 727s. American Airlines has been innovative in other aspects initiating several of the industry's major competitive developments including computer reservations systems, frequent flyer loyalty programs and two-tier wage scales.&lt;ref&gt;Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. (2009). &quot;Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees&quot;. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971–1978 [[Beverly Lynn Burns]] worked as a stewardess for AA. She went on to become the first woman Boeing 747 airline captain when, on the afternoon of July 18, 1984, she commanded [[People Express]] flight #17 (aircraft 604) departing [[Newark International Airport]] at 3:30pm to [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. In a prearranged effort, this honor was shared with another female People Express captain [[Lynn Rippelmeyer]], who flew flight #2 from Newark to London Gatwick at 7:35pm that same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-3354521.html People Express Airlines' Burns and Rippelmeyer are the first women captains to fly Boeing 747 jets.

===Expansion in the 1980s and 1990s===
[[File:IMG 1265r.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A300-600]]]]
[[File:aa.b777-200er.n781an.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-223ER]] landing at [[London Heathrow Airport]]]]
After moving headquarters to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] in 1979, American changed its routing to a [[spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke system]] in 1981, opening its first hubs at DFW and Chicago O'Hare. Led by its new chairman and CEO, [[Robert Crandall]], American began flights from these hubs to Europe and Japan in the mid-1980s.

In the late 1980s, American opened three hubs for north-south traffic. [[Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport|San Jose International Airport]] was added after American purchased [[AirCal]]. American also built a terminal and runway at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]] for the growing [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby and compete with [[USAir]]'s hub in [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]]. [[Nashville International Airport|Nashville]] was also a hub. In 1988, American Airlines received its first Airbus A300B4-605R aircraft.

In 1990, American Airlines bought the assets of TWA's operations at London Heathrow for $445 million, giving American a hub there. The US/UK [[Bermuda II]] treaty, in effect until [[open skies]] came into effect in April 2008, barred U.S. airlines from Heathrow with the sole exceptions of American and [[United Airlines]].

Lower fuel prices and a favorable business climate led to higher than average profits in the 1990s. The industry's expansion was not lost on pilots who on February 17, 1997 went on strike for higher wages. President [[Bill Clinton]] invoked the [[Railway Labor Act]] citing economic impact to the United States, quashing the strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=American Airlines Resuming Service After Clinton Stops Strike |last=Knowlton |first=Brian |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/02/17/fly.t_1.php |date=February 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilots settled for wages lower than their demands.

The three new hubs were abandoned in the 1990s: some San Jose facilities were sold to [[Reno Air]], and at Raleigh/Durham to [[Midway Airlines (1993–2003)|Midway Airlines]]. Midway went out of business in 2001. American purchased Reno Air in February 1999 and integrated its operations on August 31, 1999, but did not resume hub operations in San Jose. American discontinued most of Reno Air's routes, and sold most of the Reno Air aircraft, as they had with [[Air California]] 12 years earlier. The only remaining route from the [[Air California]] and Reno Air purchases is San Francisco to Los Angeles.

[[File:Aa oneworld b777-200er n791an arp.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 777#777-200ER|Boeing 777-200ER]] in [[Oneworld]] livery]]
During this time, concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices brought a warning from American's CEO [[Robert Crandall]]. &quot;I've never invested in any airline&quot;, Crandall said. &quot;I'm an airline manager. I don't invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, 'This is not an appropriate investment. It's a great place to work and it's a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.'&quot; Crandall noted that since [[airline deregulation]] of the 1970s, 150 airlines had gone out of business. &quot;A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money&quot;, he said.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

[[Miami International Airport|Miami]] became a hub after American bought Central and South American routes from [[Eastern Air Lines]] in 1990 (inherited from [[Braniff International Airways]] but originated by [[Panagra]]). Through the 1990s, American expanded its network in Latin America to become the dominant U.S. carrier in the region.

On October 15, 1998 American Airlines became the first airline to offer electronic ticketing in the 44 countries it serves.

In 1999 American Airlines, together with [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Canadian Airlines]] and [[Qantas]], founded the global airline alliance Oneworld.

===TWA merger and 9/11 to the present===
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2009}}
[[File:American Airlines Center outside.jpg|thumb|[[American Airlines Center]]]]
Robert Crandall left in 1998 and was replaced by [[Donald J. Carty]], who negotiated the purchase of the near bankrupt [[Trans World Airlines]] (it would file for its 3rd bankruptcy as part of the purchase agreement)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/29/business/twa-cleared-for-2d-bankruptcy-filing.html |work=The New York Times |title=T.W.A. Cleared for 2d Bankruptcy Filing |first=AdamDAM |last=Bryant |date=June 29, 1995 |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its hub in St. Louis in April 2001.

The merger of seniority lists remains contentious for pilots; the groups were represented by different unions. In the merger, 60 percent of former TWA pilots moved to the bottom of the seniority list at AA. Many were [[furlough]]ed, and most remain on furlough. The senior TWA captains were integrated at the same seniority level as AA captains hired years later.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} All TWA captains and first officers hired in March 1989 and later were appended to the seniority list junior to American Airlines first officers hired in June 2001. The senior TWA pilots were able to stay in captain's seats at a higher pay rate with American and were working for a solvent company. The junior TWA pilots were mostly furloughed. On the AA side the captains were mostly unaffected except that AMR inherited TWA debt which decreased the solvency of their parent company. The AA first officers saw hundreds of TWA captains maintain their captain seats even as the company downsized after the 9/11 attacks and subsequent financial crises. The extensive furloughs of former TWA pilots in the wake of the 9/11 attacks disproportionately affected St. Louis and resulted in a significant influx of American Airlines pilots into this base. For cabin crews, all former TWA flight attendants (approximately 4,200) were furloughed by mid-2003 due to the AA flight attendants' union putting TWA flight attendants at the bottom of their seniority list.

American Airlines began losing money in the wake of the TWA merger and the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] (in which two of its planes were involved). Carty negotiated wage and benefit agreements with the unions but resigned after union leaders discovered he was planning to award [[executive compensation]] packages at the same time. This undermined AA's attempts to increase trust with its workforce and to increase its productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Bamber, G. J., Gittell, J. H, Kochan, T. A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. (2009), ''Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees'' [http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup_detail.taf?ti_id=5284 Cornell University Press], Ithaca: pp. 153ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Louis hub was also downsized.

In 2002, the airline received a 100% rating on the first Corporate Equality Index released by the [[Human Rights Campaign]] in 2002 and has maintained their rating in respect to policies on employees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

AA has undergone additional cost-cutting, including rolling back its &quot;More Room Throughout Coach&quot; program (which eliminated several rows of seats on certain aircraft), ending three-class service on many international flights, and standardizing its fleet at each hub (see below). However, the airline also expanded into new markets, including [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], India and [[mainland China]]. On July 20, 2005, American announced a quarterly profit for the first time in 17 quarters; the airline earned $58 million in the second quarter of 2005.

AA was a strong backer of the [[Wright Amendment]], which regulated commercial airline operations at [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in Dallas. On June 15, 2006, American agreed with [[Southwest Airlines]] and the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth to seek repeal of the Wright Amendment on condition that Love Field remained a domestic airport and its gate capacity be limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/sky/wright_amendment/index.html|title=American Airlines Joins Southwest Airlines in Defeating the Wright Amendment|work=[[USA Today]] Today In The Sky|date= November 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, a month after mass grounding of aircraft, American announced capacity cuts and fees to increase revenue and help cover high fuel prices. The airline increased fees such as a $15 charge for the first checked bag and $25 for the second, as well as a $150 change fee for domestic reservations. American's regional airline, [[American Eagle Airlines]], will retire 35-to-40 regional jets as well as its Saab turboprop fleet.

On July 2, 2008, American announced furloughs of up to 950 flight attendants, via Texas' [[Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;warna&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/070308dnbusaaflightattendants.172cf18b.html|title=American Airlines' parent AMR to cut 6,500 or more jobs|date=July 3, 2008|first=Terry|last=Maxon|work=The [[Dallas Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This furlough is in addition to the furlough of 20 MD-80 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;md80era&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/368286_air25.html|title=Aerospace Notebook: MD-80 era winding down as fuel costs rise|first=James|last=Wallace|date=June 24, 2008|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American's hub at San Juan, Puerto Rico's Luiz Muñoz Marin International Airport, will be truncated from 38 to 18 daily inbound flights, but the carrier will retain service in a [[focus city|diminished capacity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;caribbeancuts&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2008-06-16-flight-cuts-caribbean_N.htm|title=Flight cuts may hurt Caribbean tourism|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 16, 2008|first=Danica|last=Coto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:aa b767-300er n363aa arp.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300]]ER taking off]]
On August 13, 2008, ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' reported that American would move some overhaul work from its [[Kansas City, Missouri]], base. Repairs on [[Boeing 757]]s will be made in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], and some 767 maintenance will move there as well; one, possibly two, Boeing 767 repair lines will be retained at [[Kansas City International Airport]]. The narrow-body repair hangar will be shut. The city's aviation department offered to upgrade repair facilities on condition that the airline maintain at least 700 jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcjobs&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1825603/|title=Up to 600 jobs in jeopardy at overhaul base|work=Kansas City Star|date=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, rumors of a merger with [[US Airways]] resurfaced to much speculation within the online aviation community. 

In August 2009, American was placed under credit watch, along with United Airlines and US Airways.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} All Airbus A300 jets were retired by the end of August and are currently stored in [[Roswell, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/American%20Airlines-stored-a300.htm American Airlines Fleet of A300 (Stored) | Airfleets aviation].

On October 28, 2009, American notified its employees that it would close its Kansas City maintenance base in September 2010, and would also close or make cutbacks at five smaller maintenance stations, resulting in the loss of up to 700 jobs.&lt;ref name='TW20091028'&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Koenig |title=American Airlines will close Kansas City base |date=2009-10-28 |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=45&amp;articleid=20091028_45_0_hrimgs266815 |work=[[Associated Press]] in [[Tulsa World]] |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July 2010, it was reported that American Airlines was trying to find buyers for its regional airline American Eagle. The move followed Delta Air Lines and its spin off of its wholly owned regional airlines [[Compass Airlines (North America)|Compass Airlines]] and [[Mesaba Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pilots-on-potential-sale-of-american-eagle-we-are-crucial-to-the-future-of-our-airline-2010-07-02?reflink=MW_news_stmp MarketWatch.com].

====MD-80 maintenance controversies====
[[File:AARDUT.jpg|thumb|left| [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[MD-82]] at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]]]]
American Airlines has had repeated run-ins with the FAA regarding maintenance of its [[MD-80]] fleet; the costs associated with operating these jets has affected American's bottom line. American Airlines canceled 1,000 flights to inspect wire bundles over three days in April 2008 to make sure they complied with government safety regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;md80s&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24029455/|title=American’s MD-80s cleared to fly again|agency=Associated Press|date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused significant inconvenience to passengers and financial problems for the airline. American has begun the process of replacing its older MD-80 jets with Boeing 737s. The newer MD-80s will continue to serve until the next generation Boeing narrowbody aircraft ([[Boeing Y1]]) is available.

In September 2009, the [[Associated Press]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that American was accused of hiding repeated maintenance lapses on at least 16 MD-80s from the FAA. Repair issues included such items as faulty emergency slides, improper engine coatings, incorrectly drilled holes and other examples of shoddy workmanship. The most serious alleged lapse is a failure to repair cracks to pressure bulkheads; the rupture of a bulkhead could lead to cabin depressurization.

===Environmental record===
The [[Texas Commission on Environmental Quality]] has awarded American Airlines its 2005 Governor's Award for its outstanding efforts in [[environmental protection]] and pollution prevention. American Airline's wastewater treatment plant [[recycle]]s water used at the base of the wash aircraft, process rinse water tanks, and irrigates landscape. That alone has saved almost $1 million since 2002. In addition to that, American Airlines has also won the award for the reduction of [[hazardous waste]] that saved them $229,000 after a $2,000 investment. A bar code system used is to track hazardous waste. It has led to reduction of waste by 50 percent since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;envqual&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2006_May_11/ai_n16359869|title=American Airlines Receives Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's Governor's Award|work=Airline Industry Information|date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations occurring over a 4½ year period — from October 1993 to July 1998 — targeted American Airlines for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country.

===Marketing===
====Livery====
American's early [[aircraft livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage. The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

[[File:American Airlines Astrojet N951AA.jpg|thumb|left|A Boeing 737 in the Astrojet livery]]
[[File:aa b767-300er takeoff at manchester arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300ER]] in the current livery takes off from [[Manchester Airport]]]]

In the late 1960s, American commissioned an industrial designer to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple &quot;AA&quot; logo, without an eagle, on the tail. However, American's employees revolted when the livery was made public, and launched a &quot;Save the Eagle&quot; campaign similar to the &quot;Save the Flying Red Horse&quot; campaign at [[Mobil]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Eventually, the designer caved in and created a highly stylized eagle, which remains the company's logo to this day. In 1999, American painted a new [[Boeing 757]] (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. There is a Boeing 737-800 painted in the retro AstroJet livery. One [[Boeing 777]] and one Boeing 757 are painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail, in support for the [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]].

American is the only major U.S. airline that leaves the majority of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://industry.bnet.com/travel/1000148/paint-vs-bare-metal-on-airplanes/ Delta, Air Canada Among Carriers Weighing Benefit of Paint Stripping]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Air Lines]], [[US Airways]], [[Flying Tigers]], [[Dominicana de Aviación|Dominicana]], [[Cathay Pacific Cargo]] and [[Northwest Airlines]] have also maintained unpainted airplanes.
[[File:Shuttle Enterprise at Ellington Airfield 1978 5.jpg|thumb|[[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|SCA N905NA]] in 1978, with American pinstriping]]

[[NASA]]'s [[Boeing 747]] [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], with the registry N905NA, originally belonged to American Airlines, and in its early years still bore the distinct American pinstriping. By the early 1980s, however, NASA decided to discontinue using the American livery and replaced it with its own livery, consisting of a white fuselage and blue pinstriping.

American Airlines serves four continents, trailing [[Continental Airlines]] that serves five, and [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[United Airlines]] that both serve six. Hubs at Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami serve as gateways to the Americas, while American's Chicago hub has become the airline's primary gateway to Europe and Asia. New York Kennedy (JFK) is a primary gateway for both the Americas and Europe, while the Los Angeles hub (LAX) is the primary gateway to the Asia/Pacific. [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] has served as a regional as well for several years. However, the airline's 2009 restructuring led to the airport being removed as a focus city on April 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/item.aspx?type=blog&amp;ak=68499380.blog |title=Aviation Photos &amp; Video |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; American serves the third largest number of international destinations, after [[Continental Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]].

American is the only U.S. airline with scheduled flights to [[Anguilla]], [[Bolivia]], [[Dominica]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Uruguay]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

American has begun to expand in Asia, with mixed success. In 2005, American re-introduced a non-stop flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to [[Kansai International Airport|Osaka-Kansai]], which has since been discontinued. American also launched non-stop service from Chicago to [[Chūbu Centrair International Airport|Nagoya-Centrair]], but that too ended within a year. Also in 2005, American launched service from Chicago to [[Delhi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;delhi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com/content/amrcorp/pressReleases/2005_07/12_delhi.jhtml|title=American Airlines Introduces Non-Stop Service To Delhi|date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, American began service from Chicago to [[Shanghai]]. However, in October 2006, American ceased its San Jose, California to Tokyo-Narita service, leaving LAX as American's sole international gateway on the West Coast. American planned flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Beijing via Chicago-O'Hare (on Westbound only) in 2007 but lost its bid to United Airlines' [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles]] to Beijing route. AA was granted permission in September 2007 to start a Chicago-Beijing route in a new set of China routes in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Terry |last=Maxon |title=American Airlines wins Chicago-Beijing route |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/092607dnbusaachina.10b76637e.html |publisher=The Dallas Morning News |month=September |year=2007 |accessdate=26-May-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was originally planned to begin service on April 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AA Receives Tentative Approval to Fly Between Chicago And Beijing, China In 2010 |url=http://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/travelInformation/destinationInformation/chicago_beijing.jsp |publisher=American Airlines |accessdate=26-May-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Airlines then delayed the launched for the Beijing flight to May 1, 2010 due to rising fuel prices and the weak economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=45&amp;articleid=20091001_45_E3_Travel77751&amp;rss_lnk=5 American seeking Beijing flight delay]&lt;/ref&gt; After numerous delays, the airline finally announced that it will launch flights to the Chinese capital on April 26, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/American-Airlines-Moves-Up-prnews-266897681.html?x=0&amp;.v=1 American Airlines Moves Up Launch Date for New Service to China]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of a lack of proper landing clearance from the Chinese government, the airline was forced to cancel its inaugural flight from Chicago to Beijing tentatively until at least May 4, 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The airline launched service to Beijing on May 25, 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. 
As stated above, AA has also applied for and won service between New York and Tokyo Haneda Airport, and between Los Angeles and Shanghai Pudong Airport-that which began on February 18, 2011 and April 5, 2011, respectively.

===Codeshare agreements===
In addition to its [[Oneworld]] alliance codeshares, American has signed agreements to codeshare with certain other airlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/codesharePartners/flightrange.jsp Codeshare Partners] on AA.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Airlines 767-200 N324AA.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-200ER]]]]
As of December 2010, the American Airlines fleet consists of 621 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/American%20Airlines.htm American Airlines Fleet Information – Airfleets.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007 the airline announced it would offer [[Wi-Fi]] internet services on [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-200ER]] American Flagship Service (AFS) routes across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/08/07/215881/american-airlines-to-launch-wi-fi-wireless-in-usa-next.html www.flightglobal.com], 8 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2008, American Airlines became the first to offer full inflight internet service.&lt;ref name=&quot;gogo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com/content/amrcorp/pressReleases/2008_08/20_gogo.jhtml|title=AA First to Feature GoGo Inflight Internet|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, American announced plans to order the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.&lt;ref name=&quot;b787&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=American Airlines Takes Major Fleet Renewal Step By Announcing Plans To Acquire Boeing 787-9 Dreamline|url=http://www.aa.com/content/amrcorp/pressReleases/2008_10/15_787.jhtml|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American is the largest operator of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]], with some 225 of the type in service. As part of its fleet renewal plan, American is replacing one fourth of its MD-80s with the Boeing 737-800, which offers a 35 percent increase per-seat mileage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David|last=Koenig|title=American Airlines unveils newest jet in fleet|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2009031988_apamericanairlinesnewjets.html|publisher=The Seattle Times|month=April|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest will eventually be replaced by Boeing's next generation narrow body aircraft, the [[Boeing Y1]], which may not be until 2020 or later. American Airlines has stated that they have MD-80 leases running until as late as 2024.

In August 2009, American officially retired its fleet of Airbus A300 aircraft, after 21 years of service. American has not made plans to replace this fleet.
On Jan.19 2011 American Airlines announced that it would order 2 [[Boeing 777#777-300ER|Boeing 777-300ER]]s, and will become the first American carrier to operate Boeing 777-300ER.
The [[List of Boeing customer codes|Boeing customer codes]] for American Airlines is 7x7-x23. (i.e. 737-823, 777-223)

===Current===
American Airlines had an average fleet age of 14.5 years in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/ageflotte/American%20Airlines.htm American Airlines Average Fleet Age]&lt;/ref&gt; American Airlines operates an all-Boeing fleet (including aircraft produced by McDonnell Douglas before it merged with Boeing in 1997), one of only two legacy carriers which have such a fleet, the other being Continental Airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/history/chronology/chron16.html |title=Boeing Chronology 1997-2001 |publisher=Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shuttle Enterprise at Ellington Airfield 1978 4.jpg|thumb|Former AA 747-100 carrying the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise]]]]
Notes:
* Eight [[Boeing 377]]s and seven [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed L-049 Constellations]] served in American Overseas Airways transatlantic service and were acquired by [[Pan American World Airways]].
* In early 1970 before AA took delivery of its own Boeing 747, the company leased 2 Pan Am 747-121s (N740PA &amp; N743PA). These aircraft were painted in full AA livery, and were operated until early 1971, then returned to Pan Am after AA received its own new 747-123s.
* After American acquired Trans Caribbean in 1971, the company briefly owned TC's fleet of five DC-8s (3 -50s &amp; 2 -61s). These aircraft were never operated by AA and were sold to other carriers.
* Most [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]]s were retired from passenger service in the late 1970s and served as freighters until their final retirement in 1985. Several were retired earlier; [[NASA]] acquired one of the early retired aircraft, N905NA, in 1974 and has since used it as a [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]]. Early in its NASA career, the aircraft continued to carry the American Airlines tricolor cheatline. One [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]] was used in the film [[Airport 1975]], registration number N9675, which was delivered to the carrier in 1971. The aircraft was redressed in the &quot;Columbia Airlines&quot; livery for this film. American flew the aircraft both as a passenger jet and later as a freighter only, under the &quot;American Freighter&quot; titles. The aircraft has been in storage at Roswell since 2005 under registration number N675UP, in UPS colors, its last operator.

* American briefly operated one [[Boeing 747#747-200|Boeing 747-273C]] freighter N749WA (serial nunber 20653/ line number 237) in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b747-20653.htm Airfleets.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

* American Airlines retired their Airbus A300s in August 2009 after 21 years of service and they are now stored in Roswell, NM. One American A300 was scrapped at Victorville Airport in March 2009, its tail number was N7055A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airport-data.com/aircraft/N7055A.html Aircraft N7055A, 1988 Airbus A300B4-605R C/N 462]. Airport-data.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

*21 [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-100/200/300]]s and 8 [[BAe 146]] aircraft operated between 1987 and 1992 were acquired with the assets of [[Air California]] and primarily operated from AA's hub at [[San Jose International Airport]]. Eight 737-3A4s that were once operated by American Airlines are now operated by [[Southwest Airlines]] and as of 2010, N679AA is the only remaining former Air Cal/AA 737-3A4 in service by Southwest.
* In addition to original run MD-80 series aircraft, American also operated 28 [[Boeing 717]] aircraft acquired from [[Trans World Airlines]] between 2001 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/American%20Airlines-history-b717.htm Airfleets.net]&lt;/ref&gt; American also briefly owned five [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-87s]] and five [[McDonnell Douglas MD-90|MD-90s]] acquired from [[Reno Air]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/American%20Airlines-history-md80.htm Airfleets.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

== On-board service ==
On domestic flights and flights to Canada, Central America, and areas in the Caribbean (including the Dominican Republic), American Airlines offers a [[buy on board]] program offering sandwiches and snacks for purchase. Flights two hours or longer have snacks, and flights three hours or longer have sandwiches. Transcontinental flights and Hawaii flights have the &quot;Premium Sandwich and Chip Combo&quot; for purchase. Buy on board service to Central America (From Miami) and the Dominican Republic began on March 1, 2009. American will continue to offer free coach meals on flights to Europe, Haiti,&lt;!--Haiti IS exempt from the rest of the Caribbean--&gt; Japan, Venezuela, and other destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;AANCar&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/travelInformation/duringFlight/dining/domesticMealService.jsp North America And Caribbean Meal Service].&quot; ''American Airlines''.

Retrieved February 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In First and Business classes, on all domestic flights of two hours or more that operate within a traditional meal time, full meal service is included. Flights with a duration longer than two and one half hours that do not fall within a meal time have snack service for those classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AANCar&quot;/&gt; First Class and Business Class passengers receive alcoholic beverages for free. Non-alcoholic beverages are free for all classes. Alcoholic drinks are available for purchase, even during international flights on New Year's Eve.

However, in February 2010 American Airlines announced that it would eliminate free blankets in coach and sell an $8 packet that includes a pillow and blanket starting May 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/passengers-must-pay-for-blankets-on-american/ Intransit.blogs.nytimes.com], ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== AAdvantage ==
[[File:AAdvantage logo.svg|thumb]]

[[AAdvantage]] is the frequent flyer program of American Airlines.

==Admirals Club==
[[File:AA Admirals Club.png|left|thumb|163px]]
The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing gimmick shortly after he was made an honorary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]. Inspired by the [[Kentucky colonel]]s and other [[Title of honor|honorary]] organizations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers &quot;admirals&quot; of the &quot;Flagship fleet&quot; (AA called its aircraft &quot;Flagships&quot; at the time). The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians and other VIPs, as well as more &quot;ordinary&quot; customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.

There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the &quot;Admirals Club&quot; in 1939.

The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the Club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their own liquor at the airport. For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeac&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Toward Equality for VIPs|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|work=[[TIME]]|date=1966-07-15|accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.

Membership now costs $300 to $450 a year, depending on AAdvantage frequent flyer program level (and annual renewal membership costs $250–$400); membership can also be purchased with AAdvantage miles. As of December 2010, passengers can buy a 24-hour pass for $59.

===Flagship Lounge===
Though affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the AA Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying on premium flights both within the United States and internationally. This means that only First Class passengers on 3-class aircraft, both Internationally and Transcontinentally, are granted entrance to these clubs. A 3-class aircraft operating a non-transcon AFS flight and not sold as 3-class is not considered Premium, and entrance is not granted to passengers on this type of service. Lounge access is granted to passengers on non-AA operated flights flown by select airline partners as well, again, as long as the flight has a true International First Class cabin and the passenger is booked in that class as a paying customer or on a premium cabin frequent flyer award ticket (not as an upgrade). The only exception to this rule is for OneWorld Emerald elite FF members (including AA Executive Platinum) on international flights (excluding Canada, the Caribbean, and Mexico except Mexico City), and non-AAdvantage OneWorld Emerald elite FF members on 'domestic' flights, who are granted access to the lounges travelling in any class.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/travelInformation/airportAmenities/AdmiralsLoungeAccess.jsp Admirals Club ( R ) Lounge Access]&lt;/ref&gt;

The added amenities of the Flagship Lounges compared to the normal Admirals Club include free alcoholic beverages including premium brands not found in the Admirals Club, free premium buffet snacks including breakfast items, salads, sandwiches, fruits, chocolates, cheeses and other light fare (options change based on time of day), as well as a less crowded, more comfortable lounge space. Additionally, complimentary [[Lenovo]] computer terminals with free internet access, complimentary [[T-Mobile]] hotspot access, and complimentary printing is available at most locations, as are shower facilities.

The first Flagship Lounge was opened at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport as a courtesy to First Class customers preparing for long flights to London and Tokyo. While the Dallas lounge is no longer open, Flagship Lounges are now available at four airports: Chicago-O'Hare, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles and New York-JFK.

{{Trivia|date=March 2009}}
* AA lobbied heavily to be assigned the IATA airline code ''US'' when the [[U.S. military]] released it for non-military use. However, [[USAir]] ultimately won the bid for the ''US'' airliner code.{{When|date=July 2010}}
* AA is the only Big Five [[legacy carrier]] in the United States which has not filed for [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] protection.
* AA has its name on two major U.S. venues, [[American Airlines Center]] in Dallas, home to the [[Dallas Mavericks|Mavericks]] basketball team and [[Dallas Stars]] ice hockey team, and [[American Airlines Arena]] in Miami, home to the [[Miami Heat]] basketball team. When the Heat and Mavericks played each other in the [[2006 NBA Finals]], it was referred to as the &quot;American Airlines series.&quot;
* American Airlines has a Broadway Theatre called the &quot;[[American Airlines Theatre]]&quot; on 42nd Street in New York City.
* AA plays a key role in the first two films of the [[Home Alone (film series)|''Home Alone series'']].
* American Airlines is also featured in the movie ''[[L.A. Story]]'' at the point in which Harris K. Telemacher's love interest, Sara, a journalist from London, tries to fly home.
* AA appears in the movie ''[[Up in the Air (film)|Up in the Air]]'', starring [[George Clooney]], in which it and [[Hilton Hotels]] received free publicity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew Adam |last=Newman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/21/business/media/21adco.html |title=A Dream for an Airline and a Hotel Chain |publisher= New York Times |date=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the movie juxtaposes human bonds with corporate loyalty, such as bonus programs for frequent travelers.
* An AA rebranding effort is a brief subplot in ''[[Mad Men]]''.
* An American Airlines DC-2 is the setting for Shirley Temple to sing, &quot;[[On the Good Ship Lollipop]]&quot; in the film ''[[Bright Eyes (film)|Bright Eyes]]'' while James Dunn is taxiing the plane around the airport. Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;good ship Lollipop&quot; refers to an airplane, not a seagoing ship. The film contains some fine aeronautical footage of the DC-2 and the contemporary [[Curtiss Condor]] airliner.
* The nose section of an American Airlines DC-7 is displayed at the [[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]]
*  In the film [[Silent Running]] the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; is labeled as an American Airlines Space Freighter.

[[Image:Venlafaxine-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|The chemical structure of [[venlafaxine]] (Effexor), an [[Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRI]]]]
An '''antidepressant''' is a [[psychiatric medication]] used to alleviate [[mood disorder]]s, such as [[major depression]] and [[dysthymia]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s such as [[social anxiety disorder]]. According to Gelder, Mayou &amp;*Geddes (2005) people with a depressive illness will experience a therapeutic effect to their mood, however this will not be experienced in healthy individuals. Drugs including the [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs), [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), [[tetracyclic antidepressant]]s (TeCAs), [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), and [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) are most commonly associated with the term. These medications are among those most commonly prescribed by [[psychiatrist]]s and other physicians, and their effectiveness and adverse effects are the subject of many studies and competing claims. Many drugs produce an antidepressant effect, but restrictions on their use have caused controversy and off-label prescription a risk, despite claims of superior efficacy.

A review of all studies ever submitted to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of 12 anti-depressants, published and unpublished, was submitted to the FDA in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R 2008 252–60&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R |title=Selective publication of antidepressant trials and its influence on apparent efficacy |journal=N.

This increased the apparent efficacy of different anti-depressants from between 11% to 69% over placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R 2008 252–60&quot;/&gt; Possible exceptions are [[mirtazapine]] - a norepinephrine and serotonin antagonist - and [[venlafaxine]], an SNRI with substantial similarity in chemical structure to the opioid derivative [[tramadol]]. A separate study concluded that the difference in effect between [[active placebo]]s and several anti-depressants appeared small and strongly affected by [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R 2008 252–60&quot;/&gt;

[[Opioids]] were used to treat major depression until the late 1950s. [[Amphetamine]]s were used until the mid 1960s. Prescribing opioids or amphetamines for depression falls into a legal grey area. Research has only rarely been conducted in to the therapeutic potential of opioid derivatives for depression in the past sixty years, whereas amphetamines have found a thriving market for conditions as widely arrayed as [[attention deficit disorder]], [[narcolepsy]], and [[obesity]], and continue to be studied for myriad applications. Both opioids and amphetamines induce a therapeutic response very quickly, showing results within twenty-four to forty-eight hours; the [[therapeutic ratio]]s for both opioids and amphetamines are greater than those of the tricyclic anti-depressants. In some of this little, heavily restricted research, the opioid [[buprenorphine]] has shown the greatest potential for treating severe, treatment-resistant depression of any known pharmaceutical in a small study that is generally recognized and was published in 1995, but has never been pursued due to the social stigma attached to opioids in addition to that attached to mental illness in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bodkin | first1 = JA.

Most typical antidepressants have a delayed onset of action (2–6 weeks) and are usually administered for anywhere from months to years. Despite the name, antidepressants are often used controversially, and with a dearth of empirical evidence to support their indication, off-label to treat other conditions, such as [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[chronic pain]], and some hormone-mediated disorders such as [[dysmenorrhea]]. Alone or together with [[anticonvulsant]]s (e.g., Tegretol or Depakote), these medications can be used to treat [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and [[substance abuse]] by addressing underlying depression. Also, antidepressants have been used sometimes to treat [[snoring]] and [[migraines]].

Other medications that are not usually called antidepressants, including [[antipsychotics]] in low doses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0512 |author=Wheeler Vega JA, Mortimer AM, Tyson PJ |title=Conventional antipsychotic prescription in unipolar depression, I: an audit and recommendations for practice |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=568–74 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12755661 |url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/abstracts/abstracts.asp?abstract=200305/050311.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[benzodiazepines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Petty F, Trivedi MH, Fulton M, Rush AJ |title=Benzodiazepines as antidepressants: does GABA play a role in depression? |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=578–91 |year=1995 |month=November |pmid=8573660 |doi=10.1016/0006-3223(95)00049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be used to manage depression, although benzodiazepines cause a physical dependence to form. Stopping benzodiazepine treatment abruptly can cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. An extract of the herb [[St John's Wort]] is commonly used as an antidepressant, although it is labeled as a [[dietary supplement]] in some countries. The term ''antidepressant'' is sometimes applied to any therapy (e.g., [[psychotherapy]], [[electro-convulsive therapy]], [[acupuncture]]) or process (e.g., sleep disruption, increased light levels, regular exercise) found to improve a clinically depressed mood.

Inert [[placebo]]s can have significant antidepressant effects, and so to establish a substance as an &quot;antidepressant&quot; in a [[clinical trial]] it is necessary to show superior efficacy to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://healthlifeandstuff.com/2009/07/do-we-know-anything-about-antidepressants/ Do Antidepressants Work as Promised?]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of antidepressants}}

===Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors===
''[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s'' (SSRIs) are a class of antidepressants considered the current standard of drug treatment. A possible cause of depression is an inadequate amount of [[serotonin]], a chemical used in the brain to transmit signals between neurons. SSRIs are said to work by preventing the reuptake of serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) by the presynaptic neuron, thus maintaining higher levels of 5-HT in the synapse. Chemists [[Klaus Schmiegel]] and Bryan Molloy of Eli Lilly discovered the first SSRI, fluoxetine.  This class of drugs includes:

*[[Citalopram]] (Celexa, Cipramil)
*[[Escitalopram]] (Lexapro, Cipralex, Seroplex, Lexamil)
*[[Fluoxetine]] (Prozac, Sarafem, Symbyax)
*[[Fluvoxamine]] (Luvox)
*[[Paroxetine]] (Paxil, Aropax)
*[[Sertraline]] (Zoloft)
These antidepressants typically have fewer adverse effects than the tricyclics or the MAOIs, although such effects as drowsiness, dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, decreased appetite, long-term weight gain and decreased ability to function sexually may occur. Some side effects may decrease as a person adjusts to the drug, but other side effects may be persistent.

Work by two researchers has called into question the link between serotonin deficiency and symptoms of depression, noting that the efficacy of SSRIs as treatment does not in itself prove the link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lacasse J, Leo J |title=Serotonin and depression: a disconnect between the advertisements and the scientific literature |journal=PLoS Med |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e392 |year=2005 |pmid=16268734 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392 |pmc=1277931}} ''[http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392 Full text]''&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that these drugs may interact with transcription factors known as &quot;[[clock genes]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Uz T, Ahmed R, Akhisaroglu M, Kurtuncu M, Imbesi M, Dirim Arslan A, Manev H |title=Effect of fluoxetine and cocaine on the expression of clock genes in the mouse hippocampus and striatum |journal=Neuroscience |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=1309–16 |year=2005 |pmid=15994025 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may play a role in the addictive properties of drugs (drug abuse), and possibly in obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Yuferov V, Butelman E, Kreek M |title=Biological clock: biological clocks may modulate drug addiction |journal=Eur J Hum Genet |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1101–3 |year=2005 |pmid=16094306 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Manev H, Uz T |title=Clock genes as a link between addiction and obesity |journal=Eur J Hum Genet |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=5 |year=2006 |pmid=16288309 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic review of [[randomized controlled trials]] published in the Archives of General Psychiatry showed that up to one-third of the 6-week effect of SSRI Treatment can be seen in the first week. The same study also found that patients treated with SSRIs were 64% more likely to achieve a 50% absolute reduction in [[Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression|HRSD]] than patients given a placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Taylor MJ, Freemantle N, Geddes JR, Bhagwagar Z |title=Early Onset of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressant Action |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1217–23 |year=2005 |pmid=17088502 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.11.1217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===
''[[Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s'' (SNRIs) are a newer form of antidepressant that work on both norepinephrine and 5-HT. They typically have similar side effects to the SSRIs, though there may be a withdrawal syndrome on discontinuation that may necessitate dosage tapering.  These include:

*[[Desvenlafaxine]] (Pristiq)
*[[Duloxetine]] (Cymbalta)
*[[Milnacipran]] (Ixel)
*[[Venlafaxine]] (Effexor)

===Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants===
[[Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]]s (NaSSAs) form a newer class of antidepressants which purportedly work to increase norepinephrine ([[noradrenaline]]) and serotonin neurotransmission by blocking presynaptic alpha-2 [[adrenergic receptor]]s while at the same time blocking certain serotonin receptors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnsforum.com/imagebank/item/Drug_nassa/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Side effects may include drowsiness, increased appetite, and weight gain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stimmel&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stimmel |first=GL|year=1997|month=Jan-Feb|title=Mirtazapine: an antidepressant with noradrenergic and specific serotonergic effects|journal=Pharmacotherapy|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10–21|publisher=American College of Clinical Pharmacy|issn=0277-0008|pmid=9017762|accessdate=2009-05-28|last2=Dopheide|first2=JA|last3=Stahl|first3=SM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*[[Mianserin]] (Tolvon)
*[[Mirtazapine]] (Remeron, Avanza, Zispin)

===Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors===
''[[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor]]s'' (NRIs) act via norepinephrine (also known as ''noradrenaline''). NRIs are thought to have a positive effect on the concentration and motivation in particular.  These include:

*[[Atomoxetine]] (Strattera)
*[[Mazindol]] (Mazanor, Sanorex)
*[[Reboxetine]] (Edronax)
*[[Viloxazine]] (Vivalan)

===Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors===
''[[Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s'' inhibit the neuronal reuptake of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stahl|first=SM|year=2004|title=A Review of the Neuropharmacology of Bupropion, a Dual Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor|journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=4|pages=159–166|publisher=Physicians Postgraduate Press|pmc=514842|accessdate=2009-05-28|doi=10.4088/PCC.v06n0403|pmid=15361919|last2=Pradko|first2=JF|last3=Haight|first3=BR|last4=Modell|first4=JG|last5=Rockett|first5=CB|last6=Learned-Coughlin|first6=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

*[[Bupropion]] (Wellbutrin, Zyban)

===Selective serotonin reuptake enhancers===

*[[Tianeptine]] (Stablon, Coaxil, Tatinol)

===Norepinephrine-dopamine disinhibitors===
[[Norepinephrine-dopamine disinhibitor]]s (NDDIs) act by antagonizing the serotonin [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] which normally acts to inhibit norepinephrine and dopamine release, thereby promoting outflow of these neurotransmitters.

*[[Agomelatine]] (Valdoxan, Melitor, Thymanax)

===Tricyclic antidepressants===
''[[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s'' are the oldest class of antidepressant drugs.  Tricyclics block the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and serotonin. They are used less commonly now due to the development of more selective and safer drugs. Side effects include increased [[heart]] rate, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, and sexual dysfunction. Toxicity occurs at approximately ten times normal dosages; these drugs are often lethal in overdoses, as they may cause a fatal arrhythmia. However, tricyclic antidepressants are still used because of their effectiveness, especially in severe cases of major depression.  These include:

'''Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants''':

*[[Amitriptyline]] (Elavil, Endep)
*[[Clomipramine]] (Anafranil)
*[[Doxepin]] (Adapin, Sinequan)
*[[Imipramine]] (Tofranil)
*[[Trimipramine]] (Surmontil)

'''Secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants'''

*[[Desipramine]] (Norpramin)
*[[Nortriptyline]] (Pamelor, Aventyl, Noritren)
*[[Protriptyline]] (Vivactil)

===Monoamine oxidase inhibitor===
''[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s'' (MAOIs) may be used if other antidepressant medications are ineffective. MAOIs work by blocking the enzyme monoamine oxidase which breaks down the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Because there are potentially fatal interactions between this class of medication and certain foods (particularly those containing [[tyramine]]), as well as certain drugs, classic MAOIs are rarely prescribed anymore. However, this does not apply to [[Emsam]], the [[transdermal patch]] form of [[selegiline]], which due to its bypassing of the stomach has a lesser propensity to induce such events.&lt;ref name=Cascade01&gt;
{{Cite journal

|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAOIs can be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants, although they are generally used less frequently because they have a higher incidence of dangerous side effects and interactions. A new generation of MAOIs has been introduced; [[moclobemide]] (Manerix), known as a [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA), acts in a more short-lived and selective manner and does not require a special diet. The MAOI group of medicines include:

*[[Isocarboxazid]] (Marplan)
*[[Moclobemide]] (Aurorix, Manerix)
*[[Phenelzine]] (Nardil)
*[[Selegiline]] (Eldepryl, Emsam)
*[[Tranylcypromine]] (Parnate)

===Augmenter drugs===
Some antidepressants have been found to work better in some patients when used in combination with another drug. Such &quot;augmenter&quot; drugs include:

*[[Buspirone]] (Buspar)
*[[Gepirone]] (Ariza)
*[[Nefazodone]] (Serzone)
*[[Tandospirone]] (Sediel)
*[[Trazodone]] (Desyrel)
*[[Bupropion]] (Wellbutrin/Zyban)

''[[Tranquillizer]]s and [[sedative]]s'', typically the benzodiazepines, are prescribed to ease anxiety and promote sleep. Because of the high risk of dependency, these medications are intended only for short-term or occasional use. Medications are often used not for their primary functions, but to exploit what are normally [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]]. [[Quetiapine]] fumarate (Seroquel) is designed primarily to treat [[schizophrenia]] and bipolar disorder, but frequently causes [[somnolence]] because of its affinity for histamine (H1 and H2) receptors, exploiting the same side effects as [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl).

''[[Antipsychotic]]s'' such as [[risperidone]] (Risperdal), [[olanzapine]] (Zyprexa), and [[quetiapine]] (Seroquel) are prescribed as mood stabilizers and to treat anxiety. Their use as mood stabilizers is a recent phenomenon, and controversial among some patients.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Antipsychotics, whether typical or atypical, may also be prescribed to augment an antidepressant, to increase the blood concentration of another drug, or to relieve the [[psychotic]] or [[Paranoia|paranoid]] symptoms that often accompany clinical depression. However, they can cause serious side effects, particularly at high dosages, including [[blurred vision]], muscle spasms, restlessness, [[tardive dyskinesia]], and weight gain.

[[Psychostimulants]] are sometimes added to an antidepressant regimen if the patient suffers from [[anhedonia]], [[hypersomnia]] and/or excessive eating as well as low motivation. These symptoms are common in [[atypical depression]], and can be resolved by adding low to moderate doses of [[amphetamine]] (Adderall), [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin) or [[modafinil]] (Provigil, Alertec), as these chemicals can enhance motivation and social behavior, and suppress appetite and sleep. [[Modafinil]] is unique in its effect on sleep: it increases alertness and reduces drowsiness while the patient is active, but does not inhibit normal sleep. These medications can also restore sexual drive, although this is a negative side effect and not a reason for the prescription of psychostimulants. Extreme caution must be used however with certain populations. Stimulants are known to trigger manic episodes in people suffering from bipolar disorder. Close supervision of those with substance abuse disorders is urged. Emotionally labile patients should avoid stimulants, as they exacerbate mood shifting. &lt;!-- reverted edit from 'liable' back to 'labile', however unless 'labile' has specific meaning within this context, may be worth changing to the more common 'unstable' --&gt;

''[[Lithium pharmacology|Lithium]]'' remains the standard treatment for bipolar disorder and is often used in conjunction with other medications, depending on whether mania or depression is being treated. Lithium's potential side effects include thirst, [[tremor]]s, light-headedness, [[nausea]], and [[diarrhea]]. Some of the [[anticonvulsants]], such as [[carbamazepine]] (Tegretol), [[sodium valproate]] (Epilim), and [[lamotrigine]] (Lamictal), are also used as mood stabilizers, particularly in bipolar disorder. Both lithium and lamotrigine have also been studied and used to augment antidepressants in treatment-resistant unipolar depression.

===Herbal ===
[[St. John's Wort]] is by far the most widely-used and well-studied herbal antidepressant.  A number of other herbs have been used traditionally to treat depression and related ailments like anxiety, but the research on most of these treatments is sparse.

[[Saffron]] (''Crocus sativus L.'') has been found in a double-blind randomized clinical trial to be equally effective with imipramine for treating mild to moderate depression; the study also remarked that anticholinergic side effects were more frequent in the imipramine treatment group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/4/12 Shahin Akhondzadeh et. al., &quot;Comparison of Crocus sativus L. and imipramine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression: A pilot double-blind randomized trial&quot;, ''BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine'', 2004..]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another 8-week double-blind randomized trial found saffron to have a similar effect to fluoxetine (Prozac) in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, including a similar remission rate and similar rate of side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Akhondzadehbasti |first1=A |last2=Moshiri |first2=E |last3=Noorbala |first3=A |last4=Jamshidi |first4=A |last5=Abbasi |first5=S |last6=Akhondzadeh |first6=S |title=Comparison of petal of Crocus sativus L. and fluoxetine in the treatment of depressed outpatients: A pilot double-blind randomized trial |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=439–42 |year=2007 |pmid=17174460 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lavender]], ''Lavandula angustifolia'', has been traditionally used to treat depression, although until recently there was little research on this plant.  A 2003 double-blind, randomized clinical trial compared lavender to imipramine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, testing both each treatments individually, and a combination of the two.  Lavender was found to be less effective than imipramine, but the combination of both treatments was found to be more effective than either alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Akhondzadeh |first1=S |last2=Kashani |first2=L |last3=Fotouhi |first3=A |last4=Jarvandi |first4=S |last5=Mobaseri |first5=M |last6=Moin |first6=M |last7=Khani |first7=M |last8=Jamshidi |first8=AH |last9=Baghalian |first9=K |title=Comparison of Lavandula angustifolia Mill. tincture and imipramine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression: a double-blind, randomized trial |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=123–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12551734 |doi=10.1016/S0278-5846(02)00342-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several plants in the ''Salvia'' genus have been studied for antidepressant properties, although most of the research conducted so far has only been from mice and rat studies.  [[Salvia elegans]], also known as pineapple sage, is widely used in Mexican traditional medicine, and has been found in single study in mice to have antidepressant and antianxiety properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herreraruiz |first1=M |last2=Garciabeltran |first2=Y |last3=Mora |first3=S |last4=Diazveliz |first4=G |last5=Viana |first5=G |last6=Tortoriello |first6=J |last7=Ramirez |first7=G |title=Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of hydroalcoholic extract from Salvia elegans☆ |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=53–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16530995 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Salvia sclarea]], also known as clary, is known to have an antidepressant-like effect in rats, which is thought to be explained by modulation of dopamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seol |first1=Geun Hee |last2=Shim |first2=Hyun Soo |last3=Kim |first3=Pill-Joo |last4=Moon |first4=Hea Kyung |last5=Lee |first5=Ki Ho |last6=Shim |first6=Insop |last7=Suh |first7=Suk Hyo |last8=Min |first8=Sun Seek |title=Antidepressant-like effect of Salvia sclarea is explained by modulation of dopamine activities in rats |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=187–90 |year=2010 |pmid=20441789 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2010.04.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ocimum tenuiflorum]], also known as Tulsi or holy basil, has been used in [[Ayurveda]] to treat anxiety and depression, and was shown in a clinical study to be effective at treating generalized anxiety disorder and depression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=788038 Hanumanthachar Joshi, Milind Parle, &quot;Evaluation of nootropic potential of Ocimum sanctum Linn. in mice&quot;, ''Indian Journal of Experimental Biology'', Feb. 2006, Vol. 44, No. 2, pp.133-6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wormwood]], ''Artemisia absinthium'', has shown antidepressant effects in mice, similar activity to imipramine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academicjournals.org/AJB/PDF/pdf2009/15Dec/Mahmoudi%20et%20al.pdf Mahmoudi M. et. al., &quot;Antidepressant and antioxidant activities of Artemisia absinthium L. at flowering stage&quot;, ''African Journal of Biotechnology'', Vol. 8, No.24, pp. 7170-7175, Dec. 15, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrients===

[[Nutrition]] has been implicated as one of the causes and risk factors for depression, and accordingly, one approach to depression involves the use of nutritional supplements or changes in diet.  A study of older adults found that poor nutrition was a strong predictor of depressive symptoms a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boult |first1=C |last2=Krinke |first2=UB |last3=Urdangarin |first3=CF |last4=Skarin |first4=V |title=The validity of nutritional status as a marker for future disability and depressive symptoms among high-risk older adults |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=995–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10443862}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few nutrients have been studied directly for their antidepressant properties, both to treat and prevent depression, as well as related conditions such as anxiety.

====Omega-3====

[[Omega 3 fatty acids]] have been proposed as a treatment for depression, often suggested to be combined with other treatments.  One small pilot study of childhood depression (ages 6–12) suggested that omega 3 may have therapeutic benefits for treating childhood depression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/ajp%3B163/6/1098 Hanah Nemetz et. al., &quot;Omega-3 Treatment of Childhood Depression: A Controlled, Double-Blind Pilot Study&quot;, ''Am J Psychiatry'' 163:1098-1100, June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2005 review of the scientific literature concluded that there were several different independent lines of evidence suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids play a role in depression, and that the theory of omega-3's role in depression was biologically plausible.  The evidence includes a few double-blind randomized control trials, epidemiological studies linking low fish consumption (the primary source of omega-3) to increased rates of depression, and case-control and cohort studies of unipolar and postpartum depression indicating low blood levels of omega-3 in depressed patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sontrop |first1=J |last2=Campbell |first2=M |title=ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression: A review of the evidence and a methodological critique |journal=Preventive Medicine |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=4–13 |year=2006 |pmid=16337677 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2005.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====

[[Folic acid]] and [[Vitamin B12]] have also been proposed as a treatment for depression, especially when used in conjunction with other treatments.  In particular, folic acid has been shown to improve the treatment response to other antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jop.sagepub.com/content/19/1/59.short Alec Coppen, &quot;Treatment of depression: time to consider folic acid and vitamin B12&quot;, ''J Psychopharmacol'', Jan. 2005, Vol. 19  No. 1, pp. 59-65.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic efficacy==
There is a large amount of research evaluating the potential therapeutic effects of antidepressants, whether through efficacy studies under experimental conditions (including randomized clinical trials) or through studies of &quot;real world&quot; effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} A sufficient ''response'' to a drug is often defined as at least a 50% reduction in self-reported or observed symptoms, with a ''partial response'' often defined as at least a 25% reduction.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} The term ''remission'' indicates a virtual elimination of depression symptoms, albeit with the risk of a ''recurrence'' of symptoms or complete ''relapse''. Full remission or ''recovery'' signifies a full sustained return to a &quot;normal&quot; psychological state with full functioning.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There has also been a great deal of study about whether antidepressants address the underlying causes of depression.  A 2002 review concluded that there was no evidence that antidepressants reduce the risk of recurrence of depression when their use is terminated.  The authors of this review advocated that antidepressants be combined with therapy, and pointed to Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/pdf/pspi31101.pdf Hollon SD, Thase ME, Markowitz JC. &quot;Treatment and prevention of depression&quot;, ''Psychological Science in the Public Interest'', 2002;3:1–39.]&lt;/ref&gt;

*A review of all antidepressant trials submitted to the U.S. FDA from 1987 to 2004 has shown that around half of the trials failed to show any benefit over placebo. All but one of the successful trial results were published in scientific journals, while nearly all the unsuccessful trials were either not published or were presented in a misleadingly positive light (compared to the FDA's own evaluation of the data). This arose because whilst studies are required for medical approval, studies showing adverse findings are not necessarily required to be published or (if published) given similar prominence. As a result, while it appeared in the research literature that 94 percent of trials had positive outcomes, in the actual data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, only 51 percent did. This [[publication bias]] inflated the apparent statistical effect of every antidepressant studied, by between 11% and 69%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R 2008 252–60&quot;/&gt;
* A meta-analysis by UK, US and Canadian researchers, published in 2008, surveyed all pharmaceutical-company-sponsored drug trials on the six most widely prescribed new-generation antidepressants submitted for approval to the FDA between 1987 and 1999. The results showed, consistent with a prior metaanalysis, that the difference in efficacy between antidepressants and placebo was minimal, but that it increased from virtually no difference at moderate levels of initial depression to a relatively small difference for patients with very severe depression. The difference reached conventional criteria for clinical significance for patients at the upper end of the very severely depressed category, due to a reduction in the efficacy of placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18303940&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT |title=Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |year=2008 |pmid=18303940 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 |pmc=2253608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study received widespread media coverage in some countries, but was met with criticism from the professional community.&lt;ref&gt;K.

*A May 7, 2002 article in [[The Washington Post]] titled &quot;Against Depression, a Sugar Pill Is Hard to Beat&quot; stated, &quot;A new analysis has found that in the majority of trials conducted by drug companies in recent decades, sugar pills have done as well as—or better than—antidepressants. Companies have had to conduct numerous trials to get two that show a positive result, which is the Food and Drug Administration's minimum for approval. What's more, the sugar pills, or placebos, cause profound changes in the same areas of the brain affected by the medicines, according to research published last week...  the makers of Prozac had to run five trials to obtain two that were positive, and the makers of Paxil and Zoloft had to run even more... When Leuchter compared the brain changes in patients on placebos, he was amazed to find that many of them had changes in the same parts of the brain that are thought to control important facets of mood... Once the trial was over and the patients who had been given placebos were told as much, they quickly deteriorated. People's belief in the power of antidepressants may explain why they do well on placebos...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chelationtherapyonline.com/technical/p58.htm Against Depression, a Sugar Pill Is Hard to Beat], The Washington Post, May 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical guidelines===
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depressive Disorder &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidelines.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=2605&amp;nbr=1831 |title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder |publisher=Guidelines.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that, if preferred by the patient, antidepressant medications may be provided as an initial primary treatment for mild major depressive disorder; antidepressant medications should be provided for moderate to severe major depressive disorder unless [[electroconvulsive therapy]] is planned; and a combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications or electroconvulsive therapy should be used for psychotic depression. It states that efficacy is generally comparable between classes and within classes and that the initial selection will largely be based on the anticipated side effects for an individual patient, patient preference, quantity and quality of clinical trial data regarding the medication, and its cost.

The UK [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor; that for moderate or severe depression an SSRI is more likely to be tolerated than a tricyclic; and that antidepressants for severe depression should be combined with a psychological treatment such as [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |title=Depression |publisher=Nice.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficacy limitations and strategies===
Between 30% and 50% of individuals treated with a given antidepressant do not show a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Baghai TC, Möller HJ, Rupprecht R |title=Recent progress in pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options of major depression |journal=Curr.

====&quot;Trial and error&quot; switching====
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant.

A recent meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug, with between 5% and 39% ending treatment due to adverse effects. The more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSRIswitch&quot;/&gt;

====Augmentation and combination====
For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines advise adding a different kind of pharmaceutical agent to the antidepressant. Studies suggest that most patients fail to achieve remission on a given antidepressant, and augmentation strategies used in clinical practice include the use of [[lithium]] and [[thyroid]] augmentation, but there is not a good evidence base for these practices or for more novel strategies such as the use of selective [[dopamine agonists]], [[sex steroids]], [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRI's]], [[glucocorticoid]]-specific agents, or the newer [[anticonvulsants]]&lt;ref name=&quot;augment&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=DeBattista C, Lembke A |title=Update on augmentation of antidepressant response in resistant depression |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=435–40 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16318821 |doi=10.1007/s11920-005-0064-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination strategy involves adding one or more additional antidepressants, usually from different classes so as to have a diverse neurochemical effect. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lam RW, Wan DD, Cohen NL, Kennedy SH |title=Combining antidepressants for treatment-resistant depression: a review |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=685–93 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12197448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long-term use====
The therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of relapse. A recent meta-analysis of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geddes JR, Carney SM, Davies C |title=Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: a systematic review |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9358 |pages=653–61 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12606176 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychiatric Association guidelines advise four to five months of continuation treatment on an antidepressant following the resolution of symptoms. For patients with a history of depressive episodes, the British Association for Psychopharmacology's 2000 Guidelines for Treating Depressive Disorders with Antidepressants advise remaining on an antidepressant for at least six months and as long as five years or indefinitely.

Whether or not someone relapses after stopping an antidepressant does not appear to be related to the duration of prior treatment, however, and gradual loss of therapeutic benefit during the course also occurs. A strategy involving the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode, followed by psychotherapy in its residual phase, has been suggested by some studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fava GA, Park SK, Sonino N |title=Treatment of recurrent depression |journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1735–40 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17144786 |doi=10.1586/14737175.6.11.1735 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Petersen TJ |title=Enhancing the efficacy of antidepressants with psychotherapy |journal=J.

===Medication failure===
Approximately 30% of patients have remission of depression with medications.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16390886&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Trivedi MH, Rush AJ, Wisniewski SR |title=Evaluation of outcomes with citalopram for depression using measurement-based care in STAR*D: implications for clinical practice |journal=The American journal of psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=28–40 |year=2006 |pmid=16390886 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For patients with inadequate response, either adding sustained-release [[bupropion]] (initially {{nowrap|200 mg}} per day then increase by {{nowrap|100 mg}} up to total of {{nowrap|400 mg}} per day) or [[buspirone]] (up to {{nowrap|60 mg}} per day) for augmentation as a second drug can cause remission in approximately 30% of patients,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16554526&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Trivedi MH, Fava M, Wisniewski SR |title=Medication augmentation after the failure of SSRIs for depression |journal=N.

====By pregnancy====
There is uncertainty whether pregnancy contributes to medication failure, because the only report so far has drawn much controversy on itself:

In 2006, a widely reported study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') challenged the common assumption that hormonal changes during pregnancy protected expectant mothers against depression, finding that discontinuing anti-depressive medication during pregnancy led to more frequent relapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Cohen, MD | first =Lee S. | title = Relapse of Major Depression During Pregnancy in Women Who Maintain or Discontinue Antidepressant Treatment | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume =295 | issue = 5 | pages = 499–507 | publisher = American Medical Association | date=  February 1, 2006 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/295/5/499 | accessdate = 2007-06-14 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.5.499 | pmid = 16449615 | last2 = Altshuler | first2 = LL | last3 = Harlow | first3 = BL | last4 = Nonacs | first4 = R | last5 = Newport | first5 = DJ | last6 = Viguera | first6 = AC | last7 = Suri | first7 = R | last8 = Burt | first8 = VK | last9 = Hendrick | first9 = V}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''JAMA'' article did not disclose that several authors had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies making antidepressants. The ''JAMA'' later published a correction noting the ties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Relapse of Major Depression During Pregnancy in Women Who Maintain or Discontinue Antidepressant Treatment—Correction | journal = JAMA | volume = 296 | issue = 2 | page = 170 | date=  July 12, 2006 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/jama;296/2/170 | accessdate = 2007-06-14 | doi = 10.1001/jama.296.2.170}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the authors maintain that the ties have no bearing on their research work. Obstetrician and perinatologist Adam Urato told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that patients and medical professionals need advice free of industry influence.&lt;ref&gt;David Armstrong, &quot;Drug Interactions: Financial Ties to Industry Cloud Major Depression Study At Issue: Whether It's Safe For Pregnant Women To Stay on Medication - JAMA Asks Authors to Explain&quot;. Wall Street Journal. July 11, 2006 ([http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06192/705022-114.stm copy] published on post-gazette.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Several studies have stimulated doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants. A 2002 study cited that the difference between antidepressants and placebo is close to negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=I|year=2002|month=July|title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment|volume=5|issue=1|publisher=American Psychological Association|doi=10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a|accessdate=2009-05-29|last2=Moore|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Scoboria|first3=Alan|last4=Nicholls|first4=Sarah S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request, two psychologists obtained 47 studies used by the FDA for approval of the six antidepressants prescribed most widely between 1987-99. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, &quot;but not meaningful for people in clinical settings&quot;, says University of Connecticut psychologist Irving Kirsch. He and co-author Thomas Moore released their findings in &quot;Prevention and Treatment&quot;, an e-journal of the American Psychological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-07-08-antidepressants.htm |title= Study: Antidepressant barely better than placebo |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2002-07-07&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Updated&amp;nbsp;11:47 PM&amp;nbsp;ET |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study by psychologists at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Vanderbilt University]], the University of Colorado, and the [[University of New Mexico]] also found that antidepressant drugs hardly have better effects than a placebo in those cases of mild or moderate depression. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study focused on Paxil from GlaxoSmithKline and imipramine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/05/antidepressant-paxil-placebo-business-healthcare-depression.html| title=Study Undermines Case for Antidepressants|date=2010-01-05|accessdate= 2010-07-01|work=Forbes|first=Robert|last=Langreth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, anti-depressants became the most prescribed drug in the United States, causing more debate over the issue. Some doctors believe this is a positive sign that people are finally seeking help for their issues. Others disagree, saying that this shows that people are becoming too dependent on anti-depressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/09/antidepressants/index.html |title=CDC: Antidepressants most prescribed drugs in U.S.  |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2011-05-21 |

==Adverse effects==
Antidepressants often cause [[adverse effects]], and difficulty tolerating these is the most common reason for discontinuing an effective medication.

Side effects of SSRIs include:
[[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[headache]]s. Sexual side effects are also common with SSRIs, such as loss of [[sexual drive]], failure to reach [[orgasm]] and [[erectile dysfunction]]. [[Serotonin syndrome]] is also a worrying condition associated with the use of SSRIs. The Food and Drug Administration requires Black Box warnings on all SSRIs, which state that they double suicidal rates (from 2 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000) in children and adolescents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Lenzer | first = Jeanne | title = Antidepressants double suicidality in children, says FDA | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | page = 626 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/332/7542/626-c | doi = 10.1136/bmj.332.7542.626-c | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it's controversial whether this is due to the medication or as part of the depression itself (i.e. efficacious antidepressant effect can cause those that are severely depressed, to the point of severe psychomotor inhibition, are rendered more alert and thus have increased capacity to carry out suicide even though they are relatively improved in state&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Antidepressants-SSRIs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;).

August&amp;nbsp;11 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Side effects of TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants):
Fairly common side effects include [[dry mouth]], blurred vision, [[drowsiness]], [[dizziness]], tremors, sexual problems, [[skin rash]], and weight gain or loss.

Side effects of MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors):
Rare side effects of MAOIs like [[phenelzine]] (Nardil) and [[tranylcypromine]] (Parnate) include [[hepatitis]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[stroke]], and [[seizures]]. Serotonin syndrome is a side effect of MAOIs when combined with certain medications.

===General===
MAO inhibitors can produce a potentially lethal hypertensive reaction if taken with foods that contain excessively high levels of [[tyramine]], such as mature cheese, cured meats or yeast extracts. Likewise, lethal reactions to both prescription and over the counter medications have occurred. Patients undergoing therapy with MAO inhibiting medications are monitored closely by their prescribing physicians, who are consulted before taking an over the counter or prescribed medication. Such patients must also inform emergency room personnel and keep information with their identification indicating that they are on MAO inhibitors. Some doctors suggest the use of [[medical identification tag]]s. Although these reactions may be lethal, the total number of deaths due to interactions and dietary concerns is comparable to over-the-counter medications.

Antidepressants are used with care, usually in conjunction with [[mood stabilisers]], in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]], as they can exacerbate symptoms of [[mania]]. They can also trigger mania or [[hypomania]] in some patients with bipolar disorder and in a small percentage of patients with depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00082-7 |last1=Benazzi |first1=F |title=Antidepressant-associated hypomania in outpatient depression: a 203-case study in private practice |journal=Journal of affective disorders |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=73–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9387089}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs are the antidepressants most frequently associated with this side effect.

Breast cancer survivors risk having their disease come back if they use certain antidepressants while also taking the cancer prevention drug tamoxifen, according to research released in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/30/health/main5050992.shtml?tag=main_home_storiesBySection | work=CBS News | title=Drug Combos Linked To Breast Cancer Risk | date=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-depressants are not psychologically addictive in most people, but cause a physical dependency in nearly all patients with sustained use. SNRI drugs tend to cause a greater degree of physical dependency than SSRIs, and thus have a more difficult withdrawal syndrome. However, all anti-depressants, with the possible exception of the NaSSA drugs, cause a physical dependency to form and have a withdrawal syndrome that can be anywhere from mild to severe in intensity given the unique factors of each patient and drug when discontinuing the drug. Anti-depressants need to be tapered slowly when being discontinued to avoid a severe withdrawal; however, discontinuing an anti-depressant quickly if the need is great can be very uncomfortable, but is very unlikely to be harmful to a non-impregnated female, unlike benzodiazepines, which must be tapered slowly under all circumstances for risk of status epilepticus and possible fatality. Harm can come to the foetus by means of spontaneous abortion due to the over-rapid discontinuation of some anti-depressants; however, most anti-depressants are harmful to the foetus, and should not be taken by those who are impregnate or attempting to become impregnated unless the benefit is judged to outweigh the risk. If impregnated, it is necessary to consult with a medical doctor who can counsel one on the best course of action in continuing, tapering, or abruptly discontinuing psychiatric medication. One should never attempt to discontinue psychiatric medication without the knowledge and supervision of a medical practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biopsychiatry.com/addictionp.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
Patients with depression are at greatest risk for [[suicide]] immediately after treatment has begun, as antidepressants can reduce the symptoms of depression such as [[psychomotor retardation]] or lack of motivation before mood starts to improve.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Although this appears paradoxical, studies {{Which?|date=May 2010}} indicate that suicidal ideation is a relatively common {{Weasel-inline|date=May 2010}} at the start of antidepressant therapy, and it may be especially common in younger patients such as pre-adolescents and teenagers. Manufacturers and physicians often recommend that other family members and loved ones monitor the young patient's behavior for any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviors, especially in the first eight weeks of therapy.

Until the black box warnings on these drugs were issued by FDA and equivalent agencies in other nations, side effects and alerting families to risk were largely ignored and downplayed by manufacturers and practitioners. This may have resulted in some deaths by suicide although direct proof for such a link is largely anecdotal.{{Or|date=May 2009}} The higher incidence of suicide ideation reported in a number of studies has drawn attention and caution in how these drugs are used.

People under the age of 24 who suffer from depression are warned that the use of antidepressants could increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Federal health officials unveiled [http://web.archive.org/web/20070930023930/http://www.ecanadanow.com/science/health/2006/12/13/fda-antidepressants-increase-suicidal-risk-for-young-adults/ proposed changes] to the labels on antidepressant drugs in December 2006 to warn people of this danger.

The FDA states that Paxil should be avoided in children and teens and that in cases of pediatric cases of depressive disorder the antidepressant drug to be used is Prozac.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antidepressantseffects.com/depression/| title=Depression Antidepressants in Teenagers and Children|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2007, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported that the suicide rate in American [[adolescents]], (especially [[girls]], 10 to 24 years old), increased 8% (2003 to 2004), the largest jump in 15 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/health/07suicide.html Suicide Rises in Youth; Antidepressant Debate Looms], Benedict Carey, New York Times, September 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to 4,599 suicides in Americans ages 10 to 24 in 2004, from 4,232 in 2003, giving a suicide rate of 7.32 per 100,000 people that age. The rate previously dropped to 6.78 per 100,000 in 2003 from 9.48 per 100,000 in 1990.

Psychiatrists {{Who|date=May 2010}} found that the increase is due to the decline in prescriptions of antidepressant drugs like Prozac to young people since 2003, leaving more cases of serious depression untreated. A December 2006 study found that a decrease in antidepressant prescriptions to minors of just a few percentage points coincided with a 14 percent increase in suicides in the United States; in the [[Netherlands]], the suicide rate was 50% up after a fall in antidepressant prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gibbons RD, Brown CH, Hur K et al. |title=Early Evidence on the Effects of Regulators' Suicidality Warnings on SSRI Prescriptions and Suicide in Children and Adolescents |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=1 |pages=1356–1363 |year=2007 |pmid=17728420 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07030454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon Jureidini, a critic of this study, says that the US &quot;2004 suicide figures were compared simplistically with the previous year, rather than examining the change in trends over several years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18056248&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jureidini J |title=The black box warning: decreased prescriptions and increased youth suicide? |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=12 |page=1907 |year=2007 |pmid=18056248 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07091463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pitfalls of such attempts to infer a trend using just two data points (years 2003 and 2004) are further demonstrated by the fact that, according to the new epidemiological data, the suicide rate in 2005 in children and adolescents actually declined despite the continuing decrease of SSRI prescriptions. &quot;It is risky to draw conclusions from limited ecologic analyses of isolated year-to-year fluctuations in antidepressant prescriptions and suicides.

One promising epidemiological approach involves examining the associations between trends in psychotropic medication use and suicide over time across a large number of small geographic regions. Until the results of more detailed analyses are known, prudence dictates deferring judgment concerning the public health effects of the FDA warnings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18056247&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Olfson M, Shaffer D |title=SSRI Prescriptions and the Rate of Suicide |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=12 |pages=1907–1908 |year=2007 |pmid=18056247 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07091467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;titleN C H S - Health E Stats - Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/prelimdeaths05/prelimdeaths05.htm |title=N C H S - Health E Stats - Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2005 |accessdate=2007-12-12 |author=Kung HC, Hoyert DL, Xu J, Murphy SL |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=National Center for Health Statistics |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequest follow-up studies have supported the hypothesis that antidepressant drugs reduce suicide risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bridge JA, Iyengar S, Salary CB |title=Clinical response and risk for reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in pediatric antidepressant treatment: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=15 |pages=1683–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17440145 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.15.1683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Beasley CM, Ball SG, Nilsson ME |title=Fluoxetine and Adult Suicidality Revisited: An Updated Meta-Analysis Using Expanded Data Sources From Placebo-Controlled Trials |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=682–686 |year=2007 |pmid=18004137 |doi=10.1097/jcp.0b013e31815abf21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the conclusion that societal suicide rate decreases are due to antidepressant prescription is unsupported given the plethora of confounding variables.{{Or|date=May 2009}}

===Sexual===
[[Sexual dysfunction]] is a very common side effect, especially with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]. Common sexual side effects include problems with sexual desire, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/question/antidepressants-and-anorgasmia |title=UCSB's SexInfo |publisher=Soc.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although usually reversible, these sexual side effects can, in rare cases, last for months or years after the drug has been completely withdrawn. This is known as [[Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction]].

SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction affects 30% to 50% or more of individuals who take these drugs for depression.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Biochemical mechanisms suggested as causative include increased serotonin, particularly affecting 5HT2 and 5HT3 receptors; decreased dopamine; decreased norepinephrine; blockade of cholinergic and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors; inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase; and elevation of prolactin levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Keltner NL, McAfee KM, Taylor CL |title=Mechanisms and treatments of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction |journal=Perspectives in Psychiatric Care |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=111–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12385082 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.2002.tb00665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bupropion]], a dual reuptake inhibitor (NE and DA), often causes a moderate increase in sexual drive, due to increased dopamine activity. This effect is also seen with dopamine reuptake inhibitors, CNS stimulants and dopamine agonists, and is due to increases in testosterone production (due to inhibition of prolactin) and nitric oxide synthesis.
[[Mirtazapine]] (Remeron) is reported to have fewer sexual side effects, most likely because it antagonizes 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine can in some cases reverse sexual dysfunction induced by SSRIs, which is also likely due to its antagonisation of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ozmenler NK, Karlidere T, Bozkurt A |title=Mirtazapine augmentation in depressed patients with sexual dysfunction due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors |journal=Human Psychopharmacology |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=321–6 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18278806 |doi=10.1002/hup.929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apomorphine]], [[nefazodone]] and [[nitroglycerin]] have been shown to reverse some sexual dysfunction via increased nitric oxide activity. [[MAOI]]s are reported to have fewer negative effects on sexual function and sexual drive, particularly [[moclobemide]] at a 1.9% rate of occurrence. Bethanechol has been reported to reverse MAOI-induced sexual dysfunction via its cholinergic agonist properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gross MD |title=Reversal by bethanechol of sexual dysfunction caused by anticholinergic antidepressants |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=139 |issue=9 |pages=1193–4 |year=1982 |month=September |pmid=7114318 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7114318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parnate]] has been anecdotally shown to make one hypersexual with increased libido and very hard erections.

===Love===
Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist from Rutgers University, has theorized that based on the proposed actions of certain neurotransmitters, SSRIs may alter the perception of some emotions related to love such as desire and arousal. &quot;There’s every reason to think SSRIs blunt your ability to fall and stay in love,&quot; said Helen Fisher. During sex, a cocktail of hormones is released that appears to play important roles in fostering romantic attachment within the brain. Take away sex, and romantic love can dwindle. But this is just part of the problem, say Fisher and University of Virginia psychiatrist James Thomson.

Dopamine also appears central to the neurobiology of romantic love and attachment, conditions that Fisher believes to be affected by — but ultimately distinct from — sexual love and its effects. She and Thomson say that SSRIs may do more than cause sexual dysfunction: They also suppress romance.

&quot;There are all sorts of unconscious systems in our brain that we use to negotiate romantic love and romantic attraction,&quot; said Thomson. &quot;If these drugs cause conscious sexual side effects, we’d argue that there are going to be side effects that are not conscious.&quot;

A psychological study showed a small effect to back up this hypothesis but the study has not been reproduced and no clinical evidence exists to lend support to this theory.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/antidepressants/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thymoanesthesia===
Closely related to sexual side effects is the phenomenon of emotional blunting, or mood anesthesia. Many users of SSRIs complain of apathy, lack of motivation, emotional numbness, feelings of detachment, and indifference to surroundings. They may describe this as a feeling of &quot;not caring about anything anymore.&quot; All SSRIs, SNRIs, and serotonergic TCAs can cause this to varying degrees, especially at high doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v58n0502 |last1=Gillin |first1=JC |last2=Rapaport |first2=M |last3=Erman |first3=MK |last4=Winokur |first4=A |last5=Albala |first5=BJ |title=A comparison of nefazodone and fluoxetine on mood and on objective, subjective, and clinician-rated measures of sleep in depressed patients: a double-blind, 8-week clinical trial |journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=185–92 |year=1997 |pmid=9184611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===REM Sleep===
All major antidepressant drugs, except trimipramine, mirtazapine and nefazodone suppress [[REM sleep]], and it has been proposed that the clinical efficacy of these drugs largely derives from their suppressant effects on REM sleep. The three major classes of antidepressant drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), profoundly suppress REM sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Robert P. |last=Vertes |year=2000 |title=The case against memory consolidation in REM sleep |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=867–876 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00004003 |pmid=11515146 |last2=Eastman |first2=KE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirtazapine either has no effect on REM sleep or increases it slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/2030e2.htm |title=ISP: Mirtazapine Regulates Stress Hormones, Improves Sleep In Depressed Patients}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MAOIs almost completely suppress REM sleep, while the TCAs and SSRIs have been shown to produce immediate (40-85%) and sustained (30-50%) reductions in REM sleep. This effect often causes increased fatigue in patients who take large doses of antidepressants for extended periods of time. Such fatigue can occasionally interfere with a patient's everyday activities. Abrupt discontinuation of MAOIs can cause a temporary phenomenon known as &quot;REM rebound&quot; in which the patient experiences extremely vivid dreams and nightmares.

===Weight gain===
Many antidepressants are associated with weight gain usually in the range of {{Convert|5|–|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} but rarely upwards of {{Convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The specific cause is unknown, but antidepressants are associated with increased cravings, an inability to feel full despite consuming enough calories, low energy levels and increased daytime sleepiness, which can lead to overeating and a lack of desire to exercise, and dry mouth, which can lead to ingestion of calorie-laden beverages.
The antihistaminic properties of certain TCA and TeCA class antidepressants have been shown to contribute to the common side effects of increased appetite and weight gain associated with these classes of medication. Eating low fat, low protein carbohydrate snacks and carbohydrate-rich dinners allows the brain to make serotonin which then controls appetite and balances mood. Carbohydrates thus eaten, as part of a balanced diet, by virtue of their effect on brain serotonin levels, can support weight loss in the setting of antidepressant weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wurtman JJ, McDermott JM, Levendusky P, Duca K, Wurtman R |title=The effect of a novel dietary intervention on weight loss in psychotropic drug-induced obesity |journal=Psychopharmacology Bulletin |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=55–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12473965 |doi= |url=http://www.medworksmedia.com/psychopharmbulletin/pdf/7/055_059_pb_36_3_wurtman.pdf |format=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wurtman|first=JJ|coauthors=Marquis NF|title=The serotonin power diet : use your brain's natural chemistry to cut cravings, curb emotional overeating, and lose weight|accessdate=2009-05-29|year=c2006|publisher=Rodale|location=Emmaus, Penn|isbn=978-1-59486-346-2|pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal symptoms===
If an [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] medication is suddenly discontinued, it may produce both [[withdrawal|somatic]] and [[Substance use disorder|psychological withdrawal]] symptoms, a phenomenon known as &quot;[[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]]&quot; (Tamam &amp; Ozpoyraz, 2002). When the decision is made to stop taking antidepressants it is common practice to &quot;wean&quot; off of them by slowly decreasing the dose over a period of several weeks. Most cases of discontinuation syndrome last between one and four weeks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The selection of an antidepressant and dosage suitable for a certain case and a certain person is a lengthy and complicated process, requiring the knowledge of a professional. Certain antidepressants can initially make depression worse, can induce [[anxiety]], or can make a patient aggressive, dysphoric or acutely [[suicidal]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In rare cases, an antidepressant can induce a switch from depression to [[mania]] or [[hypomania]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Anecdotal evidence seems to show that many antidepressants can be withdrawn without major withdrawal symptoms if discontinued within the first week of treatment.

==Mechanisms of action==
The therapeutic effects of antidepressants are believed to be caused by their effects on [[neurotransmitter]]s and [[neurotransmission]].

The [[Chemical_imbalance#Monoamine_hypothesis|Monoamine Hypothesis]] is a biological theory stating that depression is caused by the underactivity in the brain of monoamines, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.
In the 1950s the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants were accidentally discovered to be effective in the treatment of depression. These findings and other supporting evidence led Joseph Schildkraut to publish his paper called &quot;The Catecholamine Hypothesis of Affective Disorders&quot; in 1965. Schildkraut associated low levels of neurotransmitters with depression. Research into other mental impairments such as schizophrenia also found that too little activity of certain neurotransmitters were connected to these disorders. The hypothesis has been a major focus of research in the fields pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy for over 25 years.

[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) block the degradation of the monoamine neurotransmitters [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]] by inhibiting the [[enzyme]] [[monoamine oxidase]], leading to increased concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the brain and an increase in neurotransmission.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) prevent the reuptake of various [[neurotransmitters]], including [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and to a much less extent, [[dopamine]]. Nowadays the most common antidepressants are [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), which prevent the reuptake of serotonin (thereby increasing the level of active serotonin in [[synapse]]s of the [[Human brain|brain]]). Other novel antidepressants affect norepinephrine reuptake, or different receptors on the nerve cell.

While MAOIs, TCAs and SSRIs increase serotonin levels, others prevent serotonin from binding to 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, suggesting it is too simplistic to say serotonin is a happy hormone. In fact, when the  former antidepressants build up in the bloodstream and the serotonin level is increased, it is common for the patient to feel worse for the first weeks of treatment. One explanation of this is that 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors evolved as a saturation signal (people who use 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists often gain weight), telling the animal to stop searching for food, a mate, etc., and to start looking for predators. In a threatening situation it is beneficial for the animal not to feel hungry even if it needs to eat. Stimulation of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors will achieve that. But if the threat is long lasting the animal needs to start eating and mating again - the fact that it survived shows that the threat was not so dangerous as the animal felt. So the number of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors decreases through a process known as [[downregulation]] and the animal goes back to its normal behavior. This suggests that there are two ways to relieve anxiety in humans with serotonergic drugs: by blocking stimulation of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors or by overstimulating them until they decrease via tolerance.

The stimulation or blocking of different receptors on a cell affects its [[genetic expression]]. Recent findings have shown that [[neurogenesis]], and thus, changes in brain morphogenesis, mediate the effects of antidepressant drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16425236&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Warner-Schmidt JL, Duman RS |title=Hippocampal neurogenesis: opposing effects of stress and antidepressant treatment |journal=Hippocampus |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=239–49 |year=2006 |pmid=16425236 |doi=10.1002/hipo.20156 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis is that antidepressants may have some longer-term effects due to the promotion of [[neurogenesis]] in the [[hippocampus]], an effect found in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malberg|first=JE|date=15 December 200|title=Chronic antidepressant treatment increases neurogenesis in adult rat hippocampus|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=20|issue=24|pages=9104–10|publisher=Society for Neuroscience|pmid=11124987|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/20/24/9104|accessdate=2009-05-29|author2=E|author3=N|author4=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manev|first=H|year=2001|month=May|title=Antidepressants alter cell proliferation in the adult brain in vivo and in neural cultures in vitro|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|volume=411|issue=1-2|pages=67–70|publisher=Elsevier|pmid=11137860|doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(00)00904-3|accessdate=2009-05-29|last2=Uz|first2=T|last3=Smalheiser|first3=NR|last4=Manev|first4=R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animal research suggests that antidepressants can affect the expression of genes in brain cells, by influencing &quot;[[circadian rhythm|clock genes]]&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uz|first=T|year=2005|title=Effect of fluoxetine and cocaine on the expression of clock genes in the mouse hippocampus and striatum|journal=Neuroscience|volume=134|issue=4|pages=1309–16|publisher=Elsevier|pmid=15994025|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.05.003|accessdate=2009-05-29|last2=Ahmed|first2=R|last3=Akhisaroglu|first3=M|last4=Kurtuncu|first4=M|last5=Imbesi|first5=M|last6=Dirim Arslan|first6=A|last7=Manev|first7=H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research suggests that delayed onset of clinical effects from antidepressants indicates involvement of adaptive changes in antidepressant effects. Rodent studies have consistently shown upregulation of the [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|3, 5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) system induced by different types of chronic but not acute antidepressant treatment, including serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium and electroconvulsions. cAMP is synthesized from [[Adenosine triphosphate|adenosine 5-triphosphate]] (ATP) by adenylyl cyclase and metabolized by cyclic nucleotide [[phosphodiesterase]]s (PDEs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zang|first=HT|date=12 July 2005|title=Interaction between the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of beta adrenergic agonists and the cyclic AMP PDE inhibitor rolipram in rats |journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=182|issue=1|pages=104–115|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|doi=10.1007/s00213-005-0055-y|pmid=16010541|accessdate=2009-05-28|last2=Huang|first2=Y|last3=Mishler|first3=K|last4=Roerig|first4=SC|last5=O'Donnell|first5=JM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data also suggest that antidepressants can modulate [[Neuroplasticity|neural plasticity]] in longterm administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carboni|first=L|year=2006|month=October|title=Proteomic analysis of rat hippocampus and frontal cortex after chronic treatment with fluoxetine or putative novel antidepressants: CRF1 and NK1 receptor antagonists|journal=European Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=16|issue=7|pages=521–537|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.euroneuro.2006.01.007|pmid=16517129|accessdate=2009-05-28|last2=Vighini|first2=M|last3=Piubelli|first3=C|last4=Castelletti|first4=L|last5=Milli|first5=A|last6=Domenici|first6=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory regarding the cause of depression is that it is characterized by an overactive [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) that resembles the neuro-endocrine ([[cortisol]]) response to [[Stress (biological)|stress]].  These HPA axis abnormalities participate in the development of depressive symptoms, and antidepressants serve to regulate HPA axis function.&lt;ref&gt;Carmine M. Pariante, Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London [http://www.neuroendo.org.uk/content/view/31/11/ Depression, stress and the adrenal axis.] The British Society for Neuroendocrinology, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The values above are expressed as [[Dissociation constant|equilibrium dissociation constant]]s. It should be noted that less is more. SERT, NET, and DAT correspond to the abilities of the compounds to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, respectively. The other values correspond to their affinity for various receptors.

===Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulation===

Studies also show that the chronic secretion of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] [[hormones]] as a result of disease, including [[somatic]] [[infections]] or [[autoimmune]] syndromes, may reduce the effect of [[neurotransmitters]] or other receptors in the brain by [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated]] pro-inflammatory pathways, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elen&quot;/&gt; [[SSRI]]s, [[SNRI]]s and [[tricyclic]] [[antidepressants]] acting on serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine receptors have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] processes, specifically on the regulation of [[Interferon-gamma]] (IFN-gamma) and [[Interleukin-10]] (IL-10), as well as [[TNF-alpha]] and [[Interleukin-6]] (IL-6).

==History==
[[Image:Saint johns wart flowers.jpg|thumb|[[St John's Wort]]]]

Various [[opiates]] (via the [[µ-opioid receptor]] and [[κ-opioid receptor]]) and [[amphetamine]]s were commonly used as antidepressants until the mid-1950s, when they fell out of favor due to their addictive nature and side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber 1988 255–66&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=MM|year=1988|month=July|title=Current and Historical Concepts of Opiate Treatment in Psychiatric Disorders|journal=International Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume=3|issue=3|pages=255–66|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |pmid=3153713 |url=http://journals.lww.com/intclinpsychopharm/Abstract/1988/07000/Current_and_Historical_Concepts_of_Opiate.7.aspx |doi=10.1097/00004850-198807000-00007 |accessdate=2009-05-28|last2=Emrich|first2=HM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts from the herb [[St John's Wort]] have long been used (as a &quot;nerve tonic&quot;) to alleviate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czygan|first=FC|date=8 May 2003|title=Kulturgeschichte und Mystik des Johanniskrauts: Vom 2500 Jahre alten Apotropaikum zum aktuellen Antidepressivum|journal=Pharmazie in unserer Zeit|volume=32|issue=3|pages=184–190|publisher=WILEY-VCH Verlag|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/pauz.200390062|language=German|accessdate=2009-05-28|pmid=12784538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isoniazid and iproniazid===
In 1951, two people from Sea View Hospital on [[Staten Island]], [[Irving Selikoff]] and Edward Robitzek, began clinical trials on two new [[tuberculosis|anti-tuberculosis]] agents from Hoffman-LaRoche, [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]]. Only patients with a poor [[prognosis]] were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted &quot;a subtle general stimulation . . . the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14906149&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selikoff|first=IJ|year=1952|month=April|title=Tuberculosis chemotherapy with hydrazine derivatives of isonicotinic acid|journal=Chest|volume=21|issue=4|pages=385–438|issn=1931-3543|pmid=14906149|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/content/21/4/385.long|accessdate=2009-05-28|doi=10.1378/chest.21.4.385|doi_brokendate=2009-10-24|last2=Robitzek|first2=EH}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press. In 1952, learning of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term ''antidepressant'' to describe its action.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-88048-397-0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Healy|first=D|editor=Weissman MM|title=The treatment of depression: bridging the 21st century|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LAmBVolIG5kC|accessdate=2009-05-28|year=2001|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-0-88048-397-1|pages=10–11|chapter=The Antidepressant Drama|chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LAmBVolIG5kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, found out from his [[pulmonology]] colleagues at Cochin Hospital about the side effects of isoniazid. In 1952, before Lurie and Salzer, Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported the positive effect of isoniazid on depressed patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Healy96&quot;&gt;&quot;{{Cite book|last=Healy|first=David|title=The psychopharmacologists : interviews|accessdate=2009-05-28|year=c1996|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|isbn=978-1-86036-008-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons unrelated to its efficacy, isoniazid as an antidepressant was soon overshadowed by the more toxic iproniazid,&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-88048-397-0&quot;/&gt; although it remains a mainstay of [[tuberculosis treatment]]. The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of [[diamine oxidase]], coupled with a weak inhibition of [[monoamine oxidase A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-86036-010-6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Healy, David |title=The Psychopharmacologists: Volume 2 |publisher=A Hodder Arnold Publication |year=1998 |pages=132–4 |isbn=978-1-86036-010-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another anti-tuberculosis drug tried at the same time by Selikoff and Robitzek, [[iproniazid]], showed a greater &quot;psychostimulant&quot; effect, but more pronounced toxicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12998444&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Robitzek EH, Selikoff IJ, Mamlok E, Tendlau |title=Isoniazid and its isopropyl derivative in the therapy of tuberculosis in humans:  comparative therapeutic and toxicologic properties |journal=Chest |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |year=1953 |pmid=12998444 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/content/23/1/1.long |doi=10.1378/chest.23.1.1 |doi_brokendate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publications on isoniazid, papers by Jackson Smith, Gordon Kamman, George Crane, and [[Frank Ayd]] appeared, describing the psychiatric applications of iproniazid.

===Imipramine===
The discovery that a [[tricyclic]] (&quot;three ringed&quot;) compound had a significant antidepressant effect was first made in 1957 by [[Roland Kuhn]] in a Swiss [[psychiatric hospital]]. By that time [[antihistamine]] derivatives were increasingly used to treat surgical shock and then as psychiatric neuroleptics. Although in 1955 [[reserpine]] was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics (literally, &quot;to seize the nerves&quot; or &quot;to take hold of nerves&quot;) were being developed as [[sedatives]] and [[antipsychotics]].

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of [[chlorpromazine]], Kuhn, in conjunction with the [[Geigy]] [[pharmaceutical company]], discovered that compound &quot;G 22355&quot; (manufactured and patented in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and Schinder) had a beneficial effect in patients with depression accompanied by mental and motor retardation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn|first=R|year=1958|month=November|title=The Treatment of Depressive States with G 22355 (Imipramine Hydrochloride)|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=115|issue=5|pages=459–464|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.115.5.459|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/115/5/459?ijkey=366b7fc177f17d99017ed6276c3fa6a9411f8a7c&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|accessdate=2009-05-28|pmid=13583250|doi_brokendate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn first reported his findings on what he called a &quot;thymoleptic&quot; (literally, &quot;taking hold of the emotions,&quot; in contrast with neuroleptics, &quot;taking hold of the nerves&quot;) in 1955-56. These gradually became established, resulting in marketing of the first tricyclic antidepressant, [[imipramine]], soon followed by variants.

===Later history===
These new drug therapies became [[prescription drug]]s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 people per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the [[major tranquilizers]] (neuroleptics/antipsychotics) and [[minor tranquilizers]] (such as benzodiazepines), which were being marketed for different uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;3faces&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Healy D |title=The three faces of the antidepressants: a critical commentary on the clinical-economic context of diagnosis |journal=J.

Most pharmacologists by the 1960s thought the main therapeutic action of tricyclics was to inhibit [[norepinephrine]] [[reuptake]], but it was gradually observed that this action was associated with energizing and motor stimulating effects, while some antidepressant compounds appeared to have differing effects through action on [[serotonin]] systems (notably proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug).

Researchers began a process of [[rational drug design]] to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems. The first such compound to be patented was [[zimelidine]] in 1971, while the first released clinically was [[indalpine]]. [[Fluoxetine]] was approved for commercial use by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]] in 1988, becoming the first [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] SSRI. Fluoxetine was developed at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in the early 1970s by Bryan Molloy, David Wong and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Domino EF |title=History of modern psychopharmacology: a personal view with an emphasis on antidepressants |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=591–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10511010 |doi= |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10511010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wong DT, Bymaster FP, Horng JS, Molloy BB |title=A new selective inhibitor for uptake of serotonin into synaptosomes of rat brain: 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy).

While it had fallen out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, the herb [[St John's Wort]] became increasingly popular in [[Germany]], where [[Hypericum]] extracts were eventually licensed, packaged and prescribed by doctors. Small-scale efficacy trials were carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, and attention grew in the 1990s following a [[meta-analysis]] of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Linde K, Ramirez G, Mulrow CD, Pauls A, Weidenhammer W, Melchart D |title=St John's wort for depression--an overview and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7052 |pages=253–8 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8704532 |pmc=2351679 |doi= |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8704532}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained an [[over-the-counter drug]] (OTC) or supplement in most countries and research continued to investigate its neurotransmitter effects and active components, particularly [[hyperforin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Müller WE |title=Current St John's wort research from mode of action to clinical efficacy |journal=Pharmacol.

SSRIs became known as &quot;novel antidepressants&quot; along with other newer drugs such as [[SNRI]]s and [[Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor|NRIs]] with various different selective effects, such as [[venlafaxine]], [[duloxetine]], [[nefazodone]] and [[mirtazapine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=H |title=Tolerability and safety of novel antidepressants |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=11 |pages=206s |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/0924-9338(96)88597-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prescription trends===
In the United Kingdom the use of antidepressants increased by 234% in the 10 years up to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;(National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States a 2005 independent report stated that 11% of women and 5% of men in the non-institutionalized population (2002) take antidepressants&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/Pub_ProdResults_Details.jsp?pt=Statistical%20Brief&amp;opt=2&amp;id=685] Stagnitti,M.

A 2002 survey found that about 3.5% of all people in [[France]] were being prescribed antidepressants, compared to 1.7% in 1992, often for conditions other than depression and often not in line with authorizations or guidelines&lt;ref name=&quot;Ol&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olié|first=JP|year=2002|month=October|title=Antidepressants consumption in the global population in France|journal=L'Encéphale|volume=28|issue=5 pt. 1|pages=411–7|publisher=Elsevier|pmid=12386542 |accessdate=2009-05-29|language=French|doi_brokendate=2009-10-24|last2=Elomari|first2=F|last3=Spadone|first3=C|last4=Lépine|first4=JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1996 and 2004 in [[British Columbia]], antidepressant use increased from 3.4% to 7.2% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=CB|year=2007|month=January|title=Antidepressant utilization in British Columbia from 1996 to 2004: increasing prevalence but not incidence|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=58|issue=1|pages=79–84|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|pmid=17215416|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.58.1.79|accessdate=2009-05-29|last2=Morgan|first2=SG|last3=Caetano|first3=PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 1992 to 2001 from the [[Netherlands]] indicated an increasing rate of prescriptions of SSRIs, and an increasing duration of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Meijer W, Heerdink E, Leufkens H, Herings R, Egberts A, Nolen W |title=Incidence and determinants of long-term use of antidepressants |journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=57–61 |year=2004 |pmid=14985889 |doi=10.1007/s00228-004-0726-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Surveys indicate that antidepressant use, particularly of SSRIs, has increased rapidly in most developed countries, driven by an increased awareness of depression together with the availability and commercial promotion of new antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McManus P, Mant A, Mitchell PB, Montgomery WS, Marley J, Auland ME |title=Recent trends in the use of antidepressant drugs in Australia, 1990-1998 |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=173 |issue=9 |pages=458–61 |year=2000 |month=November |pmid=11149300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antidepressants are also increasingly used worldwide for non-depressive patients as studies continue to show the potential of immunomodulatory, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in antidepressants.

The choice of particular antidepressant is reported to be based, in the absence of research evidence of differences in efficacy, on seeking to avoid certain side effects, and taking into account comorbid (co-occurring) psychiatric disorders, specific clinical symptoms and prior treatment history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.7.1285 |first1=Mark |last1=Zimmerman |first2=Michael |last2=Posternak |first3=Michael |last3=Friedman |first4=Naureen |last4=Attiullah |first5=Scott |last5=Baymiller |first6=Robert |last6=Boland |first7=Stacie |last7=Berlowitz |first8=Shahzad |last8=Rahman |first9=Kirsten |last9=Uy |title=Which factors influence psychiatrists' selection of antidepressants? |pmid=15229063 |year=2004 |pages=1285–9 |issue=7 |volume=161 |journal=The American journal of psychiatry |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15229063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also reported that, despite equivocal evidence of a significant difference in efficacy between older and newer antidepressants, clinicians perceive the newer drugs, including SSRIs and SNRIs, to be more effective than the older drugs (tricyclics and MAOIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|first=T|year=2002|month=January|title=A survey of prescribing practices in the treatment of depression|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=26|issue=1|pages=177–87|publisher=Elsevier|pmid=11853110|doi=10.1016/S0278-5846(01)00250-0   |accessdate=2009-05-29|last2=Dording|first2=C|last3=Neault|first3=NB|last4=Kornbluh|first4=R|last5=Alpert|first5=JE|last6=Nierenberg|first6=AA|last7=Rosenbaum|first7=JF|last8=Fava|first8=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in the UK found that male general physicians were more likely to prescribe antidepressants than female doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Male GPs depression pills 'bias' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4704053.stm|date=July 21, 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of antidepressants prescribed by the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in the United Kingdom almost doubled during one decade, authorities reported in 2010. Furthermore the number highly increased in 2009 when 39.1 million [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]] were issued compared with 20.1 million issued in 1999. Also, physicians issued 3.18 million more prescriptions in 2009 than in 2008. Health authorities believed the increase was partly linked to the [[recession]]. However, other reasons include a diagnosis improvement, a reduction of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] on mental ill-health, and more distress caused by the economic crisis. Furthermore, physicians concern is that some people who exhibit milder symptoms of depression are being prescribed drugs unnecessarily due to the lack of other options including talking therapies, [[counseling]] and [[cognitive behavior therapy]]. One more factor that may be increasing the  consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for  other  conditions including [[social anxiety]] and [[post traumatic stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession| title=Antidepressant Use Rises as Recession Feeds Wave of Worry|date=2010-06-11|accessdate= 2010-07-01 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rowenna | last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of antidepressants in the United States doubled over one decade, from 1996 to 2005. Antidepressant drugs were prescribed to 13 million in 1996 and to 27 million people by 2005. In 2008, more than 164 million prescriptions were written. During this period, patients were less likely to undergo [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5725E720090804| title=Antidepressant Use Doubles in U.S., Study Finds|date=2009-08-04|accessdate= 2010-07-01 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly prescribed antidepressant in Germany is reported to be (concentrated extracts of) hypericum perforatum ([[St John's Wort]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tyler|first=VE|editor=Janick J|title=Perspectives on New Crops and New Uses|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/|accessdate=2009-05-29|year=1999|publisher=ASHS Press|isbn=978-0-9615027-0-6|pages=528|chapter=Herbs Affecting the Central Nervous System|chapterurl=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-442.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, paroxetine, marketed as Seroxat among generic preparations, is the most prescribed antidepressant, followed by the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, citalopram and venlafaxine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gipdatabank.nl/index.asp?scherm=tabellenFrameSet&amp;infoType=g&amp;tabel=01-basis&amp;item=N06AB |title=GIPdatabank |publisher=Gipdatabank.nl |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
{{Story|date=June 2008}}
In many cases SSRI drug manufacturers have withheld information from the FDA and the public to play down the risks and adverse effects associated with SSRIs. This had led to litigation against many of the pharmaceutical manufacturers of SSRI anti-depressants in cases covering suicidality, SSRI withdrawal and birth defects in neonates from nursing mothers on SSRIs.

In one of the only three cases to ever go to trial for SSRI indication in suicide, [[Eli Lilly and Company]] was caught corrupting the judicial process by making a deal with the plaintiff's attorney to throw the case, in part by not disclosing damaging evidence to the jury. The case, known as the [[Fentress Case]] involved a Kentucky man, [[Joseph Wesbecker]], on Prozac, who went to his workplace and opened fire with an assault rifle killing 8 people (including Fentress), and injuring 12 others before turning the gun on himself. The jury returned a 9-to-3 verdict in favor of Lilly. The judge, in the end, took the matter to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which found that &quot;there was a serious lack of candor with the trial court and there may have been deception, bad faith conduct, abuse of judicial process and, perhaps even fraud.&quot; The judge later revoked the verdict and instead, recorded the case as settled. The value of the secret settlement deal has never been disclosed, but was reportedly &quot;tremendous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judicialaccountability.org/articles/hideandseek.htm] from Richard Zitrin &amp; Carol M. Langford. &quot;Hide and Secrets in Louisville&quot; from &quot;The Moral Compass of the American Lawyer&quot;. Ballantine Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2006, a US court decided in Hoorman, et al. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. that individuals who purchased Paxil or Paxil CR (paroxetine) for a minor child may be eligible for benefits under a $63.8 million Proposed Settlement. The lawsuit won the claim that pharmaceutical maker [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) promoted Paxil or Paxil CR for prescription to children and adolescents while withholding and concealing material information about the medication's safety and effectiveness for minors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrp.org/risks/SSRI0204/GSKpaxil/pg1.html] October 1998 GSK Internal Memo: Strategy of Concealment&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit stemmed from a consumer advocate protest against Paroxetine manufacturer GSK. Since the FDA approved paroxetine in 1992, approximately 5,000 U.S. citizens – and thousands more worldwide{{Who|date=September 2010}} – have sued GSK{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Most of these people feel they were not sufficiently warned in advance of the drug's side effects and addictive properties.

According to the [http://www.paxilprotest.com/ Paxil Protest website], hundreds more lawsuits have been filed against GSK. The Paxil Protest website was launched August 8, 2005 to offer both information about the protest and information on Paxil previously unavailable to the public. Just three weeks after its launch, the site received more than a quarter of a million hits.

The original Paxil Protest website is no longer available. It is understood that the action to remove the site from the internet was undertaken as part of a confidentiality agreement or '[[gagging order]]' which the owner of the site entered into as part of a settlement of his action against GlaxoSmithKline. (However, in March 2007, the website Seroxat Secrets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seroxatsecrets.wordpress.com/2007/03/03/the-paxil-protest-time-machine/ |title=The Paxil Protest time machine &quot; seroxat secrets… |publisher=Seroxatsecrets.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that an archive of Paxil Protest site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paxilprotest.com/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060519170044/http://paxilprotest.com/|archivedate=2006-05-19 |title=The Paxil Protest I Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was still available on the internet via Archive.org) Gagging orders are common in such cases and can extend to documents that defendants wish to remain hidden from the public. However, in some cases, such documents can become public at a later date, such as those made public by Peter Breggin in February 2006. A press release from Dr. Breggin can be seen here:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.breggin.com/courtfiling.pbreggin.2006.html |title=Suppressed Paxil Suicide Data Released |publisher=Breggin.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, according to the Seroxat Secrets website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seroxatsecrets.wordpress.com |title=seroxat secrets… |publisher=Seroxatsecrets.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the national group litigation in the [[United Kingdom]], on behalf of several hundred people who allege withdrawal reactions after use of the drug Seroxat, against GlaxoSmithKline plc, moved a step closer to the High Court in [[London]], with the confirmation that Public Funding had been reinstated following a decision by the Public Interest Appeal Panel. The issue at the heart of this particular action claims Seroxat is a defective drug in that it has a propensity to cause a withdrawal reaction. Hugh James Solicitors confirm this news on their website&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20070222131722/http://www.hughjames.com/lifestyle/groupactions/seroxt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2007, the BBC in the UK aired a fourth documentary in its 'Panorama'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5346938.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Programmes &amp;#124; Panorama &amp;#124; Seroxat update |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=Last Updated: |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; series about the controversial drug Seroxat. This programme, entitled Secrets of the Drug Trials, focuses on three GSK paediatric clinical trials on depressed children and adolescents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Auger Process.svg|thumb|280px| Two views of the Auger process. (a) illustrates sequentially the steps involved in Auger deexcitation. An incident electron (or photon) creates a core hole in the 1s level. An electron from the 2s level fills in the 1s hole and the transition energy is imparted to a 2p electron which is emitted. The final atomic state thus has two holes, one in the 2s orbital and the other in the 2p orbital. (b) illustrates the same process using spectroscopic notation, &lt;math&gt;KL_1L_{2,3}&lt;/math&gt;.]]The '''Auger effect''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|oʊ|ˈ|ʒ|eɪ}}) is a physical phenomenon in which the transition of an [[electron]] in an [[atom]] filling in an [[Inner-shell electrons|inner-shell]] vacancy causes the emission of another electron.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger effect|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00520.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[core electron]] is removed, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of [[energy]]. Although sometimes this energy is released in the form of an emitted [[photon]], the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom. This second ejected electron is called an '''Auger electron''',&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger electron|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00521.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; after one of its discoverers, [[Pierre Victor Auger]].

Upon ejection the [[kinetic energy]] of the Auger electron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the initial [[electronic transition]] and the [[ionization energy]] for the [[electron shell]] from which the Auger electron was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located. [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either [[X-ray]]s or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment. [[Carrier generation and recombination#Auger recombination|Auger recombination]] is a similar Auger effect which occurs in [[semiconductor]]s. An electron and [[electron hole]] (electron-hole pair) can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the conduction band, increasing its energy. The reverse effect is known as [[impact ionization]].

==Discovery==
The Auger emission process was discovered in 1922 by [[Lise Meitner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01326962|author=L. Meitner|title=Über die Entstehung der β-Strahl-Spektren radioaktiver Substanzen|journal=Z.

The French physicist [[Pierre Victor Auger]] also discovered it in 1923&lt;ref&gt;P. Auger: [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3130n.image.f187.langFR Sur les rayons β secondaires produits dans un gaz par des rayons X], C.R.A.S. 177 (1923) 169-171.&lt;/ref&gt; upon analysis of a Wilson [[cloud chamber]] experiment and it became the central part of his PhD work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3139/146.110163|title=Pierre Auger – Lise Meitner: Comparative contributions to the Auger effect|year=2009|last1=Duparc|first1=Olivier Hardouin|journal=International Journal of Materials Research (formerly Zeitschrift fuer Metallkunde)|volume=100|issue=09|pages=1162}}&lt;/ref&gt; High energy X-rays were applied to ionize gas particles and observe [[photoelectric]] electrons. Observation of electron tracks independent of the frequency of the incident photon suggested a mechanism for electron ionization that was caused from an [[internal conversion]] of energy from a radiationless transition. Further investigation and theoretical work showed that the effect was a radiationless effect more than an internal conversion effect by use of elementary quantum mechanics and transition rate and transition probability calculations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Auger Effect and Other Radiationless Transitions&quot;.

'''Akio Morita''' [[KBE]] (盛田 昭夫 ''Morita Akio'', January 26, 1921, [[Nagoya, Aichi]] &amp;ndash; October 3, 1999, [[Tokyo]]) was a [[Japan]]ese businessman and co-founder of [[Sony Corporation]] along with [[Masaru Ibuka]].

==Early life==
Morita's family was involved in [[sake]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]] production in the [[Chita Peninsula]], [[Aichi Prefecture]] since 1665. He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from [[Osaka University|Osaka Imperial University]] with a degree in physics. He later joined the navy and served as a lieutenant during [[World War II]]. During his service, Morita met his future business partner Masaru Ibuka in the Navy's Wartime Research Committee.

==Sony==
On May 7, 1946, Morita and Ibuka founded ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha'' (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, the forerunner of Sony Corporation) with about 20 employees and initial capital of ¥190,000. Ibuka was 38 years old, Morita, 25. Morita's family invested in Sony during the early period and was the largest shareholder.

In 1949, the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first tape recorder in Japan. In 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully-[[transistor]]ized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (sonus is [[Latin]] for [[sound]], and ''Sonny-boys'' is Japanese [[slang]] for &quot;whiz kids&quot;). Morita was an advocate for all the products made by the [[Sony Corporation]]. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a &quot;pocket sized&quot; appearance. In 1960, it produced the first [[transistor]] television in the world. In 1975, it released the first [[Betamax]] home video recorder, a year before [[VHS]] came out. In 1979, the [[Walkman]] was introduced, making it the world's first portable music player. In 1984, Sony launched the [[Discman]] series which extended their [[Walkman]] brand to portable CD products.

In 1960, the Sony Corporation of America was established in the United States. In 1961, the Sony Corporation of America was the first Japanese company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Sony bought CBS Records Group ([[Columbia Records]], [[Epic Records]] and other CBS labels) in 1988 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment ([[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]] and others) in 1989.

On November 25, 1994, Morita stepped down as Sony chairman after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while playing tennis. His successor, [[Norio Ohga]], had joined the company after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.

==Other affiliations==
Morita was vice chairman of the [[Keidanren]] ([[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]]), and was a member of the [[Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group]], also known as the &quot;[[Wise Men's Group]]&quot;.

==Publications==
In 1966, Morita wrote a book called ''Gakureki Muyō Ron'' (学歴無用論, Never Mind School Records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. In 1986, Morita wrote an autobiography titled ''[[Made in Japan (biography)|Made in Japan]]''. He co-authored the 1991 essay ''[[The Japan That Can Say No]]'' with politician [[Shintaro Ishihara]], where they criticized American business practices and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs.

==Awards==
Morita was awarded the [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]] by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1982, the first Japanese to receive the honor. Two years later, he received the prestigious [[Légion d'honneur|National Order of the Legion of Honor]], and in 1991, was awarded the First Class [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] from the [[Emperor Akihito|Emperor of Japan]]. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|British knighthood (KBE)]]. Morita received the International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1987.

==Death==
Morita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis. On October 3, 1999, Morita died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 78.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Zinc anode 2.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[zinc]] anode in a [[galvanic cell]]. Watch how electrons move out of the cell, and the current moves into it]]

An '''anode''' is an [[electrode]] through which [[electric current]] flows ''into'' a polarized electrical device. [[Mnemonic]]: ACID (Anode Current Into Device). (The direction of electric current is, by convention, opposite to the direction of electron flow)

A widespread misconception is that anode [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] is always positive (+). This is often incorrectly inferred from the correct fact that in all electrochemical devices negatively charged [[anion]]s move towards the anode (hence their name) and/or positively charged [[cation]]s move away from it. In fact anode polarity depends on the device type, and sometimes even in which mode it operates, as per the above electric current direction-based universal definition.  Consequently, as can be seen from the following examples, in a device which consumes power the anode is positive, and in a device which provides power the anode is negative:
* In a discharging battery or [[galvanic cell]] (diagram at right) the anode is the negative terminal since that is where the current flows into the device (see drawing). This inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards, negative charge moving one way constituting positive current flowing the other way. It is continued internally by positive ions flowing into the [[electrolyte]] ''from'' the anode, i.e., away (surprisingly) from the more negative electrode and towards the more positive one (chemical energy is responsible for this &quot;uphill&quot; motion).
* In a recharging battery, or an [[electrolytic cell]], the anode is the positive terminal, which receives current from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; In other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging.
* In a [[diode]], it is the positive terminal at the tail of the arrow symbol, where current flows into the device. Note electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows &quot;most easily&quot;), even for types such as zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current.
* In a [[cathode ray tube]], it is the positive terminal where electrons flow out of the device, i.e., where positive electric current flows in.

An electrode through which current flows the other way (out of the device) is termed a [[cathode]].

==Etymology==
The word was coined in 1834 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄνοδος (''anodos''), 'ascent', by [[William Whewell]], who had been consulted&lt;ref&gt;Ross, S, ''Faraday Consults the Scholars: The Origins of the Terms of Electrochemistry'' in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London (1938-1996)'', Volume 16, Number 2 / 1961, Pages: 187 - 220, [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=y61755r466478481] consulted 2006-12-22&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Michael Faraday]] over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of [[electrolysis]]. In that paper Faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the &quot;decomposing body&quot; (electrolyte) in a direction &quot;from East to West, or, which will strengthen this help to the memory, that in which the sun appears to move&quot;, the anode is where the current enters the electrolyte, on the East side: &quot;''ano'' upwards, ''odos'' a way ; the way which the sun rises&quot; (,&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Michael, ''Experimental Researches in Electricity. Seventh Series, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (1776-1886)'', Volume 124, 01 January 1834, Page 77, [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=526145013443q040] consulted 2006-12-27 (in which Faraday introduces the words ''[[electrode]]'', ''anode'', ''[[cathode]]'', ''[[anion]]'', ''[[cation]]'', ''[[electrolyte]]'', ''[[electrolyze]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted in &lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Michael, ''Experimental Researches in Electricity'', Volume 1, 1849, reprint of series 1 to 14, freely accessible Gutenberg.org transcript [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14986] consulted 2007-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;).

The use of 'East' to mean the 'in' direction (actually 'in' → 'East' → 'sunrise' → 'up') may appear contrived. Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term &quot;eisode&quot; (the doorway where the current enters). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the East electrode' (other candidates had been &quot;eastode&quot;, &quot;oriode&quot; and &quot;anatolode&quot;) was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for [[electric current|current]], whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical [[solenoid|magnetizing current loop]] around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic [[dipole]] field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the East electrode would not have been the 'way in' any more. Therefore &quot;eisode&quot; would have become inappropriate, whereas &quot;anode&quot; meaning 'East electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the anode's function any more, but more importantly because, as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the &quot;anode&quot; term is based is subject to [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversals]] whereas the [[electric current|current]] direction convention on which the &quot;eisode&quot; term was based has no reason to change in the future.

Since the later discovery of the [[electron]], an easier to remember, and more durably correct technically although historically false, etymology has been suggested: anode, from the Greek ''anodos'', 'way up', 'the way (up) out of the cell (or other device) for electrons'.

==Flow of electrons==
The flow of electrons is always from anode to cathode outside of the cell or device, regardless of the cell or device type and operating mode, with the exception of diodes, where electrode naming always assumes current in the forward direction (that of the arrow symbol), i.e., electrons flow in the opposite direction, even when the diode reverse-conducts either by accident (breakdown of a normal diode) or by design (breakdown of a Zener diode, photo-current of a photodiode or solar cell).

==Electrolytic anode==
In [[electrochemistry]], the '''anode''' is where [[oxidation]] occurs and is the positive polarity contact in an [[electrolytic cell]]. At the anode, [[anions]] (negative ions) are forced by the electrical potential to react chemically and give off electrons (oxidation) which then flow up and into the driving circuit. Mnemonics: LEO Red Cat (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation, Reduction occurs at the Cathode), or AnOx Red Cat (Anode Oxidation, Reduction Cathode), or OIL RIG (Oxidation is Loss, Reduction is Gain of electrons), or Roman Catholic and Orthodox (Reduction - Cathode, anode - Oxidation), or LEO the lion says GER (Losing electrons is Oxidation, Gaining electrons is Reduction)

This process is widely used in metals refining.  For example, in copper refining, copper [[anodes]], an intermediate product from the furnaces, are electrolysed in an appropriate solution (such as [[sulfuric acid]]) to yield high purity (99.99%) cathodes. Copper cathodes produced using this method are also described as [[electrolytic copper.]]

==Battery or galvanic cell anode==
In a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[galvanic cell]], the anode is the negative electrode from which electrons flow out towards the external part of the circuit. Internally the positively charged cations are flowing away from the anode (even though it is negative and therefore would be expected to attract them, this is due to [[electrode potential]] relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal/electrolyte systems); but, external to the cell in the circuit, electrons are being pushed out through the negative contact and thus through the circuit by the voltage potential as would be expected. Note: in a galvanic cell, contrary to what occurs in an electrolytic cell, no anions flow to the anode, the internal current being entirely accounted for by the cations flowing away from it (cf drawing).

In the United States, many battery manufacturers regard the positive electrode as the anode, particularly in their technical literature.  Though technically incorrect, it does resolve the problem of which electrode is the anode in a secondary (or rechargeable) cell.  Using the traditional definition, the anode switches ends between charge and discharge cycles.

==Vacuum tube anode==
In electronic vacuum devices such as a [[cathode ray tube]], the anode is the positively charged electron collector.  In a tube, the anode is a charged positive plate that collects the electrons emitted by the cathode through electric attraction.  It also accelerates the flow of these electrons.

==Diode anode==
In a [[semiconductor]] [[diode]], the anode is the P-doped layer which initially supplies '''[[electron hole|holes]]''' to the junction.  In the junction region, the holes supplied by the anode combine with electrons supplied from the N-doped region, creating a depleted zone.  As the P-doped layer supplies holes to the depleted region, negative dope ions are left behind in the P-doped layer ('P' for positive charge-carrier ions).  This creates a base negative charge on the anode.  When a positive voltage is applied to anode of the diode from the circuit, more '''[[electron hole|holes]]''' are able to be transferred to the depleted region, and this causes the diode to become conductive, allowing current to flow through the circuit.  The terms anode and cathode should not be applied to a zener diode, since it allows flow in either direction, depending on the polarity of the applied potential (i.e. voltage).

==Sacrificial anode==
In [[cathodic protection]], a metal anode that is more reactive to the corrosive environment of the system to be protected is electrically linked to the protected system, and partially [[corrosion|corrodes]] or dissolves, which protects the metal of the system it is connected to.  As an example, an [[iron]] or [[steel]] [[hull (watercraft)|ship's hull]] may be protected by a zinc [[sacrificial anode]], which will dissolve into the seawater and prevent the hull from being corroded.  Sacrificial anodes are particularly needed for systems where a [[electrostatics|static charge]] is generated by the action of flowing liquids, such as pipelines and watercraft.

In 1824 to reduce the impact of this destructive electrolytic action on ships hulls, their fastenings and underwater equipment, the Victorian scientist-engineer Sir Humphry Davy, developed the first and still most widely used marine electrolysis protection system. Davy installed sacrificial anodes made from a more electrically reactive (less noble) metal attached to the vessel hull and electrically connected to form a cathodic protection circuit.

A less obvious example of this type of protection is the process of [[galvanise|galvanising]] iron (though the name of the process provides the essential clue).  This process coats iron structures (such as fencing) with a coating of [[zinc]] metal.  As long as the zinc remains intact, the iron is protected from the effects of corrosion.  Inevitably, the zinc coating becomes breached, either by cracking or physical damage.  Once this occurs, corrosive elements act as an electrolyte and the zinc/iron combination as electrodes.  The resultant current ensures that the zinc coating is sacrificed but that the base iron does not corrode.  Such a coating can potentially protect an iron structure for a few decades, but once the protecting coating is consumed, the iron rapidly corrodes.

At least one anode is found in tank-type water heaters. The anode should be removed and checked after 5 years (sooner if there is a sodium based water softner inline), and replaced if 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;inches) or more of bare wire is showing. This will greatly extend the life of the tank.

==Related antonym==
The opposite of an anode is a [[cathode]].  When the current through the device is reversed, the [[electrodes]] switch functions, so anode becomes cathode, while cathode becomes anode, as long as the reversed current is applied, with the exception of diodes where electrode naming is always based on the forward current direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Analog''' (or '''analogue''') '''television''' encodes [[television]] picture and sound information and transmits it as an [[analog signal]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/tech-guidance/tv_tech_platform_code.pdf|title=Television Technical Performance Code|work=Publication date December 2006|publisher=Ofcom - office of Communications|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in which the message conveyed by the broadcast [[Signal (information theory)|signal]] is a function of deliberate variations in the amplitude and/or [[frequency]] of the signal. All systems preceding [[digital television]] were analog television systems.
{{image|OTVbelweder-front.jpg|thumb|right| Early Monochrome Analog receiver}}

==Development ==
The earliest [[mechanical television]] systems used spinning disks with patterns of holes punched into the disc to &quot;scan&quot; an image. A similar disk reconstructed the image at the receiver. Synchronization of the receiver disc rotation was handled through sync pulses broadcast with the image information. However these mechanical systems were slow, the images were dim and flickered severely, and the image resolution very low. Camera systems used similar spinning discs and required intensely bright illumination of the subject for the light detector to work.

Analog television did not really begin as an industry until the development of the [[cathode-ray tube]], which uses a steered electron beam to &quot;write&quot; lines of electrons across a [[phosphor]] coated surface. The electron beam could be swept across the screen much faster than any mechanical disc system, allowing for more closely spaced scan lines and much higher image resolution, while slow-fade phosphors removed image flicker effects. Also far less maintenance was required of an all-electronic system compared to a spinning disc system.

===Standards===
{{see|Television station}}
Broadcasters using analog television systems encode their signal using [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]] analog encoding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/conGlossary.252|title=TV Technology PAL|work=Publication date unknown|publisher=Thinkbox|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then modulate this signal onto a [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] carrier. Each frame of a television image is composed of lines drawn on the screen. The lines are of varying brightness; the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image. The next sequential frame is displayed, allowing the depiction of motion. The analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal. 

In many countries, over-the-air broadcast of analog television signals is being discontinued, to allow the re-use of the television broadcast [[radio spectrum]] for other services. 

The first commercial analog television systems were [[monochrome]]; they were enhanced to include color beginning in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blcolortelevision.htm|title=Color Television History|work=Publication date unknown|publisher=About.com|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A practical television system needs to take luminance, chrominance (in a color system), synchronization (horizontal and vertical), and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] signals, and [[broadcast]] them over a [[radio]] transmission. The transmission system must include a means of [[television channel|channel]] selection.

Analog [[broadcast television systems]] come in a variety of frame rates and resolutions. Further differences exist in the frequency and modulation of the audio carrier. The [[Broadcast television systems#List_of_analogue_television_systems|monochrome combinations]] still existing in the 1950s are standardized by the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] as capital letters A through N. When color television was introduced, the hue and saturation information was added to the monochrome signals in a way that black &amp; white televisions ignore. This way backwards compatibility was achieved. That concept is true for all analog television standards.

However there are three standards for the way the additional color information can be encoded and transmitted. The first was the American [[NTSC]] (National Television Systems Committee) [[color television]] system. The European/Australian [[PAL]] (Phase Alternation Line rate) and the French-Former Soviet Union [[SECAM]] (Séquentiel Couleur Avec Mémoire) standard were developed later and attempt to cure certain defects of the NTSC system. PAL's color encoding is similar to the NTSC systems. SECAM, though, uses a different modulation approach than PAL or NTSC.

In principle all three color encoding systems can be combined with any scan line/frame rate combination. Therefore, in order to describe a given signal completely, it's necessary to quote the color system and the broadcast standard as capital letter. For example the United States uses NTSC-M, the UK uses PAL-I, France uses SECAM-L, much of Western Europe and Australia uses PAL-B/G, most of Eastern Europe uses PAL-D/K or SECAM-D/K and so on.

However not all of these possible combinations actually exist. NTSC is currently ''only'' used with system M, even though there were experiments with NTSC-A (405 line) and NTSC-I (625 line) in the UK. PAL is used with a variety of 625-line standards (B,G,D,K,I,N) but also with the North American 525-line standard, accordingly named [[PAL-M]]. Likewise, SECAM is used with a variety of 625-line standards.

For this reason many people refer to any 625/25 type signal as &quot;PAL&quot; and to any 525/30 signal as &quot;NTSC&quot;, even when referring to digital signals, for example, on [[DVD-Video]] which don't contain any analog color encoding, thus no PAL or NTSC signals at all. Even though this usage is common, it is misleading as that is not the original meaning of the terms PAL/SECAM/NTSC.

Although a number of different [[broadcast television systems]] were in use worldwide, the same principles of operation apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.paradiso-design.net/TVsystems_worldwide.html|title=Color subcarrier frequency and TV Standards/TV Systems|work=Publication dates 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 last updated 2005/12/15|publisher=Paradiso Design|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displaying an image===
A [[cathode-ray tube|CRT]] television displays an image by scanning a beam of [[electrons]] across the screen in a pattern of horizontal lines known as a [[raster scan|raster]]. At the end of each line the beam returns to the start of the next line; at the end of the last line it returns to the top of the screen. As it passes each point the intensity of the beam is varied, varying the [[luminance]] of that point. A [[color television]] system is identical except that an additional signal known as [[chrominance]] controls the color of the spot.

Raster scanning is shown in a slightly simplified form below.

[[Image:Raster-scan.svg]]

When analog television was developed, no affordable technology for storing any video signals existed; the luminance signal has to be generated and transmitted at the same time at which it is displayed on the CRT. It is therefore essential to keep the raster scanning in the camera (or other device for producing the signal) in exact [[synchronization]] with the scanning in the television.

The physics of the CRT require that a finite time interval is allowed for the spot to move back to the start of the next line (''horizontal retrace'') or the start of the screen (''vertical retrace''). The timing of the luminance signal must allow for this.

The human eye has a characteristic called [[Persistence of vision]]. Quickly displaying successive scan images will allow the apparent [[illusion]] of smooth motion. Flickering of the image can be partially solved using a long [[persistence]] phosphor coating on the CRT, so that successive images fade slowly. However, slow phosphor has the negative side-effect of causing image smearing and blurring when there is a large amount of rapid on-screen motion occurring.

The maximum [[frame rate]] depends on the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the electronics and the transmission system, and the number of horizontal scan lines in the image. A frame rate of 25 or 30 [[hertz]] is a satisfactory compromise, while the process of [[interlacing]] two fields of the picture per frame is used to build the image. This process doubles the apparent number of fields per second and further reduces flicker and other defects in transmission. 
{{image|TV screen close-up.jpg|thumb|right| Close up image of analog colour screen}}

===Other types of display screens===

{{see|Plasma display}}
{{see|Liquid crystal display}}
[[Plasma screens]] and [[LCD]] screens have been used in analog television receivers. These types of display screens use lower voltages than older CRT displays. Many dual system television receivers, equipped with both digital [[Freeview]] and analog receiving capability were produced with a CRT display.

==Receiving signals==
The television system for each country will specify a number of ''channels'' within the [[UHF]] or [[VHF]] frequency ranges. A channel actually consists of two signals: the picture information is transmitted using [[amplitude modulation]] on one frequency, and the sound is transmitted with [[frequency modulation]] at a frequency at a fixed offset (typically 4.5 to 6&amp;nbsp;MHz) from the picture signal.

The channel frequencies chosen represent a compromise between allowing enough [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for video (and hence satisfactory picture resolution), and allowing enough channels to be packed into the available frequency band. In practice a technique called [[vestigial sideband]] is used to reduce the channel spacing, which would be at least twice the video bandwidth if purely AM was used.

Signal reception is invariably done via a [[superheterodyne receiver]]: the first stage is a ''tuner'' which selects a channel and frequency-shifts it to a fixed [[intermediate frequency]] (IF). Signal [[amplifier|amplification]] (from the microvolt range to fractions of a volt) is then performed largely by the IF stages.

===Extracting the sound===
At this point the IF signal consists of a video [[carrier wave|carrier]] at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A [[demodulator]] recovers the video signal and sound as an FM signal at the offset frequency (this is known as ''intercarrier sound'').

The FM sound carrier is then demodulated, amplified, and used to drive a loudspeaker. Until the advent of [[NICAM]], and [[MTS]], sound transmission was invariably monophonic.

===Stereo vs. [[Surround Sound]]===
To hear the voices over the [[surround sound]]s back ground music, BOTH the TV and set the cable box AUDIO settings to &quot;SURROUND SOUND.&quot;  Some cable boxes label this settings as &quot;ADVANCED.&quot;

To hear the voices over the [[surround sound]]s back ground music, set the cable box AUDIO settings to &quot;STEREO&quot; from the default setting of  &quot;ADVANCED.&quot;   

Most of the voice dialogue audio stays in the FRONT CENTER, FRONT RIGHT, and FRONT LEFT speakers. The ADVANCED settings is intended to send background [[surround sound]]s to remote speakers (sides, back, etc).  

A mis-match of settings (that is one in &quot;SURROUND SOUND&quot; and one NOT in &quot;SURROUND SOUND&quot;, causes programs with background music sound like a &quot;music video&quot;, and hearing the dialogue becomes almost impossible. When the ADVANCED setting is used on a TV without the [[surround sound]] FRONT CENTER, FRONT RIGHT, and FRONT LEFT speakers, the background sounds can be much too loud and over power the with the voice dialogue audio.

===Structure of a video signal===
The video carrier is demodulated to give a [[composite video]] signal; this contains luminance (brightness), chrominance (color) and synchronization signals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tek.com/Measurement/App_Notes/25_7075/eng/25W_7075_3.pdf?wt=480&amp;wtwi=2217&amp;wtla=EN&amp;wtty=TI&amp;wtsty=Primer&amp;wtpt=DETAILS&amp;wtlit=25W-7075-3&amp;wtcat=signal+generators&amp;wtti=PAL+Video+Measurements|title=Pal systems - Television measurements|work=Publication date September 1999|publisher=Tektronics Incorporated|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is identical to the video signal format used by [[analog video]] devices such as [[VCRs]] or [[closed-circuit television|CCTV cameras]]. Note that the RF signal modulation is inverted compared to the conventional AM: the minimum video signal level corresponds to maximum carrier amplitude, and vice versa. The carrier is never shut off altogether; this is to ensure that intercarrier sound demodulation can still occur.

[[Image:Video-line.svg|alt=Diagram showing video signal amplitude against time.]]

Each line of the displayed image is transmitted using a signal as shown above. The same basic format (with minor differences mainly related to timing and the encoding of color) is used for [[PAL]], [[NTSC]] and [[SECAM]] television systems. A monochrome signal is identical to a color one, with the exception that the elements shown in color in the diagram (the color burst, and the chrominance signal) are not present.

===Monochrome video signal extraction===
The luminance component of a composite video signal varies between 0&amp;nbsp;V and approximately 0.7&amp;nbsp;V above the 'black' level. In the NTSC system, there is a ''blanking'' signal level used during the front porch and back porch, and a ''black'' signal level 75&amp;nbsp;mV above it; in PAL and SECAM these are identical.

In a monochrome receiver the luminance signal is amplified to drive the [[control grid]] in the [[electron gun]] of the CRT. This changes the intensity of the electron beam and therefore the brightness of the spot being scanned. Brightness and contrast controls determine the DC shift and amplification, respectively.

===Color video signal extraction===
{{image|Burnt-in timecode.jpg|thumb|right| Colour bar generator test signal}}
A color signal conveys picture information for each of the red, green, and blue components of an image (see the article on [[Color space]] for more information). However, these are not simply transmitted as three separate signals, because:
* such a signal would not be compatible with monochrome receivers (an important consideration when color broadcasting was first introduced)
* it would occupy three times the bandwidth of existing television, requiring a decrease in the number of channels available
* typical problems with signal transmission (such as differing received signal levels between different colors) would produce unpleasant side-effects.

Instead, the RGB signals are converted into [[YUV]] form, where the Y signal represents the overall brightness, and can be transmitted as the luminance signal. This ensures a monochrome receiver will display a correct picture. The U and V signals are the difference between the Y signal and the B and R signals respectively. The U signal then represents how 'blue' the color is, and the V signal how 'red' it is. The advantage of this scheme is that the U and V signals are zero when the picture has no color content. As the eye is more sensitive to errors in luminance than in color, the U and V signals can be transmitted in a relatively [[lossy compression|lossy]] (specifically: bandwidth-limited) way with acceptable results. The G signal is not transmitted in the YUV system but is recovered algebraically at the receiving end.{{image|Waveform monitor.jpg|thumb|right|Colour signals mixed with video signal}}

In the [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] color systems, U and V are transmitted by adding a ''color subcarrier'' to the composite video signal, and using [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] on it. In NTSC, the subcarrier is at approximately 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz, in the PAL system it is roughly 4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz these frequencies are within the luminance signal band, but the exact frequency is chosen so that it is midway between two harmonics of the line repetition rate, thus ensuring that the majority of the energy of the luminance signal does not overlap with the energy of the chroma signal.

In the U.K. PAL (D) system the actual frequency is 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz, a direct multiple of the scan rate frequency. This frequency was chosen to minimise the chroma [[beat]] interference pattern which is visible in areas of high color saturation in the transmitted picture. 

The two signals (U and V) modulate both the [[amplitude]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the color carrier, so to demodulate them it is necessary to have a reference signal against which to compare it. For this reason a short burst of reference signal known as the ''color burst'' is transmitted during the back porch (re-trace period) of each scan line. A reference oscillator in the receiver locks onto this signal (see [[phase-locked loop]]) to achieve a phase reference, and uses its amplitude to set an [[Automatic gain control|AGC]] system to achieve an amplitude reference.

The U and V signals are then demodulated by band-pass filtering to retrieve the color subcarrier, mixing it with the in-phase and [[quadrature phase|quadrature]] signals from the reference oscillator, and low-pass filtering the results.
[[File:Hanoverbars without PAL delay.png|thumb|right|Test card showing &quot;Hanover Bars&quot; (colour banding phase effect) in Pal S (simple) signal mode of transmission.]]
NTSC uses this process unmodified; unfortunately this often results in poor color reproduction due to phase errors in the received signal. The PAL D (delay) system corrects this by reversing the phase of the signal on each successive line and averaging the result over pairs of lines. This process is achieved by the use of a 1H (where H = horizontal scan frequency) duration delay line. (A typical circuit used with this device converts the low frequency color signal to ultrasonic sound and back again). Phase shift errors between successive lines are therefore cancelled out and the wanted signal amplitude is increased when the two in-phase ([[coincident]]) signals are re-combined.

In the [[SECAM]] television system, U and V are transmitted on ''alternate'' lines, using simple [[frequency modulation]] of the color subcarrier.

In analog color CRT displays the brightness control signal ([[luminance]]) is fed to the [[cathode]] connections of the electron guns, and the color difference signals ([[chrominance]]) are fed to the control grids connections. This simple matrix mixing technique was replaced in later [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] designs of signal processing.

==Synchronization==
Synchronizing pulses added to the video signal at the end of every [[scan line]] and video frame ensure that the sweep oscillators in the receiver remain locked in step with the transmitted signal, so that the image can be reconstructed on the receiver screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;tveng&quot;&gt;

A ''sync separator'' circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync. (see section below - Other technical information, for extra detail.)

===Horizontal synchronization ===
The horizontal synchronization pulse (''horizontal sync'' ''HSYNC''), separates the [[scan line]]s. The horizontal sync signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. The rest of the [[scan line]] follows, with the signal ranging from 0.3&amp;nbsp;V (black) to 1&amp;nbsp;V (white), until the next horizontal or [[vertical synchronization pulse]].

The format of the horizontal sync pulse varies. In the 525-line [[NTSC]] system it is a 4.85&amp;nbsp;[[microsecond|µs]]-long pulse at 0&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]]. In the 625-line [[PAL]] system the pulse is 4.7&amp;nbsp;µs synchronization pulse at 0&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]] . This is lower than the amplitude of any video signal (''blacker than black'') so it can be detected by the level-sensitive &quot;sync stripper&quot; circuit of the receiver.

===Vertical synchronization ===
Vertical synchronization (Also ''vertical sync'' or ''V-SYNC'') separates the video fields. In PAL and NTSC, the vertical sync pulse occurs within the [[vertical blanking interval]]. The vertical sync pulses are made by prolonging the length of HSYNC pulses through almost the entire length of the scan line. 

The ''vertical sync'' signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or mid-way through).

The format of such a signal in 525-line [[NTSC]] is: 
* pre-equalizing pulses (6 to start scanning odd lines, 5 to start scanning even lines)
* long-sync pulses (5 pulses)
* post-equalizing pulses (5 to start scanning odd lines, 4 to start scanning even lines)

Each pre- or post- equalizing pulse consists in half a [[scan line]] of black signal: 2&amp;nbsp;µs at 0&amp;nbsp;V, followed by 30&amp;nbsp;µs at 0.3&amp;nbsp;V.

Each long sync pulse consists in an equalizing pulse with timings inverted: 30&amp;nbsp;µs at 0&amp;nbsp;V, followed by 2&amp;nbsp;µs at 0.3&amp;nbsp;V.

In video production and computer graphics, changes to the image are often kept in step with the vertical synchronization pulse to avoid visible discontinuity of the image. Since the [[frame buffer]] of a [[computer graphics]] display imitates the dynamics of a cathode-ray display, if it is updated with a new image while the image is being transmitted to the display, the display shows a mishmash of both frames, producing a [[page tearing]] [[digital artifact|artifact]] partway down the image.

Vertical synchronization eliminates this by timing frame buffer fills to coincide with the [[vertical blanking interval]], thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as [[computer game]]s and [[Computer aided design|CAD]] packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the vertical blanking interval. This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. [[Triple buffering]] reduces this latency significantly.

Two timing intervals are defined - the ''front porch'' between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the ''back porch'' after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the ''horizontal blanking'' (or ''retrace'') ''interval'' and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.

===Horizontal hold and vertical hold===
The lack of precision timing components available in early television receivers meant that the timebase circuits occasionally needed manual adjustment. The adjustment took the form of ''horizontal hold'' and ''vertical hold'' controls, usually on the rear of the set. Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.

== Transition to digital broadcasts==
{{main|Digital television transition}}
{{main|Digital television}}

As of late 2009, ten countries had completed the process of turning off analog terrestrial broadcasting. Many other countries had plans to do so or were in the process of a staged conversion. The first country to make a wholesale [[digital television transition|switch]] to digital over-the-air (terrestrial) broadcasting was [[Luxembourg]] in 2006, followed later in 2006 by [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]; in 2007 by [[Finland]], [[Andorra]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]]; in 2008 by [[Flanders|Belgium (Flanders)]] and [[Germany]]; in 2009 by the [[United States]] (high power only), [[Isle of Man]], [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]]. In 2010, [[Wallonia| Belgium (Wallonia)]], [[Spain]], [[Wales]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Channel Islands]] and [[Slovenia]]; in 2011 [[Israel]] completed the transition. [[Croatia]] is fully covered with digital signal and the last analog region shut down in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/8593948.stm Wales becomes first UK digital TV nation with switch]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, high-power over-the-air broadcasts are solely in the [[ATSC]] digital format since June 12, 2009, the date that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) set for the end of all high-power analog TV transmissions. As a result, almost two million households could no longer watch TV because they were not prepared for the transition. The switchover was originally scheduled for February 17, 2009, until the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] passed the [[DTV Delay Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Stephanie Condon |title=Senate OKs delay of digital TV transition |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10150551-38.html |date=January 26, 2009 |publisher=[[CNET News]] |accessdate=2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By special dispensation, some analog TV signals ceased on the original date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601067.html Across Nation, Some TV Stations Go Digital Tonight]&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of the viewers of over-the-air broadcasting in the USA watch full-power stations (which number about 1800), there are three other categories of TV stations in the US: [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power stations]], [[Class A television service|Class A stations]], and [[Broadcast relay station|TV translator stations]]. There is presently no deadline for these stations, about 7100 in number, to convert to digital broadcasting.

In Japan, the switch to digital is scheduled to happen July 24, 2011. In Canada, it is scheduled to happen August 31, 2011. China is scheduled to switch in 2015. In the United Kingdom, the digital switchover has different times for each part of the country; however, the whole of the UK will be digital by 2012. Brazil switched to digital on December 2, 2007 in major cities and it is estimated it will take seven years for complete signal expansion over all of the Brazilian territory. Australia will turn off analog signals between 2010 and 2013, region by region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalready.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malaysia, the Malaysian Communications &amp; Multimedia Commission (MCMC) advertised for tender bids to be submitted in the third quarter of 2009 for the UHF 470–742&amp;nbsp;MHz [[radio spectrum]] allocation, to enable the countrys` broadcast system to progress into the digital television era. The new [[broadcast band]] allocation would result in the winner having to build an [[infrastructure]] for all broadcasters, using a single digital terrestrial transmission/TV broadcast (DTTB) channel. Users may then [[encode]] and transmit their TV programs on this channels` digital data stream. The winner was to be announced at the end of 2009 or early 2010. A condition of the award is that digital transmission must start as soon as possible, and analoge switch-off was proposed for 2015. The scheme may not go ahead as the Government successor, [[Najib Tun Razak]] deferred the transition indefinitely in favor of his own [[1Malaysia]] concept, which means that analogue television will continue for longer than originally planned.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
