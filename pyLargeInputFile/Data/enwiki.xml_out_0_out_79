Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident for some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behaviour of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been beforehand excluded as measure imprecision and simple &quot;[[noise]]&quot; was considered by chaos theories as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems.

[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turbulence]] in the [[Wingtip vortices|tip vortex]] from an [[airplane]] wing. Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence was important for Chaos theory, analyzed for example by the Soviet physicist [[Lev Landau]] who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

An early pioneer of the theory was [[Edward Lorenz]] whose interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Lorenz, &quot;Deterministic non-periodic flow,&quot; ''Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences'', vol.&amp;nbsp;20, pages 130–141 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He was able to do this by entering a printout of the data corresponding to conditions in the middle of his simulation which he had calculated last time.

To his surprise the weather that the machine began to predict was completely different from the weather calculated before. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 was printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have had practically no effect. However Lorenz had discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in the long-term outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]|last=Gleick|first=James|year=1987|publisher=Cardinal|location=London|page=17|isbn=043429554X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot in general make long-term weather predictions. Weather is usually predictable only about a week ahead.&lt;ref name=&quot;RGW&quot;/&gt;

The year before, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Benoît|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394–419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand, he had studied [[information theory]] and concluded noise was patterned like a [[Cantor set]]: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Berger and B. Mandelbrot (July 1963) &quot;A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits,&quot; ''I.B.M. Journal of Research and Development'', vol 7, pages 224–236.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot described both the &quot;Noah effect&quot; (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the &quot;Joseph effect&quot; (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).&lt;ref&gt;B. Mandelbrot, ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature'' (N.Y., N.Y.: Freeman, 1977), page 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Benoît B. Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson, ''The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward'' (N.Y., N.Y.: Basic Books, 2004), page 201.&lt;/ref&gt; This challenged the idea that changes in price were [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. In 1967, he published &quot;[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension]]&quot;, showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an [[infinitesimal]]ly small measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;Benoît Mandelbrot (5 May 1967) &quot;How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension,&quot; ''Science'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;156, No.&amp;nbsp;3775, pages 636–638.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that a ball of twine appears to be a point when viewed from far away (0-dimensional), a ball when viewed from fairly near (3-dimensional), or a curved strand (1-dimensional), he argued that the dimensions of an object are relative to the observer and may be fractional. An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales (&quot;self-similarity&quot;) is a [[fractal]] (for example, the [[Koch curve]] or &quot;snowflake&quot;, which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has [[fractal dimension]] equal to circa 1.2619, the [[Menger sponge]] and the [[Sierpiński gasket]]). In 1975 Mandelbrot published ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'', which became a classic of chaos theory. Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.

Chaos was observed by a number of experimenters before it was recognized; e.g., in 1927 by van der Pol&lt;ref&gt;B. van der Pol and J. van der Mark (1927) &quot;Frequency demultiplication,&quot; ''Nature'', vol.&amp;nbsp;120, pages 363–364. See also: Van der Pol oscillator&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1958 by R.L. Ives.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Ives (10 October 1958) &quot;Neon oscillator rings,&quot; ''Electronics'', vol.&amp;nbsp;31, pages 108–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See p. 83 of Lee W. Casperson, &quot;Gas laser instabilities and their interpretation,&quot; pages 83–98 in: N.&amp;nbsp;B. Abraham, F.&amp;nbsp;T. Arecchi, and L.&amp;nbsp;A. Lugiato, eds., ''Instabilities and Chaos in Quantum Optics II: Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute, Il Ciocco, Italy, June 28–July 7, 1987'' (N.Y., N.Y.: Springer Verlag, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a graduate student in [[Chihiro Hayashi]]'s laboratory at Kyoto University, [[Yoshisuke Ueda]] was experimenting with analog computers (that is, vacuum tubes) and noticed, on Nov. 27, 1961, what he called &quot;randomly transitional phenomena&quot;.  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph H. Abraham and Yoshisuke Ueda, eds., ''The Chaos Avant-Garde: Memoirs of the Early Days of Chaos Theory'' (Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Co., 2001).

In December 1977 the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on Chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term &quot;chaos&quot; as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]] (a physicist, part of the [[Eudaemons]] group with [[J. Doyne Farmer]] and [[Norman Packard]] who tried to find a mathematical method to beat [[roulette]], and then created with them the [[Dynamical Systems Collective]] in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]]), and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz.

The following year, [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] published the noted article &quot;Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations&quot;, where he described logistic maps.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Feigenbaum (July 1978) &quot;Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations,&quot; ''Journal of Statistical Physics'', vol.&amp;nbsp;19, no.&amp;nbsp;1, pages 25–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Feigenbaum had applied [[fractal geometry]] to the study of natural forms such as coastlines. Feigenbaum notably discovered the universality in chaos, permitting an application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[convection|convective]] [[Rayleigh–Benard systems]]. He was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] in 1986 along with [[Mitchell J. Feigenbaum]] &quot;for his brilliant experimental demonstration of the transition to turbulence and chaos in dynamical systems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&amp;cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1986 the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on Chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Huberman, &quot;A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement&quot; Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Vol.&amp;nbsp;504 Page 260 July 1987, Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''&lt;ref&gt;Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld, &quot;Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise,&quot; ''Physical Review Letters'', vol.&amp;nbsp;59, no.&amp;nbsp;4, pages 381–384 (27 July 1987). However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web |url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html  |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}. See especially: Lasse Laurson, Mikko J. Alava, and Stefano Zapperi, &quot;Letter: Power spectra of self-organized critical sand piles,&quot; ''Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment'', 0511, L001 (15 September 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; describing for the first time [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC), considered to be one of the mechanisms by which [[complexity]] arises in nature.
Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behaviour. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including: [[earthquakes]] (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behaviour such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Omori (1894) &quot;On the aftershocks of earthquakes,&quot; ''Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo'', vol.&amp;nbsp;7, pages 111–200.&lt;/ref&gt; describing the frequency of aftershocks); [[solar flares]]; fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial markets]] (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]); [[landscape formation]]; [[forest fires]]; [[landslides]]; [[epidemics]]; and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of &quot;[[punctuated equilibria]]&quot; put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Worryingly,{{Why?|date=December 2010}} given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[wars]]. These &quot;applied&quot; investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

The same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''Chaos: Making a New Science'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public. At first the domain of work of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many &quot;chaologists&quot; (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by J. Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory continues to be a very active area of research, involving many different disciplines (mathematics, [[topology]], physics, population biology, biology, meteorology, astrophysics, information theory, etc.).

==Distinguishing random from chaotic data==
It can be difficult to tell from data whether a physical or other observed process is random or chaotic, because in practice no time series consists of pure 'signal.' There will always be some form of corrupting noise, even if it is present as round-off or truncation error. Thus any real time series, even if mostly deterministic, will contain some randomness.&lt;ref name=prov&gt;Provenzale A. et al.: &quot;Distinguishing between low-dimensional dynamics and randomness in measured time-series&quot;, in: Physica D, 58:31–49, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock, W. A., &quot;Distinguishing random and deterministic systems: Abridged version,&quot; ''[[Journal of Economic Theory]]'' 40, October 1986, 168-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

All methods for distinguishing deterministic and stochastic processes rely on the fact that a deterministic system always evolves in the same way from a given starting point.&lt;ref name=prov /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sugihara G. and May R. (1990) [http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/~george/publications/90_nonlinear_forecasting.pdf &quot;Nonlinear forecasting as a way of distinguishing chaos from measurement error in time series&quot;] ''Nature,'' '''344''':734–741.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, given a time series to test for determinism, one can:
#pick a test state;
#search the time series for a similar or 'nearby' state; and
#compare their respective time evolutions.

Define the error as the difference between the time evolution of the 'test' state and the time evolution of the nearby state. A deterministic system will have an error that either remains small (stable, regular solution) or increases exponentially with time (chaos). A stochastic system will have a randomly distributed error.&lt;ref&gt;Casdagli, Martin. &quot;Chaos and Deterministic ''versus'' Stochastic Non-linear Modelling&quot;, in: ''Journal Royal Statistics Society'': Series B, 54, nr. 2 (1991), 303-28&lt;!-- Spelled &quot;Modelling&quot; in print, and ''versus'' in italics. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially all measures of determinism taken from time series rely upon finding the closest states to a given 'test' state (e.g., correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponents, etc.). To define the state of a system one typically relies on phase space embedding methods.&lt;ref&gt;Broomhead D. S. and King G. P.: &quot;Extracting Qualitative Dynamics from Experimental Data&quot;, in: Physica 20D, 217–36, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically one chooses an embedding dimension, and investigates the propagation of the error between two nearby states. If the error looks random, one increases the dimension. If you can increase the dimension to obtain a deterministic looking error, then you are done. Though it may sound simple it is not really. One complication is that as the dimension increases the search for a nearby state requires a lot more computation time and a lot of data (the amount of data required increases exponentially with embedding dimension) to find a suitably close candidate. If the embedding dimension (number of measures per state) is chosen too small (less than the 'true' value) deterministic data can appear to be random but in theory there is no problem choosing the dimension too large – the method will work.

When a non-linear deterministic system is attended by external fluctuations, its trajectories present serious and permanent distortions. Furthermore, the noise is amplified due to the inherent non-linearity and reveals totally new dynamical properties. Statistical tests attempting to separate noise from the deterministic skeleton or inversely isolate the deterministic part risk failure. Things become worse when the deterministic component is a non-linear feedback system.&lt;ref&gt;Kyrtsou, C., (2008). Re-examining the sources of heteroskedasticity: the paradigm of noisy chaotic models, ''Physica A'', 387, pp. 6785–6789.&lt;/ref&gt; In presence of interactions between nonlinear deterministic components and noise, the resulting nonlinear series can display dynamics that traditional tests for nonlinearity are sometimes not able to capture.&lt;ref&gt;Kyrtsou, C., (2005). Evidence for neglected linearity in noisy chaotic models, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 15(10), pp. 3391–3394.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of how to distinguish deterministic chaotic systems from stochastic systems has also been discussed in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Werndl, Charlotte (2009c). ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VH6-4X1GG4G-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=4433c2dcaed0b2a60cc7cbcfae7664ff&amp;searchtype=a Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent?]''. Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 40, 232-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Chaos theory has been mentioned in numerous movies and works of literature. Examples include the book ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', the film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'', the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'' and the video game [[Tom Clancy]]'s [[Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory]]. The influence of chaos theory in shaping the popular understanding of the world we live in was the subject of the BBC documentary ''High Anxieties - The Mathematics of Chaos''  directed by [[David Malone (independent filmmaker)|David Malone]]. Chaos Theory is also the subject of discussion in the BBC documentary &quot;The Secret Life of Chaos&quot; presented by the physicist [[Jim Al-Khalili]].

[[File:Montefiascone cupola.JPG|thumb|upright|Cupolas on the towers of [[Montefiascone Cathedral]], Italy]]

In [[architecture]], a '''cupola''' (pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈkjuːpələ|}}) is a small, most-often [[dome]]-like, structure on top of a building.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARCHSEE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archiseek.com/guides/glossary/c.html |title=Glossary of Architectural Terms - C|accessdate=3 January 2009 |publisher=Archiseek: Online Architecture Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often used to provide a lookout or to admit light and air, it usually crowns a larger [[roof]] or dome.&lt;ref name=&quot;DICTIONARY&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cupola |title=cupola|accessdate=17 March 2010|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition |publisher=Dictionary.com|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHATCUP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cupola.com/whatscu1.htm |title=Just what is a cupola anyway? |accessdate=3 January 2009 |work=Cupola Consulting |publisher=Cupola.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word derives, via [[Italian language|Italian]], from the lower Latin ''cupula'' (classical Latin ''cupella'' from the Greek κύπελλον ''kupellon'') small cup (Latin ''cupa'') indicating a vault resembling an upside down cup.&lt;ref&gt;In Italian cupola simply means [[dome]], and the ornamental top element is called ''lanterna''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cupolas often appear as small buildings in their own right. They often serve as a [[Bell tower|belfry]], lantern, or [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] above a main roof.  In other cases they may crown a [[tower]], [[spire]], or [[turret]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHATCUP&quot;/&gt;  The [[chhatri]], seen in [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]], fits the definition of a cupola when it is used atop a larger structure.

The cupola is a development of the [[oculus]], an ancient device found in Roman architecture but, being weatherproof, it is superior for the wetter climates of northern Europe, which were influential during the Renaissance.

The '''chupacabras'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Clave&quot;&gt;Diccionario Clave, [http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras chupacabras]. It states that both singular and plural is ''chupacabras''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-es|tʃupaˈkaβɾas}}, from ''chupar'' &quot;to suck&quot; and ''cabra'' &quot;goat&quot;, literally &quot;goat sucker&quot;) is a [[legend]]ary [[cryptid]] rumored to inhabit parts of the [[Americas]]. It is associated more recently with sightings of an allegedly unknown animal in [[Puerto Rico]] (where these sightings were first reported), Mexico, and the United States, especially in the latter's [[Latin America]]n communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latino Bigfoot&quot;/&gt; The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of [[livestock]], especially [[goat]]s. 

People are still discovering if they are [[realistic fiction]]. There  has been rumors about  the [[Chupacabra]].
No one knows if the are real or not.Its a myth they made up in [[Puerto Rico]] then the message went to [[Mexico]] about the cryptid.

Physical descriptions of the creature vary. Eyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1995 in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as [[Maine]], and as far south as [[Chile]]. It is supposedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail. 

Biologists and wildlife management officials view the chupacabras as a [[urban legend|contemporary legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miried Gonzalez Rodriguez|title=Dizfrazado el chupacabras| publisher= Primera Hora|location=Puerto Rico |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2010, an animal was killed and reported to be a chupacabra, but found to be a [[coyote]] with a severe parasite infection. In October of that year, [[University of Michigan]] scientists theorised that parasite-riddled coyotoes (specifically the parasites responsible for [[scabies]] and [[mange]]) were likely the basis for the chupacabra legend.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.discovery.com&quot;&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/animals/chupacabra-mystery-solved.html Chupacabra Mystery Solved: Discovery News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first reported attacks occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm| title=On the trail of the Chupacabras| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this attack, eight [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot;/&gt; A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot;/&gt; In 1975, similar killings in the small town of [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], were attributed to ''El Vampiro de Moca'' (The Vampire of Moca).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm| title=Encounters with Chupacabras| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was suspected that the killings were committed by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]]; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals had their bodies bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] comedian and [[entrepreneur]] [[Silverio Pérez]] is credited with coining the term ''chupacabras'' soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[United States]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot;/&gt;

==Reported sightings==
In July 2004, a rancher near [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Texas, killed a hairless [[dog]]-like creature, which was attacking his livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Walker Robinson| url=http://www.woai.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=FAE91F84-A264AC3-8EA4-9097690CDEFC| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051109030151/http://www.woai.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=FAE91F84-A264AC3-8EA4-9097690CDEFC| archivedate=November 9, 2005| title=Chupacabra? Strange Animal Found in Elmendorf| publisher=WOAI| date=August 3, 2004| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This animal, initially given the name the [[Elmendorf Beast]], was later determined by [[DNA]] assay conducted at [[University of California, Davis]] to be a [[coyote]] with demodectic or sarcoptic [[mange]]. In October 2004, two more carcasses were found in the same area. [[Biology|Biologists]] in [[Texas]] examined samples from the two carcasses and determined they were also [[coyote]]s suffering from very severe cases of [[mange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0603/art-chupacabra.htm| title=Texas' Blood-Sucking Monster| accessdate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Coleman, Texas|Coleman]], Texas, a farmer named Reggie Lagow caught an animal in a trap he set up after the deaths of a number of his [[chicken]]s and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s. The animal was described as resembling a mix of hairless dog, [[rat]], and [[kangaroo]]. Lagow provided the animal to Texas Parks and Wildlife officials for identification, but Lagow reported in a September 17, 2006 phone interview with John Adolfi, founder of the Lost World Museum, that the &quot;critter was caught on a Tuesday and thrown out in Thursday's trash.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbc4.tv/news/4895053/detail.html|title=Texas Farmer Claims He Caught Legendary 'Chupacabra'|publisher=KNBC Los Angeles|date=August 25, 2005}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, ''MosNews'' reported that the chupacabras was spotted in Russia for the first time. Reports from [[Central Federal District|Central Russia]] beginning in March 2005 tell of a beast that kills animals and sucks out their blood. 32 turkeys were killed and drained overnight. Reports later came from neighboring villages when 30 sheep were killed and had their blood drained. Finally, eyewitnesses were able to describe the chupacabras. In May 2006, experts were determined to track the animal down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2006/04/27/chupacabra.shtml|title=Chupacabra the Goatsucker Vampire Sightings Reported in Central Russia|publisher=MosNews|date=April 17, 2006}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-August 2006, Michelle O'Donnell of [[Turner, Maine|Turner]], Maine, described an &quot;evil looking&quot; rodent-like animal with fangs that had been found dead alongside a road. The animal was apparently struck by a car, and was unidentifiable. Photographs were taken and witness reports seem to be in relative agreement that the creature was canine in appearance, but in widely published photos seemed unlike any dog or [[Gray Wolf|wolf]] in the area. Photos from other angles seem to show a [[Chow Chow|chow]]- or [[akita Inu|akita]]-mixed breed dog. It was reported that &quot;the carcass was picked clean by [[vulture]]s before experts could examine it&quot;. For years, residents of [[Maine]] have reported a mysterious creature and a string of dog maulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MYSTERY_BEAST?SITE=WWL&amp;TEMPLATE=STRANGEHEADS.html&amp;SECTION=HOME| title='Hybrid Mutant' Found Dead in Maine|work=Associated Press|date=August 16, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, a series of reports on national [[Colombia]] news reported more than 300 dead sheep in the region of [[Department of Boyacá|Boyaca]], and the capture of a possible specimen to be analyzed by [[zoology|zoologists]] at the [[National University of Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/nacion/boyaca/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3539469.html| title=''Bestia' chupasangre asusta a los campesinos de Chiscas: ha matado 310 animales'|publisher=El Tiempo|date=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MysteryCreature (Chupacabra).jpg|right|thumb|150px|Alleged chupacabra (representing the less common &quot;dog-like&quot; description) caught on video in DeWitt County, Texas, August 2008.]] --&gt;

In August 2007, [[Cuero, Texas#Sighting of Chupacabra in 2007 and 2008|Phylis Canion]] found three animals in [[Cuero, Texas|Cuero]], Texas. She and her neighbors reported to have discovered three strange animal carcasses outside Canion's property. She took photographs of the carcasses and preserved the head of one in her freezer before turning it over for DNA analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070831/ap_on_re_us/mythical_chupacabra_1;_ylt=AnDelIZ4v5tFOrVuRPy0I_EE1vAI| title=Has a mythical beast turned up in Texas?| date=August 31, 2007}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canion reported that nearly 30 chickens on her farm had been [[Exsanguination|exsanguinated]] over a period of years, a factor which led her to connect the carcasses with the chupacabras legend. State [[Mammalogy|Mammologist]] John Young estimated that the animal in Canion's pictures was a [[Gray Fox]] suffering from an extreme case of [[mange]]. In November 2007, biology researchers at [[Texas State University–San Marcos]] determined from DNA samples that the suspicious animal was a coyote.&lt;ref name=&quot;CueroDNA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2007/11/Chupacabra110107.html| title=Texas State researchers solve mystery of Cuero chupacabra|publisher=Texas State University News Service|date=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coyote, however, had grayish-blue, mostly hairless skin and large fanged teeth, which caused it to appear different from a normal coyote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307576,00.html|title=Texas Woman Claims to Have Found Mythical 'Chupacabra'|work=Foxnews.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 27, 2009 | date=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional skin samples were taken to attempt to determine the cause of the hair loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;CueroDNA&quot;/&gt;

On January 11, 2008, a sighting was reported at the province of [[Capiz]] in the [[Philippines]]. Some of the residents from the [[barangay]] believed that it was the chupacabras that killed eight chickens. The owner of the chickens saw a dog-like animal attacking his chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view_article.php?article_id=112177| title='Blood Suckerkilling farm animals in Capiz'|publisher=Inquirer|date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On August 8, 2008, a [[DeWitt County, Texas|DeWitt County]] deputy, Brandon Riedel, filmed an unidentifiable animal along back roads near [[Cuero, Texas|Cuero]], Texas on his dashboard camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/video/index.html?referralObject=3018890|title=Legend Lives On'|publisher=FOXNews|date=August 12, 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal was about the size of a coyote but was hairless with a long snout, short front legs and long back legs. However, Reiter's boss, Sheriff Jode Zavesky, believes it may be the same species of coyote identified by [[Texas State University–San Marcos]] researchers in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2008/08/12/pkg.tx.chupucabra.kens| title='Is this Texas' goat-sucker'|publisher=CNN|date=August 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video footage was shown on an April 2011 episode of the [[Syfy]] television series ''[[Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files]]'' where an investigative team tried to recreate the dashboard video footage using a [[miniature horse]] and a [[Mexican Hairless Dog]] (both of which were bred locally). Neither test animal matched the creature in the video. The team had also tested a DNA sample taken from an alleged carcass of one of the creatures found by a local rancher which was later identified as being a hybrid wolf/coyote. 

In September 2009, [[CNN]] aired a report showing closeup video footage of an unidentified dead animal. The same CNN report stated that locals have begun speculating the possibility that this might be a chupacabras. A [[Blanco, Texas|Blanco]], [[Texas]], taxidermist reported that he received the body from a former student whose cousin had discovered the animal in his barn, where it had succumbed to poison left out for rodents. The taxidermist expressed his belief that this is a genetically mutated coyote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch CNN video report], 9/3/09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/03/animal.mystery.chupacabra/index.html Texas mystery: 'Defective coyote' or chupacabra?], CNN, September 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2009, taxidermist Jerry Ayer sold the Blanco Texas Chupacabra to the Lost World Museum. The museum, as reported in the Syracuse Post Standard on 9/26/09, is placing the creature on display as they work with a unnamed university to have the remains tested.

==Captured or killed==
On December 18, 2010, in [[Nelson County, Kentucky]], Mark Cothren shot and killed an animal that he could not recognize and feared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wave 3&quot;&gt;[http://www.wave3.com/story/13731615/mysterious-creature-found-in-nelson-county Mysterious creature found in Nelson County]&lt;/ref&gt; Many pictures of the Chupacabra were taken and the story was well documented by various news organizations. Cothren described the creature as having large ears, whiskers, a long tail, and about the size of a house cat. Cothren says he spoke with the [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources]] and handed over the preserved animal for further analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox News&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/12/28/man-shoots-kills- chupacabra-kentucky/ Man Shoots, Kills 'Chupacabra' in Ky]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 'solving' of chupacabra==

In July 2010, there were reports of chupacabras being shot dead by animal control officers in [[Hood County]], [[Texas]]. A second creature was also reportedly spotted and killed several miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/38224385#38224385 |title=msnbc.com Video Player |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blastr.com/2010/07/chupacabra-found-officer.php |title=Chupacabra found?

However, an officer of Hood County animal control said [[Texas A&amp;M University]] scientists conducted tests and identified the corpse as a &quot;[[coyote]]-[[dog]] [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]&quot; with signs of [[mange]] and internal [[parasites]]. The second reported chupacabra, shot July 9 about 8 miles south of [[Cresson, Texas|Cresson]], was eaten by [[vultures]] before it could be taken for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2010/07/14/Expert-Chupacabra-a-coyote-dog-hybrid/UPI-80031279145698/ |title=Expert: 'Chupacabra' a coyote-dog hybrid |publisher=UPI.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New information from researcher [[Benjamin Radford]] in 2010 revealed that Madelyne Tolentino, the original eyewitness, had described a creature she had recently seen in the science-fiction horror film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' as the chupacabra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford&quot;&gt;Radford, Benjamin. 2010.

ISBN 978-0-936455-11-2&lt;/ref&gt; The alien in the film, named Sil, is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account: “It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all….The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive,” Tolentino reported.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott. Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. ISBN 1883729068&lt;/ref&gt; Radford revealed that Tolentino “believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' were actually happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time,” and therefore concludes that “The popular image of the chupacabra—the one appearing on thousands of books, magazines, and Web sites as a credible eyewitness description—is in fact based on a science fiction film.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Radford&quot; /&gt; This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Benjamin. &quot;Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery&quot; ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45 - 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2010, [[University of Michigan]] biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all of the 'chupacabras' were simply coyotes infected with the parasite [[Sarcoptes scabiei]], the symptoms of which would explain most of the features of the chupacabras: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odour. O'Connor theorised the attacks on goats occurred &quot;because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;news.discovery.com&quot;/&gt;

==Appearance==
The most common description of chupacabras is a [[reptile]]-like being, appearing to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/chupa.html|title=Chupacabras Biography|accessdate=May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form stands approximately 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 m) high, and stands and hops in a similar fashion to a [[kangaroo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;top ten&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stephen Wagner| url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa010101b.htm| title=The Top 10 Most Mysterious Creatures of Modern Times | accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one sighting, the creature was reported to hop 20 feet (6 m). This variety is said to have a dog or [[Leopard|panther]]-like nose and face, a [[forked tongue]], and large fangs. It is said to hiss and screech when alarmed, as well as leave behind a [[sulfur]]ic stench.&lt;ref name=&quot;top ten&quot;/&gt; When it screeches, some reports assert that the chupacabras' eyes glow an unusual red which gives the witnesses nausea.

Another description of chupacabras, although not as common, describes a strange breed of wild dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;top ten&quot;/&gt; This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. It is claimed that this breed might be an example of a dog-like reptile. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabras is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of an upside-down triangle or through one or two holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tomás De Jesús Mangual| url=http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011110443/http://vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285| archivedate=2007-10-11| title=Imputan otro ataque al Chupacabras| publisher=El Vocero| date=January 9, 2006| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant appearances in media==
&lt;!-- ATTENTION: Long lists of your favourite TV show featuring a chupacabras aren't needed, thanks!--&gt;
The popularity of the chupacabras has resulted in it being featured in several types of media. Some mystery novels that use aspects of the myth as the centerpoint of the plot have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Lloyd. ''El Chupacabras: Trail of the Goatsucker.'' ISBN 059533315X&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds of books include those that provide a scientific explanation for the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott. ''Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries.'' ISBN 1883729068&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Authors, Mandy, and Clifton C. Phillips. ''Chupacabra, You Don't Scare Me!'' ISBN 0805944907&lt;/ref&gt; The chupacabras has been featured in films such as ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico]]'' and in independent film productions including: ''[[Chupacabra: Dark Seas]]'', starring [[John Rhys-Davies]], ''[[Guns of El Chupacabra]]'', starring [[Scott Shaw]], ''El Chupacabras'' and ''Vuelve el Chupacabras''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Welsh rock band [[Super Furry Animals]] have a song on the 1997 album &quot;Radiator&quot; called &quot;Chupacabras&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://superfurry.org/info.php?q=chupacabras&amp;t=lyrics ''Chupacabras''](lyrics). Super Furry Animals. ''Radiator'' (album). 1997&lt;/ref&gt; An entire episode of [[The X-Files]] series, ''[[El Mundo Gira]]'', is devoted to the chupacabras. A whole segment in [[Dexter's Laboratory]] is for the chupacabras in the episode called &quot;Got Your Goat&quot; from the [[List of Dexter's Laboratory episodes#ep29|Season 2]]. A Brazilian jungle monster from [[Generator Rex]] turns out to be a chupacabra. It has also been portrayed various times in the anime series [[Negima!?]].

[[CNN]]'s Ed Lavandera has described the chupacabras as the &quot;[[Bigfoot]] of [[Latin American culture|Latino culture]]&quot; and has stated that &quot;El Chupacabra also symbolizes the fear of something that doesn't exist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latino Bigfoot&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/02/lt.01.html| title=Illegal Immigrants Frightened by Raid Rumors; George Bush: &quot;The Decider&quot;; &quot;Happy Slapping&quot; | publisher=CNN| date=May 2, 2006| accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident in [[Cuero, Texas|Cuero]], Texas the popularity of the chupacabras myth was receiving global attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;craze&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kvue.com/news/top/stories/082807kvuechupacabracraze-cb.7c603ee0.html| title=Chupacabra craze goes global| publisher=KVUE| date=August 28, 2007| accessdate=October 5, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071204230222/http://www.kvue.com/news/top/stories/082807kvuechupacabracraze-cb.7c603ee0.html| archivedate = December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylis Canion, who was responsible for capturing the alleged specimen, claimed that t-shirts highlighting the event were shipped to locations such as Italy, [[Guam]], and [[Iraq]]. The publicity that Cuero received following this event has led to some suggesting changing the town's mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;craze&quot;/&gt; In July 2008, [[History (TV channel)|History]]'s [[Monster Quest]] series featured the Texas carcasses, which were determined to be dogs and coyotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsterquest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.history.com/minisites/monsterquest| title=MonsterQuest: Chupacabra| date=July 23, 2008| accessdate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming convention==
''Chupacabras'' can be translated as &quot;goat-sucker.&quot; It is known as both ''chupacabras'' and ''chupacabra'' throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word,&lt;ref name=&quot;Clave&quot;/&gt; and the latter a [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of it. The name in Spanish can be preceded by singular masculine article (''el chupacabras''), or the plural masculine article (''los chupacabras'').

==Related legends==

In the [[Philippines]], another [[legendary creature]] called the [[Sigbin]] shares many of the same descriptions as the ''Chupacabra''. The recent discovery of the [[cat-fox]] in Southeast Asia suggests that it could also have been simply sightings of this once unknown animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Meek  | first = James | title = On the trail of the Borneo cat-fox | pages = | publisher = The Guardian| date = 2005-12-07 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,13369,1660581,00.html | accessdate = 2007-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peuchen]] of [[Chile]] also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the [[vampire bat]], an animal endemic to the region.&lt;ref name=peuchen1&gt;[http://www.diarioelcentro.cl/articulos_sc.php?fecha=26-07-2004&amp;semana=29-2004 Article: Tras los pasos del chupacabras.

'''Cayuga Lake''' ({{IPA-en|keɪˈjuːɡə}} or {{IPA-en|kaɪˈjuːɡə|}})&amp;#160; is the longest of central [[New York]]'s glacial [[Finger Lakes]], and is the second largest in surface area (marginally smaller than [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]) and second largest in volume.  It is just under 40 miles (64&amp;nbsp;km) long.  Its average width is 1.7 miles (2.7&amp;nbsp;km), and it is {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=mid|wide|abbr=on}} at its widest point near Aurora.  It is approximately {{convert|435|ft|m|adj=mid|deep|abbr=on}} at its deepest point.

==Location==
The city of [[Ithaca, New York]], site of [[Ithaca College]] and [[Cornell University]], is located at the southern end of Cayuga Lake.  Cornell's [[alma mater]] or official school song makes reference to its position &quot;[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]&quot;, while that of Ithaca College references &quot;[[Cayuga’s shore]]&quot;.

Villages and settlements along the east shore of Cayuga Lake include Myers, King Ferry, [[Aurora, Cayuga County, New York|Aurora]], Levanna, [[Union Springs, New York|Union Springs]], and [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]].  Settlements along the west shore of the lake include Sheldrake, Poplar Beach, and Canoga.

The lake has one small island near Union Springs, Frontenac Island.  It is one of only two islands in the Finger Lakes.

===Geographical characteristics===
Cayuga Lake is located at {{Coord|42|41|00|N|76|41|46|W|region:US_type:waterbody}}; {{convert|116.4|m}} above sea level. Its depth, steep east and west sides with shallow north and south ends is typical of the Finger Lakes, as they were carved by [[glaciers]] during the last [[ice age]].

*Length: {{convert|61.4|km|abbr=on}}
*Average width: {{convert|2.8|km|abbr=on}}
*Maximum depth: {{convert|132|m|abbr=on}}
*Surface area: {{convert|172|km2|abbr=on}}
*Mean depth: {{convert|54.5|m|abbr=on}}
*[[drainage basin|Catchment]] area: 2,033&amp;nbsp;km² (37.1% natural forest, 58% active agricultural)
*Main islands: 1, Frontenac
*Main outflows: 1

The water level is regulated by the Mud Lock at the north end of the lake. It is connected to [[Lake Ontario]] by the [[Erie Canal]] and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] by the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]]. The lake is drawn down as winter approaches, to minimize ice damage and to maximize its capacity to store heavy spring runoff.

The north end is dominated by shallow [[mudflats]].  An important stopover for [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, the mudflats and marsh are the location of the [[Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge]].

The southern end is also shallow and often freezes during the winter.

===Human impact===
[[Image:CayugaLake.jpg|left|thumb|325px|Winter view of the head of Cayuga Lake]]
The fish population is managed and substantial sport fishing is practiced, including [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]], [[lake trout]] and [[smallmouth bass]] fishing.

Cayuga Lake is very popular among recreational boaters.  A large state marina and boat launch is located at the southern end of the lake in [[Ithaca, NY|Ithaca]] ([[Allan H. Treman State Marine Park]], the largest inland marina in New York).  There are two yacht clubs on the western shore: Ithaca Yacht Club a few miles north of Ithaca, and Red Jacket Yacht Club just south of Canoga. There are several other marinas and boat launches scattered along the lake shore.

The lake is used for drinking water, although this is no longer legal and very uncommon. There are also several [[Deep lake water cooling|lake source cooling]] systems that are in operation on the lake, whereby cooler water is pumped from the depths of the lake, warmed, and circulated in a closed system back to the surface. One of these systems, which is operated by Cornell University and began operation in 2000, was controversial during the planning and building states for potential negative environmental impact.  All the environmental impact reports and scientific studies have shown that the Cornell lake source cooling system has not yet had and will not likely have any measurably significant environmental impact. Furthermore, Cornell's system pumps significantly less warm water back into the lake than others further north which have been operating for decades, including the coal-fired power plant on the eastern shore.{{Fact|date=July 2010}}

The AES Cayuga electrical generating station operates in the Town of Lansing, on the east shore of Cayuga Lake. This coal-fired plant uses Cayuga Lake as a cooling source.  In the late 1960s, citizens successfully opposed the construction of an 830-MW nuclear power plant on the shore of Cayuga Lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ107899&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ107899  &quot;The Role of Experts in a Nuclear Siting Controversy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MD4cPQAmF7oC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=Cayuga+Lake+nuclear+power&amp;source=web&amp;ots=f9NO88vkjr&amp;sig=DsaBb6otYOvd6rj5zl2N6ZEVhXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA262,M1 Chain Reaction] pp. 262-264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990).

''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==
The lake is the subject of local folklore; a tradition at [[Wells College]] in Aurora holds that if the lake completely freezes over, classes are canceled (though for only one day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = The Student Life Office| title = Wells College Student Traditions| work = Wells College (Official Site) | publisher = Wells College| date = 2007| url = http://www.wells.edu/slife/sttrads.htm| accessdate =2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Wells College records, this last happened in 1979.  However, other sources suggest that the only time the entire lake froze over in the 20th century was in 1912.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Cayuga Lake, like nearby [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], is also the site of a phenomenon known as the [[Guns of the Seneca]], mysterious cannon-like booms heard in the surrounding area. Many of these booms may be  attributable to [[Bird_scarer#Propane_gas_gun|bird-scarers]], automated cannon-like devices used by farmers to scare birds away from the many vineyards, orchards and crops. There is however no proof of this.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[Rod Serling]] named his production company Cayuga Productions during the years of his TV series, ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''.  Serling and his family had a summer home at Cayuga Lake.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rodserling.com/FAQ.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia is the oldest institution of higher learning in the [[New York|state of New York]], the fifth oldest in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/shaping_the_world/index.html |title= The Course of History |publisher=Columbia University |year=2004 |accessdate=2004-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the country's nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the [[American Revolution]]. Today the University operates four global centers overseas in [[Amman]], Jordan; [[Beijing]], China; [[Paris]], France; and [[Mumbai]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | rul=http://globalcenters.columbia.edu/globa-centers | title= Columbia University Global Centers | publisher= Columbia University | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University was founded in 1754 as King's College by [[royal charter]] of [[George II of Great Britain]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]] King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. The University now operates under a 1787 charter that places the institution under a private board of trustees, and in 1896 it was further renamed Columbia University.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Brief History of Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html | title=A Brief History of Columbia | publisher=Columbia University | year=2011 | accessdate= 2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the University's campus was moved from [[Madison Avenue]] to its current location in the [[Morningside Heights]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], where it occupies more than six city blocks, or {{convert|32|acres|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/admissions/university/campus/housing.php Columbia University Office of Undergraduate Admissions - Housing &amp; Dining&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The University encompasses twenty schools and is affiliated with numerous institutions, including [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], [[Barnard College]], and the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], with joint undergraduate programs available through the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] as well as the [[Juilliard School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college.columbia.edu/students/academics/special_prog/juilliard.php Columbia College Academics &gt; Special Programs &gt; Juilliard &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===King's College (1754-1784)===
[[File:Kings college 1770.gif|thumb|right|King's College Hall, 1770]]
Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the [[Province of New York]] began as early as 1704, when [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Colonel Lewis Morris]] wrote to the [[USPS|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]], the missionary arm of the [[Church of England]], persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stand, Columbia : A History of Columbia University in the City of New York |last=McCaughey |first=Robert |year= 2003|publisher= Columbia University Press |location= New York, New York |isbn=0231130082 |page=1  |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, not until the founding of [[Princeton University]] across the [[Hudson River]] in [[New Jersey]] did the City of New York seriously consider founding a college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stand, Columbia: A History of Columbia University in the City of New York |last=McCaughey |first=Robert |year= 2003|publisher= Columbia University Press |location= New York, New York |isbn=0231130082 |page=1  |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Columbia |last=Keppel |first= Fredrick Paul |year= 1914 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford, England |page=26 |accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes were initially held in July of 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, [[Samuel Johnson (1696-1772)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Columbia University: 1754-1904 |last= Matthews |first=Brander | coauthors= John Pine, Harry Peck, Munroe Smith |year= 1904 |publisher= Macmillan Company |location= London, Englad |pages= 8–10 |accessdate= 2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Official Guide to Columbia University |last=Butler |first= Nicholas Murray  |year= 1912 |publisher= Columbia University Press |location= New York, New York |page= 3|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Brief History of Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html | title=A Brief History of Columbia | publisher=Columbia University | year=2011 | accessdate= 2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1763, Dr. Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by [[Myles Cooper]], a graduate of [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the [[American Revolution]], his chief opponent in discussions at the College was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|1912|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the [[Continental Army]]. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their [[Evacuation Day (New York)|departure]] in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schecter |first=Barnet |title=The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |year=2002 |isbn=9780802713742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCullough |first=David |title=1776 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2005 |isbn=9780743226714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columbia College (1784-1896)===
[[File:columbia law madison.gif|right|thumb|200px|The [[Gothic Revival]] Law School building on the Madison Avenue campus]]

After the Revolution, the college turned to the [[New York|State of New York]] in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the schools charter the state might demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matthews|1904|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed &quot;an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last= | first= | authorlink= | last2= | first2= | author2-link= | title= A History of Columbia University, 1754–1904 | year=1904 | pages= | location=New York | publisher = Macmillan | doi= | id = | isbn= 1402137370 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created a [[Board of Regents]] to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the Legislature stipulated that &quot;the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot; /&gt; The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February of 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by [[John Jay]] and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college, still in use today, granting power to a private board of 24 Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1846|pp=65–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the May 21, 1787, [[William Samuel Johnson]], the son of Dr. Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the University, Johnson had participated in the [[First Continental Congress]] and been chosen as a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  William Samuel Johnson: A Maker of the Constitution |last= Groce |first= C. G. | year=1937 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= New York, New York |accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President [[George Washington]] and Vice President [[John Adams]] attended the College's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school that had been involved in the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matthews|1904|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the College functioned. In 1857, the College moved from Park Place to a primarily [[Gothic Revival]] campus on 49th&amp;nbsp;Street and [[Madison Avenue]], where it remained for the next fifty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|F.A.P. Barnard]], the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = McCaughey | first = Robert | date = December 10, 2003 | url = http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/stand_columbia/phdleaders1861-1900.html | title = Leading American University Producers of PhDs, 1861–1900 | work = Stand, Columbia - A History of Columbia University|publisher = Columbia University Press|accessdate = 2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the College's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's rapidly expanding population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Butler|1912|pp=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Columbia University (1896-present)===
[[File:ColumbiaUNYC1915.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An illustration of Columbia in 1915.]]

In 1896, the trustees officially authorized the use of yet another new name, Columbia University, and today the institution is officially known as &quot;Columbia University in the City of New York.&quot; At the same time, university president [[Seth Low]] moved the campus again, from 49th&amp;nbsp;Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of [[Morningside Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2008/05/05/columbia-universitys-lunatic-past &quot;Columbia University's Lunatic Past.&quot; ''Ephemeral New York'' website. May 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Low's successor, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the &quot;multiversity&quot; model that later universities would adopt.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Brief History of Columbia&quot;/&gt;

Research into the atom by faculty members [[John R. Dunning]], I. I. Rabi, [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Polykarp Kusch]] placed Columbia's Physics Department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Broad&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/science/30manh.html| title = Why They Called It the Manhattan Project | accessdate = 2007-10-30 | work=The New York Times | first=William J. | last=Broad | date=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, to meet the needs of [[GI (military)|GIs]] returning from World War II, University Extension was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html | title=A Brief History of Columbia | publisher=Columbia University | year=2011 | accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism, which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied various buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's then President, [[Grayson Kirk]] and the establishment of the University Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=1968: The Year That Rocked The World | last= Kurlansky | first= Mark | year=2005 | publisher= Random House | location=New York, New York | isbn= 0345455827 | pages= 194–199 | accessdate= 2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Harlem vs. Columbia University: Black Student Power in the Late 1960s|last= Bradley|first= Stefan|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2009|publisher= University of Illinois|location= New York, New York|isbn= 9780252034527 |pages=5–19, 164–191| accessdate= 2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983, after a decade of failed negotiations with [[Barnard College]], an all female institution affiliated with the University, to merge the two schools. Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both Columbia University and Barnard College.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.barnard.edu/about/facts.html Link text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
===Morningside Heights===
[[File:Lowbanners.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Low Memorial Library]]]]
The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] on [[Seth Low]]'s late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught in one location. The campus was designed along [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] principles by architects [[McKim, Mead, and White]]. Columbia's main [[campus]] occupies more than six [[city block]]s, or {{convert|32|acres|abbr=on}}, in [[Morningside Heights]], New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/admissions/university/campus/housing.php Columbia University Office of Undergraduate Admissions - Housing &amp; Dining&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University has an extensive [[Columbia University tunnels|underground tunnel system]] more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus.

The Nicholas Murray Butler Library, commonly known simply as [[Butler Library]], is the largest single library in the [[Columbia University Library System]], and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as &quot;South Hall&quot; by the University's former President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] as expansion plans for [[Low Memorial Library]] stalled, the new library was funded by [[Edward Harkness]], benefactor of [[Yale]]'s [[residential college]] system, and designed by his favorite architect, [[James Gamble Rogers]]. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library's design is [[neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] in style. Its facade features an arcade of columns in the [[Ionic order]] above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/img/assets/5295/SelfGuided.pdf | title= Butler Library: Self-Guided Tour | publisher= Columbia University | accessdate= 2011-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, [[Columbia University Library System|Columbia's library system]] includes over 10.4 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.columbia.edu/about/facts.html | publisher= Columbia University | title= Libraries and Collections: Fast Facts | accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm | publisher= American Library Association | title= The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing By Volumes Held | accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. [[Low Memorial Library]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance.

A statue by sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] called ''[[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' is centered on the front steps of [[Low Memorial Library]]. McKim, Mead &amp; White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing [[List of Latin phrases (S)|sapientia and doctrina]]. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!20526~!0#focus |title= Alma Mater (sculpture) |author= Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture |publisher= The Smithsonian Institute |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a [[women's college]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart |title=The Myth of the College Sweetheart |author=Meredith Foster |date= 11 February 2011 |work= The Eye |publisher= Columbia Spectator |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/newrec/2423/tmpl/story.4.html | title= What Is the Mace?

&quot;The Steps&quot;, alternatively known as &quot;Low Steps&quot; or the &quot;Urban Beach&quot;, are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the [[City Beautiful movement]], the steps of Low Library provides Columbia university and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable and spacious outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlmplanners.org/notes/pdf/The%20Steps%20at%20Low%20Library.pdf | publisher= Dober, Lidsky, Craig and Associates, Inc. | title=

===Other campuses===

In April 2007, the University purchased more than two-thirds of a {{convert|17|acre}} site for a new campus in [[Manhattanville]], an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]] to 133rd&amp;nbsp;Street, the new campus will house buildings for Columbia's schools of business and the arts and allow the construction of the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://neighbors.columbia.edu/pages/manplanning/index.html | title = Manhattanville in West Harlem | accessdate = 2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $7&amp;nbsp;billion expansion plan includes demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant, eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132&amp;nbsp;apartments. Replacing these buildings will be {{convert|6800000|sqft|m2}} of space for the University. Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Williams | first = Timothy | title = In West Harlem Land Dispute, It's Columbia vs. Residents | work = New York Times | date = November 20, 2006 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/20/nyregion/20columbia.html?em&amp;ex=1164171600&amp;en=85fc31aebe9f875c&amp;ei=5087% }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/21gas.html | work=The New York Times | title=2 Gas Stations, and a Family's Resolve, Confront Columbia Expansion Plan | first=Timothy | last=Williams | date=2008-09-21 | accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition. Most recently, as of December 2008, the State of New York's [[Empire State Development Corporation]] approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's &quot;blighted&quot; status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2008/12/18/mville-expansion-clears-last-major-hurdle-state-approves-eminent-domain |title=M'ville Expansion Clears Last Major Hurdle, State Approves Eminent Domain |date=December 18, 2008 |work=Columbia Spectator|first=Maggie |last=Astor |coauthors=Kim Kirschenbaum |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2009, the [[New York State Public Authorities Control Board]] approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.empire.state.ny.us/columbia/ |title=Columbia Manhattanville Project |work=Press Release |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]] is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and [[Cornell University]]. According to ''US News and World Report''s &quot;Americas Best Hospitals 2009&quot;, it is ranked sixth overall and third among university hospitals. Columbia Medical School has a strategic partnership with [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]], and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals overseas. Health-related schools are located at the [[Columbia University Medical Center]], a {{convert|20|acre}} campus located in the neighborhood of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], fifty blocks uptown. Other teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the New York-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cornellpsychiatry.org/about/westchester.html | title= NYP: Weschster | publisher= New York-Presbyterian Hospital | accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]]), Columbia owns {{convert|26|acre|sing=on}} Baker Field, which includes the [[Lawrence A.

In 2006, the University established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the University’s environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the University’s Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and “green” building design principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neighbors.columbia.edu/pages/manplanning/proposed_plan/environmental.html | title= Manhattenville in West Harlem | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate= 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The University requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the University also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://environment.columbia.edu/greenbuildings | publisher= Columbia Environmental Stewardship | title=Projects: Green Buildings | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Every Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a [[Farmers' market|greenmarket]] where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city. In addition, from April to November Hodgson’s farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grownyc.org/columbiagreenmarket | publisher= GrowNYC | title= Columbia Greenmarket | accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/columbia-university | title=Columbia University Green Report Card | publisher= The College Sustainability Report Card | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia has been rated &quot;B+&quot; by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/columbia-university | title= Columbia University Green Report Card | publisher= College Sustainability Report Card | accessdate= 2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus [[John Kluge]] to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value will depend on the eventual value of Kluge's estate at the time of his death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=evo-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB117624800578765660.html%3Fmod%3Dhome_whats_news_us Wall Street Journal article breaking the news about Kluge's donation]&lt;/ref&gt; Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university’s endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the University, including room, board, and academic fees, subsidized by the University. That same year, the University ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/education/11columbia.html | work=The New York Times | title=Columbia University to Offer Financial Aid to More Students | date=2008-03-11 | accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] and the [[School of Engineering and Applied Science (Columbia University)|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] began accepting the [[Common Application]].

Columbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is “The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.” The University’s first Charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its current Charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The University is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves [[Ex officio member|ex officio]]. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the University, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the University’s financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the University’s real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the University.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia University Press&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/organization.html | title= Organization and Goverenance of the University | year= 2011 | publisher= Columbia University Press | accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html | title= Board of Trustees | publisher= Columbia University | accessdate= 2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University Senate was established by the Trustees after a University-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of University-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the University. These include the President of the University, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the University’s administration. The President serves as the Senate’s presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the University. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/senate/ | title= Columbia University Senate | publisher= Columbia University | accessdate= 2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Presidents of Columbia University|The President of Columbia University]], who is selected by the Trustees in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate and who serves at the Trustees’ pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the University. Assisting the President in administering the University are the Provost, the Senior Executive Vice President, the Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences, several other vice presidents, the General Counsel, the Secretary of the University, and the deans of the Faculties, all of whom are appointed by the Trustees on the nomination of the President and serve at their pleasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia University Press&quot;/&gt; [[Lee C. Bollinger]] became the 19th President of Columbia University on June 1, 2002. A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases—[[Grutter v Bollinger]] and [[Gratz v Bollinger]]—that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education. A leading First Amendment scholar, he is widely published on freedom of speech and press, and currently serves on the faculty of Columbia Law School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.columbia.edu/cu/president/docs/bio/index.html| title= Office of the President: Lee Bollinger | accessdate= 2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia has three undergraduate colleges: [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College (CC)]], the liberal arts college offering the [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, and [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)]], the engineering and applied science school offering the [[Bachelor of Science]] degree, and [[Columbia University School of General Studies|The School of General Studies (GS)]], which offers the ability for returning and nontraditional students to obtain a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of science through either full time or part time study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/academics.html | title= Schools of Columbia University | publisher= Columbia University | accessdate= 2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University is affiliated with [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], [[Barnard College]], the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], and the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], all located nearby in Morningside Heights. Joint undergraduate programs are available through the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] as well as through the [[Juilliard School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college.columbia.edu/students/academics/special_prog/juilliard.php Columbia College Academics &gt; Special Programs &gt; Juilliard &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Two affiliated institutions – Barnard College and Teachers College – are also Faculties of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/organization.html |title=Organization and Governance of the University |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculty and research===

Columbia is ranked first (tied with [[MIT]] and [[Stanford University]]) in the first tier of the United States' top research universities by the [[Center for Measuring University Performance]], which takes into account total research, federal research, endowment assets, annual giving, [[National Academy]] members, faculty awards, doctorates granted, postdoctoral appointees, and undergraduate SAT/ACT range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mup.asu.edu/research_data.html |title=Research- The Center for Measuring University Performance |publisher=Mup.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia was the first North American site where the [[Uranium]] atom was split.

====Broadcasting====
Columbia is home to two early pioneers in undergraduate student broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. [[WKCR]], the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the University's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/content/about | title=&quot;The Original FM&quot;: The Columbia University Radio Club | publisher= Columbia University | year= 2009 | accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station currently has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ctvnewsonline.com | title = CTV News | accessdate = 2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ctv | title = CTV | accessdate = 2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) was founded in 1999. The student-run group aims to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Each year CORE hosts dozens of events, including a business plan competition and a series of seminars. Notable seminar speakers include [[Mark Cuban]], owner of the [[Dallas Mavericks]] and Chairman of HDNet, and [[Blake Ross]], creator of [[Mozilla Firefox]]. As of 2006, CORE has awarded graduate and undergraduate students with over $100,000 in seed capital. Events are possible through the contributions of various private and corporate groups; previous sponsors include [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]], [[Citigroup]], and i-Compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/core/ | publisher=Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs | title= About Us | accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CampusNetwork]], an on-campus social networking site that preceded [[Facebook]], was created and popularized by a Columbia engineering student Adam Goldberg in 2003. [[Mark Zuckerberg]] later asked Goldberg to join him in [[Palo Alto]] to work on Facebook, but Goldberg declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2010/10/07/columbias-web-30 |title=Columbia's Web 3.0 &amp;#124; The Eye |publisher=Eye.columbiaspectator.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] offers a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship through its [http://ctice.columbia.edu/content/interdisciplinary-minor-entrepreneurship Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement].

Professor Chris Wiggins of [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] is working in conjunction with Professors Evan Korth of [[New York University]] and Hilary Mason, chief scientist at [[bit.ly]] to facilitate the growth of student tech-startups in an effort to transform a traditionally financially-centered New York City into the next [[Silicon Valley]]. Their website [http://hackny.org/a/ hackny.org] is a huge gathering ground of ideas and discussions for New York's young entrepreneurial community, the [[Silicon Alley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/technology/07reboot.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=New York Isn't Silicon Valley, and That's Why They Like It | first=Jenna | last=Wortham | date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 14, 2010, Mayor [[Michael R.

The Lab is modeled after similar ones at [[MIT]] and [[Stanford]]. A $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation was used to establish the NYC Media Lab. Each year, the lab will host a range of roundtable discussions between the private sector and academic institutions. The lab will support research projects on topics of content format, next generation search technologies, computer animation for film and gaming, emerging marketing techniques, and new devices development. The lab will also create a media research and development database. Columbia University will coordinate the long-term direction of the media lab as well as the involvement of its faculty and those of other universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2010a/pr268-10.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 | publisher= www.nyc.gov | title= Mayor Bloomberg Launches NYC Media Lab | author= Stu Loeser | date= June 14, 2010 | accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===

{{Main|Columbia Lions}}
A member institution of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (Division I-AA FCS), Columbia fields varsity teams in 29 sports and is a member of the [[Ivy League]]. The football Lions play home games at the 17,000-seat [[Lawrence A. Wien Stadium]] at [[Baker Field]]. One hundred blocks north of the main campus at Morningside Heights, the Baker Athletics Complex also includes facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, tennis, track and rowing. The basketball, fencing, swimming &amp; diving, volleyball and wrestling programs are based at the Dodge Physical Fitness Center on the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/admissions/university/campus/athletics.php | title= Athletics | publisher= Columbia University | accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia University athletics has had a long history, with many accomplishments in various athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against [[Rutgers University]] in the second football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student [[Maxie Long]] set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18-0 and was ranked first in the nation, but losing to Indiana 1-0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/athletics/athletics_timeline.html | title= Columbia Athletics Highlight | publisher= Columbia University | year= 2004 | accessdate= 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA [[Football Championship Subdivision]].  The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16-13 victory over archrival [[Princeton Tigers|Princeton]]. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium, which had been opened during the losing streak and was already four years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wikicu.com/Losing_streak&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Leaders Forum===
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Columbia.jpg|thumb|right|Ahmadinejad speaking at the World Leaders Forum in 2007]]
Established in 2003 by current university president [[Lee C. Bollinger]], the World Leaders Forum at Columbia University provides the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students alike to listen to some of the most prominent world leaders in government, religion, industry, finance, and academia. The World Leaders Forum is a year-around event series that strives to provide a platform for uninhibited speech among nations and cultures, while educating students about the current problems as well as progress around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldleaders.columbia.edu/president-lee-c-bollingers-statement-about-world-leaders-forum World Leaders Forum Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

All Columbia undergraduates and graduates as well as students of [[Barnard College]] and other Columbia affiliated schools can register to participate in the World Leaders Forum using their student IDs. Even for individuals who do not have the privilege to attend the event live, they can watch the forum via online videos on Columbia University's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldleaders.columbia.edu/faq|title=World Leaders Forum: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Worldleaders.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia University Orchestra was founded by composer Edward MacDowell in 1896, and is the oldest continually operating university orchestra in the United States. Undergraduate student composers at Columbia may choose to become involved with Columbia New Music, which sponsors concerts of music written by undergraduate students from all of Columbia's schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cuo/ Columbia University Orchestra&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Columbia University Marching Band]] is one of Columbia's most visible student groups, due to both its humor and central role in campus traditions such as Orgo Night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumb.org/orgo-night-a-columbia-university-marching-band-tradition/|title=Orgo Night! A Columbia University Marching Band Tradition|publisher=Columbia University Marching Band|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Band is frequently seen on campus performing as more of a humor or comedy group rather than or in addition to its role as a spirit group, although it does also cheer and play songs at Columbia football and basketball games, just as a traditional marching band would. There are a number of performing arts groups at Columbia dedicated to producing student theater, including the Columbia Players, King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe (KCST), Columbia Musical Theater Society (CMTS), NOMADS (New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students), LateNite Theatre, Columbia University Performing Arts League (CUPAL), Black Theatre Ensemble (BTE), sketch comedy group Chowdah, and improvisational troupes Alfred and Fruit Paunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cupal/#members | title= CUPAL: Member Organizations | publisher= Columbia University of Performing Arts | accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Columbia Queer Alliance]] is the central Columbia student organization that represents the lesbian, gay, transgender, and questioning student population. It is the oldest gay student organization in the world, founded as the Student [[Homophile]] League in 1967 by students including lifelong activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Stephen Donaldson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cqanyc.com/ | publisher= Columbia Queer Alliance | title= About Us | accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Queer Man on Campus: A History of Non-heterosexual College Men, 1945-2000 | publisher= Psychology Press | year=2002 | isbn=0415933366 | page= 167 | accessdate= 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University campus military groups include the U.S. Military Veterans of Columbia University and Advocates for Columbia ROTC. In the 2005–06 academic year, the Columbia Military Society, Columbia's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates, was renamed the Hamilton Society for &quot;students who aspire to serve their nation through the military in the tradition of [[Alexander Hamilton]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocatesforrotc.org/columbia/hamilton.html|title=Columbia University Hamilton Society: About|publisher=http://www.advocatesforrotc.org/|accessdate= 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University also houses an independent nonprofit organization, Community Impact, which strives to serve disadvantaged people in the Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights communities. From its earliest inception as a single service initiative formed in 1981 by Columbia University undergraduates, Community Impact has grown into Columbia University’s largest student service organization. CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and companionship for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of a dedicated corps of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ci/index.html |title=Community Impact |publisher=Columbia University |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and student demonstrations==
===Protests of 1968===
{{Main|Columbia University protests of 1968}}
[[File:Tony-kushner.1978-graduation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Playwright [[Tony Kushner]] protesting at his 1978 graduation]]
Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring [[Morningside Park (New York City)|Morningside Park]]; this was seen by the protesters to be an act of aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring [[Harlem]]. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in [[the Pentagon]]'s weapons research think-tank, the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside [[Low Memorial Library|Low Library]], [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]], and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html?scp=1&amp;sq=columbia+1968&amp;st=nyt &quot;Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion&quot;, New York Times, April 28, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/1968.html#notes Columbia University - 1968]&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests achieved two of their stated goals. Columbia disaffiliated from the IDA and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym, building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead. The gym's plans were eventually used by [[Princeton University]] for the expansion of its athletic facilities. At least 30 Columbia students were suspended by the administration as a result of the protests. Many of the Class of ’68 walked out of their graduation and held a countercommencement on Low Plaza with a picnic following at Morningside Park, the place where the protests began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/sites/cct/files/cct_spring_1968.pdf | title=Columbia College Today | author= George Keller | publisher= Columbia University | accessdate= 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests hurt Columbia financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate money to the school. [[Allan Bloom]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]],
believed that the protest efforts at Columbia were responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left. As a result of the protests, Bloom stated, “American universities were no longer places of intellectual and academic debate, but rather places of ‘political correctness’ and liberalism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Harlem vs. Columbia University: Black Student Power in the Late 1960s|last= Bradley|first= Stefan|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2009|publisher= University of Illinois|location= New York, New York|isbn= 9780252034527 |pages=5–19, 164–191, 174 | accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests against racism and apartheid===
Further student protests, including hunger strike and more barricades of [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]] and the Business School&lt;ref&gt;[[Disinvestment from South Africa#University campuses|&quot;Disinvestment from South Africa #University campuses&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt; during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] regime in South Africa. A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of University investments in South Africa. The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. University.

The initial (and partial) Columbia divestment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Columbia Senate Supports Selling South African Stocks Selectively |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 7, 1978 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D1EFD395413728DDDAE0894DD405B888BF1D3 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
focused largely on bonds and financial institutions directly involved with the South African regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Trustees vote for divestiture from backers of S. African government|publisher = Columbia Spectator|date = 1978-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed a year long campaign first initiated by students who had worked together to block the appointment of former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] to an endowed chair at the University in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 400 sign petition against offering Kissinger faculty post |publisher = Columbia Spectator|date = 1977-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly backed by a diverse array of student groups and many notable faculty members the Committee Against Investment in South Africa held numerous teach-ins and demonstrations through the year focused on the trustees ties to the corporations doing business with South Africa. Trustee meetings were picketed and interrupted by demonstrations culminating in May 1978 in the takeover of the Graduate School of Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Demonstration at Columbia|publisher = New York Daily News|date = 1978-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Student Sit-in at Columbia|publisher = New York Post|date = 1978-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadinejad speech controversy===
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 13 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right| Students protest Ahmadinejad's invitation to speak at the University.]]

The [[School of International and Public Affairs]] traditionally extends invitations to many heads of state and heads of government who come to New York City for the opening of the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, [[Iran]]ian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Thousands of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September&amp;nbsp;24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President [[Lee Bollinger]] tried to assuage the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased with the fact that the Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/24/politics/main3292477.shtml |title=Candidates Speak Out On Ahmadinejad Visit |date=2007-09-24 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his speech, Ahmadinejad criticized [[Israel]]'s existence and policies towards the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]; called for research on the historical accuracy of [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]; raised questions as to who initiated the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]]; defended Iran's [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear power program]], criticizing the [[United Nations]]' policy of sanctions on his country; and attacked [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in the Middle East. In response to a question about Iran's [[Human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|treatment]] of [[Women's rights in Iran|women]] and [[LGBT rights in Iran|homosexuals]], he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that &quot;In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country... In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who told you this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7010962.stm |title=Iran president in NY campus row |date=2007-09-25 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter statement drew [[laughter]] from the audience. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office accused Columbia of accepting grant money from the [[Alavi Foundation]] to support faculty &quot;sympathetic&quot; to Iran's Islamic republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1258705167723&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Iran backers funding US universities |date=2009-11-23 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ROTC controversy===
Since 1969, during the Vietnam War, the university has not allowed the US military to have [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) programs on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Feith, David J., &quot;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGQ2Y2YyYTAxOTliMzQ3NjE2MmY1YzE3ZTI2YzIwMjQ= Duty, Honor, Country… and Columbia]&quot;, ''National Review'', September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after 1969, Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other nearby colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/academics/special_programs/army_rotc_ram_battal/affiliated_instituti_29928.asp Army ROTC at Fordham University] Accessed 09/09/10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrotc.com/college-life/college/?recruiter_id=860 |title=U.S. Air Force ROTC - College Life - College |publisher=Afrotc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;home.manhattan.edu&quot;&gt;http://home.manhattan.edu/~afrotc/CROSSTOWNS.htm AFROTC Detachment 560, &quot;The Bronx Bombers&quot;, CROSS-TOWN SCHOOLS.

At a forum at the university during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election campaign]], both [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;home.manhattan.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGurn, William, &quot;[http://s.wsj.net/article/SB122273091416788171.html A Columbia Marine To Obama: Help!]&quot;, ''Wall Street Journal'', September 30, 2008, Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrotc.navy.mil/colleges-univers.cfm Colleges and Universities with NROTC Units]&lt;/ref&gt; After the debate, the President of the University, [[Lee Bollinger]], stated that he did not favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum on the question of whether or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point. In April 2010 during [[Admiral]] [[Mike Mullen]]'s address at Columbia, president [[Lee Bollinger]] stated that the ROTC would be readmitted to campus if the admiral's plans for revoking the [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy were successful. In February 2011 during a town-hall meeting on the ROTC ban former Army staff sergeant Anthony Maschek, a [[purple heart]] recipient for injuries sustained during his service in Iraq, was booed and hissed at by some students during his speech promoting the idea of allowing the ROTC on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Karni, Annie, &quot;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hero_unwelcome_Zi3u1fwtRpo87vXAiAQfSN]&quot;, ''New York Post'', February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
{{details|Columbia traditions}}

===Orgo Night===
On the day before the Organic Chemistry exam&amp;mdash;which is often on the first day of finals&amp;mdash;at precisely the stroke of midnight, the [[Columbia University Marching Band]] occupies [[Butler Library]] to distract diligent students from studying. After a forty-five minutes or so of jokes and music, the procession then moves out to the lawn in front of Hartley, Wallach and John Jay residence halls to entertain the residents there. The Band then plays at various other locations around Morningside Heights, including the residential quadrangle of [[Barnard College]], where students of the all-women's school, in mock-consternation, rain trash — including notes and course packets — and water balloons upon them from their dormitories above. The Band tends to close their Orgo Night performances before Furnald Hall, known among students as the more studious and reportedly &quot;anti-social&quot; residence hall, where the underclassmen in the Band serenade the graduating seniors with an entertaining, though vulgar, mock-hymn to Columbia, composed of quips that poke fun at the various stereotypes about the Columbia student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cumb.org/orgo-night-a-columbia-university-marching-band-tradition/ | publisher= Columbia University Marching Band Legacy | title= Orgo Night!

===Tree-Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies===
The campus Tree-Lighting Ceremony is a relatively new tradition at Columbia, inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent and Hamilton Halls on the east end and Dodge and Journalism Halls on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February&amp;nbsp;28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by various ''a cappella'' groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html | title= Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony | author= Jason Hollander | publisher= Columbia University News | accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The ceremony dates to a period prior to the [[Revolutionary War]], but lapsed before being revived by University President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century. A troop of students dressed as [[Continental Army]] soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The ceremony is accompanied by a reading of ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' by [[Clement Clarke Moore]] and ''[[Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus]]'' by [[Francis Pharcellus Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hollander|first = Jason|date = December 3, 1999 | url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html | title = Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony | work = Columbia News | accessdate = 2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''cell wall''' is the tough, usually flexible but sometimes fairly rigid layer that surrounds some types of [[cell (biology)|cells]]. It is located outside the [[cell membrane]] and provides these cells with structural support and protection, and also acts as a filtering mechanism. A major function of the cell wall is to act as a pressure vessel, preventing over-expansion when water enters the cell. They are found in [[plant]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[algae]], and some [[archaea]]. [[Animal]]s and [[protozoa]] do not have cell walls.

The material in the cell wall varies between species, and can also differ depending on cell type and developmental stage. In plants, the strongest component of the complex cell wall is a [[carbohydrate]] called [[cellulose]], which is a [[polymer]] of [[glucose]].  In bacteria, [[peptidoglycan]] forms the cell wall. Archaean cell walls have various compositions, and may be formed of [[glycoprotein]] [[S-layer]]s, [[pseudopeptidoglycan]], or [[polysaccharide]]s. Fungi possess cell walls made of the [[glucosamine]] polymer [[chitin]], and algae typically possess walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Unusually, [[diatom]]s have a cell wall composed of [[silicic acid]]. Often, other accessory molecules are found anchored to the cell wall.

== Properties ==
[[Image:Eukaryota cell strucutre.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Diagram of the plant cell, with the cell wall in green.]]

The cell wall serves a similar purpose in those organisms that possess them.  The wall gives cells rigidity and strength, offering protection against mechanical stress.  In multicellular organisms, it permits the organism to build and hold its shape ([[morphogenesis]]).  The cell wall also limits the entry of large molecules that may be toxic to the cell.  It further permits the creation of a stable [[osmotic]] environment by preventing [[osmotic lysis]] and helping to retain water.  The composition, properties, and form of the cell wall may change during the [[cell cycle]] and depend on growth conditions.

=== Rigidity of cell walls ===
The rigidity of the cell walls is often over-estimated. In most cells, the cell wall is flexible, meaning that it will bend rather than holding a fixed shape, but has considerable [[tensile strength]]. The apparent rigidity of primary plant tissues is enabled by cell walls, but not due to the walls' strength. Hydraulic [[turgor pressure]] creates this rigidity, along with the wall structure.  The flexibility of the cell walls is seen when plants wilt, so that the stems and leaves begin to droop, or in [[seaweed]]s that bend in [[Ocean current|water current]]s. As John Howland states it:
{{quote|Think of the cell wall as a wicker basket in which a balloon has been inflated so that it exerts pressure from the inside.  Such a basket is very rigid and resistant to mechanical damage.  Thus does the prokaryote cell (and eukaryotic cell that possesses a cell wall) gain strength from a flexible plasma membrane pressing against a rigid cell wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howland 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Howland | first = John L. | year = 2000 | title = The Surprising Archaea: Discovering Another Domain of Life | pages = 69–71 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-511183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rigidity of the cell wall thus results in part from inflation of the cell contained.  This inflation is a result of the [[osmosis|passive uptake of water]].

In plants, a '''secondary cell wall''' is a thicker additional layer of cellulose which increases wall rigidity.  Additional layers may be formed containing [[lignin]] in [[xylem]] cell walls, or containing [[suberin]] in [[cork cambium|cork]] cell walls.  These compounds are [[Structural rigidity|rigid]] and [[waterproof]], making the secondary wall stiff.  Both [[wood]] and [[bark]] cells of [[tree]]s have secondary walls.  Other parts of plants such as the [[petiole (botany)|leaf stalk]] may acquire similar reinforcement to resist the strain of physical forces.

Certain single-cell [[protist]]s and [[algae]] also produce a rigid wall.  [[Diatom]]s build a '''frustule''' from [[silica]] extracted from the surrounding water; [[radiolarian]]s also produce a '''test''' from minerals.  Many [[green algae]], such as the [[Dasycladales]] encase their cells in a secreted skeleton of [[calcium carbonate]].  In each case, the wall is rigid and essentially inorganic.

=== Permeability ===
The primary cell wall of most [[plant cell]]s is [[Semipermeable membrane|semi-permeable]] and permits the passage of small molecules and small proteins, with size exclusion estimated to be 30-60 [[Atomic mass unit|kDa]]. Key nutrients, especially [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]], are distributed throughout the plant from cell wall to cell wall in [[apoplast]]ic flow. The pH is an important factor governing the transport of molecules through cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant cell walls ==
Many plant cells have walls that are strong enough to withstand the [[osmotic pressure]] from the difference in solute concentration between the cell interior and distilled water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2006-11/1164842041.Cb.r.html]&lt;/ref&gt;    
===Layers===
[[Image:Plant cell wall diagram.svg|thumb|250px|right|Molecular structure of the primary cell wall in plants.]]
Up to three strata or layers may be found in plant cell walls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Buchanan |coauthors= Gruissem, Jones |title= Biochemistry &amp; molecular biology of plants |edition=1st |publisher= American society of plant physiology|year=2000 |isbn=0-943088-39-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Middle lamella|'''middle lamella''']], a layer rich in [[pectin]]s. This  outermost layer forms the interface between adjacent plant cells and glues them together.
*The '''primary cell wall''', generally a thin, flexible and extensible layer formed while the cell is growing.
*The '''[[secondary cell wall]]''', a thick layer formed inside the primary cell wall after the cell is fully grown. It is not found in all cell types. In some cells, such as found [[xylem]], the secondary wall contains [[lignin]], which strengthens and waterproofs the wall.

===Composition===
In the primary (growing) plant cell wall, the major [[carbohydrate]]s are [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[pectin]]. The cellulose [[microfibril]]s are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network, which is embedded in the pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose  in the primary cell wall is [[xyloglucan]]. In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan, a hemicellulose. Primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called [[acid growth]], which involves [[turgor]]-driven movement of the strong cellulose microfibrils within the weaker hemicellulose/pectin matrix, catalyzed by [[expansin]] proteins. The outer part of the primary cell wall of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with [[cutin]] and [[wax]], forming a permeability barrier known as the [[plant cuticle]].

Secondary cell walls contain a wide range of additional compounds that modify their mechanical properties and permeability. The major [[polymer]]s that make up [[wood]] (largely secondary cell walls) include:
* cellulose, 35-50%
* [[xylan]], 20-35%, a type of hemicellulose
* [[lignin]], 10-25%,  a complex phenolic polymer that penetrates the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.

Additionally, structural [[protein]]s (1-5%) are found in most plant cell walls; they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), [[arabinogalactan]] proteins (AGP), glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are [[glycosylation|glycosylated]], contain [[hydroxyproline]] (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] and [[endodermis]] may also contain [[suberin]] or [[cutin]], two polyester-like polymers that protect the cell from herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1104/pp.119.3.1137 | author = Laurence Moire, Alain Schmutz, Antony Buchala, Bin Yan, Ruth E. Stark, and Ulrich Ryser | year = 1999 | title = Glycerol Is a Suberin Monomer.

Plant cells walls also contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and transglycosylases, that cut, trim and [[cross-link]] wall polymers. 

The walls of cork cells in the bark of trees are impregnated with [[suberin]], and suberin also forms the permeability barrier in primary roots known as the [[Casparian strip]]. Secondary walls - especially in grasses - may also contain microscopic [[silica]] crystals, which may strengthen the wall and protect it from herbivores.

Cell walls in some plant tissues also function as storage depots for carbohydrates that can be broken down and resorbed to supply the metabolic and growth needs of the plant. For example, endosperm cell walls in the seeds of cereal grasses, nasturtium, and other species, are rich in glucans and other polysaccharides that are readily digested by enzymes during seed germination to form simple sugars that nourish the growing embryo. Cellulose microfibrils are not readily digested by plants, however.

=== Formation ===
The middle [[Lamella (cell biology)|lamella]] is laid down first, formed from the [[cell plate]] during [[cytokinesis]], and the primary cell wall is then deposited inside the middle lamella. The actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the primary cell wall, can be defined as composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the ''middle lamella'', which contains [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]] [[pectate]]s (salts of [[pectic acid]]). Cells interact though [[plasmodesma]](ta), which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.

In some plants and cell types, after a maximum size or point in development has been reached, a ''secondary wall'' is constructed between the plant cell and primary wall. Unlike the primary wall, the microfibrils are aligned mostly in the same direction, and with each additional layer the orientation changes slightly. Cells with secondary cell walls are rigid. Cell to cell communication is possible through ''pits'' in the secondary cell wall that allow plasmodesma to connect cells through the secondary cell walls.

==Algal cell walls==
[[Image:Diatoms.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron]] [[micrograph]]s of [[diatom]]s showing the external appearance of the cell wall]]
Like plants, algae have cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;Sendbusch, Peter V. (2003-07-31). &quot;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e26/26d.htm Cell Walls of Algae]&quot;. ''Botany Online''. Retrieved on 2007-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Algal cell walls contain either [[polysaccharide]]s (such as cellulose (a glucan)) or a variety of [[glycoprotein]]s ([[Volvocales]]) or both. The inclusion of additional [[polysaccharide]]s in algal cells walls is used as a feature for algal taxonomy.

* [[Mannan]]s: They form microfibrils in the cell walls of a number of marine [[green algae]] including those from the genera, ''Codium'', ''Dasycladus'', and ''Acetabularia'' as well as in the walls of some [[red algae]], like ''Porphyra'' and ''Bangia''.
* [[Xylan]]s:
* [[Alginic acid]]: It is a common polysaccharide in the cell walls of [[brown algae]].
* Sulfonated polysaccharides: They occur in the cell walls of most algae; those common in red algae include [[agar]]ose, [[carrageenan]], [[porphyra]]n, furcelleran and [[funoran.

Other compounds that may accumulate in algal cell walls include [[sporopollenin]] and [[calcium|calcium ions]].

The group of [[algae]] known as the [[diatom]]s synthesize their cell walls (also known as frustules or valves) from [[silicic acid]] (specifically orthosilicic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The acid is [[polymer]]ised intra-cellularly, then the wall is extruded to protect the cell. Significantly, relative to the organic cell walls produced by other groups, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8%), potentially a major saving on the overall cell energy budget&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.1983.tb00385.x | author = Raven, J.

== Fungal cell walls ==
[[Image:Chitin.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of a unit from a [[chitin]] polymer chain.]]
There are several groups of organisms that may be called &quot;fungi&quot;. Some of these groups have been transferred out of the Kingdom Fungi, in part because of fundamental biochemical differences in the composition of the cell wall.  Most true fungi have a cell wall consisting largely of [[chitin]] and other [[polysaccharide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hudler, George W. (1998). ''Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 7. [[Special:Booksources/0691028737|ISBN 0-691-02873-7]].&lt;/ref&gt;  True fungi do not have [[cellulose]] in their cell walls, but some fungus-like organisms do.

=== True fungi ===
Not all species of [[fungi]] have cell walls but in those that do, the [[plasma membrane]] is followed by three layers of cell wall material.  From inside out these are:
* a [[chitin]] layer ([[polymer]] consisting mainly of unbranched chains of [[N-Acetylglucosamine|N-acetyl-D-glucosamine]])
* a layer of β-1,3-[[glucan]] ([[zymosan]])
* a layer of mannoproteins ([[mannose]]-containing [[glycoprotein]]s) which are heavily [[glycosylated]] at the outside of the cell.

=== Fungus-like protists ===
The group [[Oomycete]]s, also known as water molds, are [[saprotroph]]ic [[Plant pathology|plant pathogens]] like fungi. Until recently they were widely believed to be fungi, but [[organelle|structural]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] evidence&lt;ref&gt;Sengbusch, Peter V. (2003-07-31). &quot;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e33/33.htm Interactions between Plants and Fungi: the Evolution of their Parasitic and Symbiotic Relations]&quot;. ''biologie.uni-hamburg.de''. Retrieved on 2007-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; has led to their reclassification as [[heterokont]]s, related to [[autotroph]]ic [[brown algae]] and [[diatom]]s.  Unlike fungi, oomycetes typically possess cell walls of cellulose and [[glucan]]s rather than chitin, although some genera (such as ''[[Achlya]]'' and ''[[Saprolegnia]]'') do have chitin in their walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexopoulos 1996&quot;&gt;Alexopoulos, C. J., C. W. Mims, &amp; M. Blackwell (1996). ''Introductory Mycology'' '''4'''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 687-688. [[Special:Booksources/0471522295|ISBN 0-471-52229-5]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The fraction of cellulose in the walls is no more than 4 to 20%, far less than the fraction comprised by glucans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexopoulos 1996&quot; /&gt;  Oomycete cell walls also contain the [[amino acid]] [[hydroxyproline]], which is not found in fungal cell walls.

The [[dictyostelid]]s are another group formerly classified among the fungi.  They are [[slime mold]]s that feed as unicellular [[amoeba]]e, but aggregate into a reproductive stalk and [[sporangium]] under certain conditions.  Cells of the reproductive stalk, as well as the [[spore]]s formed at the apex, possess a [[cellulose]] wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raper 1984&quot;&gt;Raper, Kenneth B. (1984). ''The Dictyostelids''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 99-100. [[Special:Booksources/0691083452|ISBN 0-691-08345-2]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The spore wall has been shown to possess three layers, the middle of which is composed primarily of cellulose, and the innermost is sensitive to [[cellulase]] and [[pronase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Raper 1984&quot; /&gt;

==Prokaryotic cell walls==
=== Bacterial cell walls ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bacteriocin]] --&gt;

{{further|[[Cell envelope]]}}
Around the outside of the cell membrane is the bacterial cell wall. Bacterial cell walls are made of [[peptidoglycan]] (also called murein), which is made from [[polysaccharide]] chains cross-linked by unusual [[peptide]]s containing D-[[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = van Heijenoort J | title = Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan | url=http://glycob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/25R | journal = Glycobiology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 25R – 36R | year = 2001 | pmid = 11320055 | doi = 10.1093/glycob/11.3.25R  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of [[plant]]s and [[fungi]] which are made of [[cellulose]] and [[chitin]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koch A | title = Bacterial wall as target for attack: past, present, and future research | url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/16/4/673?view=long&amp;pmid=14557293 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.16.4.673-687.2003 | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 673–87 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14557293 | pmc = 207114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, although [[L-form bacteria]] can be produced in the laboratory that lack a cell wall.&lt;ref name=Joseleau&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joseleau-Petit D, Liébart JC, Ayala JA, D'Ari R |title=Unstable Escherichia coli L forms revisited: growth requires peptidoglycan synthesis |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=189 |issue=18 |pages=6512–20 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17586646 |pmc=2045188 |doi=10.1128/JB.00273-07 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17586646}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The antibiotic [[penicillin]] is able to kill bacteria by preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan and this causes the cell wall to weaken and lyse.&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt; The [[lysozyme]] enzyme can also damage bacterial cell walls.

There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, called [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]]. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the [[Gram stain]], a test long-employed for the classification of bacterial species.&lt;ref name=Gram&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gram | first =  HC | authorlink = Hans Christian Gram | year = 1884 | title = Über die isolierte Färbung der Schizomyceten in Schnitt- und Trockenpräparaten | journal = Fortschr. Med. | volume = 2 | pages = 185&amp;ndash;189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and [[teichoic acid]]s. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing [[lipopolysaccharide]]s and [[lipoprotein]]s. Most bacteria have the Gram-negative cell wall and only the [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]] (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative Gram-positive arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hugenholtz P | title = Exploring prokaryotic diversity in the genomic era | url= | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-reviews0003 | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = REVIEWS0003 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11864374 | nopp = true | pmc = 139013 | last2 = Rogozin | first2 = Igor B | last3 = Grishin | first3 = Nick V | last4 = Tatusov | first4 = Roman L | last5 = Koonin | first5 = Eugene V}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility, for instance [[vancomycin]] can kill only Gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against Gram-negative pathogens, such as ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Walsh F, Amyes S | title = Microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens. | journal = Curr Opin Microbiol | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 439–44 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15451497 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2004.08.007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeal cell walls ===
Although not truly unique, the cell walls of [[Archaea]] are unusual. Whereas [[peptidoglycan]] is a standard component of all bacterial cell walls, all archaeal cell walls lack peptidoglycan,&lt;ref name=&quot;White 1995&quot;&gt;White, David. (1995) ''The Physiology and Biochemistry of Prokaryotes'', pages 6, 12-21. (Oxford: Oxford University Press). ISBN 0-19-508439-X.&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of one group of [[methanogen]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howland 2000&quot; /&gt; In that group, the peptidoglycan is a modified form very different from the kind found in bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;White 1995&quot; /&gt;  There are four types of cell wall currently known among the Archaea.

One type of archaeal cell wall is that composed of [[pseudopeptidoglycan]] (also called pseudomurein).  This type of wall is found in some [[methanogen]]s, such as ''[[Methanobacterium]]'' and ''[[Methanothermus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brock 1994&quot;&gt;[[Thomas D. Brock|Brock, Thomas D.]], Michael T. Madigan, John M. Martinko, &amp; Jack Parker. (1994) ''Biology of Microorganisms'', 7th ed., pages 818-819, 824 (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall). ISBN 0-13-042169-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the overall structure of archaeal ''pseudo''peptidoglycan superficially resembles that of bacterial peptidoglycan, there are a number of significant chemical differences. Like the peptidoglycan found in [[bacteria]]l cell walls, pseudopeptidoglycan consists of [[polymer]] chains of [[glycan]] cross-linked by short [[peptide]] connections.  However, unlike peptidoglycan, the sugar [[N-Acetylmuramic acid|N-acetylmuramic acid]] is replaced by [[N-Acetyltalosaminuronic acid|N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid]],&lt;ref name=&quot;White 1995&quot; /&gt; and the two sugars are bonded with a ''β'',1-3 glycosidic linkage instead of  ''β'',1-4.  Additionally, the cross-linking peptides are L-[[amino acid]]s rather than D-amino acids as they are in bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brock 1994&quot; /&gt;

A second type of archaeal cell wall is found in ''[[Methanosarcina]]'' and ''[[Halococcus]]''.  This type of cell wall is composed entirely of a thick layer of [[polysaccharide]]s, which may be [[sulfate]]d in the case of ''Halococcus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brock 1994&quot; /&gt;  Structure in this type of wall is complex and as yet is not fully investigated.

A third type of wall among the Archaea consists of [[glycoprotein]], and occurs in the [[hyperthermophile]]s, ''[[Halobacterium]]'', and some [[methanogen]]s.  In ''Halobacterium'', the [[protein]]s in the wall have a high content of [[acid]]ic [[amino acid]]s, giving the wall an overall negative charge.  The result is an unstable structure that is stabilized by the presence of large quantities of positive [[sodium]] [[ion]]s that neutralize the charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brock 1994&quot; /&gt;  Consequently, ''Halobacterium'' thrives only under conditions with high [[salinity]]. 

In other Archaea, such as ''[[Methanomicrobium]]'' and ''[[Desulfurococcus]]'', the wall may be composed only of surface-layer [[protein]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Howland 2000&quot;&gt;Howland, John L. (2000) ''The Surprising Archaea: Discovering Another Domain of Life'', pages 69-71. (Oxford: Oxford University Press). ISBN 0-19-511183-4.&lt;/ref&gt; known as an ''S-layer''. S-layers are common in [[bacteria]], where they serve as either the sole cell-wall component or an outer layer in conjunction with polysaccharides. Most Archaea are Gram-negative, though at least one Gram-positive member is known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howland 2000&quot; /&gt;

Many [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[worldview]]s have a set of '''classical elements''' believed to reflect the simplest essential parts and principles of which anything consists or upon which the constitution and fundamental powers of anything are based. Most frequently, ''classical elements'' refer to [[#Ancient classic element systems|ancient beliefs]] inspired by natural observation of the [[phases of matter]]. [[History of science|Historians]] trace the evolution of [[#Modern elements|modern theory]] pertaining to the [[chemical element]]s, as well as [[chemical compound]]s and [[mixture]]s of [[chemical substance|natural substances]] to [[#Medieval classic element systems|medieval]], Islamic and Greek models. Many concepts once thought to be analogous, such as the Chinese [[Wu Xing]], are now understood more figuratively.

==Ancient classic element systems==
{{classic element}}
In classical thought, the four elements [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] frequently occur; sometimes including a fifth element or ''quintessence'' (after &quot;quint&quot; meaning &quot;fifth&quot;) called [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]] in ancient Greece.

The concept of essentially the same five elements was similarly found in ancient [[India]], where they formed a basis of analysis in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In Hinduism, particularly in an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] context, the four states-of-matter describe matter, and a fifth element describes that which was beyond the [[material]] world. Similar lists existed in ancient [[China]] and [[Japan]]. In Buddhism the four great elements, to which two others are sometimes added, are not viewed as substances, but as categories of [[sensory experience]].

===Classical elements in Babylonia===
The concept of the four classical elements in the Western tradition originates from [[Babylonian mythology]]. The ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', a text written between the 18th and 16th centuries BC, describes four cosmic elements: the [[Water (classical element)|sea]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Aether (classical element)|sky]], and [[Air (classical element)|wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A consideration of Babylonian astronomy within the historiography of science|author=Francesca Rochberg|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=33|issue=4|date=December 2002|pages=661–684|doi=10.1016/S0039-3681(02)00022-5|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical elements in Greece===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Democritus]] --&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] classical elements (Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Aether) date from pre-Socratic times and persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], deeply influencing [[Europe]]an thought and culture. The Greek five elements are sometimes associated with the five [[platonic solid]]s.

[[Plato]] characterizes the elements as being [[The Presocratics|pre-Socratic]] in origin from a list created by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]] (ca. 450 BC).  Empedocles called these the four &quot;roots&quot; (ῥιζὤματα, rhizōmata). Plato seems to have been the first to use the term &quot;element (στοιχεῖον, ''stoicheion'')&quot; in reference to air, fire, earth, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plat.+Tim.+48b |title=Timaeus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient Greek word for element, ''stoicheion'' (from ''stoicheo'', &quot;to line up&quot;) meant &quot;smallest division (of a sun-dial), a syllable&quot;, as the composing unit of an alphabet it could denote a letter and the smallest unit from which a word is formed.

According to Aristotle in his ''On Generation and Corruption'':
* [[Air (classical element)|'''Air''']] is primarily wet and secondarily hot.
* [[Fire (classical element)|'''Fire''']] is primarily hot and secondarily dry.
* [[Earth (classical element)|'''Earth''']] is primarily dry and secondarily cold.
* [[Water (classical element)|'''Water''']] is primarily cold and secondarily wet.

One classic diagram (above) has one square [[inscribed]] in the other, with the corners of one being the classical elements, and the corners of the other being the properties. The opposite corner is the opposite of these properties, &quot;hot - cold&quot; and &quot;dry - wet&quot;.

[[Aristotle]] added [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|aether]] as the quintessence, reasoning that whereas fire, earth, air, and water were earthly and corruptible, since no changes had been perceived in the heavenly regions, the [[star]]s cannot be made out of any of the four elements but must be made of a different, unchangeable, heavenly substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. E. R. Lloyd |title=Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of his Thought |location=Cambridge Univ. Pr. |year=1968 |pages=133–139 |isbn=0-521-09456-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical elements in Egypt===
A Greek text called the &quot;Kore Kosmou&quot; or &quot;Virgin of the World,&quot; ascribed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (the name given by the Greeks to the Egyptian god [[Thoth]]), names the four elements fire, water, air, and earth. As described in this book: &quot;And Isis answer made: Of living things, my son, some are made friends with ''fire'', and some with ''water'', some with ''air'', and some with ''earth'', and some with two or three of these, and some with all. And, on the contrary, again some are made enemies of fire, and some of water, some of earth, and some of air, and some of two of them, and some of three, and some of all. For instance, son, the locust and all flies flee fire; the eagle and the hawk and all high-flying birds flee water; fish, air and earth; the snake avoids the open air. Whereas snakes and all creeping things love earth; all swimming things--love--water; winged things, air, of which they are the citizens; while those that fly still higher--love--the fire and have the habitat near it. Not that some of the animals as well do not love fire; for instance salamanders, for they even have their homes in it. It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies' outer envelope. Each soul, accordingly, while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four.&quot;

According to [[Galen]], these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] in describing the [[human body]] with an association with the [[Humorism|four humours]]: yellow [[bile]] (fire), [[Melancholia|black bile]] (earth), [[blood]] (air), and [[phlegm]] (water).

===Classical elements in Hinduism===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Akasha]] --&gt;
{{Ref improve section|date=August 2007}}

{{Main|Mahabhuta}}

The ''pancha mahabhuta,'' or &quot;five great elements&quot;, of [[Hinduism]] are ''[[kshiti]]'' or ''[[bhūmi]]'' ([[earth (classical element)|earth]]), ''[[Ap (water)|ap]]'' or ''jala'' ([[water (classical element)|water]]), ''[[agni|tejas]]'' or ''[[agni]]'' ([[fire (classical element)|fire]]), ''[[maruts|marut]]'' or ''pavan'' ([[air (classical element)|air]] or [[wind]]), ''[[vyom]]'' or ''shunya (or akash?)'' ([[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or [[Aether (classical element)|void]]). Hindus believe that all of creation, including the human body, is made up of these five essential elements and that upon death, the human body dissolves into these five elements of nature, thereby balancing the cycle of nature.

Hindus believe that the [[Creator_deity|Creator]] used akasha (ether), the most &quot;subtle&quot; element, to create the other four traditional elements; each element created is in turn used to create the next element, each less subtle than the last. The five elements are associated with the five senses, and act as the gross medium for the experience of sensations. The basest element, earth, created using all the other elements, can be perceived by all five senses - hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell. The next higher element, water, has no odor but can be heard, felt, seen and tasted. Next comes fire, which can be heard, felt and seen. Air can be heard and felt. &quot;Akasha&quot; (ether) is the medium of sound but is inaccessible to all other senses.

===Buddhist elements===
{{Ref improve section|date=September 2007}}
{{Main|Mahābhūta}}
In the [[Pali literature]], the ''[[mahabhuta]]'' (&quot;great elements&quot;) or ''catudhatu'' (&quot;four elements&quot;) are earth, water, fire and air.  In early Buddhism, the four elements are a basis for understanding suffering and for liberating oneself from suffering. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the sensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterization as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, is declared an abstraction—instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one observes how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Dan Lusthaus]] |title=What is and isn't Yogacara |url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s teaching regarding the four elements is to be understood as the base of all observation of real sensations rather than as a philosophy. The four properties are cohesion (water), solidity or inertia (earth), expansion or vibration (air) and heat or energy content (fire). He promulgated a categorization of mind and matter as composed of eight types of &quot;[[kalapas]]&quot; of which the four elements are primary and a secondary group of four are color, smell, taste, and nutriment which are derivative from the four primaries.

The Buddha's teaching of the four elements does predate Greek teaching of the same four elements.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This is possibly explained by the fact that he sent out 60 [[arahant]]s to the known world to spread his teaching; however it differs in the fact that the Buddha taught that the four elements are false and that form is in fact made up of much smaller particles which are constantly changing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] (1997) renders an extract of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]]'s from Pali into English thus:
{{quote|Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces, the monk contemplates this very body -- however it stands, however it is disposed -- in terms of properties: 'In this body there is the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, &amp; the wind property.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Kayagata-sati Sutta'' |author=[[Majjhima Nikaya]] |page=119 |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.119.than.html |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Seven chakras===
In the philosophy of the seven [[chakras]] there are correspondences to the five elements as shared by both Hinduism and Buddhism as well as two other elements:

*Sahasrara (Crown): Thought/Space
*Ajña (Third Eye): Light/Dark
*Vishuddhi (Throat): Ether/Sound
*Anahata (Heart): Air
*Manipura (Navel): Fire
*Svadhisthana (Sacral): Water
*Muladhara (Root): Earth

===Bön elements===
In [[Bön]] or ancient Tibetan philosophy, the five elemental processes of [[earth]], [[water]], [[fire]], [[air]] and [[space]] are the essential materials of all existent [[phenomena]] or [[skandha|aggregate]]s.  The elemental processes form the basis of the [[calendar]], [[astrology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]] and are the foundation of the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[traditions]] of [[shamanism]], [[tantra]] and [[Dzogchen]].

[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] states that
{{quote|physical properties are assigned to the elements:  earth is solidity; water is cohesion; fire is temperature; air is motion; and space is the spatial dimension that accommodates the other four active elements.  In addition, the elements are correlated to different emotions, temperaments, directions, colors, tastes, body types, illnesses, thinking styles, and character.  From the five elements arise the five senses and the five fields of sensual experience; the five negative emotions and the five wisdoms; and the five extensions of the body.  They are the five primary ''pranas'' or vital energies.  They are the constituents of every physical, sensual, mental, and spiritual phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche |title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light |page=1 |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |isbn=1559391766 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The names of the elements are analogous to categorised experiential sensations of the natural world.  The [[name]]s are [[symbol]]ic and key to their inherent qualities and/or modes of action by [[analogy]].  In [[Bön]] the elemental processes are fundamental [[metaphor]]s for working with external, internal and secret energetic forces.  All five elemental processes in their essential purity are inherent in the [[mindstream]] and link the [[trikaya]] and are aspects of primordial energy. As [[Herbert V. Günther]] states:
{{quote|Thus, bearing in mind that thought struggles incessantly against the treachery of language and that what we observe and describe is the observer himself [''sic.''], we may nonetheless proceed to investigate the successive phases in our becoming human beings. Throughout these phases, the experience (''das Erlebnis'') of ourselves as an intensity (imaged and felt as a &quot;god&quot;, lha) setting up its own spatiality (imaged and felt as a &quot;house&quot; ''khang'') is present in various intensities of illumination that occur within ourselves as a &quot;temple.&quot; A corollary of this Erlebnis is its light character manifesting itself in various &quot;frequencies&quot; or colors. This is to say, since we are beings of light we display this light in a multiplicity of nuances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herber V. Günther |year=1996 |title=The Teachings of Padmasambhava |pages=115–116 |location=Leiden, Netherlands |publisher=E. J. Brill |edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the above block quote the [[trikaya]] is encoded as: [[dharmakaya]] &quot;god&quot;; [[sambhogakaya]] &quot;temple&quot; and [[nirmanakaya]] &quot;house&quot;.

===Chinese elements ===
{{Main|Wu Xing}}
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2009}}
The Chinese had a somewhat different series of elements, namely Fire, Earth, Water, Metal and Wood, which were understood as different types of energy in a state of constant interaction and flux with one another, rather than the Western notion of different kinds of material.

Although it is usually translated as &quot;element&quot;, the Chinese word ''xing'' literally means something like &quot;changing states of being&quot;, &quot;permutations&quot; or &quot;metamorphoses of being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfram Eberhard |title=A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols |pages=93, 105, 309 |publisher=Routledge and Keegan Paul |location=London |year=1986|isbn=0710201915}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Sinologists cannot agree on one single translation. The Chinese conception of &quot;element&quot; is therefore quite different from the Western one. The Western elements were seen as the basic building blocks of matter. The Chinese, by contrast, were seen as ever changing and moving forces or energies—one translation of ''wu xing'' is simply &quot;the five changes&quot;.

The Wu Xing are chiefly an ancient mnemonic device for systems with five stages; hence the preferred translation of &quot;movements&quot;, &quot;phases&quot; or &quot;steps&quot; over &quot;elements.&quot;

In [[Taoism]] there is a similar system of elements, which includes [[Metal (classical element)|metal]] and [[Wood (classical element)|wood]], but excludes air, which is replaced with ''[[qi]]'', which is a force or energy rather than an element. In Chinese philosophy the universe consists of heaven and earth, heaven being made of ''qi'' and earth being made of the five elements (in the Chinese view, the attributes and properties of the Western and Indian Air element are equivalent to that of Wood{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, where the element of Ether is often seen as a correspondent to Metal{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}). The five major [[planet]]s are associated with and named after the elements: [[Venus]] 金星 is Metal ([[wikt:金#Han_character|金]]), [[Jupiter]] 木星 is Wood ([[wikt:木#Han_character|木]]), [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] 水星 is Water ([[wikt:水#Han_character|水]]), [[Mars]] 火星 is Fire ([[wikt:火#Han_character|火]]), and [[Saturn]] 土星 is Earth ([[wikt:土#Han_character|土]]). Additionally, the [[Moon]] represents [[Yin and yang|Yin]] ([[wikt:陰#Han_character|陰]]), and the [[Sun]] 太陽 represents [[Yin and yang|Yang]] ([[wikt:陽#Han_character|陽]]). Yin, Yang, and the five elements are recurring themes in the [[I Ching]], the oldest of Chinese classical texts which describes an ancient system of [[cosmology]] and [[philosophy]]. The five elements also play an important part in [[Chinese astrology]] and the Chinese form of [[geomancy]] known as [[Feng shui]]

The doctrine of five phases describes two cycles of balance, a generating or creation (生, shēng) cycle and an overcoming or destruction (克/剋, kè) cycle of interactions between the phases.

''Generating''
* Wood feeds fire;
* Fire creates earth (ash);
* Earth bears metal;
* Metal collects water;
* Water nourishes wood.

''Overcoming''
* Wood parts earth;
* Earth absorbs water;
* Water quenches fire;
* Fire melts metal;
* Metal chops wood.

There are also two cycles of imbalance, an overacting cycle (cheng) and an insulting cycle (wu).

===Japanese elements===
{{Main|Five elements (Japanese philosophy)}}
[[Japan]]ese traditions use a set of elements called the {{lang|ja|五大}} (''go dai'', literally &quot;five great&quot;). These five are [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wind (classical element)|wind]]/air, and [[Aether (classical element)|void]]. These came from Buddhist beliefs; the classical Chinese elements ({{lang|ja|五行}}, ''go gyô'') are also prominent in Japanese culture, especially to the influential Neo-Confucianists during the [[Edo period]].

*'''Earth''' represented things that were solid.
*'''Water''' represented things that were liquid.
*'''Fire''' represented things that destroyed.
*'''Air''' represented things that moved.
*'''Heaven''' represented things not of our everyday life.

==Elements in Medieval alchemy==
The elemental system used in Medieval [[alchemy]] was developed by the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic alchemist]], [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Norris | first1 = John A. | title = The Mineral Exhalation Theory of Metallogenesis in Pre-Modern Mineral Science | journal = Ambix | volume = 53 | pages = 43 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1179/174582306X93183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His original system consisted of the four classical elements found in the ancient Greek traditions (air, earth, fire and water), in addition to two philosophical elements: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], ‘the stone which burns’, which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.  The three metallic principles: sulphur to flammability or combustion, mercury to volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] to solidity.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} became the ''tri prima'' of the Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]], who reasoned that Aristotle’s four element theory appeared in bodies as three principles. Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental, and justified them by recourse to the description of how wood burns in fire. Mercury included the cohesive principle, so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart. Smoke described the volatility (the mercury principle), the heat-giving flames described flammability (sulphur), and the remnant ash described solidity (salt).&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, 2000. Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern elements==
{{See also|History of science}}
The [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotelian tradition]] and medieval [[Alchemy]] eventually gave rise to modern scientific theories and new taxonomies. By the time of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], for example, a [[History_of_the_periodic_table#Antoine-Laurent_de_Lavoisier|list of elements]] would no longer refer to classical elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/lavtable.html Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794)], in [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/index.html Classic Chemistry], compiled by Carmen Giunta&lt;/ref&gt; The classical elements correspond more closely to four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.

[[Image:neon orbitals.JPG|right|thumb|300px|{{nowrap|'''1s, 2s, 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;,2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''.}}&lt;br&gt;The [[Standing wave|shapes]] of the first five [[Quantum number#Traditional nomenclature|atomic orbitals]] using [[Flavour (particle physics)#Definition|color]] to depict the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the [[wavefunction]].]]Modern science recognizes classes of [[elementary particle]]s which have no substructure, (or rather, particles that aren't made of other particles), and [[composite particle]]s having substructure, (particles made of other particles). The [[Standard Model]] of [[quantum mechanics]] defines three classes of elementary [[subatomic particles]]: ''[[quark]]s'' and ''[[lepton]]s'', ([[matter]]-like particles), and ''[[gauge boson]]s'' ([[energy]]-like [[force carrier]]s). Quarks are divided into six types: ''[[Up quark|up]]'', ''[[Down quark|down]]'', ''[[Top quark|top]]'', ''[[Bottom quark|bottom]]'', ''[[Strange quark|strange]]'' and ''[[Charm quark|charm]]''; and leptons are similarly divided into six types: ''[[electron]]'', ''[[electron neutrino]]'', ''[[muon]]'', ''[[muon neutrino]]'', ''[[tau (particle)|tau]]'' and ''[[tau neutrino]]''. The types of force carriers include: ''[[photon]]'', ''[[W and Z bosons|W and Z boson]]'', ''[[gluon]]'' and some quantification of a ''[[Higgs boson]]''.

==Elements in western astrology and tarot==
{{Main|astrology and the classical elements|divinatory tarot}}
Western [[astrology]] uses the four [[astrology and the classical elements|classical elements]] in connection with [[natal chart|astrological chart]]s and [[horoscopes]]. The twelve [[Astrological signs|signs]] of the [[zodiac]] are divided into the four elements: [[Fire signs]] are Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, [[Earth signs]] are Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, [[Air signs]] are Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, and [[Water signs]] are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.

In [[divinatory tarot]], the suits of cups, swords, batons/wands, and discs/coins are said to correspond to water, air, fire, and earth respectively.

'''Fire''' has been an important part of all [[culture]]s and [[religion]]s from pre-history to modern day and was vital to the development of civilization. It has been regarded in many different contexts throughout history, but especially as a metaphysical constant of the world.

==Greek and Roman tradition==
Fire is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  It was commonly associated with the qualities of energy, assertiveness, and passion.  In one Greek myth, [[Prometheus]] stole ''fire'' from the gods to protect the otherwise helpless humans, but was punished for this charity. The ancient Greeks distinguished the destructive and consumptive (''aidelon'') fire, associated with [[Hades]], from the creative fire, associated with [[Hephaestus]], the god of metalworking and smithing.&lt;ref name=&quot;F&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~Mclennan/BA/AGEDE/Fire.html|title= The Elements: Fire|author= |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goddess [[Hekate]] was called ''Pyrphoros'' (Fire-bearing), ''Pyripnon'' (Fire-breather), ''Daidoukhos'' (Torch-bearer) and ''Phosphoros'' (Light-bearer).&lt;ref name=&quot;F&quot;/&gt;

Fire was one of many ''archai'' proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom sought to reduce the [[cosmos]], or its creation, by a single substance. [[Heraclitus]] {{nowrap|(c. 535 BCE –}} {{nowrap|c. 475 BCE)}} considered ''fire'' to be the most fundamental of all elements. He believed fire gave rise to the other three elements: &quot;All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods&quot;.[[#DK|{{super|{{small|DK B90}}}}]] He had a reputation for obscure philosophical principles and for speaking in riddles. He described how fire gave rise to the other elements as the: &quot;upward-downward path&quot;, ({{Polytonic|ὁδὸς ἄνω κάτω}}), [[#DK|{{super|{{small|DK B60}}}}]] a &quot;hidden harmony&quot; [[#DK|{{super|{{small|DK B54}}}}]] or series of transformations he called the &quot;turnings of fire&quot;, ({{Polytonic|πυρὸς τροπαὶ}}), [[#DK|{{super|{{small|DK B31}}}}]] first into ''[[water (classical element)|sea]]'', and half that ''sea'' into ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', and half that ''earth'' into rarefied ''[[air (classical element)|air]]''. A concept that anticipates both the four [[classical elements]] of [[Empedocles]] and [[Aristotle]]'s transmutation of the four elements into one another.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.[[#DK|{{super|{{small|DK B30}}}}]]&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
[[Heraclitus]] regarded the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as being a mixture of fire and water, with fire being is the more [[noble]] part and water the ignoble aspect. He believed the goal of the soul is to be rid of water and become pure fire: the dry soul is the best and it is worldly pleasures make the soul &quot;moist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;russell&quot;&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]], ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was known as the &quot;weeping philosopher&quot; and died of [[hydropsy]], a swelling due to abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin.

However, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas {{nowrap|(c. 495 -}} {{nowrap|c. 435 BCE)}}, is best known for having selected all elements as his ''archai'' and by the time of [[Plato]] {{nowrap|(427 -}} {{nowrap|347 BCE)}}, the four Empedoclian elements of were well established. In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', Plato's major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] he associated with fire was the [[tetrahedron]] which is formed from four triangles and contains the least volume with the greatest surface area. This also makes fire the element with the smallest number of sides, and Plato regarded it as appropriate for the heat of fire, which he felt is sharp and stabbing, (like one of the points of a tetrahedra).&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22-23; Gregory Vlastos, ''Plato’s Universe'', pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato’s student [[Aristotle]] {{nowrap|(384 -}} {{nowrap|322 BCE)}} did not maintain his former teacher's geometric view of the elements, but rather preferred a somewhat more naturalistic explanation for the elements based on their traditional qualities. Fire the hot and dry element, like the other elements was an abstract principle and not identical with the normal solids, liquids and combustion phenomena we experience:
&lt;blockquote&gt; What we commonly call fire. It is not really fire, for fire is an excess of heat and a sort of ebullition; but in reality, of what we call air, the part surrounding the earth is moist and warm, because it contains both vapour and a dry exhalation from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/book1.html |title=Meteorology, by Aristotle (Book I, Section 3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Aristotle, the four elements rise or fall toward their natural place in concentric layers surrounding the center of the earth and form the terrestrial or [[sublunary sphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. Yellow [[bile]] was the humor identified with fire, since both were hot and dry. Other things associated with fire and yellow bile in ancient and [[medieval medicine]] included the season of summer, since it increased the qualities of heat and aridity; the choleric temperament (of a person dominated by the yellow bile humour);  the [[Masculinity|masculine]]; and the eastern point of the compass.

[[Image:Alchemy fire symbol.svg|thumb|100px|left|Alchemical symbol for fire]]

In [[alchemy]] the [[chemical element]] of [[sulfur]] was often associated with fire and its [[alchemical symbol]] and its symbol was an upward-pointing triangle. In alchemic tradition, metals are incubated by fire in the womb of the Earth and alchemists only accelerate their development.&lt;ref name=&quot;F&quot;/&gt;

==Indian tradition==
{{Main|Agni}}
'''Agni''' is a [[Hindu]] and [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]].  The word ''agni'' is [[Sanskrit]] for fire (noun), cognate with [[Latin]] ''ignis'' (the root of English ''ignite''), Russian ''ogon'' (fire), pronounced ''agon''. Agni has three forms: fire, lightning and the sun.

Agni is one of the most important of the Vedic gods. He is the god of fire and the acceptor of sacrifices. The sacrifices made to Agni go to the [[deity|deities]] because Agni is a messenger from and to the other gods. He is ever-young, because the fire is re-lit every day, yet he is also immortal. In Indian tradition Fire is also linked to [[Surya]] or the Sun and [[Mangala]] or Mars, and with the south-east direction.

===Astrological personalities===
People born under the astrological signs of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] and [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] are thought to have dominant fire personalities.  Fire personalities are believed to have good leading qualities, and also tend to be extroverted, rebellious, passionate and enthusiastic, brave and valiant; however, they can also be moody, hot-tempered, snappy, uncontrollable and angry.

===Ceremonial magic===
Fire and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the Golden Dawn system.  Philosophus (4=7) is the elemental grade attributed to fire; this grade is also attributed to the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] Sephirah [[Netzach]] and the planet Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154-65.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of fire is the Wand or Dagger.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of fire is [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], the angel is Aral, the ruler is Seraph, the king is Djin, and the fire [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Fire is considered to be active; it is represented by the symbol for [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], and it is referred to the lower right point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280-286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

===Modern witchcraft===
Fire is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n traditions influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic, and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism, which was in turn inspired by the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp. 216-23; Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Common Wiccan attributions include:
* Cardinal direction: [[Cardinal directions|South]]
* Season: [[Summer]]
* Time of life: Youth
* Time of day: Noon
* Elemental being: [[Salamander (legendary creature)|Salamander]]
* Colors: Red and orange 
* Magical tools: [[Athame]] and ceremonial dagger
* [[Tarot]]: Wands or Swords in the [[Minor Arcana]]. Wands are traditionally associated with fire and still are in most tarot decks, however, increasingly decks are being published with Swords associated with Fire. This is still a matter of debate within the esoteric and Wiccan community.&lt;ref&gt;Philip and Stephanie Carr-Gomm DruidCraft Tarot Handbook.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Altar tool: Candle 
* Masculine energy
* Other: [[As Above, So Below|Correspondences]] include blood, the guitar, rubies and in writing fire is sometimes represented by a red upwards triangle.

In rituals, fire is represented in the forms of burning objects, love spells, baking and lighting candles or fires.

The manifestations of the element are found in the sun, lightning, volcanoes and lava and all forms of light. Cats of all types, especially the [[lion]] and [[tiger]] are also thought to personify the element of fire, as are all predatory creatures, such as the fox. 

Other mythic and legendary creatures of fire include [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], [[European dragon]] and occasionally the [[hawk]].

==Other traditions==
Fire represents the creativity and passion that all intellectual and emotional beings have. It is an active force that has the passion to create and  animate things. The element is also very rational and quick to flare up as is the personality of many fire-children. 

Fire in many ancient cultures and myths has been known to purify the land with the flames of destruction, however, it is also capable of the renewal of life through the warmth and comfort of those very same flames.

The element of fire shows up in mythological stories all across the world, often in stories related to the sun. 

In [[East Asia]] fire is represented by the [[Vermilion Bird]], known as 朱雀 (''Zhū Què'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], ''Suzaku'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and Ju-jak (주작, [[Hanja]]:朱雀) in [[Korean language|Korean]].  ''Fire'' is represented in the [[Aztec]] religion by a flint; to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], a mouse; to the [[Hindu]] and [[Islam]]ic faiths, a lightning bolt; to the [[Scythian]]s, an axe, to the [[Culture of Greece|Greeks]], an apple-bough; and in [[Christian]] [[iconography]], a lion.

'''Air''' is often seen as a universal power or pure substance. Its supposed fundamental importance to life can be seen in words such as ''aspire'', ''inspire'', ''perspire'' and ''spirit'', all derived from the [[Latin]] ''spirare''. 

==Greek and Roman tradition==
Air is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  According to [[Plato]], it is associated with the [[octahedron]]; air is considered to be both hot and wet. The ancient Greeks used two words for air: ''aer'' meant the dim lower atmosphere, and ''[[aether (mythology)|aether]]'' meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, pp. 466, 470-71.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], for instance writes that &quot;So it is with air: there is the brightest variety which we call ''aether'', the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', ch. 27, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the early Greek [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers, [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (mid-6th century BCE) named air as the ''[[arche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, pp. 115-16, 120-32; Jonathan Barnes, ''Early Greek Philosophy'', pp. 77-80.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar belief was attributed by some ancient sources to [[Diogenes Apolloniates]] (late 5th century BCE), who also linked air with intelligence and soul (''psyche''), but other sources claim that his ''arche'' was a substance between air and fire.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 362-81; Barnes, pp. 289-94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristophanes]] parodied such teachings in his play ''[[The Clouds]]'' by putting a prayer to air in the mouth of [[Socrates]].

Air was one of many ''archai'' proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BCE) selected four ''archai'' for his four roots: Air, [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[water (classical element)|water]], and [[earth (classical element)|earth]]. Ancient and modern opinions differ as to whether he identified air by the divine name [[Hera]], [[Hades|Aidoneus]] or even [[Zeus]]. Empedocles’ roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 138-46. Guthrie suggests that Hera is the safest identification for air.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] (427-347 BCE) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', his major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] associated with air is the [[octahedron]] which is formed from eight equilateral triangles. This places air between fire and water which Plato regarded as appropriate because it is intermediate in its mobility, sharpness, and ability to penetrate.  He also said of air that its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel them.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22-23; Gregory Vlastos, ''Plato’s Universe'', pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BCE) developed a different explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities. The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center of the universe to form the [[sublunary sphere]]. According to Aristotle, air is both hot and wet and occupies a place between fire and water among the elemental spheres. Aristotle definitively separated air from [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. For him, aether was an unchanging, almost divine substance that was found only in the heavens, where it formed [[celestial sphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. [[Blood]] was the humor identified with air, since both were hot and wet. Other things associated with air and blood in ancient and medieval medicine included the season of [[spring (season)|spring]], since it increased the qualities of heat and moisture; the sanguine temperament (of a person dominated by the blood humour); [[hermaphrodite]] (combining the masculine quality of heat with the feminine quality of moisture); and the northern point of the compass.&lt;ref&gt;Londa Schiebinger, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alchemy air symbol.svg|thumb|100px|left|Alchemical symbol for air]]
The [[alchemical symbol]] for air is an upward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.

==Indian tradition==
{{Main|Vayu}}
In [[Hinduism]], '''Vayu''' ([[Sanskrit]] वायु  ), ''also known as'' '''Vāta''' वात, '''Pavana''' पवन (meaning the Purifier)&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  , or '''Prāna,''' is a primary deity, who is the father of [[Bhima]] and the spiritual father of Lord [[Hanuman]]. As the words for air (Vāyu) or wind (Pavana) it is one of the ''[[Classical elements#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamahābhuta]]'' the &quot;five great elements&quot; in Hinduism. The [[Sanskrit]] word 'Vāta' literally means &quot;[[:wikt:blown|blown]]&quot;, 'Vāyu' &quot;[[:wikt:blower|blower]]&quot;, and 'Prāna' &quot;[[:wikt:breathing|breathing]]&quot; (viz. the breath of life, cf. the *an- in '[[:wikt:animate|animate]]'). 

==Chinese tradition==
Air is not one of the traditional five [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical elements]].  Nevertheless, the ancient Chinese concept of ''Qi'' or ''chi'' is believed to be close to that of air. '''[[Qi]]''' ({{IPA-cmn|tɕʰî}}; spelled ''qì'' in [[Pinyin]] [[romanization]] and ''ch'i4'' in [[Wade-Giles]]) or '''ki''' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[romanization of Japanese|romanization]]), is a fundamental concept of traditional [[China|Chinese]] culture. Qi is believed to be part of every living thing that exists, as a kind of &quot;[[Vitalism|life force]]&quot; or &quot;[[energy (spirituality)|spiritual energy]]&quot;. It is frequently translated as &quot;energy flow&quot;, or literally as &quot;air&quot; or &quot;breath&quot;. (For example, &quot;tiānqì&quot;, literally &quot;sky breath&quot;, is the ordinary Chinese word for &quot;[[weather]]&quot;). In Mandarin Chinese it is pronounced something like &quot;chee&quot; in English, but the tongue position is different.  (See [[Media:Difficult Sounds.GIF]].) The concept of qi is often [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], however no scientific evidence supports its existence. 

The element air also appears as a concept in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religion which has an ancient history in China.

Some modern occultists equate the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical element]] of [[metal (classical element)|metal]] with ''air''.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Michael Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrological personalities===
People born under the astrological signs of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] are thought to have dominant air personalities. Air personalities tend to be kind, intellectual, communicative, social and helpful. However, they can also be cold, superficial, vicious and very insensitive to other people's emotions.

===Ceremonial magic===
The [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], founded in 1888, incorporates air and the other Greek classical elements into its teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154-65.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of air is the dagger which must be painted yellow with magical names and sigils written upon it in violet.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of air is [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], the angel is Chassan, the ruler is Aral, the king is Paralda, and the air [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[sylph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Air is considerable and it is referred to the upper left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280-286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

In the Golden Dawn and many other magical systems, each element is associated with one of the [[cardinal point]]s and is placed under the care of guardian Watchtowers. The Watchtowers derive from the [[Enochian magic|Enochian system of magic]] founded by Dee. In the Golden Dawn, they are represented by the Enochian elemental tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Valiente, ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Air is associated with the east, which is guarded by the First Watchtower.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern witchcraft===
Air is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n and Pagan traditions. [[Wicca]] in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic, and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism, which was in turn inspired by the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp. 216-23; Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Common Wiccan attributions include:
* Cardinal direction: [[Cardinal directions|East]]
* Season: [[Spring (season)|Spring]]
* Time of life: Childhood
* Time of day: Sunrise
* Elemental being: [[Sylph]]
* Colors: Yellow 
* Magical tools: [[Wand]]
* [[Tarot]]: Wands in the [[Minor Arcana]]. Swords are traditionally associated with air and still are in most tarot decks, however, increasingly decks are being published with Wands. This is still a matter of debate within the esoteric and Wiccan community.&lt;ref&gt;See Philip and Stephanie Carr-Gomm DruidCraft Tarot Handbook, or http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/learn/meanings/suits.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* Altar tool: Incense
* Masculine energy
* Other: [[As Above, So Below|Correspondences]] include mind, intellect, consciousness, study, communication and beginnings.

==Other traditions==
[[Enlil]] was the god of air in ancient [[Sumer]]. [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian god of air and the husband of [[Tefnut]], goddess of moisture. He became an emblem of strength by virtue of his role in separating [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] from [[Geb]]. He played a primary role in the [[Coffin Texts]], which were spells intended to help the deceased reach the realm of the afterlife safely. On the way to the sky, the spirit had to travel through the air as one spell indicates: &quot;I have gone up in Shu, I have climbed on the sunbeams.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brier, ''Ancient Egyptian Magic'', p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Asia]], air is seen as the equivalent of wood. Air is represented in the [[Aztec]] religion by a snake to the [[Scythians]], a yoke to the [[Hindu]]s and for [[Culture of Greece|Greeks]] as a sword{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in [[Christian]] [[iconography]] as [[Human|mankind]].

{{classic element}}
'''Water''' is one of the [[classical element|elements]] in [[Pre-Socratics|ancient Greek philosophy]], in the [[India|Asian Indian]] system ''[[Classical element#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamahabhuta]]'', and in the [[China|Chinese]] cosmological and [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|physiological]] system ''[[Wu Xing]]''. In contemporary [[esotericism|esoteric traditions]], it is commonly associated with the qualities of [[emotion]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

==Greek and Roman tradition==
Water was one of many ''archai'' proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BC) selected four archai for his four roots: [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], water and [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]. Empedocles roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy. [[Plato]] (427-347 BC) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], his major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] associated with water is the [[icosahedron]] which is formed from twenty equilateral triangles. This makes water the element with the greatest number of sides, which Plato regarded as appropriate because water flows out of one's hand when picked up, as if it is made of tiny little balls.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22-23; [[Gregory Vlastos]], ''Plato’s Universe'', pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato’s student [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC) developed a different explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities. The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center of the [[Universe]] to form the [[sublunary sphere]].  According to Aristotle, water is both cold and wet and occupies a place between air and earth among the elemental spheres.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. [[Phlegm]] was the humor identified with water, since both were cold and wet. Other things associated with water and phlegm in ancient and [[medieval medicine]] included the season of Winter, since it increased the qualities of cold and moisture; the phlegmatic temperament, the [[Femininity|feminine]], the [[Human brain|brain]] and the [[west]]ern point of the compass.

[[File:Alchemy water symbol.svg|thumb|100px|left|Alchemical symbol for water]]

In [[alchemy]], the [[chemical element]] of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] was often associated with water and its [[alchemical symbol]] was an downward-pointing triangle.

==Indian tradition==
{{Main|Ap (water)}}
'''Ap''' (''{{IAST|áp-}}'') is the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] term for water, in [[Classical Sanskrit]] occurring only in the pluralis not an element.v, '''{{IAST|āpas}}''' (sometimes re-analysed as a thematic singular, ''{{IAST|āpa-}}''), whence [[Hindi]] '''{{IAST|āp}}'''. The term is from [[PIE]] ''h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;ap'' water.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], the term refers to 
water as an element, one of the ''[[Classical element#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamahabhuta]],'' or &quot;five great elements&quot;. In [[Hinduism]], it is also the name of the [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]], a [[personification]] of water, (one of the [[Vasu]]s in most later [[Puranic]] lists). The element water is also associated with [[Chandra]] or the moon and [[Shukra]], who represent feelings, intuition and imagination. 

===Astrological personalities===
People born under the astrological signs of [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] are thought to have dominant water personalities. Water personalities tend to be emotional, deep, nurturing, sympathetic, empathetic, imaginative and intuitive, however, they can also be sentimental, sensitive, escapistic and irrational.

===Ceremonial magic===
Water and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the Golden Dawn system.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154-65.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of water is the cup.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of water is [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]], the angel is Taliahad, the ruler is Tharsis, the king is Nichsa and the water [[elemental]]s are called [[Ondine (mythology)|Ondines]].&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to the upper right point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280-286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

===Modern witchcraft===
Water is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n traditions. [[Wicca]] in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism, which was in turn inspired by the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''Triumph of the Moon'', pp. 216-23; Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Common Wiccan attributions include:
* Cardinal direction: [[Cardinal directions|West]]
* Season: [[Winter]]
* Time of life: Adulthood
* Time of day: Twilight
* Elemental being: [[Ondine (mythology)|Ondine]]
* Colors: Ocean blue, sea green, dusky violet and gray
* Magical tools: [[Cup]] 
* [[Tarot]]: Cups in the [[Minor Arcana]]
* Altar tool: Cup
* Feminine energy
* Other: [[As Above, So Below|Correspondences]] include emotions, love, compassion, healing, dreams, divination, intuition and psychic abilities.

The manifestations of the element of water are [[rivers]], [[oceans]], [[lakes]], [[water well|well]]s, [[rain]], [[fog]], [[ice]], [[snow]] and all [[drinks]]. Animals, especially the [[dolphin]], [[Pinniped|seal]], [[turtle]], [[frog]] and all types of [[fish]] are also thought to personify the element of water. Other mythic and legendary creatures of water include the [[Mermaid]], [[Oread]], [[Naiad]] and [[Sea Serpent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{classic element}}
'''Earth''' home and origin of humanity, has often been worshipped in its own right with its own unique spiritual tradition.
 
==European tradition==
Earth is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  It was commonly associated with qualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world.  Due to the [[hero cult]]s, and [[chthonic]] [[List of Greek mythological figures#Chthonic deities|underworld deities]], the elemental of ''earth'' is also associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death in later [[occultism]].

[[Empedocles]] of Acragas {{nowrap|(c. 495 –}} {{nowrap|c. 435 BCE)}} proposed four ''[[arche|archai]]'' by which to understand the [[cosmos]]: ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'','' [[Air (classical element)|air]]'', ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'', and ''earth''. [[Plato]] {{nowrap|(427 –}} {{nowrap|347 BCE)}} believed the elements were geometric forms (the [[platonic solid]]s) and he assigned the [[cube]] to the element of ''earth'' in his dialogue ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22–23; [[Gregory Vlastos]], ''Plato's Universe'', pp. 66–82.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], {{nowiki|(384 –}} {{nowiki|322 BCE)}}, believed ''earth'' was the heaviest element, and his theory of ''[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|natural place]]'' suggested that any ''earth–laden'' substances, would fall quickly, straight down, toward the center of the ''cosmos''.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Classical [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] myth, various goddesses represented the Earth, seasons, crops and fertility, including [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]; [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]; the [[Horae]] (goddesses of the seasons), and [[Proserpina]]; and [[Hades]] ([[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) who ruled the souls of dead in the [[Underworld]].

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. [[Melancholia|Black bile]] was the humor identified with earth, since both were cold and dry. Other things associated with earth and black bile in ancient and [[medieval medicine]] included the season of [[fall]], since it increased the qualities of cold and aridity; the melancholic temperament (of a person dominated by the black bile humour); the [[Femininity|feminine]]; and the southern point of the compass.

[[Image:Alchemy earth symbol.svg|thumb|100px|left|Alchemical symbol for earth]]

In [[alchemy]], earth was believed to be primarily cold, and secondarily dry, (as per Aristotle). Beyond those classical attributes, the chemical substance [[salt]], was associated with earth and its [[alchemical symbol]] was a downward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.

==Indian tradition==
{{Main|Prithvi}}
'''Prithvi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|pṛthvī}}'', also ''{{IAST|pṛthivī}}'') is the  [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''earth'' and [[mother goddess]]. According to one such tradition, she is the personification of the [[Earth]] itself; according to another, its actual [[mother]], being ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Tattwa]]'', the essence of the element earth. 

As ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Mata]]'', or &quot;[[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]&quot;, she contrasts with ''[[Dyaus Pita]]'', &quot;[[Sky Father|father sky]]&quot;. In the [[Rigveda]], ''earth'' and sky are frequently addressed as a [[duality]], often indicated by the idea of two complementary &quot;half-shells.&quot; In addition, the element Earth is associated with [[Budha]] or Mercury who represents communication, business, mathematics and other practical matters.

===Astrological personalities===
People born under the astrological signs of [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] and [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] being one of the two drawn elements meaning it is part of two of the classical elements are thought to have dominant earth personalities. Earth personalities tend to be calm, practical, hard working, wise, stable, patient and sensual; however, they can also be stubborn, possessive, jealous, nearsighted and very harsh.

===Ceremonial magic===
Earth and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the Golden Dawn system despite being considered obsolete by modern science. Zelator (1=10) is the elemental grade attributed to earth; this grade is also attributed to the Qabalistic sphere Malkuth.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154-65.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of earth is the [[Pentacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of earth is [[Uriel (archangel)|Uriel]], the angel is Phorlakh, the ruler is Kerub, the king is Ghob, and the earth [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[gnomes]].&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is considered to be passive; it is represented by the symbol for [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], and it is referred to the lower left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280-286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

It is sometimes represented by its [[Tattva]] or by a downward pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it.

===Modern witchcraft===
Earth is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n and [[Pagan]] traditions. [[Wicca]] in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism which was in turn inspired by the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp. 216-23; Valiente, witchcraft for tomorrow, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Common Wiccan attributions include:
* Cardinal direction: [[Cardinal directions|North]]
* Season: [[Autumn]]
* Time of life: Old age 
* Time of day: Midnight
* Elemental being: [[Gnome]]
* Colors: Brown and green
* Magical tools: [[Pentacle]] and staff
* [[Tarot]]: Coins in the [[Minor Arcana]]
* Altar tool: Pentacle 
* Feminine energy
* Other: [[As Above, So Below|Correspondences]] include strength, stability and abundance.

In rituals earth is represented by burying objects in the ground, carving images out of [[wood]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[herbalism]] or using [[animal fur]] and [[bone]]s.

The manifestations of the earth element are found in [[plant]]s, [[tree]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[forest]]s, [[cave]]s and [[garden]]s. The [[bear]], [[boar]], [[bull]], [[sow]], [[snake]] and [[stag]] are also thought to personify the element as are all [[burrow]]ing animals, such as the [[mole (animal)|mole]] or [[rabbit]]. Other legendary and mythical creatures of earth include the [[Faun]], [[Goblin]], [[Satyr]] and Sylvester.

==Other traditions==
In [[East Asia]], [[Metal (classical element)|metal]] is sometimes seen as the equivalent of ''earth'' and is represented by the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)]], known as 白虎 (''Bái Hǔ'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], ''Byakko'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Bạch Hổ'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and ''Baekho'' (백호, [[Hanja]]:白虎) in [[Korean language|Korean]].  ''Earth'' is represented in the [[Aztec]] religion by a house; to the [[Hindu]]s, a lotus; to the [[Scythians]], a plough; to the [[Culture of Greece|Greeks]], a wheel; and in [[Christian]] [[iconography]] by a bull.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Original research|date=November 2009}}
'''''Blue Jam''''' was an [[Ambient music|ambient]] [[radio comedy]] programme created and directed by [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]. It aired on [[BBC Radio 1]] in the early hours of the morning from 1997 to 1999.

The programme gained cult status due to its unique mix of surreal [[monologue]], [[music]], synthesised voices, heavily edited broadcasts and recurring sketches. It featured the vocal talents of [[Kevin Eldon]], [[Julia Davis]], [[Mark Heap]], [[David Cann]] and [[Amelia Bullmore]]. Morris himself delivered disturbing monologues, one of which was revamped and made into the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-winning short film, ''[[My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117|My Wrongs #8245–8249 &amp; 117]]''.

Writers who contributed to the programme included [[Graham Linehan]], [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]], [[Peter Baynham]], [[David Quantick]], [[Jane Bussmann]], Robert Katz and the cast.

==Format and style==
Each episode opened (and closed) with a short spoken introduction (delivered by Morris) describing, in surreal, broken language, various bizarre feelings and situations, set to ambient music interspersed with short clips of other songs.

===Common recurring sketches===

*'''Doctor''' (played by [[David Cann]]): &quot;The Doctor&quot; is a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; physician working in a standard British medical practice. However, he has a habit of treating his patients in bizarre and often disturbing ways, such as prescribing heroin for a cold, making a man with a headache jump up and down in order to make his penis swing (while mirroring the patient's bewildered jumping himself) and making a patient leave and go in to the next room so he can examine him over the telephone.
*'''The Monologue Man''' (played by [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]): Short stories, often up to 10 minutes in length, written from the perspective of a lonely and socially inept man. Invariably involving the man's acquaintance 'Susie', but in different capacities each time, Morris paints a picture of insanity with sober and reasonable clarity.
*'''Michael Alexander St. John''': A parody of hyperbolic and pun-laden radio presenting, St. John presents items such as the top 10 singles charts and the weekend's gigs.
*'''Monged Sex''': Short clips of two lovers making increasingly bizarre erotic requests of one another, such as &quot;shit[ting] your leg off&quot; and &quot;mak[ing] your spunk come out green&quot;.
*'''The Interviewer''' (played by Chris Morris): conducting real interviews with celebrities such as [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] and [[Jerry Springer]], Morris confuses and mocks his subjects with ambiguous and odd questions.
*'''Mr. Ventham''' (played by [[Mark Heap]]): An extremely awkward man who requires one-to-one consultations with what seems to be his psychologist for the most banal of matters.

===Radio stings===

Morris included a series of 'radio stings', bizarre sequences of sounds and prose as a parody of modern DJs' own soundbites and self-advertising pieces. Each one revolves around a contemporary DJ, such as [[Chris Moyles]], [[Jo Whiley]] and [[Mark Goodier]].

==Derivative shows==

Blue Jam was later made for [[television]] and broadcast on [[Channel 4]] as ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]''. It utilised unusual editing techniques to achieve an unnerving ambience in keeping with the radio show. Many of the sketches were lifted from the radio version, even to the extent of simply setting images to the radio soundtrack. A subsequent &quot;re-mixed&quot; airing, called ''Jaaaaam'' was even more extreme in its use of post-production gadgetry, often heavily distorting the footage.

In place of [[closing credits]] the show had the website address of jamcredits.com [http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/J/jam/credits_ie.html]

==Blue Jam CD==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BlueJamCD.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of the ''Blue Jam'' CD.]] --&gt;

A [[CD]] of some of the best ''Blue Jam'' sketches was released on 23 October 2000 on [[Warp Records]]. Although the CD claims to have 22 tracks, the last one, &quot;www.bishopslips.com,&quot; is a reference to the &quot;Bishopslips&quot; sketch. Most of the sketches on the CD were remade for ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]''.

'''Channel 4''' is a British [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public-service]] [[television]] broadcaster which began working on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by the [[#Channel Four Television Corporation|Channel Four Television Corporation]], a public body established in 1990, coming into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] transmitter in [[Wales]] to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a national TV channel for the first time.

The channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the [[United Kingdom]] in addition to the [[Television licence]]-funded [[BBC]]'s two services and the single commercial broadcasting network, [[ITV]]. 
==Public service remit==

Channel 4 was established with, and continues to hold, a remit of public service obligations which it must fulfil. The remit changes periodically, as dictated by various broadcasting and communications acts, and is regulated by the various authorities Channel 4 has been answerable to; originally the IBA, then the [[Independent Television Commission|ITC]] and now [[Ofcom]].

The preamble of the remit as per the [[Communications Act 2003]] states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The public service remit for Channel 4 is the provision of a broad range of high quality and diverse programming which, in particular:
*    demonstrates innovation, experiment and creativity in the form and content of programmes;
*    appeals to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society;
*    makes a significant contribution to meeting the need for the licensed public service channels to include programmes of an educational nature and other programmes of educative value; and
*   exhibits a distinctive character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/about4/overview.html | publisher=Channel 4 | title=Channel 4 Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;licence&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/ | publisher=Ofcom | title=Channel 4 Licence}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The remit also involves an obligation to provide programming for schools,&lt;ref name=&quot;schools&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf | format=PDF | title=Channel 4 Broadcasting Licence | pages = [http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf#page=13 Appendix 2, part 10 (Page 13)] | publisher=Ofcom | date=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a substantial amount of programming produced outside of [[Greater London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf | format=PDF | title=Channel 4 Broadcasting Licence | pages = [http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/c4/c4v2attach.pdf#page=12 Appendix 2, part 8 (Page 12)] | publisher=Ofcom | date=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an organisation, Channel 4 is known as the '''Channel Four Television Corporation''' (sometimes abbreviated to C4C), a [[statutory corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmpubacc/409/40905.htm&lt;/ref&gt; though this form is more recent than the station itself, having previously been the '''Channel Four Television Company Limited''', a subsidiary of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], between 1982 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/4D2/BA/201.pdf | format=PDF | title=National Assets Register of the Department of Culture Media &amp; Sport | pages=[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/4D2/BA/201.pdf#page=42 Page 42] | accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tbsseefour&quot;/&gt;

Towards the end of the 1980s, the government began a radical process of re-organisation of the commercial broadcasting industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2005-09-11 | url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/theauthority/quality.php | title=Never Mind The Quality | publisher=The Authority by Electromusications from [http://www.transdiffusion.org Transdiffusion] | author=Stephen Hopkins | accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written onto the statute books by means of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ninetyact&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900042_en_3.htm#mdiv23 | title=Broadcasting Act 1990 (c. 42) | publisher=Office of Public Sector Information | date=2000-09-20 | accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, this meant the abolition of the IBA, and hence the Channel Four Television Company. The result led to the creation of a corporation to own and operate the channel, which would have a greater deal of autonomy and would eventually go on to establish its other operations. The new corporation, which became operational in 1993, remained publicly owned and was regulated by the new [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC), created under the same act. The ITC and its duties were later replaced by [[Ofcom]], which like its predecessor is responsible for appointing the Corporation's board, in agreement with the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;/&gt;

In terms of the station's remit and other duties, the creation of the corporation meant little change; the new corporation would have to manage its own advertising, rather than this being carried out on its behalf by the local ITV contractors (see [[#Funding|Funding]]).

==History==
===Wales===
{{Main|S4C}}
At the time the fourth service was being considered, a movement in Wales lobbied for the creation of dedicated service that would air Welsh-language programmes, then only catered for at 'off peak' times on [[BBC Wales]] and [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]]. The campaign was taken so seriously by [[Gwynfor Evans]], former president of [[Plaid Cymru]], that he threatened the government with a hunger strike were it not to honour the plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;seefour_wales&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/wales.php | title=A Channel for Wales | author=Dafydd Hancock | publisher=seefour by Electromusications from [http://www.transdiffusion.org Transdiffusion] | date=2005-09-11 | accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was that Channel 4 as seen by the rest of the United Kingdom would be replaced in Wales by ''[[Sianel Pedwar Cymru]] (S4C)'' ({{lang-en|Channel Four Wales}}). Operated by a specially created [[Welsh Fourth Channel Authority]], S4C would air programmes in Welsh as made by HTV, the BBC, or from independent companies. Initially limited frequency space meant that Channel 4 could not be broadcast alongside S4C, though some English Channel 4 programmes would be aired at less popular times on the Welsh variant, a practice that carried on up until the closure of S4C's analogue transmissions in 2010.

Since then, carriage on digital [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial]] has introduced Channel 4 to Welsh homes where it is now universally available.

===Conception===
Before Channel 4 and S4C, Britain had three terrestrial television services: [[BBC One|BBC1]], [[BBC Two|BBC2]], and [[ITV]]. The [[Broadcasting Act 1980]] began the process of adding a fourth, and Channel 4, along with its [[S4C|Welsh counterpart]], was formally created by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1982. After some months of test broadcasts, it began scheduled transmissions on 2 November 1982.

The notion of a second commercial broadcaster in the United Kingdom had been around since the inception of ITV in 1954 and its subsequent launch in 1955; the idea of an '[[ITV2#Background|ITV2]]' was long expected and pushed for. Indeed television sets sold throughout the 1970s and early 1980s had a spare channel called 'ITV/IBA 2'. Throughout [[History of ITV|ITV's history]] and until Channel 4 finally became a reality, a perennial dialogue existed between the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]], [[Her Majesty's Government|the government]], the ITV companies and other interested parties, concerning the form such an expansion of commercial broadcasting would take. It was most likely politics which had the biggest impact in leading to a delay of almost three decades before the second commercial channel became a reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;tbsseefour&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/yes.php | title=Yes it's no | author=Russ J Graham | publisher=seefour by Electromusications from [http://www.transdiffusion.org Transdiffusion] | date = 2005-09-11 | accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; With what can crudely be summed up as a clash of ideologies between an expansion of ITV's [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] ethos and a [[public service broadcasting|public service]] approach more akin to the BBC, it was ultimately somewhat of a compromise that eventually led to the formation of Channel 4 as launched in 1982.

One clear benefit of the 'late arrival' of the channel was that its frequency allocations at each transmitter had already been arranged in the early 1960s, when the launch of an ITV2 was highly anticipated.&lt;ref name=&quot;tbsseefour&quot;/&gt; This led to very good coverage across most of the country and few problems of interference with other UK-based transmissions; a stark contrast to the problems associated with [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s launch 14 and a half years later.

===Launch and IBA control: 1982–1993===

[[Image:C4logo82-96.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The original Channel 4 blocks logo, used between 2 November 1982 and 11 October 1996, the logo was briefly revived in 2007 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the channel.]]
The first voice ever heard on Channel 4's opening day of Tuesday 2 November 1982 was that of [[continuity announcer]] [[Paul Coia]], who intoned, &quot;Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be able to say to you: Welcome to Channel Four&quot;, before heading into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station's signature tune, &quot;[[Fourscore]]&quot;, written by [[Lord David Dundas]], which would form the basis of the station's jingles for its first decade. The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime [[game show]] ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', at 16.45 produced by [[Yorkshire Television]]; it is still running as of 2010. The first person to be seen on Channel 4 was [[Richard Whiteley]] with [[Carol Vorderman]] being the second and the first female on the channel. Whiteley opened the show with the words &quot;As the countdown to a brand new channel ends, a brand new countdown begins.&quot;  On its first day, Channel 4 also broadcast controversial soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', which ran for 21 years.

Upon its launch, Channel 4 committed itself to providing an alternative to the existing channels, an agenda in part set out by its remit which required the provision of programming to minority groups.

In step with its remit, the channel became well received both by minority groups and the arts and cultural worlds during this period, especially under Isaacs, where the channel gained a reputation for programmes on the contemporary arts. The channel often did not receive mass audiences for much of this period, however, as might be expected for a station focusing on minority interest.

Channel 4 also began the funding of independent films, such as the [[Merchant-Ivory]] [[docudrama]] ''[[The Courtesans of Bombay]]'', during this time.

In 1992, Channel 4 also faced its first libel case by [[Jani Allan]], a South African journalist, who objected to her representation in the documentary ''[[The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/901342.stm|title= BBC News - UK - Victims of the 'silver fox'|accessdate=2007-08-20 | date=2000-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:C4logo96-99.png|thumb|150px|right|The Channel 4 circles logo - referred to as the &quot;4 Connections&quot; - used between 12 October 1996 and 2 April 1999. The four circles appeared in various configurations.]]

===Channel Four Television Corporation: 1993 onwards===

After control of the station passed from the Channel Four Television Company to the Channel Four Television Corporation in 1993 (see [[#Channel Four Television Corporation|above]]), a shift in broadcasting style took place. Instead of aiming for the fringes of society, it began to focus on the edges of the mainstream, and the centre of the mass market itself{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. It began to show many US programmes in peak viewing time, far more than it had previously done. It premièred such shows as ''[[Friends]]'' and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.

In the early 2000s, Channel Four began broadcasting reality formats such as ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and obtained the rights to broadcast mass appeal sporting events like [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]]. This new direction increased ratings and revenues.

In addition, the channel launched a number of new television channels through its new [[Channel 4#4Ventures.2F4Rights|4Ventures]] off-shoot, including [[#Film4|Film4]], [[#At the Races|At The Races]], [[#E4|E4]] and [[#More4|More4]] (see [[#Other services|Other services]]).

Partially in reaction to its new 'populist' direction, the [[Communications Act 2003]] directed the channel to demonstrate innovation, experimentation and creativity, appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society and to include programmes of an educational nature which exhibit a distinctive character.&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;/&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]] founder [[Andy Duncan (executive)|Andy Duncan]], 2005 saw a change of direction for Channel 4's digital channels. Channel 4 made E4 'free to air' on Digital Terrestrial, and launched a new 'free to air' digital channel called [[More4]]. By October, Channel 4 had joined the Freeview consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1225|title=DTG News: ITV and Channel 4 confirm Freeview stakes|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2006, [[Film4]] had also become a 'free to air' and re-started broadcasting on Digital Terrestrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&amp;id=21|title=CHANNEL4SALES : NEWS|accessdate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203111052/http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&amp;id=21 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venturing into radio broadcasting, 2005 saw Channel 4 purchase 51 per cent of shares in the now defunct [[Oneword]] radio station with UBC Media holding on to the remaining shares. New programmes such as the weekly, half-hour ''The Morning Report'' news programme were among some of the new content Channel 4 provided for the station, with the name [[#4radio|4Radio]] being used. As of early 2009, however, Channel 4's future involvement in radio remained uncertain.

On 2 November 2007, the station celebrated its twenty-fifth birthday. It showed the first episode of ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', an anniversary ''Countdown'' special, as well as a special edition of [[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year#The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz|The Big Fat Quiz]] and using the original multicoloured 1982-1996 blocks logo on presentation and idents using the [[Fourscore]] jingle throughout the day.

[[Image:Channel 4 New Logo.svg|thumb|125px|right|Channel 4's shadow logo, used from New Year's Eve 2004 onwards. cut out from a white background, and is shown in moving.]]

In November 2009, Channel 4 launched a week of [[3D television]], broadcasting selected programmes each night using [[Stereoscopy#ColorCode 3D|stereoscopic ColorCode technology]]. The accompanying 3D glasses were distributed through [[Sainsbury's]] supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/programmes/3d-week&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The future ===
Channel 4 has raised concerns over how it might finance its public service obligations after digital switch-over. However, some certainty lies in the announcement in April 2006 that Channel 4's digital switch-over costs would be paid for by licence fee revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,1761155,00.html|title=Media registration promo - Media - MediaGuardian.co.uk |accessdate=2007-04-03 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=2006-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 2007, Channel 4 announced plans to launch a music channel &quot;4Music&quot; as a joint venture with British media company [[EMAP]] which would include carriage on the [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]] platform. On 15 August 2008, [[4Music]] was launched across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://4music.channel4.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Channel 4 have announced interest in launching a high-definition version of Film4 on Freeview, to coincide with the launch of Channel 4 HD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962004.html?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1|title= Channel 4 maps music presence|accessdate=2007-05-07 | first=Steve | last=Clarke | date=2007-03-28 | work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukfree.tv/fullstory.php?storyid=1107051220|title=Channel 4 to join YouTube and add music channel to - ukfree.tv - independent digital TV and switchover advice|accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the fourth HD slot was given to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a159413/five-awarded-freeview-hd-licence.html|title=Five awarded Freeview HD licence|date=11 June 2009|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 4 has since acquired a 50% stake in EMAP's TV business for a reported £28 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a67199/channel-4-takes-50-percent-stake-in-emap-tv.html|title= Channel 4 takes 50% stake in Emap TV|date=2007-07-23|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Neil Wilkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage==
Channel 4 was carried from its beginning on analogue terrestrial (except in Wales), which was practically the only means of television broadcast in the United Kingdom at the time. It will continue to be broadcast through these means until the changeover to [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom]] is complete. Since 1998, it has been universally available on digital terrestrial, and the [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] platform (encrypted, though free of charge) as well as having been available from various times in various areas, on analogue and digital cable networks.

Due to its special status as a public service broadcaster with a specific remit, it is afforded free carriage on the terrestrial platforms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/psb_review/digitalpsb/digitalpsb.pdf] Digital PSB, Public Service Broadcasting post Digital Switchover, section 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with other broadcasters such as ITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itvplc.com/itv/news/releases/pr2005/2005-06-29/|title=Ofcom determination of financial terms for Channel 3 licences ITV plc response|accessdate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061015170803/http://www.itvplc.com/itv/news/releases/pr2005/2005-06-29/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel 4 is also available overseas: parts of the European mainland have been able to receive terrestrial transmissions from the United Kingdom, and some overseas cable networks have carried the service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

Channel 4 Ulster has been available in large parts of Ireland, especially border counties which have been able to receive terrestrial transmissions from Northern Ireland. Channel 4 Ulster has been carried on Irish cable networks since the station went on the air in 1982. 
S4C has been available as a terrestrial transmission from Wales in southern counties such as Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.

From 4 December 2006 Channel 4 was officially available to Sky viewers in Ireland; some programmes, mainly imports, are not aired on this channel variant, due to Channel 4 not owning the relevant broadcast rights within the country.

Channel 4 allowed Internet users in the United Kingdom to watch Channel 4 live on the Internet{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}.  However some programmes (mostly international imports) were not shown and this service no longer exists. Channel 4 is also provided by [[Virgin Mobile]]'s [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] mobile TV service which has the same restrictions as the Internet live stream had.

Channel 4 also makes some of its programming available &quot;on demand&quot; via cable and the Internet (see [[Channel 4#4oD .2F Catch-up|4oD]]).

==Funding==
During the station's formative years, funding came from the [[ITV]] companies in return for their right to sell advertisements in their region on the fourth channel.

Nowadays it pays for itself in much the same way as most privately run commercial stations, i.e. through the sale of on-air advertising, programme sponsorship, and the sale of any programme content and merchandising rights it owns, such as overseas sales and video sales. It also has the ability to subsidise the main network through any profits made on the corporation's other endeavours, which have in the past included subscription fees from stations such as [[E4 (channel)|E4]] and [[Film4]] (now no longer subscription services) and its 'video-on-demand' sales. In practice, however, these other activities are loss-making, and are subsidised by the main network. According to Channel 4's last published accounts, for 2005, the extent of this cross-subsidy was some £30 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf 11419_11419_C4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in funding method came about by the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] when the new corporation was afforded the ability to fund itself. Originally this arrangement left a 'safety net' guaranteed minimum income should the revenue fall too low, funded by large insurance payments made to the ITV companies. Such a subsidy was never required, however, and these premiums were phased out by government in 1998. After the link with ITV was cut, the cross-promotion which had existed between ITV and Channel 4 also ended.

In 2007 due to severe funding difficulties, the channel sought government help and was granted a payment of £14 million over a six-year period. The money would have come from the television licence fee and would have been the first time that money from the licence fee had been given to any broadcaster other than the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/jowell-challenges-channel-4-to-justify-16314m-of-public-funding-454035.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Jowell challenges Channel 4 to justify £14m of public funding | first=Ian | last=Burrell | date=2007-06-21 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was scrapped by The [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Andy Burnham]], ahead of &quot;broader decisions about the future framework of public service broadcasting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7750501.stm | work=BBC News | title=Channel 4 switchover cash shelved | date=2008-11-26 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]] released their review in January 2009 in which they suggested that Channel 4 would preferably be funded by &quot;partnerships, joint ventures or mergers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/psb2_phase2/statement/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{Main|Channel 4 programming}}

[[Image:C4 share of viewing 1992-2007 v2.png|thumb|left|300px|Channel 4 share of viewing 1992-2007 BARB figures. Peaks from mid-2000 coincide with broadcast of [[Endemol]]'s ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (UK)#Celebrity Big Brother|Celebrity Big Brother]]'']]
Channel 4 is a &quot;publisher-broadcaster&quot;, meaning that it commissions or &quot;buys&quot; all of its programming from companies independent of itself, and was the first broadcaster in the United Kingdom to do so on any significant scale. This had the consequence of starting an industry of production companies that did not have to rely on owning an [[ITV]] licence in order to see their programmes air, though since Channel 4, external commissioning has become regular practise on the numerous stations that have launched since, as well as on the [[BBC]] and in ITV (where a quota of 25% minimum of total output has been imposed since the 1990 Broadcasting Act came into force). Ironically, having been the first British broadcaster to completely commission its core product from third parties, and after 25 years in-house, Channel 4 will now become the last terrestrial broadcaster to outsource its transmission and playout operations (to Red Bee Media).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/nov/14/channel4.television1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Channel 4 outsources to Red Bee | first=Caitlin | last=Fitzsimmons | date=2007-11-14 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirement to obtain all content externally is stipulated in its licence.&lt;ref name=&quot;licence&quot;/&gt; Additionally, Channel 4 also began a trend of owning the copyright and distribution rights of the programmes it aired, in a manner that is similar to the major Hollywood studios' ownership of television programs that they did not directly produce. Thus, although Channel 4 does not produce programmes, many are seen as belonging to it.

Channel 4 also pioneered the concept of ''stranded programming'', where seasons of programmes following a common theme would be aired and promoted together. Some would be very specific, and run for a fixed period of time; the ''[[4 Mation]]'' season, for example, showed innovative animation. Other, less specific strands, were (and still are) run regularly, such as ''[[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]]'', a strand of programming aimed at teenagers, on weekend mornings (and weekdays during school/college holidays); ''Friday Night Comedy'', a slot where the channel would pioneer its style of comedy commissions, ''4Music'' (now a separate channel) and ''[[4Later]]'', an eclectic collection of offbeat programmes transmitted to a cult audience in the early hours of the morning.

In its earlier years, ''Red Triangle'' was the name given to the airing of certain risqué art-house films due to the use of a red triangle [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the upper right of the screen, dubbed as being pornographic by many of Channel 4's critics, whilst general broadcasting of films on the station for many years came under the banner of ''Film on Four'' prior to the launch of the ''[[Film4|FilmFour]]'' brand and station in the late 1990s.

Its critically acclaimed news service, ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', is supplied by [[ITN]] whilst its long-standing investigative documentary, ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'', causes perennial media attention.

==Other services==
November 1998 saw Channel 4 expand beyond its remit of providing the 'fourth service' in a significant way, with the launch of [[Film4|FilmFour]]. Since then the corporation has been involved in a range of other activities, all in some way associated with the main channel, and mainly using the '4' brand.

In March 2010 these additional services were reviewed by the government's Culture, Media and Sport select committee. The channel and its Chief Executive were criticised for breaking service commitments, a lack of transparency in accounting for digital channels, poor governance and failed investments&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2010/mar/22/channel-4-select-committee-review Channel 4 select committee review is a stinker The Guardian 22 March 2010] Retrieved 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===4Ventures/4Rights===
In 2001 [http://www.channel4.com/4ventures/about/index.html 4Ventures] was created as the parent body of Channel 4 related commercial activities, rather than public-service obligations, with the intent of making profit which would serve to subsidise the main Channel 4.

Following the sale of [[Quiz Call]] (a gaming channel operated by the then-owned subsidiary [[Ostrich Media]]) in 2006, a restructure of 4Ventures saw many of its activities re-integrated back into the main channel's operations (including day-to-day running of E4, Film4 and More4).

'''4Rights''', was formed from an amalgamation of '''''Channel 4 International''''' and '''''Channel 4 Consumer Products'''''. As part of the restructure, much of the 4Ventures management team either left the company - former chief executive (and Channel 4 commercial director) Rob Woodward, and managing director Anmar Kawash are now Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer respectively of [[STV Group plc]] - or transferred to other posts within Channel 4.

In 2007, the expanding, UK-based, independent distribution group Digital Rights Group (DRG) announced an intention to buy Channel 4 International (adding it to Zeal and ID Distribution among its other companies), following a review by Channel 4 of its commercial division. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/nov/23/channel4.television The deal was completed in November of the same year]. The Consumer Products division has been retained by Channel 4 as part of a new, restructured, 4Rights division.

====Film4====
{{Main|Film4}}
Channel 4 has had a long record of success in funding the production of films through '''Channel Four Films''', renamed '''FilmFour''' in 1998 to coincide with the launch of its digital channel of the same name. Notable successes include ''[[The Madness of King George]]'', ''[[The Crying Game]]'' and ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]''. However, this dedicated film-making wing was scaled back in 2002 as a cost-cutting measure in the face of substantial losses.

Channel 4 launched a subscription film channel, FilmFour, in November 1998. It was available on digital [[satellite television]] and digital cable. Companion services, such as FilmFour+1, FilmFour World and FilmFour Extreme were also available on some digital services. In 2003 Extreme and World were discontinued, and replaced with FilmFour Weekly. FilmFour Weekly closed in July 2006, when the main, newly named Film4 channel went free-to-view and became available on [[Digital terrestrial|Digital Terrestrial]]. The switchover to digital terrestrial was heavily advertised. The adverts featured [[Lucy Liu]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Dame Judi Dench]], [[Gael García Bernal]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Mackenzie Crook]], [[Rhys Ifans]] and [[Ray Winstone]] declaring &quot;Film4 is now free&quot; in various situations across London. It remains the only film channel available free on digital terrestrial television.

In 2002, Channel 4's film financing division ([[Film4 Productions]]) was seriously scaled back, due to massive losses, although total closure was averted. It had however had various successes, most notably ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (movie)|Trainspotting]]''. In 1994, [[BAFTA]]/LA (the Los Angeles branch of the British Academy of Film &amp; Television Arts) presented a full-length film festival in Los Angeles in conjunction with the [[American Cinematheque]] (the US equivalent of Britain's [[National Film Theatre]]) that saluted the considerable contributions to British film of Channel 4's film division since its inception. The festival presented many of the most celebrated Channel 4 films, and also featured panel discussions about Channel 4's role between Channel 4 chief executive [[Michael Grade]] and US TV producer [[Norman Lear]].

When Channel 4 had the rights to broadcast test match cricket in England, the downtime of the FilmFour channel was often used to broadcast uninterrupted coverage of a match when the main channel was committed elsewhere, usually to racing. At these times FilmFour was available unencrypted and free-to-air.

====E4====
{{Main|E4 (channel)}}
E4, a digital entertainment channel previously available on the Internet, with a target age-range of 16-34, was launched in January 2001. It features premières of US imports and supplementary footage for programmes on its main channel (most notably extended ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' coverage).

In 2005 it launched on [[Digital terrestrial|Digital Terrestrial]]. E4 now has as much coverage as other services available on Cable, Satellite and Digital Terrestrial like [[ITV2]] and [[BBC Three]]. It is a very successful channel with a ''first look'' or sneak peek, with the next episode of some series, such as ''[[Hollyoaks]] ''and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' appearing on E4 immediately after the show on Channel 4 has finished. Also they have &quot;Second Chance Sunday&quot; which allows you to see programmes you have missed during the week on a Sunday. New show ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' was a massive success for E4, peaking at the 2 million mark - one of the most viewed premières in digital TV history. There has, however, been some criticism that E4 (like many other digital channels), relies on seemingly endless repeats of a small selection of shows (notably ''[[Friends]]''), with further suggestion that it is often the same ''season'' of a particular show that is endlessly repeated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

During ''Big Brother'', E4 plays host to live coverage of the show, subject to a delay. Until 2005, programmes on the channel did not air until 14.00 GMT, but on 12 August 2005 the widely-advertised '''E4 Music''' airs from 06.00 until 10.00 GMT, with various music shows and videos being showcased. This however is rested during ''Big Brother''. Transmission of E4 Music has since declined and has been replaced with repeats of popular E4 shows. It has been declared that '''E4 Music''' has been moved permanently to the new '''4Music''' channel. Since 2008, live coverage of Big Brother has been shortened during the day, until coming to a close in 2010.

E4 is widely available in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in close to 70% of homes. It is carried on the [[NTL Ireland|NTL]] / [[Chorus Communications|Chorus cable networks]] and also on Sky. The channel operates a separate advertising opt-out in Ireland allowing advertisers to directly target Irish audiences. This has been a highly successful commercial operation and all airtime sales are handled on the channels behalf by [[Medialink]] in Dublin.

====More4====
{{Main|More4}}
More4 is a channel aimed at those aged 35–60. Launched on 10 October 2005, it channel carries news and nightly discussion programmes, such as ''More4 News'', an extension of ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' that attempts to look &quot;beyond the headlines&quot;, giving in-depth analysis. Advertising before the launch of the channel flaunted such HBO shows as ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'', as well as NBC's ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''. Its conception has met conflicting responses; many people believe the programmes shown to be of great quality, while others see it as an excuse to free up more room for a deluge of property programmes or less respectable programmes (see ''[[Fat Pets]]'') in all other free slots on Channel 4.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

====4Music====
{{Main|4Music}}
Over recent years [[4Music]] has risen, showing new single releases, as well as other music shows frequently broadcast across T4, Channel 4 and E4. 2007 saw its own logo being devised and since then has had many themed weekends dedicated to a current band or performer.

On Sundays, Channel 4's 4Music strand aired between 17:00 and midnight on [[The Hits]]. The first 'episode' was presented by the most successful female act of the century [[Sugababes]], however 4Music Sundays were meant to feature live acts and also The Shockwaves Album Chart Show.

On 20 February 2008, it was announced that The Hits was to be rebranded as 4Music later in the year, and on 15 August 2008, Channel 4 replaced [[The Hits]] with 4Music. 4Music is available on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] 360, [[Virgin Media|Virgin]] 330 and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/music/features/F/4musiclaunch.html|accessdate=2008-08-10|title=4Music Launch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See ''[[#Box Television|Box Television]]'')

4Music also has its own monthly music magazine show, The Crush. Which is hosted by [[Rick Edwards]].

==== '+1' Channels ====
[[Image:Channel4+1Logo.svg|thumb|100px|right|Channel 4 &quot;+ 1&quot; logo.]]
Channel 4 runs [[Timeshift channel|timeshift]] variants of all its services (excluding 4Music and [[Channel 4 HD]]), including Channel 4 +1 since 20 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,2119529,00.html |publisher=Media Guardian |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=2007-07-05 | title=Channel 4 launches '+1' timeshift service |author=Chris Tryhorn | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; across all digital platforms. Channel 4 was the first terrestrial broadcaster in the United Kingdom to offer a time-shift variant of its main channel.  In common with many other broadcasters, these channels output exactly the same programmes and continuity as was broadcast an hour previously, and are titled with the station name followed by a &quot;+1&quot; suffix.

Channel 4 +1, E4 +1 and More4 +1 all carry a &quot;+1&quot; indication onscreen. There was some concern{{Who|date=April 2010}} about how it would be indicated on [[Channel 4 +1]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} as Channel 4 does not carry its own on-screen graphic. Eventually, a &quot;+1&quot; symbol that is derived from the Channel 4 logo was unveiled. Neither Film4 nor Film4 +1 carry on-screen graphics.

====Box Television====
In July 2007 Channel 4 bought 50% of Box Television Ltd for £28 m from Emap plc. It has since emerged that, as a result of Emap's decision to sell off its divisions in a break-up sale of the group, Channel 4 may be interested in acquiring the remaining half of the business. Box TV operates seven music TV stations ([[4Music]], [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]], [[Smash Hits (TV channel)|Smash Hits]], [[Kerrang! (TV channel)|Kerrang!]], [[Q (TV channel)|Q]], [[Kiss (TV channel)|Kiss]] and [[Magic (TV channel)|Magic]]). Emap's stake in Box Television Limited was transferred to new owners, Bauer Consumer Media, following Bauer's acquisition of Emap's publishing and radio businesses.

==== Channel 4 HD ====
[[Image:Channel 4HD Logo.svg|thumb|170px|right]]
On 10 December 2007, Channel 4 launched a [[high definition television]] [[simulcast]] of Channel 4 on [[Sky+ HD]], after British Sky Broadcasting agreed to contribute toward the channel’s satellite distribution costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/dtg/press_releases/dtg_nmm_20100318.pdf|title=BBC HD strategy comes into focus as Five opts for BSkyB, not Freeview|publisher=New Media Markets|date=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is planned to roll out on other platforms &quot;in the future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a75939/channel-4-hd-to-launch-in-december.html | title=Channel 4 HD to launch in December | accessdate=2007-09-19 | date=2007-09-19 | author=James Welsh | publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 2009, Virgin Media added Channel 4 HD on channel 146 as a part of the M pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a168390/c4-hd-coming-to-virgin-media-tomorrow.html|title=C4 HD coming to Virgin Media tomorrow|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2010 Channel 4 HD appeared on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] channel 52 with a placeholding caption, ahead of a commercial launch on 30 March 2010, coinciding with the commercial launch of Freeview HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a210797/c4-hd-begins-freeview-test-transmissions.html|title=C4 HD begins Freeview test transmissions|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2010/03/30/freeview_hd_launches_gets_channel_4/|title=Freeview HD launches, gets Channel 4|publisher=Register Hardware|date=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2011, Channel 4 HD was added to [[Freesat]] on channel 126.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joinfreesat.co.uk/index.php/channel-4-hd-finally-arrives-on-freesat|title=Channel 4 HD Finally Arrives On Freesat|publisher=Join Freesat|date=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the channel moved from being [[free-to-view]] to [[free-to-air]] on satellite during March 2011.

The channel carries the same schedule as Channel 4, broadcasting programmes in HD when available. Initially this has been mostly American imports (such as ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' for example) and movies, however, original programming such as ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' and ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' have been broadcast in HD. Although the intention is to increase the amount of &quot;home grown&quot; material being broadcast in HD. It has been announced as the UK's first full-time high definition channel from a terrestrial broadcaster.

Previously, in the summer of 2006, Channel 4 ran a six month closed trial of [[High-definition television|HDTV]], as part of the wider [[Digital television in the United Kingdom#Freeview HD|Freeview HD]] experiment via the [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace transmitter]] to London and parts of the [[home counties]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/ddr/ddr_annexed.pdf Digital Dividend Review Annexes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']] and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as part of the experiment, as US broadcasters such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] already have an HDTV back catalogue.

===Previous channels ===
====At the Races====
{{Main|At the Races}}
In 2000, Channel 4 launched a dedicated horse racing channel, At the Races. The channel ceased broadcasting in 2003. It was subsequently bought by [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and relaunched in June 2004. Channel 4 has no involvement with the new At The Races, which is branded with almost identical livery as Sky Sports. Channel 4's racing coverage, re-named to incorporate &quot;At The Races&quot; in the title, returned to its original name of [[Channel 4 Racing]] when the channel left involvement with At The Races. Channel 4 racing programmes now feature close co-operation with rival digital racing channel [[Racing UK]], who sub-licence the live rights and share the same production company. Channel 4 cross-promote Racing UK's coverage of the day's racing during its broadcasts.

===Radio===
====4 Digital Group====
{{Main|4 Digital Group}}

Channel 4 was the leading member of the '''[[4 Digital Group]]''' consortium, which includes [[EMAP]], [[UTV]] and [[STV Group plc]] as partners (although STV's involvement will cease when Virgin Radio is floated as a separate company). In July 2007 The group was awarded the 12 year licence to operate the second national [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] radio licence after having defeated its only rival, [[National Grid Wireless]], in the three-month bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/radio/story/0,,2120230,00.html | title=Channel 4 wins radio multiplex bid | accessdate=2007-07-06 | date=2007-07-06 | author=Ben Dowell | publisher=Media Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service would have operated ten radio stations, including Channel 4 Radio, E4 Radio, [[Sky News Radio]] (operated by [[British Sky Broadcasting|BSkyB]] and [[Global Radio]]) and [[Radio Disney]] (in association with [[Disney]]). Many of the services, especially Channel 4 Radio and E4 Radio would have competed directly with national BBC Radio stations. [[Podcast]] and text services were also to have been provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/radio/story/0,,2120639,00.html | title=The 4 Digital Group radio stations | accessdate=2007-07-06 | date=2007-07-06 | publisher=Media Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In  October 2008 Channel 4 announced that it was abandoning its plans for digital radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/14/radio-channel4 The Guardian, News, Media, Radio, Tuesday 14 October, 2008 16.52 BST - 4 Digital radio partners in crisis talks]&lt;/ref&gt;

====4radio====
[[Image:4Radio.svg|160px|right]]
In June 2006 Channel 4 tried to launch '''4radio''',&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4radio.com|title=4radio|accessdate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070323012109/http://www.channel4radio.com/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering audio programmes in the shape of podcasts aimed at introducing new public service radio services informed by C4's values of creativity and innovation. Coupled with its strategy of becoming a truly multimedia company, 4radio hosts shows that tie in with its flagship TV hits including ''Big Brother'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', and ''Channel 4 News''.

The successful multiplex consortium was expected to launch in 2008 with a taste of Channel 4 Radio's audio output made available earlier,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; including a revival of the channel's [[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/music/microsites/0-9/4radio/thetube/index.html|title=4Radio - The Tube|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; music programme, and a very small amount of 4radio-branded content was heard on [[Oneword]] until its closure in January 2008.

Channel 4, as part of its review of public serving spending in 2008 decided to focus its expenditure on TV content and decided to stop its radio plans, resulting in the closure of 4 Digital Group.

====Oneword====
{{Main|Oneword}}
Oneword was a [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|digital radio]] station featuring the spoken word. In early 2005 Channel 4 purchased a minority stake in it, later that year buying a majority one worth £1,000,000. On 4 January 2007 it was announced that had Channel 4 sold its 51% stake back to [[UBC Media]] for £1. Its normal programming was suspended while a strategic review took place on the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jan/04/channel4.digitaltvradio|title=Channel 4 sell majority stake in Oneword|accessdate=2008-01-04|date=2008-01-04|publisher=Media Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station ceased broadcasting on 11 January 2008.

The station's website is [http://www.channel4.com channel4.com]. The site offers detailed programme information, highlights, and chats with actors and presenters of all Channel 4 channels. It also has in-depth sections including news, film, homes, sport, and more. Its learning sections are often used by many for educational needs.

=== Internet ===
==== 4mations ====
{{Main|4mations}}
In January 2008, Channel 4 joined with [[Aardman Animations]] and Lupus Films to create [[4mations]], a [[user-generated content]] animation portal, similar to [[aniBOOM]] or [[MyToons]].

===4oD / Catch-up===
[[Image:4 on Demand logo.svg|thumb|100px|right|4oD Logo]]

Launched in November 2006, 4oD stands for &quot;4 on Demand&quot;, an [[Internet Television]] service which allows Internet (e.g. via  [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]], [[Virgin Media]], [[TalkTalk TV]] and [[BT Vision]]) users to view programming recently shown on Channel 4, E4 or More4, or from their archives. The cable and IPTV versions is operated through an appropriate [[set top box]] whilst the Internet variant can be accessed via Internet websites such as Channel 4 or [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]].

As of April 2009, the Internet version is fully available to Windows, Mac and Linux users so long as Adobe Flash Player is installed.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.channel4.com/platform4/2009/04/01/its-here-all-new-4od-catch-up/&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Catch-up&quot; service offers content free of charge for both streaming and downloaded versions of a programme for thirty days after its broadcast on Channel 4.  At this time, not all content is available to Irish users, due to licensing restrictions, however the majority of the programming is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.channel4.com/platform4/2009/09/24/4od-returns-to-the-republic-of-ireland/ - 4oD returns to Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

A Download to Own (DTO) or &quot;Buy&quot; feature was once available on selected content, allowing users to purchase a programme and keep it for as long as they wish. This service has now been suspended alongside the application to power it, in favour of further investment into their online cross platform catchup service powered by Adobe Flash 10.

The 4oD service is also partly available on [[YouTube]], launching in the United Kingdom in late 2009 with seven genre dedicated channels for ''4oD'', additional to separate channels ''Channel 4'' and ''E4''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Channel 4 Youtube Link&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/user/channel4?blend=2&amp;ob=4 Channel 4 Youtube Link].&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 14 day catchup version of 4oD is now available on the [[PS3]], at http://ps3.channel4.com.

Also a [[IPad]] Application was launched on May 3, 2011. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.which.co.uk/news/2011/05/channel-4-launches-4od-ipad-app-252487/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teletext ===
==== 4-Tel/FourText ====
{{Main|FourText}}

Channel 4 originally licensed an ancillary teletext service to provide schedules, programme information and features. The original service was called 4-Tel and was provided in collaboration with [[ORACLE (teletext)|Oracle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;4Tel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/ancillary/c4-s4c/index.shtml|title=ANCILLARY TELETEXT SERVICES|accessdate=2007-06-10|last=Brown|first=Mike|publisher=MB21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, with Oracle losing its franchise to [[Teletext Ltd]], the running of 4-Tel was taken over by Intelfax,&lt;ref name=&quot;4Tel&quot; /&gt; and in 2002 was renamed FourText.

==== Teletext on 4 ====
{{Main|Teletext on 4}}

In 2003, Channel 4 awarded Teletext Ltd a ten year contract to run the channel's ancillary teletext service, named Teletext on 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmgt.co.uk/mediacentre/newsreleases/20030701/3282/|title=Teletext and C4 sign text services deal|accessdate=2007-06-10|date=2003-07-01|publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust plc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is provided on both Channel 4 analogue and digital television services, Channel 4, E4 and More4. This has now been ceased and Teletext is no longer available on Channel 4, [[ITV]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].

Despite nearly all Channel 4 programmes being commissioned from independent production companies, the Channel 4 headquarters originally contained a studio and post-production facility, marketed as '''124 Facilities'''. The studio was used for Channel 4 programmes (such as T4 continuity), and other channels' programmes such as [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s football coverage. The studio was closed at the end of October 2007 and only the post-production operation remains, though it is now managed by [[Red Bee Media]].

==Regions==
Channel 4 has, since its inception, broadcast identical programmes and [[continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] throughout the United Kingdom (excluding Wales where it did not operate on analogue transmitters). At launch this made it unique, as both the BBC and [[ITV]] had long established traditions of providing [[regional variations]] in their programming and announcements between transmitters in different areas of the country (although in the case of BBC2, variations have by and large tended to be limited to national idents as opposed to regional ones). In ITV's case, this was a consequence of its inherent federal structure (see [[ITV#ITV companies: Past and Present|ITV companies]]). Since the launch of subsequent British television channels, Channel 4 has become typical in its lack of variations of this nature.

A few exceptions exist to this rule for programming and continuity: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has a dedicated variant broadcast on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Ireland]] which omits programmes for which broadcast rights are not held in Ireland. For example, the series [[Glee (TV series)|Glee]] is not available on Channel 4 on Sky in Ireland.

Some of Channel 4's schools' programming (1980s/early '90s) were regionalised due to differences in curricula between different regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;itvschools&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070706195104/http://www.schoolstv.com/itvschoolson4_history.shtml?1 SchoolsTV.com] History of ITV Schools on Channel 4. Retrieved at the [[Internet Archive]], 16 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of Channel 4's remit covers the commissioning of programmes from outside London. Channel 4 has a dedicated director of nations and regions, [[Stuart Cosgrove]], who is based in a regional office in Glasgow. As his job title suggests, it is his responsibility to foster relations with independent producers based in areas of the United Kingdom (including Wales) outside of London.

Advertising on Channel 4 does contain regular variation: prior to 1993, when ITV was responsible for selling Channel 4's advertising, each regional ITV company would provide the content of advertising breaks, covering the same transmitter area as themselves, and these breaks were often unique to that area. After Channel 4 became responsible for its own advertising, it continued to offer advertisers the ability to target particular audiences and divided its coverage area into six parts coining the term 'LEMNUS' standing for &quot;London, The East [and South] of England, The Midlands, The North of England, [[Ulster]] and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/television/macromap|title=Channel 4's 'Macro Regions' for advertising, including a map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, Wales does not have its own advertising region, instead its viewers receive the southern region on digital platforms intentionally broadcast to the area, or the neighbouring region where analogue transmissions spill over into Wales. Ireland shares its advertising region with Northern Ireland (referred to by Channel 4 as the 'Ulster Macro') with many advertisers selling products for Ireland here.&lt;ref name =&quot;foursales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin|title=Channel 4's Dublin Sales Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E4 (channel)|E4]] also has an advertising variant for Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;foursales&quot;/&gt; The six regions are also carried on satellite, cable and Digital Terrestrial.

[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[GMTV]] use a similar model to Channel 4 for providing their own advertising regions, despite also having a single national output of programming.

===Future possibility of regional news===
With [[ITV plc]] pushing for much looser requirements on the amount of regional news and other programming it is obliged to broadcast in its ITV regions, the idea of Channel 4 taking on a regional news commitment has been considered, with the corporation in talks with [[Ofcom]] and ITV over the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;c4moveregional&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/03/channel4.ofcom | title=Channel 4 ponders move into regional news as ITV retreats | publisher=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot; | author=Leigh Holmwood | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2008-09-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 4 believe that a scaling-back of such operations on ITV's part would be detrimental to Channel 4's national news operation, which shares much of its resources with ITV through their shared news contractor [[ITN]]. At the same time, Channel 4 also believe that such an additional public service commitment would bode well in on-going negotiations with Ofcom in securing additional funding for its other public service commitments.&lt;ref name=&quot;c4moveregional&quot; /&gt;

The '''Carolina Parakeet''' (''Conuropsis carolinensis'')&lt;ref&gt;
''Conuropsis'', from &quot;Conurus&quot;, an obsolete name of the genus ''[[Aratinga]]'' (cf. [[conure]] and see also '''Synonyms''' above), and &quot;-opsis&quot;, &quot;of similar appearance to&quot;. ''carolinensis'', &quot;from Carolina&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
was the only [[parrot]] species native to the [[eastern United States]]. It was found from the [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and lived in old forests along rivers. It was the only species at the time classified in the [[genus]] '''''Conuropsis'''''. It was called '''''puzzi la née''''' (&quot;head of yellow&quot;) or '''''pot pot chee''''' by the [[Seminole]] and '''''kelinky''''' in [[Chickasaw language|Chikasha]] (Snyder &amp; Russell, 2002).
==Extinction==
[[File:Conuropsis carolinensisAWP026AA2.jpg|thumb|left|''C. c. carolinensis'' by [[John James Audubon]]]] 
The last wild specimen was killed in [[Okeechobee County, Florida]], in 1904, and the last captive bird died at the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] on February 21, 1918.  This was the male specimen &quot;Incas,&quot; who died within a year of his mate &quot;Lady Jane.&quot;  Coincidentally, Incas died in the same aviary cage in which the last [[Passenger Pigeon]], &quot;Martha,&quot; had died nearly four years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.birdersworld.com/brd/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=432 |first=Christopher |last=Cokinos |title=The Carolina Parakeet: Glimpses of a Vanished Bird |month=June |year=2005 |journal=Birder's World}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until 1939, however, that it was determined that the Carolina Parakeet had become extinct.

At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets resembling this species were sighted and filmed in the [[Okefenokee Swamp]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. However, the [[American Ornithologists Union]] analyzed the film and concluded that they had probably filmed feral parakeets. Additional reports of the bird were made in Okeechobee County, Florida, until the late 1920s, but these are not supported by specimens. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The species may have appeared as a very rare [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] in places as far north as [[Southern Ontario]]. A few bones, including a [[pygostyle]] found at the [[Calvert Site]] in Southern Ontario, came from the Carolina Parakeet. The possibility remains open that this particular specimen was taken to Southern Ontario for ceremonial purposes (Godfrey 1986).

==Reasons for extinction==
[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis ludovicianus.jpg|thumb|left|''C. c. ludovicianus'' by [[John James Audubon]]]] 
The Carolina Parakeet died out because of a number of different threats. To make space for more agricultural land, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its habitat. The bird's colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats. The birds were also kept as pets and could be bred easily in captivity. However, little was done by owners to increase the population of tamed birds.  Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers considered them a pest, although many farmers valued them for controlling invasive [[cocklebur]]s. It has also been hypothesized that the introduced [[honeybee]] helped contribute to its extinction by taking many of the bird's nesting sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;EllisNTB&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Ellis| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Ellis (biologist) | title = No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species| publisher = Harper Perennial | date = 2004| location = New York| pages = 170| isbn =0-06-055804-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A factor that contributed to their extinction was the unfortunate flocking behavior that led them to return immediately to a location where some of the birds had just been killed.  This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock.

This combination of factors [[Local extinction|extirpated]] the species from most of its range until the early years of the 20th century. However, the last populations were not much hunted for food or feathers, nor did the farmers in rural [[Florida]] consider them a pest, as the benefit of the birds' love of cockleburs clearly outweighed the minor damage they did to the small-scale garden plots. The final extinction of the species is somewhat of a mystery, but the most likely cause seems to be that the birds succumbed to poultry disease, as suggested by the rapid disappearance of the last, small, but apparently healthy and reproducing flocks of these highly social birds. If this is true, the very fact that the Carolina Parakeet was finally tolerated to roam in the vicinity of human settlements proved its undoing (Snyder &amp; Russell, 2002). The fact remains, however, that persecution significantly reduced the bird's population over many decades.

The [[Louisiana]] subspecies of the Carolina Parakeet, ''C. c. ludovicianus'',&lt;ref&gt;
''ludovicianus'', &quot;from Louisiana&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
was slightly different in color to the parent species, being more bluish-green and generally of a somewhat subdued coloration, and went extinct in much the same way, but at a somewhat earlier date (early 1910s). The [[Appalachian Mountains]] separated these birds from the eastern ''C. c. carolinensis''

==In museums==
[[Image:ConuropsisCarolinensis-RedpathMuseumMontreal-June6-08.png|thumb|A stuffed specimen of ''C. c. carolinensis'', on display at the Redpath Museum, Montreal]]
About 720 skins and 16 skeletons are housed in museums around the world (Luther, 1996). Of the 49 supposed egg specimens McKinley (1977) accepted 20 as certainly and 7 as probably correctly assigned to this species. Five eggs collected in Florida on April 30, 1927, were controversially attributed to this species ([[Florida State Museum|FSM]]&lt;!-- check whether the same as Florida Museum of Natural History --&gt; 87234 - 3 eggs - and 89434 - 2 eggs). These are not accepted as valid by McKinley (1977) based on their small size and early date of collection, but molecular analysis could possibly determine whether these are in fact eggs of Carolina Parakeets.

A fossil parrot, ''Conuropsis fratercula'',&lt;ref&gt;
''fratercula'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] for &quot;little brother&quot;. This was a smaller bird, three-quarters the size of the Carolina Parakeet.&lt;/ref&gt;
was described based on a single [[humerus]] from the [[Miocene]] [[Sheep Creek Formation]] (possibly late [[Hemingfordian]], c.16 [[mya (unit)|mya]], possibly later) of [[Snake Creek, Nebraska]] (Wetmore, 1926).
However, it is not altogether certain that this species is correctly assigned to ''Conuropsis'' (Olson, 1985), but some authors{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} consider it a [[paleosubspecies]] of the Carolina Parakeet. This is almost certainly erroneous given the long distance in time, and probably based on a misunderstanding of the original description. Therein, ''C. fratercula'' is called a &quot;new subspecies&quot; but ''fratercula'' is consistently applied as a species-level name throughout the publication, and the fossil is correctly referenced thus in the discussion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The present ''species'' is of peculiar interest as it represents the first known parrotlike bird to be described as a fossil from North America.&quot; (Wetmore 1926; italics added)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Parakeets in the United States==
[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis.jpg|thumb|left|Rare photo of  live specimen taken in 1906]] 
The extinction of the Carolina Parakeet represents the irrevocable loss of eastern North America's only truly indigenous parrot.  However, populations of a South American parrot species, ''Myiopsitta monacha'', the [[Monk Parakeet]], or Quaker Parrot, began to breed in the same region from the 1960s onwards.  Whether introduced accidentally or intentionally, the [[Monk Parakeet]] has as of 2009 established flocks in several states, including [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]] ([[Cincinnati]] area), [[Kentucky]] (Northern/Greater Cincinnati area), [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]]. 

Smaller feral colonies of several other species of parrots and parakeets have since established themselves in various locations of the USA, including downtown [[Pasadena, California]] and [[The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill|San Francisco, California]]. Large flocks are well noted in the [[San Diego]] region, particularly in [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]] and the [[Ocean Beach, San Diego, California|Ocean Beach]] area. The African [[Lovebird]] has established itself in parts of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix, Arizona metro area]]. The [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Thick-billed Parrot]] also used to range into [[Arizona]] before its population declined in the 20th century; attempts to reintroduce them have, until now, not met with any lasting success.

A '''collective trauma''' is a traumatic psychological effect shared by a group of people of any size, up to and including an entire society. Traumatic events witnessed by an entire society can stir up collective sentiment, often resulting in a shift in that society's culture and mass actions.

Well known collective traumas include: The [[John F. Kennedy]] [[assassination]] in the [[United States]], the [[Estonia disaster]] in Sweden, the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States and various others.

Collective traumas have been shown to play a key role in group [[identity formation]] (see: [[Gestalt psychology|Law of Common Fate]]). During [[World War II]], a US submarine, the [[USS Puffer (SS-268)]], came under several hours of [[depth charge]] attack by a Japanese surface vessel until the ship became convinced the submarine had somehow escaped. Psychological studies later showed that crewmen transferred to the submarine after the event were never accepted as part of the [[team]]. Later, US naval policy was changed so that after events of such psychological trauma, the crew would be dispersed to new assignments.

Examples of contemporary collective traumas include:
* [[9/11]]
* [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]
* [[Hurricane Katrina]]

[[File:Kerk-molenstraat.jpg|thumb|right|Dutch Reformed Church in [[Vreeswijk]], [[Netherlands]]]]
A '''church building''' is a [[building]] or [[structure]] whose primary purpose is to facilitate the meeting of a [[Ecclesia (church)|church]].  Originally, [[Jewish Christians]] met in [[synagogue]]s, such as the [[Cenacle]], and in one another's homes, known as [[house churches]].  As Christianity grew and became more accepted by [[government]]s, notably with the [[Edict of Milan]], rooms and, eventually, entire buildings were set aside for the explicit purpose of Christian [[worship]], such as the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

Traditional church buildings are often in the shape of a cross and frequently have a tower or dome. More modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and, similarly, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.

== History ==
[[File:churchofAleppo.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]] in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] is considered to be one of the oldest surviving church buildings in the world.]]
{{see also|Jerusalem in Christianity}}
The [[Early Christianity|first Christians]] were, like [[Jesus]], [[Judaism|Jews]] resident in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel]] who worshiped on occasion in the [[Second Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] and weekly in local [[synagogue]]s. Temple worship was a ritual involving [[sacrifice]], occasionally including the [[Korban|sacrifice of animals]] in atonement for [[sin]], offered to the [[God of Israel]]. 
The [[New Testament]] includes many references to Jesus visiting the Temple, the first time as an infant with his parents, see [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]]. The early history of the synagogue is obscure, but it seems to be an institution developed for public Jewish worship during the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian captivity]] when the Jews (and Jewish [[Proselytes]]) did not have access to a Temple (the [[First Temple]] having been destroyed c. 586 BC) for ritual sacrifice. Instead, they developed a daily and weekly service of [[Torah reading|readings from the Torah]], and possibly also the [[Neviim|Prophets]], followed by [[Midrash|commentary]]. This could be carried out in a house if the attendance was small enough, and in many towns of the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] that was the case. In others, more elaborate architectural settings developed, sometimes by converting a house and sometimes by converting a previously public building. The minimum requirements seem to have been a meeting room with adequate seating, a case for the [[Torah scroll]], and a raised platform for the reader.

Jesus himself participated in this sort of service as a reader and commentator (see [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:16-24}}) and his followers probably remained worshipers in synagogues in some cities, for example the [[Cenacle]] in Jerusalem. However, following the [[Destruction of the Temple|destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD]], the new Christian movement and [[Rabbinic Judaism]] increasingly parted ways, see also [[List of events in early Christianity]]. The Church became overwhelmingly [[Gentile]] sometime in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], the era of [[Constantine I and Christianity]] and the birth of the [[State church of the Roman Empire]].

The [[Syria]]n city of [[Dura-Europos]] on the West bank of the [[Euphrates]] was an outpost town between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Parthia]]n empires. During a siege by Parthian troops in A.D. 257, the buildings in the outermost blocks of the city grid were partially destroyed and filled with rubble to reinforce the [[city wall]]. Thus were preserved and securely dated an early decorated church and a synagogue decorated with extensive wall paintings. Both had been converted from earlier private buildings.

The [[Dura-Europos church]] from 235 AD has a special room dedicated for [[baptisms]] with a large [[baptismal font]].

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:Dormition Cathedral, Moscow.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] is the mother church of Muscovite Russia]]
During the 11th through 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller parish churches occurred across Western Europe.  In addition to being a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was used by the community in other ways.  It could serve as a meeting place for [[guilds]] or a hall for [[banquet]]s. [[Mystery plays]] were sometimes performed in cathedrals, and cathedrals might also be used for [[fair]]s.  The church could be used as a place to thresh and store grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{main|Church architecture}}
A common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]] (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the [[altar]] space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the &quot;west&quot; end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].

==Types==
===Basilica===
{{main|Basilica}}
The [[Latin]] word basilica (derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Stoa Basileios|Basiliké Stoà]]'', Royal ''[[Stoa]]''), was originally used to describe a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] public building (as in [[Greece]], mainly a [[tribunal]]), usually located in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of a Roman town.

After the [[Roman Empire]] became officially [[Christian]], see [[Edict of Thessalonica]], the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rites by the [[Pope]]. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.

===Cathedral===
{{main|Cathedral architecture of Western Europe}}

A cathedral is a church, usually [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a [[bishop]]. The word cathedral takes its name from the word ''[[cathedra]]'', or Bishop's Throne (In [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''ecclesia cathedralis''). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.

The church that has the function of [[cathedral]] is not of necessity a large building. It might be as small as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Oxford, England]], [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh, United States]], or [[Chur]] Cathedral in [[Switzerland]]. But frequently, the cathedral, along with some of the abbey churches, was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]] in any region.

===Alternative buildings===
Old and disused church buildings can be seen as an interesting proposition for developers as the architecture and location often provide for attractive homes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/new_homes/article3047285.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Church conversions | first=Lucy | last=Alexander | date=2007-12-14 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourproperty.co.uk/guides/buying_a_church_conversion.html Buying a church conversion - OurProperty.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or city centre entertainment venues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitcherandpiano.com/locations/bar.cfm?area=Nottingham Pitcher and Piano - quality food and drink&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many newer Churches have decided to host meetings in public buildings such as [[schools]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familychurchchristchurch.org.uk The Family Church Christchurch:Welcome to the Family Church Christchurch Dorset&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[universities]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-hope.org.uk Welcome to The Hope Church, Manchester...

[[File:Child's Tomb from Carrington's Dartmoor.jpg|thumb|Childe's Tomb before its destruction in 1812]]
'''Childe's Tomb''' is a granite cross on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], England. Although not in its original form, it is more elaborate than most of the [[Dartmoor crosses|crosses on Dartmoor]], being raised upon a constructed base, and it is known that a [[kistvaen]] is underneath.

A well-known legend attached to the site concerns a wealthy hunter, Childe, who became lost in a snow storm and supposedly died there despite disembowelling his horse and climbing into its body for protection. The legend relates that Childe left a note of some sort saying that whoever found and buried his body would inherit his lands at [[Plymstock]]. After a race between the monks of [[Tavistock Abbey]] and the men of Plymstock, the Abbey won.

The tomb was virtually destroyed in 1812 by a man who stole most of the stones to build a house nearby, but it was partly reconstructed in 1890.

==Description==
Childe's Tomb is a reconstructed granite cross on the south-east edge of [[Foxtor Mires]], about 500 metres north of [[Fox Tor]] on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], England at {{gbmapping|SX625704}}. According to William Burt, in his notes to ''Dartmoor, a Descriptive Poem'' by N. T. Carrington (1826), the original tomb consisted of a pedestal of three steps, the lowest of which was built of four stones each six feet long and twelve inches square. The two upper steps were made of eight shorter but similarly shaped stones, and on top was an octagonal block about three feet high with a cross fixed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Crossing (1902) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb lies on the line of several cairns that marked the east-west route of the ancient Monks' Path between [[Buckfast Abbey]] and [[Tavistock Abbey]] and it was no doubt erected here as part of that route: it would have been particularly useful in this part of the moor with few landmarks where a traveller straying from the path could easily end up in Foxtor Mires.&lt;ref name=B218/&gt; [[Tristram Risdon]], writing in about 1630, said that Childe's Tomb was one of three remarkable things in the [[Forest of Dartmoor]] (the others being [[Crockern Tor]] and [[Wistman's Wood]]).&lt;ref&gt;Risdon (c.&amp;nbsp;1632) pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; Risdon also stated that the original tomb bore an inscription: &quot;They fyrste that fyndes and bringes mee to my grave, The priorie of Plimstoke they shall have&quot;,&lt;ref name=R198/&gt; but no sign of this has ever been found.

Today the cross, which is a replacement, is about 3&amp;nbsp;feet 4&amp;nbsp;inches (1&amp;nbsp;m) tall and 1&amp;nbsp;foot 8&amp;nbsp;inches (0.5&amp;nbsp;m) across at the crosspiece, and it has its base in a socket stone which rests on a pedestal of granite blocks that raises the total height of the cross to 7&amp;nbsp;ft (2.1&amp;nbsp;m).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The original, now broken, socket stone for the cross lies nearby. The whole is surrounded by a circle of granite stones set on their edge which once surrounded the cairn—the rocks of which are now scattered around—that was originally built over a large [[kistvaen]] that still exists beneath the pedestal.&lt;ref name=B218&gt;{{cite book

==Destruction==
[[File:Ruins of Foxtor Farm - geograph.org.uk - 635099.jpg|thumb|left|All that remains of Fox Tor Farm]]
In the early 19th century there was much interest in enclosing and &quot;improving&quot; the open moorland on Dartmoor, encouraged by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt's early successes at Tor Royal near [[Princetown]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe (1985) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Enclosure was aided by the greatly enhanced access provided by the construction of the first [[Turnpike trusts in the United Kingdom|turnpike roads]] over the moor: the road between [[Ashburton, Devon|Ashburton]] and [[Two Bridges]] opened in around 1800, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1812 Windeatt started to build a farmhouse, Fox Tor Farm, on his land and his workmen robbed the nearby Childe's Tomb of most of its stones for the building and its doorsteps.&lt;ref name=S42&gt;Stanbrook (1994) p. 42–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1902 [[William Crossing]] wrote that he had been told by an old moorman that some of the granite blocks from the tomb's pedestal had also been used to make a [[clapper bridge]] across a stream flowing into the River Swincombe near the farm. The moorman also said that they had lettering on their undersides.&lt;ref&gt;Crossing (1902) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; This encouraged Crossing to arrange to lift the clapper bridge, but no inscription was found. However he did locate nine out of the twelve stones that had made up the pedestal, as well as the broken socket stone for the cross.&lt;ref name=S42/&gt;

==Reconstruction==
Crossing rediscovered the original site of the tomb in 1882 and said that all that remained was a small mound and some half buried stones. He cleared out the kistvaen, reporting that it was 5&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;inches (1.7&amp;nbsp;m) long by 2&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;inches (86&amp;nbsp;cm) wide and that unlike most kistvaens found on the moor, the stones lining it had apparently been shaped by man, which led him to suggest that it was less old than most.&lt;ref&gt;Crossing (1902) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Having located most of the stones of the original tomb, Crossing thought that it could be rebuilt in its original form with little effort, but it was not to be.&lt;ref&gt;Crossing (1902) pp. 93–4&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Brooking Rowe, writing in 1895, states that the tomb was re-erected in 1890 under the direction of Mr. E. Fearnley Tanner, who said that he was dissatisfied with the result because several stones were missing and it was difficult to recreate the original character of the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe (1985) pp. 188–9&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner was the honourable secretary of the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]],&lt;ref name=S44&gt;Stanbrook (1994) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and this reconstruction was one of the first acts of that organisation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The replacement base and cross were made in Holne in 1885.&lt;ref name=S44/&gt;

==Childe the Hunter==
[[File:Childe's tomb 1.jpg|thumb|right|View of the setting of Childe's Tomb]]
According to legend, the cross was erected over the [[kistvaen]] (burial chamber) of [[Childe the Hunter]], who was Ordulf, son of [[Ordgar]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] Earl of [[Devon]] in the 11th century. The name ''[[Childe]]'' is probably derived from the [[Old English]] word ''cild'' which was used as a title of honour.&lt;ref name=F277/&gt;

Legend has it that Childe was in a party hunting on the moor when they were caught in some changeable weather. Childe became separated from the main party and was lost. In order to save himself from dying of exposure, he killed his horse, disembowelled it and crept inside the warm carcass for shelter. He nevertheless froze to death, but before he died, he wrote a note to the effect that whoever should find him and bury him in their church should inherit his Plymstock estate.

His body was found by the monks of [[Tavistock Abbey]], who started to carry it back. However, they heard of a plot to ambush them by the people of Plymstock, at a bridge over the [[River Tavy]]. They took a detour and built a new bridge over the river, just outside of Tavistock. They were successful in burying the body in the grounds of the Abbey and inherited the Plymstock estate.

The first account of this story is to be found in [[Tristram Risdon|Risdon]]'s ''Survey of Devon'' which was completed in around 1632:

{{quote|It is left us by tradition that one Childe of Plimstoke, a man of fair possessions, having no issue, ordained, by his will, that wheresoever he should happen to be buried, to that church his lands should belong. It so fortuned, that he riding to hunt in the forest of Dartmore, being in pursuit of his game, casually lost his company, and his way likewise. The season then being so cold, and he so benumed therewith, as he was enforced to kill his horse, and embowelled him, to creep into his belly to get heat; which not able to preserve him, was there frozen to death; and so found, was carried by Tavistoke men to be buried in the church of that abbey; which was so secretly done but the inhabitants of Plymstoke had knowledge thereof; which to prevent, they resorted to defend the carriage of the corpse over the bridge, where, they conceived, necessity compelled them to pass. But they were deceived by guile; for the Tavistoke men forthwith built a slight bridge, and passed over at another place without resistance, buried the body, and enjoyed the lands; in memory whereof the bridge beareth the name of Guilebridge to this day.&lt;ref name=R198&gt;Risdon (c.&amp;nbsp;1632) pp. 198–9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finberg pointed out, however, that a document of 1651 refers to Tavistock's guildhall as ''Guilehall'', so ''Guilebridge'' is more likely to be ''guild bridge'', probably because it was built or maintained by one of the town guilds.&lt;ref name=F277&gt;Finberg (1946) p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
[[Devon]] folk singer [[Seth Lakeman]] sang about Childe the Hunter on his 2006 album ''[[Freedom Fields]]''.

In [[linguistics]], '''cognates''' are words that have a common [[etymology|etymological]] origin. The word derives from the Latin ''[[:wikt:cognatus|cognatus]]'' (blood relative).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/cognate &quot;cognate&quot;], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed.: &quot;Latin ''cognātus'': ''co-'', co- + ''gnātus'', born, past participle of ''nāscī'', to be born.&quot; Other definitions of the English word include &quot;[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor&quot; and &quot;[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function&quot;. ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Cognates within the same language are [[Doublet (linguistics)|'''doublets''']].

For example, the English words ''shirt'' and ''skirt'' are doublets; the former derives from the [[Old English]] ''sċyrte'', the latter is [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|loaned from Old Norse]] ''skyrta'', both of which derive from the [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*skurtjōn-''. Additional cognates of the same word in other [[Germanic languages]] include the German ''Schürze'' and Dutch ''schort'' (apron).

==Characteristics of cognate words==
Cognates need not have the same meaning, which [[semantic drift|may have changed]] as the languages developed separately. For example, consider [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:starve#English|starve]]'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[wikt:sterven#Dutch|sterven]]'' (&quot;to die&quot;), both from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*sterƀ-'' (&quot;die&quot;). [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:dish#English|dish]]'' and [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:Tisch#German|Tisch]]'' (&quot;table&quot;), with their flat surfaces, both come from [[Latin Language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:discus#Latin|discus]]'', but it would be a mistake to identify their later meanings.&lt;ref&gt;''Discus'' is itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δίσκος'' (from the verb ''δικεῖν'' &quot;to throw&quot;). A later and ''separate'' English reflex of ''discus'', probably through [[mediaeval Latin]] ''desca'', is ''[[wikt:desk#English|desk]]'' (see [[OED]] s.v. ''desk'').&lt;/ref&gt; (Such potentially misleading cognate pairs are known as [[false friends]].)

==Cognates across languages==
Examples of cognates in [[Indo-European languages]] are the words ''night'' ([[English language|English]]), ''nuit'' ([[French language|French]]), ''Nacht'' ([[German language|German]]), ''nacht'' ([[Dutch Language|Dutch]]), ''nicht'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''natt'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''nat'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''nátt'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''nótt'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''noc'' ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]]), ночь, ''noch'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]), ноќ, ''noć'' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), нощ, ''nosht'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), ''ніч'', ''nich'' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), ''ноч'', ''noch''/''noč'' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]), ''noč'' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]]), ''noć'' ([[Serbo-Croatian]]), νύξ, ''nyx'' ([[Ancient Greek]], ''νύχτα''/''nyhta'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''nox'' ([[Latin]]), ''nakt-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''natë'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), ''noche'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''nos'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''nueche'' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]), ''noite'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), ''notte'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''nit'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''noapte'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), ''nakts'' ([[Latvian Language|Latvian]]) and  ''naktis'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), all meaning &quot;night&quot; and derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]]) {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European *nókʷts|*nókʷts]]}}, &quot;night&quot;.   

Another Indo-European example is ''star'' ([[English language|English]]), ''str-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''tara'' ([[Hindi-Urdu]]), ''étoile'' ([[French language|French]]), ''ἀστήρ (astēr)'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] or ''ἀστέρι''/''ἄστρο'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''stella'' (Latin, [[Italian language|Italian]]), ''stea'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), ''stairno'' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]]), ''astl'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]), ''Stern'' (German), ''ster'' (Dutch and [[Afrikaans]]), ''starn'' (Scots), ''stjerne'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and Danish), ''stjarna'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''stjärna'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''stjørna'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''setāre'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]), ''stoorei'' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]), ''seren'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''steren'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''estel'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''estrella'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''estrella'' [[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], ''estrela'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) and ''estêre'' or ''stêrk'' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), from the PIE {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European *h₂stḗr|*h₂stḗr]]}}, &quot;star&quot;. 

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|שלום}} ''shalom'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|سلام}} ''salām'', the [[Maltese language|Maltese]] ''sliem'' and the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''selam'' (&quot;peace&quot;) are also cognates, derived from [[Proto-Semitic]] [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic *šalām-|*šalām-]].

Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word ''[[wikt:milk#English|milk]]'' is clearly a cognate of German ''[[wikt:Milch#German|Milch]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:Молоко#Russian|молоко (moloko)]]'' and Croatian ''[[wikt:Mlijeko#Croatian|mlijeko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also Greek [[wikt:ἀμέλγω#Ancient_Greek|ἀμέλγω]] &quot;to milk&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, French ''[[wikt:lait#French|lait]]'' and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[wikt:leche#Spanish|leche]]'' (both meaning &quot;milk&quot;) are less obviously cognates of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{polytonic|[[wikt:γάλακτος#Ancient_Greek|γάλακτος]]}}'' ''gálaktos'' (genitive singular of {{polytonic|[[wikt:γάλα#Ancient_Greek|γάλα]]}} ''gála'', &quot;milk&quot;) , a relationship more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin ''[[wikt:lac#Latin|lac]]'' &quot;milk&quot;, as well as the English word ''[[wikt:lactic#English|lactic]]'' and other terms borrowed from Latin. At times, cognates may even be opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word {{lang|he|חוצפה}} ''[[chutzpah]]'' means &quot;impudence,&quot; its Arabic cognate {{lang|ar|حصافة}} ''ḥaṣāfah'' means &quot;sound judgment;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|authorlink=Hans Wehr |editor= J. Milton Cowan| title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |origyear=1979 |year=1994 |publisher=Spoken Language Services, Inc. |location=[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]] |isbn=0879500034}}
&lt;/ref&gt; even more contradictorily, the English word ''[[wikt:black|black]]'' and Polish ''[[wikt:biały|biały]]'', meaning [[white]], both derive from the PIE {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European *bhleg-|*bhleg-]]}}, meaning, &quot;to burn or shine.&quot;

A word may also [[loanword|enter another language]], develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; this is called a ''Rückwanderer'' (German for &quot;one who wanders back&quot;). For example, the Greek word ''κίνημα'' (&quot;movement&quot;) became French ''cinéma'' (cf. American English ''movie'') and then later returned to Greece as ''σινεμά'' (&quot;the art of film&quot;, &quot;movie theater&quot;). Now in Greece ''κίνημα'' (&quot;movement&quot;) and ''σινεμά'' (&quot;filmmaking, cinema&quot;) exist together as a doublet (see next section).&lt;ref&gt;In fact, ''σινεμά'' stands beside a Greek [[neologism]] based on the original form of the same root: ''κιμηματογράφος'' (''kinimatoγráfos''), with the same two meanings as ''cinéma''/''σινεμά''. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated ''ταινία''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognates within the same language==
Cognate [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] can exist within the same language, often with slightly different meanings.  For example, English ''ward'' and ''guard'' (&lt;PIE ''*wer-'', &quot;to perceive, watch out for&quot;) are cognates, as are ''shirt'' (garment on top) and ''skirt'' (garment on bottom) (&lt;PIE ''*sker-'', &quot;to cut&quot;).  In some cases, such as &quot;shirt&quot; and &quot;skirt&quot;, one of the cognate pairs has an ultimate source in another language related to English, while the other one is native, as happened with many loanwords from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] borrowed during the [[Danelaw]]. Sometimes, both cognates come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word ''chief'' (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the [[Middle French]] ''chef'' (&quot;head&quot;), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word ''chef'' (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, by which time the consonant had changed to a &quot;sh&quot;-sound in French.  Such word sets can also be called [[etymological twins]], and of course they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words ''wain'' (native) ''wagon'' (Dutch) and ''vehicle'' (Latin) in English.

==False cognates==
{{Main|False cognate}}
[[False cognate]]s are words that are commonly thought to be related (have a common origin) whereas linguistic examination reveals they are unrelated. Thus, for example, on the basis of superficial similarities one might suppose that the Latin verb ''habere'' and German ''haben'', both meaning 'to have', were cognates. However, an understanding of the way words in the two languages evolve from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) roots shows that they cannot be cognate (see for example [[Grimm's law]]).  German ''haben'' (like English ''have'') in fact comes from PIE ''*kap'', 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'.  Latin ''habere'', on the other hand, is from PIE ''*gʰabʰ'', 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''. English ''much'' and Spanish ''mucho'' also look similar and even have a similar meaning yet are not cognates, with ''much'' &lt; Proto-Germanic ''*mikilaz'' &lt; PIE ''*meg-'', while ''mucho'' &lt; Latin ''multum'' &lt; PIE ''*mel-''.&lt;ref&gt;[www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf Ringe, Don. ''A quick introduction to language change'', 22 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mere similarity of words between languages is ''not'' enough to demonstrate that the words are related to each other, in much the same way that facial resemblance does not imply a close genetic relationship between people. Over the course of hundreds and thousands of years, words may change their sound completely. Thus, for example, English ''five'' and [[Sanskrit]] ''pança'' are cognates, while English ''over'' and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''′avar'' are not, and neither are English ''dog'' and [[Mbabaram language|Mbabaram]] ''dog''.

Contrast this with [[false friend]]s, which frequently ''are'' cognate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Gas chromatograph.jpg|thumb|Pictured is a sophisticated gas chromatography system. This instrument records concentrations of [[acrylonitrile]] in the air at various points throughout the chemical laboratory.]]
'''Chromatography ''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] χρῶμα ''chroma'' &quot;color&quot; and γράφειν ''graphein'' &quot;to write&quot;) is the collective term for a set of [[laboratory techniques]] for the [[separation of mixtures]].
It involves passing a mixture dissolved in a &quot;mobile phase&quot; through a ''stationary phase'', which separates the [[analyte]] to be measured from other molecules in the mixture based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's [[partition coefficient]] result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus '''changing''' the separation.

Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for further use (and is thus a form of purification). Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two are not mutually exclusive.

==History==
{{Main|History of chromatography}}
The '''history of chromatography''' begins during the mid-19th century. Chromatography, literally &quot;color writing&quot;, was used—and named— in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant [[pigments]] such as [[chlorophyll]]. New types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many types of [[separation process]].

Chromatography became developed substantially as a result of the work of [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]] during the 1940s and 1950s. They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several types of chromatography method: [[paper chromatography]], [[gas chromatography]], and what would become known as [[high performance liquid chromatography]]. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Simultaneously, advances continually improve the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.

==Chromatography terms==
*The '''analyte''' is the substance to be separated during chromatography.
*'''Analytical chromatography''' is used to determine the existence and possibly also the concentration of analyte(s) in a [[Sample (material)|sample]].
*A '''bonded phase''' is a stationary phase that is covalently bonded to the support particles or to the inside wall of the column tubing.
*A '''chromatogram''' is the visual output of the chromatograph. In the case of an optimal separation, different peaks or patterns on the chromatogram correspond to different components of the separated mixture.
:[[File:Rt 5 9.png|300px|Chromatogram with unresolved peaks]] [[File:Rt 5 12.png|300px|Chromatogram with two resolved peaks]]
:Plotted on the x-axis is the retention time and plotted on the y-axis a signal (for example obtained by a [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometer]], [[Mass Spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] or a variety of other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system. In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.
*A '''chromatograph''' is equipment that enables a sophisticated separation e.g. gas chromatographic or liquid chromatographic separation.
*'''Chromatography''' is a physical method of separation in which the components to be separated are distributed between two phases, one of which is stationary (stationary phase) while the other (the mobile phase) moves in a definite direction.
*The '''eluate''' is the mobile phase leaving the column.
*The '''eluent''' is the solvent that will carry the analyte.
*An '''[[eluotropic series]]''' is a list of solvents ranked according to their eluting power.
*An '''immobilized phase''' is a stationary phase which is immobilized on the support particles, or on the inner wall of the column tubing.
*The '''mobile phase''' is the phase which moves in a definite direction. It may be a liquid (LC and CEC), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or polar solvents in reverse phase chromotagraphy and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.
*'''Preparative chromatography''' is used to purify sufficient quantities of a substance for further use, rather than analysis.
*The '''retention time''' is the characteristic time it takes for a particular analyte to pass through the system (from the column inlet to the detector) under set conditions. See also: [[Kovats retention index|Kovats' retention index]]
*The '''sample''' is the matter analyzed in chromatography. It may consist of a single component or it may be a mixture of components. When the sample is treated in the course of an analysis, the phase or the phases containing the analytes of interest is/are referred to as the sample whereas everything out of interest separated from the sample before or in the course of the analysis is referred to as waste.
*The '''solute''' refers to the sample components in partition chromatography.
*The '''solvent''' refers to any substance capable of solubilizing other substance, and especially the liquid mobile phase in LC.
*The '''stationary phase''' is the substance which is fixed in place for the chromatography procedure. Examples include the [[silica]] layer in [[Chromatography#Thin layer chromatography|thin layer chromatography]]
Chromatography is based on the concept of partition coefficient. Any solute will partition between two immissible solvents. When we make one solvent immobile (by adsorption on a solid support matrix) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography. If matrix support is polar (e.g. paper, sillica etc.) it is forward phase chromatography, and if it is non polar (C-18) it is reverse phase.

==Techniques by chromatographic bed shape==
===Column chromatography===
{{details|Column chromatography}}
Column chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1993/pdf/6504x0819.pdf IUPAC Nomenclature for Chromatography] IUPAC Recommendations 1993, Pure &amp; Appl. Chem., Vol. 65, No. 4, pp.819–872, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, W. C. Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called '''flash column chromatography''' (flash).&lt;ref&gt;Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. ''[[J. Org. Chem.]]'' '''1978''', ''43(14)'', 2923–2925. {{DOI|10.1021/jo00408a041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{Cite book

|publisher= WileyBlackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.

In [[expanded bed adsorption]], a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.

===Planar chromatography===
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|right|thumb|75px|Thin layer chromatography is used to separate components of [[chlorophyll]]]]
'''Planar chromatography''' is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed ([[paper chromatography]]) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate ([[thin layer chromatography]]). Different [[chemical compound|compounds]] in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase. The specific [[Retention factor]] (R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.

====Paper chromatography====
{{details|Paper chromatography}}
Paper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of ''[[chromatography paper]]''. The paper is placed in a jar containing a shallow layer of [[solvent]] and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.

====Thin layer chromatography====
{{details|Thin layer chromatography}}
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely employed laboratory technique and is similar to [[paper chromatography]]. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of [[adsorbent]] like [[silica gel]], [[aluminium oxide|alumina]], or [[cellulose]] on a flat, inert [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and to allow for quantification, [[HPTLC|high-performance TLC]] can be used.

==Displacement chromatography==
The basic principle of [[displacement chromatography]] is:
A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html Displacement Chromatography 101]. Sachem, Inc. Austin, TX 78737&lt;/ref&gt;
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.

==Techniques by physical state of mobile phase==
===Gas chromatography===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Biodiesel]] --&gt;
{{details|Gas chromatography}}
Gas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as Gas-Liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile  phase is a gas. Gas chromatography is always carried out in a column, which is typically &quot;packed&quot; or &quot;capillary&quot; (see below) .

Gas chromatography (GC) is based on a [[partition equilibrium]] of analyte between a solid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often Helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter glass tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in [[analytical chemistry]]; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat will denature them), frequently encountered in [[biochemistry]], it is well suited for use in the [[petrochemical]], [[environmental monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], and [[Chemical industry|industrial chemical]] fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.

===Liquid chromatography===
[[File:Preperative HPLC.svg|thumb|400px|Preparative HPLC apparatus]]
Liquid chromatography (LC) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. Liquid chromatography can be carried out either in a column or a plane. Present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC).

In the HPLC technique, the sample is forced through a column that is packed with a stationary phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a [[Monolithic HPLC column|porous monolithic layer]], or a porous membrane by a liquid (mobile phase) at high pressure. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Methods in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g. toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the stationary phase) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g. water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 = octadecylsilyl as the stationary phase) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Ironically the &quot;normal phase&quot; has fewer applications and RPLC is therefore used considerably more.

Specific techniques which come under this broad heading are listed below. It should also be noted that the following techniques can also be considered [[fast protein liquid chromatography]] if no pressure is used to drive the mobile phase through the stationary phase. See also [[Aqueous Normal Phase Chromatography]].

==Affinity chromatography==
{{details|Affinity chromatography}}
Affinity chromatography&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Bailon, George K. Ehrlich, Wen-Jian Fung and Wolfgang Berthold, An Overview of Affinity Chromatography, Humana Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-89603-694-9, ISBN 978-1-60327-261-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very robust. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of [[protein]]s bound to tags. These [[fusion protein]]s are labeled with compounds such as [[His-tag]]s, [[biotin]] or [[antigen]]s, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.

Affinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal (Zn, Cu, Fe, etc.).  Columns are often manually prepared. Traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules.

However, HPLC techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatogaphy properties.  Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) is useful to separate aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal (I.e. Dionex IMAC).  Often these columns can be loaded with different metals to create a column with a targeted affinity.

===Supercritical fluid chromatography===
{{details|Supercritical fluid chromatography}}
Supercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure.

==Techniques by separation mechanism==
===Ion exchange chromatography===
{{details|Ion exchange chromatography}}
Ion exchange chromatography (usually referred to as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including [[anion]]s, [[cation]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an [[ion exchange resin]] that carries charged [[functional group]]s which interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to be retained. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using [[fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]].

===Size-exclusion chromatography===
{{details|Size-exclusion chromatography}}
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also known as '''gel permeation chromatography''' (GPC) or '''gel filtration chromatography''' and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume).
Smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore, molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, &quot;polishing&quot; step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins, especially since it can be carried out under native [[solution]] conditions.

==Special techniques==
===Reversed-phase chromatography===
{{details|Reversed-phase chromatography}}
Reversed-phase chromatography is an elution procedure used in liquid chromatography in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase.

===Two-dimensional chromatography===
In some cases, the chemistry within a given column can be insufficient to separate some analytes. It is possible to direct a series of unresolved peaks onto a second column with different physico-chemical ([[Chemical classification]]) properties. Since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation, it can be possible to separate compounds that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography.
The sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate,developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90° and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system.

===Pyrolysis gas chromatography===
Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry.

Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample is put into direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600 – 1000° C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because a wide range of different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the GC/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information.
To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.

Besides the usage of dedicated pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30°C/sec) and high maximum temperatures of 600 - 650° C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.

===Fast protein liquid chromatography===
{{details|Fast protein liquid chromatography}}
Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) is a term applied to several chromatography techniques which are used to purify proteins. Many of these techniques are identical to those carried out under high performance liquid chromatography, however use of FPLC techniques are typically for preparing large scale batches of a purified product.

===Countercurrent chromatography===
{{details|Countercurrent chromatography}}
Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography, where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids. It involves mixing a solution of liquids, allowing them to settle into layers and then separating the layers.

===Chiral chromatography===
Chiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. [[Chiral column chromatography|Chiral chromatography HPLC columns]] (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clement Martyn Doke''' (May 16, 1893 in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]] – February 24, 1980 in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[South Africa]]) was a South African [[linguist]] working mainly on African languages. Realizing that the grammatical structures of [[Bantu languages]] are quite different from those of European languages, he was one of the first African linguists of his time to abandon the Euro-centric approach to language description for a more locally grounded one. A most prolific writer, he published a string of [[grammars]], several dictionaries, [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] work, and a history of Bantu linguistics.

==Missionary in Lambaland==
The Doke family had been engaged in missionary activity for the [[Baptist Church]] for some generations. His father Reverend [[Joseph J. Doke]] left England and travelled to South Africa in 1882, where he met and married Agnes Biggs. They returned to England, where Clement was born as the third of four children. The family moved to New Zealand and eventually returned to South Africa in 1903, where they later on settled in [[Johannesburg]].

At the age of 18, Clement received a bachelor's degree from [[Transvaal University College]] in [[Pretoria]]. He decided to devote his life to missionary activity. In 1913, he accompanied his father on a tour of north-western [[Rhodesia]], to an area called Lambaland, now known as [[Ilamba]]. It is situated at the watershed of the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Zambesi]] rivers, part of the district lay in Northern Rhodesia and part in the Belgian Congo State. The [[Cape-Cairo Railway]] threaded through its eastern portion; otherwise, travelling mostly had to be done on foot.

The Reverend William Arthur Phillips of the Nyasa Industrial Mission in [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]] had established a Baptist mission there in 1905, serving an area of {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}} and 50,000 souls. The Dokes were supposed to investigate, whether the mission in Lambaland could be taken over by the Baptist Union of South Africa. It was on this trip that Doke's father contracted enteric fever and died soon afterwards ([[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] attended the memorial service and addressed the congregation). Clement assumed his father's role.

The South African Baptists decided to take over Kafulafuta Mission, while its founder Reverend Phillips remained as superintendent. Clement Doke returned to Kafulafuta as missionary in 1914, followed by his sister Olive two years later.

==The Lamba language==
At first, Clement Doke was frustrated by his inability to communicate with the [[Lamba]]. The only written material available at the time was a translation of Jonah and a collection of 47 hymns. Soon he mastered the language and published his first book ''Ifintu Fyakwe Lesa'' (The Things of God, a Primer of Scripture Knowledge) in 1917. He enrolled in Johannesburg as the extension of Transvaal University College for an MA degree. His thesis was published as ''The Grammar of the [[Lamba language]]''. The book is couched in traditional grammatical terms as Doke had not yet established his innovative method of analysis and description for the Bantu languages. His later ''Textbook of Lamba Grammar'' is far superior in this respect. 

Clement Doke was also interested in [[ethnology]]. In 1931 he compiled ''The Lambas of Northern Rhodesia'', which remains one of the outstanding ethnographic descriptions of the peoples of Central Africa. For Doke, literacy was part of the evangelisation since people had to able to read to appreciate the message of the Bible, but it was only after his retirement that he completed the translation of the Bible into Lamba. It was published under the title of ''Amasiwi AwaLesa'' (The Words of God) in 1959.

==University of the Witwatersrand==
In 1919 Doke married Hilda Lehmann, who accompanied him back to Lambaland. They both contracted malaria during their work and she was forbidden to return to Lambaland. Clement Doke also realised that his field work couldn't continue much longer and left in 1921. He was recruited by the newly-founded [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. In order to secure a qualification as a lecturer, the family moved to England, where he registered at the School of Oriental and African Studies. His major languages were [[Lamba language|Lamba]] and [[Tshiluba language|Luba]], but as no suitable examiner was available, he eventually had to change his language to [[isiZulu|Zulu]].

Doke took up his appointment in the new Department of Bantu Studies at the University of Witwatersrand in 1923. In 1925 he received his D. Litt. for his doctoral thesis ''The Phonetics of the Zulu Language'' and was promoted to Senior Lecturer. In 1931 he was appointed to the Chair of Bantu Studies and thus headed the Department of Bantu Studies. The Department acted as a catalyst for the admission of Africans to the University: as early as 1925 a limited number were admitted to the vacation course in African Studies. Doke supported the appointment of [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] as member of the staff, as he believed a native speaker was essential for acquiring a language. This provoked a storm of criticism and controversy from the public. They both collaborated on the ''Zulu-English Dictionary'', first published in 1948. It is still one of the best examples of lexicography for any of the Bantu languages. 

At the request of the government of Southern Rhodesia, Doke investigated the range of dialect diversity among the languages of the country and made recommendations for ''Unified [[Shona language|Shona]]''. This formed the basis for Standard Shona. He devised a unified [[orthography]] based on the [[Zezuru]], [[Karanga]] and [[Manyika]] dialects. However, Doke's orthography was never fully accepted and the South African government introduced an alternative, leaving Shona with two competing orthographies between 1935 and 1955.

During his tenure Doke developed and promoted a method of [[Descriptive linguistics|linguistic analysis and description]] of the Bantu languages that was based upon the structure of these languages. The &quot;Dokean model&quot; continues to be one of the dominant models of linguistic description in Southern and Central Africa. His classification of the Bantu languages was for many years the dominant view of the interrelations among the African languages. He was also an early describer of Khoisan and Bantu click consonants, devising phonetic symbols for a number of them. 

Doke served the University of the Witwatersrand until his retirement in 1953. He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of letters by [[Rhodes University]] and the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of the Witwatersrand in 1972.

The former missionary always remained devoted to the Baptist Church. He was elected President of the South African Baptist Union in 1949 and spent a year visiting churches and mission stations. He used his presidential address in condemning the recently established apartheid policy: ''I solemnly warn the Government that the spirit behind their [[apartheid]] legislation, and the way in which they are introducing discriminatory measures of all types today, will bring disaster upon this fair land of ours.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Carl Meinhof.jpg|thumb|Carl Meinhof.]]  
'''Carl Friedrich Michael Meinhof''' (July 23, 1857 &amp;ndash; February 11, 1944) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] and one of the first linguists to study [[African languages]].

==Early years and career==
Meinhof was born in [[Barzowice|Barzwitz]] near [[Darłowo|Rügenwalde]] in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]]. He studied at the [[University of Tübingen]] and at the [[University of Greifswald]]. In 1905 he became professor at the [[School of Oriental Studies]] in [[Berlin]].

==Works==
His most notable work was developing comparative [[grammar]] studies of the [[Bantu languages]], building on the pioneering work of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek|Wilhelm Bleek]]. In his work, Meinhof looked at the common [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] to determine similarities and differences. 

In his work, Meinhof looked at [[noun class]]es with all Bantu languages having at least 10 classes and with 22 classes of nouns existing throughout the Bantu languages, though his definition of noun class differs slightly from the accepted one. While no language has all 22 (later: 23) classes active, [[Venda language|Venda]] has 20, [[Lozi language|Lozi]] has 18, and [[Ganda language#Noun classes|Ganda]] has 16 or 17 (depending on whether the locative class 23 ''e-'' is included). All Bantu languages have a noun class specifically for humans (sometimes including other animate beings).

Meinhof also examined other African languages, including the [[Kordofanian languages]], [[Khoisan languages|Bushman]], [[Khoikhoi]] and [[Hamitic]] languages. 

Meinhof developed a comprehensive classification scheme for African languages. His classification was the standard one for many years (Greenberg 1955:3). It was superseded by those of [[Joseph Greenberg]] in 1955 and especially in 1963. 

In 1902, Meinhof made recordings of East African music. These are among the first recordings made of traditional [[African music]].

==Controversial Views==
In 1912, Carl Meinhof published ''Die Sprachen Der Hamiten'' (The Languages of the Hamites.) He used the term [[Hamitic]]. Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that &quot;speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a &quot;fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].&quot; Meinhof did this in spite of earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston demonstrating that the languages which he would later dub &quot;Nilo-Hamitic&quot; were in fact Nilotic languages with numerous similarities in vocabulary with other Nilotic languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen&quot;&gt;Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Carl Meinhof was the brother of [[Ulrike Meinhof]]'s grandfather and thus the great-uncle of the woman who would be a founding member of the German [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF).

'''Cucurbitaceae''' is a [[plant]] [[family (biology)|family]], also known as '''gourd family''', which includes crops like [[cucumber]]s, [[squash (vegetable)|squashes]] (including [[pumpkins]]), [[luffa]]s, and [[melon]]s (including [[watermelons]]). The family is predominantly distributed around the tropics, where those with edible fruits were amongst the earliest cultivated plants in both the Old and New Worlds.

Most of the plants in this family are [[Annual plant|annual]] [[vine]]s but there are also woody [[liana]]s, thorny shrubs, and trees (''[[Dendrosicyos]]''). Many species have large, yellow or white flowers. The stems are hairy and pentangular. [[Tendril]]s are present at 90° to the leaf petioles at nodes. Leaves are [[exstipulate]] alternate simple [[Leaf shape|palmately]] lobed or palmately compound. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers on different plants (dioecious) or on the same plant (monoecious). The female flowers have [[Ovary (plants)#Inferior ovary|inferior ovaries]]. The fruit is often a kind of modified [[berry]] called a [[pepo]].

==Classification==
There are about 125 extant genera in Cucurbitaceae, including 960 species. The following is the classification as given by Charles Jeffrey as of 1990.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Microwriter.png|250px|thumb|right|A [[Microwriter]] MW4 (circa 1980)]]

A '''[[keyset]]''' or '''chorded keyboard''' (also called a chorded keyset, ''chord keyboard'' or ''chording keyboard'') is a [[list of input devices|computer input device]] that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a &quot;[[chord (music)|chord]]&quot; on a [[piano]]. The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer or a [[bicycle handlebar]]) that is too small to contain a normal-sized keyboard.

A chorded keyboard minus the board, typically designed to be used while held in the hand, is called a [[keyer]]. [[Douglas Engelbart]] introduced the chorded keyset as a computer interface in 1968 at what is often called &quot;[[The Mother of All Demos]]&quot;.

== Principles of operation ==
Each key is mapped to a number and then can be mapped to a corresponding letter or command. By pressing two or more keys together the user can generate many combinations. In Engelbart's original mapping, he used five keys: 1,2,4,8,16. The keys were mapped as follows: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, and so on. If the user pressed keys 1 + 2 = 3 simultaneously the letter &quot;c&quot; appeared. Since Engelbart introduced the keyset, several different designs have been developed based on similar concepts.

As a crude example, each finger might control one key which corresponds to one [[bit]] in a [[byte]], so that using seven keys and seven fingers, one could enter any [[Character (computing)|character]] in the [[ASCII]] set—if the user could remember the binary codes.  
Due to the small number of keys required, chording is easily adapted from a desktop to mobile environment. 

[[Douglas Engelbart]] recently filed two new patents for mobile chorded keyset devices and TipTap.mobi&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tiptap.mobi&lt;/ref&gt; has released a chorded app for the iPhone with Douglas Engelbart.

Practical devices generally use simpler chords for common characters (''e.g.,'' [[Baudot code|Baudot]]), or may have ways to make it easier to remember the chords (''e.g.,'' [[Microwriter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/cykeybellaire/cykey-codecard Bellaire Electronics, Cykey, Microwriter, Agenda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), but the same principles apply.
[[Image:Septambic key numbering.jpg|thumb|200px|left|an ergonomic chorded key'''board''' without the board is a [[keyer]].]]
These portable devices first became popular with the [[wearable computer]] movement in the 1980s.

[[Thad Starner]] from Georgia Institute of Technology and others published numerous studies&lt;ref&gt;http://edgarmatias.com/papers/ic93/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISWC.2004.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISWC.2005.49&lt;/ref&gt; show that two handed chorded text entry was faster and yielded fewer errors than on a QWERTY keyboard.  

Currently [[stenotype machine]]s hold the record for fastest word entry. Many stenotype users can reach 300 words per minute. However, stenographers typically train for three years before reaching professional levels of speed and accuracy.
[[Image:Chording Keyboard.png|464px|thumb|right|A 104-key USB keyboard adapted into a chording keyboard. All phonetic keystrokes may be accomplished by one and two-key chords of the home keys (top row)]]

== History ==
The earliest known chord keyboard was part of the &quot;five-needle&quot; [[telegraph]] operator station, designed by [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]] and [[William Fothergill Cooke|Cooke]] in 1836, in which any two of the five needles could point left or right to indicate letters on a grid. It was designed to be used by untrained operators (who would determine which keys to press by looking at the grid), and was not used where trained telegraph operators were available.

The first widespread use of a chord keyboard was in the [[stenotype]] machine used by court reporters, which was invented in 1868 and is still in use. But the output of the stenotype is a phonetic code that has to be transcribed later (usually by the same operator who produced the original output), rather than arbitrary text.

In 1874, the five-bit [[Baudot code|Baudot]] telegraph code and a matching 5-key chord keyboard was designed to be used with the operator forming the codes manually.  The code is optimized for speed and low wear: chords were chosen so that the most common characters used the simplest chords.  But telegraph operators were already using typewriters with QWERTY keyboards to &quot;copy&quot; received messages, and at the time it made more sense to build a typewriter that could generate the codes automatically, rather than making them learn to use a new input device.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
[[Image:Braille Writer.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[braille]] keyboard]]

[[Braille]] (a writing system for the blind) uses either 6 or 8 tactile 'points' from which all letters and numbers are formed. When [[Louis Braille]] invented it, it was produced with a needle holing successively all needed points in a cardboard sheet. In 1892, Frank Hall created the [[Hall braille writer]] which was like a typewriter with 6 keys, one for each dot in a braille cell. The [[Perkins Brailler]], first manufactured in 1951, uses a 6-key chord keyboard (plus a spacebar) to produce braille output, and has been very successful as a mass market affordable product.  Braille, like Baudot, uses a number symbol and a shift symbol, which may be repeated for shift lock, to fit numbers and upper case into the 31 codes that 6 bits offer.

After World War II, with the arrival of electronics for reading chords and looking in tables of &quot;codes&quot;, the postal [[sorting office]]s started to research chordic solutions to be able to employ people other than trained and expensive typists. In 1954, an important concept was discovered: chordic production is easier to master when the production is done at the release of the keys instead of when they are pressed.

Researchers at [[IBM]] investigated chord keyboards for both typewriters and computer data entry as early as 1959, with the idea that it might be faster than touch-typing if some chords were used to enter whole words or parts of words. One of their designs had 14 keys that were dimpled on the edges as well as the top, so one finger could press two adjacent keys for additional combinations.  Their results were inconclusive, but research continued until at least 1978.

[[Douglas Engelbart]], in a famous 1968 [[The Mother of All Demos|demonstration]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html Doug Engelbart 1968 Demo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  introduced a computer human interface that included the QWERTY keyboard, a three button mouse [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]], and a five chord keyset.  Engelbart uses the keyset with his left hand and the mouse with his right.  He uses the keyset to type both text and specific commands. To type a command Engelbart presses one of the three buttons of the mouse.

Users in Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center at SRI became proficient with the mouse and keyset. In the 1970s the funding Engelbart's group received from the Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) was cut  and many key members of Engelbart's team went to work for [[Xerox PARC]] where they continued to experiment with the mouse and keyset.  Keychord sets were used at Xerox PARC in the early 1980s, along with mice, GUIs, on the Xerox Star and Alto workstations. A one button version of the mouse was incorporated into the Apple Macintosh but Steve Jobs decided against incorporating the chorded keyset.

In the early 1980s, [[Philips]] Research labs at [[Redhill, Surrey]] did a brief study{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} into small, cheap keyboards for entering text on a telephone.  One solution made use of a grid of hexagonal keys with symbols inscribed into dimples in the keys that were either in the center of a key, across the boundary of two keys, or at the joining of three keys.  Pressing down on one of the dimples would cause either one, two or three of the hexagonal buttons to be depressed at the same time, forming a chord that would be unique to that symbol.  With this arrangement, a nine button keyboard with three rows of three hexagonal buttons could be fitted onto a telephone and could produce up to 33 different symbols.  By choosing widely separated keys, one could employ one dimple as a 'shift' key to allow both letters and numbers to be produced. With eleven keys in a 3/4/4 arrangement, 43 symbols could be arranged allowing for lowercase text, numbers and a modest number of punctuation symbols to be represented along with a 'shift' function for accessing uppercase letters.  Whilst this had the advantage of being usable by untrained users via 'hunt and peck' typing and requiring one less key switch than a conventional 12 button keypad, it had the disadvantage that some symbols required three times as much force to depress them as others which made it hard to achieve any speed with the device. That solution is still alive and proposed by Fastap and Unitap among others, and a commercial phone has been produced and promoted in Canada during 2006.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

== Standards ==
Historically, the [[Baudot code|baudot]] and [[braille]] keyboards were standardized to some extent, but they are unable to replicate the full character set of a modern keyboard.  Braille comes closest, as it has been extended to eight bits.

The only proposed modern standard, GKOS (or Global Keyboard Open Standard)&lt;ref&gt;[http://koti.mbnet.fi/gkos/gkoscom/demo/ GKOS Demo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; can support most characters and functions found on a computer keyboard but has had little commercial development. There is, however, a GKOS keyboard application available for iPhone since May 8, 2010, and for Android since October 3, 2010.

== Open source designs ==
Three open source keyer/keyset designs are available: The pickey&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuddlepuddle.org/~adam/pickey/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a ps/2 device based on the [[PIC microcontroller]], the spiffchorder&lt;ref&gt;[http://chorder.cs.vassar.edu/spiffchorder/forside Spiffchorder Project]&lt;/ref&gt; a usb device based on the [[Atmel AVR]] family of microcontrollers, and the GKOS keypad driver for Linux&lt;ref&gt;[http://github.com/pib/gkos GKOS at Github]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Gkos library for the Atmel/Arduino&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/GkosMain Gkos library for Atmel/Arduino]&lt;/ref&gt; open source board. 

'''joy2chord'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://joy2chord.sourceforge.net/ joy2chord's Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Chorded Keyboard driver for Linux computers. With a configuration file, any joystick or gamepad can be turned into a chorded keyboard. This design philosophy was decided on to lower the cost of building devices, and in turn lower the entry barrier to becoming familiar with chorded keyboards. Macro keys, and multiple modes are also easily implemented with a user space driver.

== Commercial devices ==

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:FrogPad.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[FrogPad]] + [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] = [[Wearable Computing]]]] --&gt;
A minimal chordic keyboard is the half qwerty where, to produce the letters of the missing half you just press simultaneously the space bar. It has been academically proven by Mathias and alii that people who can touch type can quickly recover 50 to 70% of their two hands operation. The loss is a solid contribution to the speed discussion above. It is implemented on two popular mobile phones, each provided with software disambiguation, which allows users to avoid using the space-bar.

[[Keyer|&quot;Multiambic&quot; keyers]] for use with wearable computers were invented in Canada in the 1970s.  Multiambic keyers are like chording keyboards but without the board, i.e. the keys are grouped in a cluster for being handheld rather than for sitting on a flat surface.

Chording keyboards are also used as portable but two handed input devices for the [[visually impaired]] (either combined with a [[refreshable braille display]] or vocal synthesis). Such keyboards use a minimum of seven keys, where each key corresponds to an individual [[braille]] point, except one key which is used as a spacebar.  In some applications, the spacebar is used to produce additional chords which enable the user to issue editing commands, such as moving the [[cursor (computers)|cursor]], deleting words, etc.  Note that the number of points used in braille computing is not 6, but 8, as this allows the user, among other things, to  distinguish between small and capital letters, as well as identify the position of the cursor.  As a result, most newer chorded keyboards for braille input include at least nine keys.

===Historical===
The '''WriteHander''' &lt;ref&gt;http://widebill.com/InputSources.html#anchor669460&lt;/ref&gt; a 12-key chord keyboard from NewO Company, appeared in 1978 issues of ROM Magazine, an early microcomputer applications magazine.

Another early commercial models was the six-button '''[[Microwriter]]''', designed by [[Cy Endfield]] and Chris Rainey, and first sold in 1980. Microwriting is the system of chord keying and is based on a set of mnemonics. It was designed only for right-handed use.

The '''[[BAT keyboard|BAT]]''' is a 7-key hand-sized device from Infogrip, and has been sold since 1985. It provides one key for each finger and three for the thumb. It is proposed for the hand which does not hold the mouse, in an exact continuation of Engelbart's vision.

===Modern===
Modern examples of chorded keyboards include '''TipTapSpeech''' &lt;ref&gt;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiptapspeech/id351162406?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt; (uses Engelbart's original mapping &lt;ref&gt;TipTap.mobi http://www.tiptap.mobi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engelbart using his 1969 keyset with TipTap.mobi's prototype for interfacing it with an iPad http://valerielandau.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/engelbart-typing-on-the-ipad-with-the-chorded-keyset/&lt;/ref&gt;), the '''GKOS''' keyboard, the '''FrogPad''', the '''In10did''' method, the '''EkaPad''', '''TextFaster'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textfaster.com/ TextFaster iPhone]&lt;/ref&gt; and '''HotTyper'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.google.com/site/hottyper1/&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are intended for tiny [[tablet PC]]s and wireless mobile terminals, many of them are additionally available as apps on Apples iOS devices.

[[Chris Rainey]], the co-inventor of [[Microwriter]], re-introduced Microwriting for PC and Palm PDAs with a standalone miniature chording keyboard called '''[[CyKey]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/cykeybellaire/  CyKey]&lt;/ref&gt; which caters to both left and right-handed users, being 9-keys. [[CyKey]]  (pronounced sai-ki or &quot;psyche&quot;) is named after the [[Microwriter]] chord system's co-inventor [[Cy Endfield]], who died in 1995 but the name also reflects its intuitive nature. 

The '''GKOS'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://gkos.com GKOS keyboard]&lt;/ref&gt; is a 6-key keyboard with a different signs and commands allocation of the 63 different chords in order to provide all PC keyboard functions and to make entering letters and numbers lighter by having to press fewer keys simultaneously. The 6 physical keys are intended to be [http://koti.mbnet.fi/gkos/gkoscom/gkos_principle.html on the back of the device] and to be operated with the 6 free fingers of two hands holding the device. Another option is to have virtual GKOS keys positioned towards the sides of a touch sensitive screen. This so called GKOS Thumbs has additional keys to enable all combos by only one keypress per hand. GKOS iPhone and Android applications are available according to this principle.

The '''EkaPad'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekatetra.com/products/ekapad.html EkaPad]&lt;/ref&gt; is a 12-key chorded keyboard operated with the four fingers of one hand. It is supported on the thumb. With the 9 main keys, (operated by the index, middle, and ring fingers), 2 prefix keys and one delete key, the EkaPad can produce all the inputs of a standard qwerty keyboard with one, two, and a few three finger chords. For some characters one or two prefix chords are required. 9 main keys (3x3 matrix) can produce a total of 511 chords. With each of the three fingers limited to its own row, 229 chords are possible with 3 fingers. EkaPad uses 66 of these accessible chords. One and two finger chords produce about 85% of American English; with an additional prefix chord about 97%. In addition, the EkaPad can store 100 text strings and 100 keyboard shortcuts. Like many other chorded keyboards, this keyboard can be used with one hand.

The '''[[FrogPad]]''' is a 20-key chorded keyboard about the size of a numeric keypad that can be used with one hand, and is optimized by character frequency. 85% of average keystrokes in English text can by typed without chording, and chords are limited to 2 fingers.

The '''In10did method'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in10did.com In10did method]&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced &quot;intended&quot;) is a ten-key limited chord system that places one key under each finger in order to utilize all of them, however only two are needed for any operations (excluding the &quot;F&quot; keys, which require three key presses). Each key is essentially a shift key so that with ten keys, there are ten single strokes and ninety two-finger keystrokes. The alphabet is produced with a single press or by shifting with a thumb. Changing modes, such as number lock, can make other input provided with a single keystroke. This avoids complex chords while providing enough keystrokes for efficient typing and allows for some unique implementations such as typing with gloves. One other interesting application is on a video game controller and called the X-SKIN which is expected to be commercially available by 2010 and could help make popular MMORPGs possible on console systems. The system can also be applied in a single hand configuration or as one key at a time if needed. Claimed advantages of the IN10DID method are the diversity of devices, limited motion and simple chords.  

The '''Twiddler'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handykey.com/ Twiddler]&lt;/ref&gt; is a 16-key keyboard (plus mouse) keyboard designed to be held and operated in one hand. It was originally introduced in the early 1990s and is currently being produced by TekGear. It was popular among [[wearable computer]] researchers and hobbyists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Carolyn Ann Mayer-Beug''' (December 11,1953&amp;ndash;September 11, 2001) was a [[film]]maker and video producer from [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]].

She was killed at the age of 48 in the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 11]] in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  She won an award for the [[Van Halen]] [[music video]] to their song &quot;[[Right Now (Van Halen song)|Right Now]]&quot;, which she produced. At the time of her death, Carolyn Beug was working on a children's book about [[Noah's Ark]] which was to be told from Noah's wife's point of view.  On the plane with her was her mother, Mary Alice Wahlstrom. Beug was survived by her twin eighteen-year-old daughters Lauren and Lindsey Mayer-Beug, her 13-year-old son, Nick, and her husband, John Beug, a senior vice president in charge of filmed production for Warner Brothers' record division. She was returning home from taking her daughters to college at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

In addition to her work as video producer, Beug also directed three music videos for country singer [[Dwight Yoakam]] -  &quot;Ain't That Lonely Yet&quot; (which, ironically, was filmed in [[Los Angeles, California]] the day of the 1993 [[World Trade Center]] bombings), &quot;A Thousand Miles from Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Fast as You.&quot; Beug co-directed the former two videos with Yoakam and was the sole director of the latter video.

She lived in a [[Tudor-style]] home in the North 25th Street neighborhood. She hosted an annual backyard barbecue for the [[Santa Monica High School]] cross country and track team, which her daughters captained. Carolyn was a [[Latter-day Saint]].

'''Cell biology''' (formerly '''cytology''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kytos'', &quot;container&quot;) is a [[list of academic disciplines|scientific discipline]] that studies [[cell (biology)|cells]] – their [[physiology|physiological]] properties, their structure, the [[organelles]] they contain, interactions with their environment, their [[cell cycle|life cycle]], [[cell division|division]] and [[apoptosis|death]]. This is done both on a [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] level. [[Cell (biology)|Cell]] biology research encompasses both the great diversity of single-celled organisms like [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]], as well as the many specialized cells in multicellular [[organisms]] such as [[human]]s.

Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all [[biology|biological sciences]]. Appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell and [[molecular biology]] as well as to biomedical fields such as [[cancer research]] and [[developmental biology]]. These fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme, sometimes allowing the [[principles]] learned from studying one cell type to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Therefore, research in cell biology is closely related to [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[immunology]], and [[developmental biology]].

==Processes==
===Movement of proteins===
[[Image:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|left| Endothelial cells under the microscope. Nuclei are stained blue with DAPI, microtubles are marked green by an antibody and actin filaments are labelled red with phalloidin.]]

Each type of [[protein]] is usually sent to a particular part of the cell. An important part of cell biology is the investigation of molecular mechanisms by which proteins are moved to different places inside cells or secreted from cells.

Most [[protein]]s are synthesized by [[ribosome]]s in the [[cytoplasm]]. This process is known as [[protein biosynthesis]]. Biosynthesis (also called biogenesis) is an enzyme-catalyzed process in cells of living organisms by which substrates are converted to more complex products (also simply known as [[translation (genetics)|protein translation]]). Some proteins, such as those to be incorporated in membranes (known as [[membrane protein]]s), are transported into the &quot;rough&quot; [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) during synthesis. This process can be followed by transportation and processing in the [[Golgi apparatus]]. From the Golgi, membrane proteins can move to the [[plasma membrane]], to other sub-cellular compartments, or they can be secreted from the cell. The ER and Golgi can be thought of as the &quot;membrane protein synthesis compartment&quot; and the &quot;membrane protein processing compartment&quot;, respectively. There is a semi-constant flux of proteins through these compartments. ER and Golgi-resident proteins associate with other proteins but remain in their respective compartments. Other proteins &quot;flow&quot; through the ER and Golgi to the plasma membrane. [[Kinesin|Motor proteins]] transport membrane protein-containing vesicles along [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal]] tracks to distant parts of cells such as [[axon]] terminals.

Some proteins that are made in the cytoplasm contain [[Nuclear Localization Signal|structural features]] that target them for transport into [[mitochondria]] or the [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]]. Some mitochondrial proteins are made inside mitochondria and are coded for by mitochondrial DNA. In plants, [[chloroplast]]s also make some cell proteins.

Extracellular and cell surface proteins destined to be degraded can move back into intracellular compartments upon being incorporated into [[Clathrin|endocytosed]] vesicles some of which fuse with [[lysosome]]s where the proteins are broken down to their individual [[amino acid]]s. The degradation of some membrane proteins begins while still at the cell surface when they are cleaved by [[secretase]]s. Proteins that function in the cytoplasm are often degraded by [[proteasome]]s.

===Other cellular processes===
*[[Active transport]] and [[Passive transport]] - Movement of molecules into and out of cells.
*[[Autophagy]] - The process whereby cells &quot;eat&quot; their own internal components or microbial invaders.
*[[Cell adhesion|Adhesion]] - Holding together cells and tissues.
*Reproduction - Made possible by the combination of sperm made in the testiculi(contained in some male cells nucleus') and the egg made in the ovary(contained in the nucleus of a female cell). When the sperm breaks through the hard outer shell of the egg a new cell embryo is formed, which, in humans, grows to full size in 9 months.
*Cell movement: [[Chemotaxis]], [[Muscle contraction|Contraction]], [[cilia]] and [[Flagellum|flagella]].
*[[Cell signaling]] - Regulation of cell behavior by signals from outside.
*[[DNA repair]] and [[Cell death]]
*[[Metabolism]]: [[Glycolysis]], [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[Photosynthesis]]
*[[Transcription (genetics)|Transcription]] and [[Splicing (genetics)|mRNA splicing]] - gene expression.

==Internal cellular structures==
[[Image:Electronmicroscopynhlbi.jpg|thumb|right|Electron micrograph.]]
*[[Chloroplast]] - key [[organelle]] for [[photosynthesis]] (only found in plant cells)
*[[Cilia]] - motile [[microtubule]]-containing structures of [[eukaryote]]s
*[[Cytoplasm]] - contents of the main fluid-filled space inside cells
*[[Cytoskeleton]] - protein filaments inside cells
*[[Endoplasmic reticulum]] - major site of membrane [[protein synthesis]]
*[[Flagella]] - motile structures of [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and eukaryotes
*[[Golgi apparatus]] - site of protein [[glycosylation]] in the [[endomembrane]] system
*[[Lipid bilayer]] - fundamental organizational structure of [[cell membrane]]s
*[[cell membrane|Membrane]] [[lipid]] and [[protein]] barrier
*[[Mitochondrion]] - major energy-producing organelle by releasing it in the form of ATP
*[[Cell nucleus|Nucleus]] - holds most of the [[DNA]] of eukaryotic cells and controls all cellular activities
*[[Organelle]] - term used for major subcellular structures
*[[Ribosome]] - [[RNA]] and protein complex required for protein synthesis in cells
*[[vesicle (biology)|Vesicle]] - small membrane-bounded spheres inside cells

==Techniques used to study cells==
[[Image:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|thumb|right|300px]]
'''Cells may be observed under the microscope'''. This includes the [[Optical Microscope]], [[Transmission Electron Microscope]], [[Scanning Electron Microscope]], [[Fluorescence Microscope]], and by [[Confocal Microscopy]].

Several different techniques exist to study cells.
*[[Cell culture]] is the basic technique of growing cells in a laboratory independent of an organism.
*[[Immunostaining]], also known as [[immunohistochemistry]], is a specialized histological method used to localize proteins in cells or tissue slices. Unlike regular histology, which uses stains to identify cells, cellular components or protein classes, immunostaining requires the reaction of an antibody directed against the protein of interest within the tissue or cell. Through the use of proper controls and published protocols (need to add reference links here), specificity of the antibody-antigen reaction can be achieved. Once this complex is formed, it is identified via either a &quot;tag&quot; attached directly to the antibody, or added in an additional technical step. Commonly used &quot;tags&quot; include fluorophores or enzymes. In the case of the former, detection of the location of the &quot;immuno-stained&quot; protein occurs via [[fluorescence microscopy]]. With an enzymatic tag, such as horse radish peroxidase, a chemical reaction is carried out that results in a dark color in the location of the protein of interest. This darkened pattern is then detected using [[light microscopy]].
*[[Computational genomics]] is used to find patterns in genomic information &lt;ref&gt;Cristianini, N. and Hahn, M. [http://www.computational-genomics.net/ ''Introduction to Computational Genomics''], [[Cambridge University Press]], 2006. (ISBN 9780521671910 | ISBN 0521671914)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[DNA microarray]]s identify changes in transcript levels between different experimental conditions.
*[[Gene knockdown]] mutates a selected gene.
*[[In situ hybridization]] shows which cells are expressing a particular RNA transcript.
*[[PCR]] can be used to determine how many copies of a gene are present in a cell.
*[[Transfection]] introduces a new gene into a cell, usually an expression construct

'''Purification of cells and their parts'''
Purification may be performed using the following methods:
*[[Cell fractionation]]
**Release of cellular organelles by disruption of cells.
**Separation of different organelles by [[centrifugation]].
*[[Flow cytometry]]
*[[Immunoprecipitation]]
*Proteins extracted from [[cell membrane]]s by [[detergent]]s and [[salt]]s or other kinds of chemicals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Canadian English''' ('''CanE''', '''CE''', '''en-CA'''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;en-CA&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''Canadian English'' , as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[English language|English]] spoken in [[Canada]]. English is the [[first language]], or &quot;mother tongue&quot;, of approximately 24 million [[Canadians]] (77%), and more than 28 million (86%) are fluent in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo15.htm?sdi=population%20knowledge%20official%20language |title=Population by knowledge of official language, by province and territory (2006 Census) |publisher=0.statcan.ca |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 82% of Canadians outside [[Quebec]] speak English natively, but within [[Quebec]] the figure drops to just 11% as most are native speakers of [[Canadian French]].

Canadian English contains elements of [[British English]] and [[American English]] in its vocabulary, as well as many distinctive &quot;Canadianisms&quot;. In many areas, speech is influenced by [[Canadian French|French]], and there are notable local variations. Canada has very little dialect diversity compared to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot; /&gt; The [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[lexicon]] for most of Canada are similar to that of the [[Western American English|Western]] and [[Midland American English|Midland]] regions of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot;&gt;Labov, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Canadian Great Lakes region]] has similarities to that of the [[Upper Midwest|Upper Midwest &amp; Great Lakes]] region and/or [[Yooper dialect]] (in particular Michigan which has extensive business ties with Ontario), while the phonological system of western Canadian English is virtually identical to that of the [[Pacific Northwest English|Pacific Northwest]] of the United States, and the phonetics are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Boberg, C: &quot;Geolinguistic Diffusion and the U.S.-Canada Border&quot;, &quot;Language Variation and Change&quot;, 12(1):15&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Canadian English and [[American English]] are sometimes classified together as [[North American English]]. Canadian English spelling is largely a blend of British and American conventions.

==History==
The term &quot;Canadian English&quot; is first attested in a speech by the Reverend A. Constable Geikie in an address to the [[Canadian Institute]] in 1857. Geikie, a [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born Canadian, reflected the [[Anglocentric]] attitude that would be prevalent in Canada for the next hundred years when he referred to the language as &quot;a corrupt dialect,&quot; in comparison to what he considered the proper English spoken by immigrants from [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name = &quot;dbmtyy&quot;&gt;Chambers, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian English is the product of four waves of immigration and settlement over a period of almost two centuries. The first large wave of permanent English-speaking settlement in Canada, and linguistically the most important, was the influx of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] fleeing the [[American Revolution]], chiefly from the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]&amp;nbsp;– as such, Canadian English is believed by some scholars to have derived from [[northern American English]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=ia5tHVtQPn8C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=%22northern+american+english%22&amp;ei=gbfRSJuAFYTMigGCvf3mAw&amp;sig=ACfU3U1zW5pEVVvZbHNqbbpBiFsnsgR4jA#PPA422,M1 Canadian English].&quot; Brinton, Laurel J., and Fee, Marjery, ed. (2005). Ch. 12. in ''The Cambridge history of the English language. Volume VI: English in North America.'', Algeo, John, ed., pp. 422–440. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1992.
ISBN 0-521-26479-0, 9780521264792. On p. 422: &quot;It is now generally agreed that Canadian English originated as a variant of northern American English (the speech of New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Canadian English.&quot; McArthur, T., ed. (2005). ''Concise Oxford companion to the English language'', pp. 96–102. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-280637-8. On p. 97: &quot;Because CanE and AmE are so alike, some scholars have argued that in linguistic terms Canadian English is no more or less than a variety of (''Northern'') ''American English''.&lt;/ref&gt; The historical development of CanE is underexplored, but recent studies suggest that CanE has been developing features of its own since the early 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;(&quot;New-Dialect Formation in Canada. (2008). Dollinger, Stefan. Amsterdam: Benjamins, 978 90 272 31068 6. On p. 279&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while recent studies have shown the emergence of CanE features.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Labov, Ash, Boberg. 2006. The Atlas of North American English. Berlin: Mouton, ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave from Britain and [[Ireland]] was encouraged to settle in Canada after the [[War of 1812]] by the [[governors of Canada]], who were worried about anti-English sentiment among its citizens. Waves of immigration from around the globe peaking in 1910 and 1960 had a lesser influence, but they did make Canada a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] country, ready to accept linguistic change from around the world during the current period of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, p. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The languages of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] started to influence European languages used in Canada even before widespread settlement took place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/globalenglish/worldenglish/factors/?view=uk |title=Factors which shaped the varieties of English |publisher=AskOxford.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Quebec French|French]] of [[Lower Canada]] provided vocabulary to the English of [[Upper Canada]].&lt;ref name = &quot;dbmtyy&quot;/&gt;

==Spelling and dictionaries==
Canadian spelling of the English language combines British and American conventions.
* French-derived words that in American English end with ''-or'' and ''-er'', such as ''color'' or ''center'', retain British spellings (''colour'', ''honour'' and ''centre''). While the United States uses the [[Nationality|Anglo-French]] spelling ''defense'' (noun), Canadians use the British spellings ''defence'' and ''offence''. (Note that ''defensive'' and ''offensive'' are universal.)
* In other cases, Canadians and Americans differ from British spelling, such as in the case of nouns like ''curb'' and ''tire'', which in British English are spelled ''kerb'' and ''tyre''.
* Words such as ''realize'' and ''paralyze'' are usually spelled with ''-ize'' or ''-yze'' rather than ''-ise'' or ''-yse''. (The etymological convention that verbs derived from Greek roots are spelled with -ize and those from Latin with -ise is preserved in that practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Ernest Gowers, ed., ''Fowler's Modern English Usage'', 2nd ed. (Oxford: OUP, 1965), 314.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Some nouns take ''-ice'' while matching verbs take ''-ise''&amp;nbsp;– for example, ''practice'' is a noun and ''practise'' is a verb; in addition, ''licence'' is a noun and ''license'' is a verb. (Note that ''prophecy'' and ''prophesy'' are universal.)
* Canadian spelling sometimes retains the British practice of doubling consonant when adding suffixes to words even when the final syllable (before the suffix) is not stressed. Compare Canadian (and British) ''travelled'', ''counselling'', and ''controllable'' (always doubled in British, more often than not in Canadian) to American ''traveled'', ''counseling'', and ''controllable'' (only doubled when stressed). (Both Canadian and British English use ''balloted'' and ''profiting''.&lt;ref name=CanadianOxford&gt;{{cite book |title=The Canadian Oxford Dictionary |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2001 |location=Toronto, Ontario |author=Oxford Press and Katherine Barber |isbn=0-19-541731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Canadian spelling conventions can be partly explained by Canada's trade history. For instance, the British spelling of the word ''cheque'' probably relates to Canada's once-important ties to British financial institutions. Canada's [[automobile]] industry, on the other hand, has been dominated by American firms from its inception, explaining why Canadians use the American spelling of ''tire'' and American terminology for the parts of automobiles (for example,, ''truck'' instead of ''lorry'', ''gasoline'' instead of ''petrol'', ''trunk'' instead of ''boot'').&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadianOxford&quot; /&gt;

Canada's political history has also had an influence on Canadian spelling. Canada's first [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], [[John A. Macdonald]], once issued an order-in-council directing that government papers be written in the British style.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gwyn, ''John A.: The Man Who Made Us'', ([Place of publication not listed]: Random House Canada), 2007, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary reference for formal Canadian spelling is the spelling used for [[Hansard]] transcripts of the [[Parliament of Canada]] (see ''The Canadian Style'' in [[#Further reading|Further reading]] below). Many Canadian editors, though, use the ''[[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]]'', often along with the chapter on spelling in ''Editing Canadian English'', and, where necessary (depending on context), one or more other references. (See [[#Further reading|Further reading]] below.)

The first Canadian dictionaries of Canadian English were edited by [[Walter Spencer Avis]] and published by [[Gage Educational Publishing Company|Gage]] Ltd. The ''Beginner's Dictionary'' (1962), the ''Intermediate Dictionary'' (1964) and, finally, the ''Senior Dictionary'' (1967) were milestones in CanE lexicography. Many secondary schools in Canada use these dictionaries. The dictionaries have regularly been updated since: the ''Senior Dictionary'' was renamed ''Gage Canadian Dictionary'' and exists in what may be called its 5th edition from 1997. Gage was acquired by [[Thomson Nelson]] around 2003. Concise versions and paperback version are available.

In 1997, the ''ITP Nelson Dictionary of the Canadian English Language'' was another product, but has not been updated since.

In 1998, Oxford University Press produced a Canadian English dictionary, after five years of lexicographical research, entitled ''The Oxford Canadian Dictionary''. A second edition, retitled ''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary'', was published in 2004. Just as the older dictionaries it includes uniquely Canadian words and words borrowed from other languages, and surveyed spellings, such as whether ''colour'' or ''color'' was the more popular choice in common use. Paperback and concise versions (2005, 2006), with minor updates, are available.

The scholarly ''Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles'' (''[http://www.dchp.ca DCHP]'') was first published in 1967 by Gage Ltd. It was a partner project of the ''Senior Dictionary'' (and appeared only a few weeks apart from it). The ''DCHP'' can be considered the &quot;Canadian OED&quot;, as it documents the historical development of CanE words that can be classified as &quot;Canadianisms&quot;. It therefore includes words such as ''mukluk, Canuck, bluff'' and ''grow op'', but does not list common core words such as ''desk'', ''table'' or ''car''. It is a specialist, scholarly dictionary, but is not without interest to the general public. After more than 40 years, a second edition has been commenced at UBC in Vancouver in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/hsl_shl/DCHP-2/DCHP-2/DCHP-2.htm |title=Dollinger 2006 |publisher=Let.leidenuniv.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the 20th century, Canadian newspapers generally adopted American spellings for example, ''color'' as opposed to the British-based ''colour''. The use of such spellings was the long-standing practice of [[The Canadian Press]] perhaps since that news agency's inception, but visibly the norm prior to [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=OC31Mar1990&gt;{{cite news | title=Practical concerns spelled the end for -our | publisher=''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' | date=31 March 1990 | page=B3 | first=William | last=MacPherson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of dropping the letter ''u'' in such words was also considered a labour-saving technique during the early days of printing in which [[movable type]] was set manually.&lt;ref name=OC31Mar1990 /&gt; Canadian newspapers also received much of their international content from American press agencies, therefore it was much easier for editorial staff to leave the spellings from the wire services as provided.&lt;ref name=TS08Mar97&gt;{{cite news | title=Let's hear what the readers say | first=Don | last=Sellar | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date=8 March 1997 | page=C2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Canadian newspapers have adopted the British spelling variants such as ''-our'' endings, notably with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' changing its spelling policy in October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Contemplating a U-turn | first=John | last=Allemang | date=1 September 1990 | publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' | page=D6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Canadian newspapers adopted similar changes later that decade, such as the [[Canwest News Service|Southam]] newspaper chain's conversion in September 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Herald's move to Canadian spellings a labour of love | date=2 September 1998 | publisher=''[[Calgary Herald]]'' | page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' adopted this new spelling policy in September 1997 after that publication's ombudsman discounted the issue earlier in 1997.&lt;ref name=TS08Mar97 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TS13Sep97&gt;{{cite news | title=How your Star is changing | first=John | last=Honderich | date=13 September 1997 | page=A2 | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonemic incidence==
The pronunciation of certain words has both American and British influence; some pronunciations are more distinctively Canadian.
* The name of the letter [[Z]] is normally the Anglo-European (and French) ''zed''; the American ''zee'' is less common in Canada, and it is often stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;J.K. Chambers, Sociolinguistic Theory: Linguistic Variation and Its Social Significance, 2nd Edition. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 2002.

* In the words ''adult'' and ''composite'' - the emphasis is usually on the first syllable, as in Britain.
* Canadians side with the British on the pronunciation of ''shone'' {{IPA|/ʃɒn/}}, ''lever'' {{IPA|/ˈlivər/}}, and several other words; ''been'' is pronounced by many speakers as {{IPA|/bin/}} rather than {{IPA|/bɪn/}}; as in Southern England, ''either'' and ''neither'' are more commonly {{IPA|/ˈaɪðər/}} and {{IPA|/ˈnaɪðər/}}, respectively.
* ''Schedule'' can sometimes be {{IPA|/ˈʃɛdʒul/}}; ''process'', ''progress'', and ''project'' are sometimes pronounced {{IPA|/ˈproʊsɛs/}}, {{IPA|/ˈproʊɡrɛs/}}, and {{IPA|/ˈproʊdʒɛkt/}}; ''leisure'' is often {{IPA|/ˈlɛʒər/}}, ''harassment'' is often {{IPA|/ˈhɛrəsmənt/}}.
* ''Again'' and ''against'' are often pronounced {{IPA|/əˈɡeɪn(st)/}} rather than {{IPA|/əˈɡɛn(st)/}}.

* Words like ''semi'', ''anti'', and ''multi'' tend to be pronounced {{IPA|/ˈsɛmi/}}, {{IPA|/ˈænti/}}, and {{IPA|/ˈmʌlti/}} rather than {{IPA|/ˈsɛmaɪ/}}, {{IPA|/ˈæntaɪ/}}, and {{IPA|/ˈmʌltaɪ/}}.
* Loanwords that have a low central vowel in their language of origin, such as ''ll'''a'''ma'', ''p'''a'''sta'', and ''pyj'''a'''mas'', as well as place names like ''G'''a'''za'', tend to have {{IPA|/æ/}} rather than {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (which is the same as {{IPA|/ɒ/}} due to the father-bother merger, see below); this also applies to older loans like ''drama'' or ''Apache''. The word ''khaki'' is sometimes pronounced {{IPA|/ˈkɑrki/}}, the preferred pronunciation of the [[Canadian Army]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;The pronunciation {{IPA|/kɑrki/}} was the one used by author and veteran [[Farley Mowat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variation==
Canada has very little dialect diversity compared to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot; /&gt; The provinces east of Ontario show the largest dialect diversity. Northern Canada is, according to Labov, a dialect region in formation, and a homogenous dialect has not yet formed.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; A very homogeneous dialect exists in Western and Central Canada, a situation that is similar to that of the Western United States. [[William Labov]] identifies an inland region that concentrates all of the defining features of the dialect centred on the Prairies, with periphery areas with more variable patterns including the metropolitan areas of Vancouver and Toronto.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot; /&gt; This dialect forms a dialect continuum with the far Western United States, however it is sharply differentiated from the Inland Northern United States. This is a result of the relatively recent phenomenon known as the [[Northern cities vowel shift]]; see below.

===Western and Central Dialect===
{{Main|West/Central Canadian English}}
[[Image:Western Central Canada IPA chart.PNG|350px|right|thumb|Based on Labov et al.; averaged F1/F2 means for speakers from Western and Central Canada. Note that {{IPA|/ɒ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} are indistinguishable; {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} are very open.]]
As a variety of North American English, this variety is similar to most other forms of North American speech in being a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accent]], which is historically a significant marker in
differentiating different English varieties.

Like General American, this variety possesses the merry-Mary-marry merger (except in Montreal, which tends towards a distinction between marry and merry&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot;&gt;Labov p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as the [[father-bother merger]].

====Canadian raising====
Perhaps the most recognizable feature of CanE is [[Canadian raising]]. The diphthongs {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} are &quot;raised&quot; before voiceless consonants, namely /p/, /t/, /k/, /s/, and /f/. In these environments, {{IPA|/aɪ/}} becomes {{IPA|[ʌɪ~ɜɪ~ɐɪ]}}. One of the few phonetic variables that divides Canadians regionally is the articulation of the raised allophone of {{IPA|/aʊ/}}: in Ontario, it tends to have a mid-central or even mid-front articulation, sometimes approaching {{IPA|[ɛʊ]}}, while in the West and Maritimes a more retracted sound is heard, closer to {{IPA|[ʌʊ]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;yqhliy&quot;&gt;Boberg&lt;/ref&gt; Among some speakers in the Prairies and in Nova Scotia, the retraction is strong enough to cause some tokens of raised {{IPA|/aʊ/}} to merge with {{IPA|/oʊ/}}, so that ''couch'' and ''coach'' sound the same, and ''about'' sounds like ''a boat'' (though never like ''a boot'', as in the American stereotype{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} of Canadian raising). Canadian raising is found throughout western and central Canada, as well as in parts of the [[Atlantic Provinces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot; /&gt; It is the strongest in the inland region, and is receding in younger speakers in Lower Mainland [[British Columbia]], as well as certain parts of Ontario.

Many Canadians, especially in parts of the Atlantic provinces, do not possess Canadian raising. In the U.S., this feature can be found in areas near the border such as the Upper Midwest and parts of New England, although it is much less common than in Canada; raising of {{IPA|/aɪ/}} alone, however, is increasing in the U.S., and unlike raising of {{IPA|/aʊ/}}, is generally not noticed by people who do not have the raising.

Because of Canadian raising, many speakers are able to distinguish between words such as ''writer'' and ''rider''&amp;nbsp;— a feat otherwise impossible, because North American dialects turn intervocalic /t/ into an alveolar flap. Thus ''writer'' and ''rider'' are distinguished solely by their vowels, even though the distinction between their consonants has since been lost. Speakers who do not have raising cannot distinguish between these two words.

====The low-back merger and the Canadian Shift====
Almost all Canadians have the [[cot–caught merger]], which also occurs in the Western U.S. Speakers do not distinguish {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (as in ''caught'') and {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (as in ''cot''), which merge as {{IPA|[ɒ̟]}}, {{IPA|[ɑ̠]}} or {{IPA|[ɑ]}}. Speakers with this merger produce these vowels identically, and often fail to hear the difference when speakers who preserve the distinction (for example, speakers of [[General American]] and [[Inland Northern American English]]) pronounce these vowels. This merger has existed in Canada for several generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov2&quot;&gt;Labov p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

This merger creates a hole in the short vowel sub-system&lt;ref&gt;Martinet, Andre 1955. Economie des changements phonetiques. Berne: Francke.&lt;/ref&gt; and triggers a sound change known as the [[Canadian Shift]], which involves the front lax vowels {{IPA|/æ, ɛ, ɪ/}}. The {{IPA|/æ/}} of ''bat'' is lowered and retracted in the direction of {{IPA|[a]}} (except in some environments, see below). Indeed, {{IPA|/æ/}} is further back in this variety than almost all other North American dialects;&lt;ref&gt;Labov p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; the retraction of {{IPA|/æ/}} was independently observed in [[Vancouver]]&lt;ref&gt;Esling, John H. and Henry J. Warkentyne (1993). &quot;Retracting of {{IPA|/æ/}} in Vancouver English.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and is more advanced for Ontarians and women than for people from the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]] or [[Atlantic Canada]] and men.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Boberg, &quot;Sounding Canadian from Coast to Coast: Regional accents in Canadian English.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Then, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} may be lowered (in the direction of {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}}) and/or retracted; studies actually disagree on the trajectory of the shift.&lt;ref&gt;Labov et al. 2006; Charles Boberg, &quot;The Canadian Shift in Montreal&quot;; Robert Hagiwara. &quot;Vowel production in Winnipeg&quot;; Rebecca V. Roeder and Lidia Jarmasz. &quot;The Canadian Shift in Toronto.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Labov and others. (2006) noted a backward and downward movement of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in [[apparent-time hypothesis|apparent time]] in all of Canada except the Atlantic Provinces, but no movement of {{IPA|/ɪ/}} was detected.

Therefore, in Canadian English, the short-''a'' and the short-''o'' are shifted in opposite directions to that of the [[Northern Cities vowel shift|Northern Cities shift]], found across the border in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland Northern U.S.]], which is causing these two dialects to diverge: the Canadian short-''a'' is very similar in quality to the Inland Northern short-''o''; for example, the production {{IPA|[maːp]}} would be recognized as ''map'' in Canada, but ''mop'' in the Inland North.

====Other features====
Most Canadians have two principal allophones of {{IPA|/aɪ/}} (raised to lower-mid position before voiceless consonants and low-central or low-back elsewhere) and three of {{IPA|/aʊ/}} (raised before voiceless consonants, fronted to {{IPA|[aʊ]}} or {{IPA|[æʊ]}} before nasals, and low-central elsewhere).

Unlike in many American English dialects, {{IPA|/æ/}} remains a low-front vowel in most environments in Canadian English. Raising along the front periphery of the vowel space is restricted to two environments&amp;nbsp;— before nasal and voiced velar consonants&amp;nbsp;— and varies regionally even in these. Ontario and Maritime Canadian English commonly show some raising before nasals, though not as extreme as in many American varieties. Much less raising is heard on the Prairies, and some ethnic groups in Montreal show no pre-nasal raising at all. On the other hand, some Prairie speech exhibits raising of {{IPA|/æ/}} before voiced velars ({{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}}), with an up-glide rather than an in-glide, so that ''bag'' sounds close to ''vague''.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first element of {{IPA|/ɑr/}} (as in ''start'') tends to be raised. As with Canadian raising, the relative advancement of the raised nucleus is a regional indicator. A striking feature of Atlantic Canadian speech (the Maritimes and Newfoundland) is a nucleus that approaches the front region of the vowel space, accompanied by strong rhoticity, ranging from {{IPA|[ɜɹ]}} to {{IPA|[ɐɹ]}}. Western Canadian speech has a much more retracted articulation with a longer non-rhotic portion, approaching a mid-back quality, {{IPA|[ɵɹ]}} (though there is no tendency toward a merger with {{IPA|/ɔr/}}). Articulation of {{IPA|/ɑr/}} in Ontario is in a position midway between the Atlantic and Western values.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another change in progress in Canadian English, part of a continental trend affecting many North American varieties, is the fronting of {{IPA|/uː/}}, whereby the nucleus of {{IPA|/uː/}} moves forward to high-central or even high-front position, directly behind {{IPA|/iː/}}. There is a wide range of allophonic dispersion in the set of words containing {{IPA|/uː/}} (i.e., the GOOSE set), extending over most of the high region of the vowel space. Most advanced are tokens of {{IPA|/uː/}} in free position after coronals (''do'', ''too''); behind these are tokens in syllables closed with coronals (''boots'', ''food'', ''soon''), then tokens before non-coronals (''goof'', ''soup''); remaining in back position are tokens of {{IPA|/uː/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} (''cool'', ''pool'', ''tool''). Unlike in some British speech, Canadian English does not show any fronting or unrounding of the glide of {{IPA|/uː/}}, and most Canadians show no parallel centralization of {{IPA|/oʊ/}}, which generally remains in back position, except in Cape Breton and Newfoundland.

Traditionally diphthongal vowels such as {{IPA|/oʊ/}} (as in ''boat'') and {{IPA|/eɪ/}} (as in ''bait'') have qualities much closer to monophthongs in some speakers especially in the Inland region.

Some older speakers still maintain a distinction between ''whale'' and ''wail'', and ''do'' and ''dew''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov2&quot;&gt;Labov p.218.&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====
British Columbia English has several words still in current use borrowed from the [[Chinook Jargon]] although the use of such vocabulary is observably decreasing. The most famous and widely used of these terms are ''[[skookum]]'' and ''[[Chinook Jargon use by English-language speakers|saltchuck]]''. However, among young British Columbians, almost no one uses this vocabulary, and only a small percentage is even familiar with the meaning of such words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the Yukon, ''cheechako'' is used for newcomers or greenhorns. A study shows that people from Vancouver exhibit more vowel retraction of /æ/ before nasals than people from Toronto, and this retraction may become a regional marker of West Coast English.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Hall &quot;Regional variation in Canadian English vowel backing&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prairies (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta)====
A strong Canadian raising exists in the prairie regions together with certain older usages such as ''chesterfield'' and ''front room'' also associated with the Maritimes. Aboriginal Canadians are a larger and more conspicuous population in prairie cities than elsewhere in the country and certain elements of aboriginal speech in English are sometimes to be heard. Similarly, the linguistic legacy, mostly intonation but also speech patterns and syntax, of the Scandinavian, Slavic and German settlers&amp;nbsp;— who are far more numerous and historically important in the Prairies than in Ontario or the Maritimes&amp;nbsp;— can be heard in the general milieu. Again, the large [[Métis]] population in [[Saskatchewan]] and Manitoba also carries with it certain linguistic traits inherited from [[French people|French]], [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] and [[Celt]]ic forebears.
Some terms are derived from immigrant groups or are just local inventions:
* Bluff: small group of trees isolated by [[prairie]]
* Bunny hug: elsewhere ''[[hoodie]]'' or ''hooded sweat shirt'' (mainly in Saskatchewan, but also in Alberta)
* Ginch/gonch/gitch/gotch: underwear (usually men's or boys' underwear, more specifically briefs), probably of Eastern European or Ukrainian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gonch |title=Wiktionary reference for gonch |publisher=En.wiktionary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gitch'' and ''gotch'' are primarily used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba while the variants with an ''n'' are common in Alberta and British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/gonch/ Doubletongued.org], reference for gonch.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jam buster: jelly-filled doughnut.
* Porch climber: [[moonshine]] or homemade alcohol.
* Pot hole: usually a deeper slough; also used to refer to slough in plural. ''Pot hole'' more commonly refers to a hole in a paved road caused by the freezing and thawing cycle.
* Slough: pond&amp;nbsp;— usually a pond on a farm
* [[Vi-Co]]: occasionally used in Saskatchewan instead of ''chocolate milk''. Formerly a brand of chocolate milk.

In farming communities with substantial Ukrainian, German, or [[Mennonite]] populations, accents, sentence structure, and vocabulary influenced by these languages is common.

====Ontario====
=====Ottawa Valley=====
{{Main|Ottawa Valley Twang}}

The area to the north and west of [[Ottawa]] is heavily influenced by original Scottish, Irish, and German settlers, with many French loanwords. This is frequently referred to as the ''Valley Accent''.

=====Toronto=====
{{See also|West/Central Canadian English#Toronto}}

Although only 1.5% of Torontonians speak French, a relatively low proportion of them (56.2%) are native speakers of English, according to the 2006 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/english/economy/demographics/census/cenhi06-8.pdf |title=Gov.on.ca |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result Toronto shows a more variable speech pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Labov p. 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Although slang terms used in Toronto are synonymous with those used in other major North American cities, there is also an influx of slang terminology originating from Toronto's many immigrant communities. These terms originate mainly from various European, Asian, and African words. Among youths in predominantly West Indian areas, a large number of words borrowed from [[Caribbean English|West Indian Patois]] can be heard.

=====Northwest Ontario=====
With a smaller French population, and sizable Aboriginal population, this area is somewhat unique as having elements from both the Western provinces and the rest of Ontario. Communities receive media from both directions, and residents travel frequently to both areas, prompting a blending of dialects. Sharp eared locals can detect from word usage (soda versus pop, hoodie versus bunny hug) where one originated, &quot;Down south&quot; (Thunder Bay and beyond the Great Lakes) or &quot;Out West&quot; (west of the [[Manitoba]] border).

====Quebec====
{{Main|Quebec English}}
* Many people in Montreal distinguish between the words marry and merry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot; /&gt;
* Quebec Anglophones generally pronounce French street names in Montreal as French words. [[Pie-IX Boulevard|''Pie IX'' Boulevard]] is pronounced as in French («pea-nuf»), not as &quot;pie nine.&quot; On the other hand, most Anglophones do pronounce final ''D''s, as in ''Bernard'' and ''Bouchard''.
* In the city of Montreal, especially in some of the western suburbs like Cote-St-Luc and Hampstead, there is a strong Jewish influence in the English spoken in these areas. A large wave of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union before and after World War II is also evident today. Their English has a strong Yiddish influence; there are some similarities to English spoken in New York. Italians and Greeks living in Montreal have also adopted English and therefore have their own dialect.
* Words used mainly in Quebec and especially in Montreal are:&lt;ref&gt;Boberg, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; ''stage'' for &quot;apprenticeship or internship&quot;, ''copybook'' for a notebook, ''dépanneur'' or ''dep'' for a convenience store, and ''guichet'' for an ABM/ATM. It is also common for Anglophones to use translated French words instead of common English equivalents, such as &quot;open&quot; and &quot;close&quot; for &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;, for example, &quot;Open the lights, please&quot; for &quot;Turn on the lights, please&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Maritimes===
{{Main|Maritimer English}}
[[Image:Atlantic Canada IPA chart.PNG|350px|right|thumb|Based on Labov et al.; averaged F1/F2 means for speakers from NS, NB, NL.]]
Many in the Maritime provinces&amp;nbsp;– Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island&amp;nbsp;– have an accent that sounds more like Scottish English and, in some places, Irish English than General American. Outside of major communities, dialects can vary markedly from community to community, as well as from province to province, reflecting ethnic origin as well as a past in which there were few roads and many communities, with some villages very isolated. Into the 1980s, residents of villages in northern Nova Scotia could identify themselves by dialects and accents distinctive to their village. The dialects of Prince Edward Island are often considered the most distinct grouping. The phonology of [[Maritimer English]] has some unique features:
* Pre-consonantal {{IPA|/r/}} is sometimes deleted.
* The flapping of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to alveolar tap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, as well as pronouncing it as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, is less common in the Maritimes. Therefore, ''battery'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbætɹi]}} instead of {{IPA|[ˈbæɾ(ə)ɹi]}}.
* Especially among the older generation, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/hw/}} are not merged; that is, the beginning sound of why, white, and which is different from that of witch, with, wear.
* Like most varieties of CanE, Maritimer English contains Canadian raising.

===Newfoundland===
{{Main|Newfoundland English}}

The [[dialect]] spoken in the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], an autonomous dominion until March 31, 1949, is often considered the most distinctive Canadian English dialect. Some Newfoundland English differs in [[vowel]] [[pronunciation]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and preservation of [[Archaism|archaic]] adverbal-intensifiers. The dialect can vary markedly from community to community, as well as from region to region, reflecting ethnic origin as well as a past in which there were few roads and many communities, and fishing villages in particular remained very isolated. A few speakers have a transitional pin-pen merger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov&quot; /&gt;

==Grammar==
* When writing, Canadians will start a sentence with ''As well,'' in the sense of &quot;in addition&quot;; this construction is a Canadianism.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill and Hannah, ''International English'' (4th edition), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Canadian and British English share idioms like ''in hospital'' and ''to university'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ling.uta.edu/~laurel/stvan98_ch1.pdf |title=UTA.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2005/06/16/midwives050616.html |title=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2005-06-17 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in American English the definite article is mandatory.

==Vocabulary==
Where Canadian English shares vocabulary with other English dialects, it tends to share most with American English. Many terms are shared with Britain, but not with the majority of American speakers. In some cases British and the American terms coexist in Canadian English to various extents; a classic example is ''holiday'', often used interchangeably with ''vacation'', distinguishing the two between a trip elsewhere and general time off work respectively. In addition, the vocabulary of Canadian English also features words that are seldom (if ever) found elsewhere. A good resource for these and other words is the [[Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles]] (Avis and others. 1967), which is currently being revised at the University of British Columbia Vancouver.

As a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], Canada shares many items of institutional terminology and professional designations with the countries of the former British Empire&amp;nbsp;– for example,, ''constable'', for a police officer of the lowest rank, and ''chartered accountant''.

===Education===
The term ''college'', which refers to post-secondary education in general in the U.S., refers in Canada to either a post-secondary technical or vocational institution, or to one of the colleges that exist as [[federated school]]s within some Canadian universities. Most often, a ''college'' is a community college, not a university. It may also refer to a [[CEGEP]] in Quebec. In Canada, ''college student'' might denote someone obtaining a diploma in business management while ''university student'' is the term for someone earning a [[bachelor's degree]]. For that reason, ''going to college'' does not have the same meaning as ''going to university'', unless the speaker or context clarifies the specific level of post-secondary education that is meant.

Within the public school system the chief administrator of a school is generally &quot;the principal&quot;, as in the United States, but the term is not used preceding his or her name, i.e. &quot;Principal Smith&quot;. The assistant to the principal is not titled as &quot;assistant principal&quot;, but rather as &quot;vice-principal&quot;, although the former is not unknown.

Canadian universities publish ''calendars'' or ''schedules'', not ''catalogs'' as in the U.S.. Canadian students ''write'' or ''take'' exams (in the U.S., students generally &quot;take&quot; exams while teachers &quot;write&quot; them); they rarely ''sit'' them (standard British usage). Those who supervise students during an exam are sometimes called ''invigilators'' as in [[England|Britain]], or sometimes ''proctors'' as in the U.S.; usage may depend on the region or even the individual institution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Successive years of school are usually referred to as ''grade one'', ''grade two'', and so on. In [[Quebec English]], however, the speaker will often say ''primary one'', ''primary two'', (a direct translation from the [[French language|French]]), and so on. (Compare American ''first grade, second grade'' (sporadically found in Canada), and English/Welsh ''Year 1, Year 2'', Scottish/Nth.Irish ''Primary 1, Primary 2'' or ''P1, P2'', and Sth.Irish ''First Class, Second Class'' and so on.)&lt;ref name&gt;''American Speech'' 80.1 (2005), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the U.S., the four years of high school are termed the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years (terms also used for college years); in Canada, the specific levels are used instead (ie, &quot;grade nine&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech&quot;&gt;''American Speech'' 80.1 (2005), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; As for higher education, only the term ''freshman'' (often reduced to ''frosh'') has some currency in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech&quot; /&gt; The American usages &quot;sophomore&quot;, &quot;junior&quot; and &quot;senior&quot; are not used in Canadian university terminology, or in speech. The specific high-school grades and university years are therefore stated and individualized; for example, ''the grade 12s failed to graduate''; ''John is in his second year at McMaster''. The &quot;first year&quot;, &quot;third year&quot; designation also applies to Canadian law school students, as opposed to the common American usage of &quot;1L&quot;, &quot;2L&quot; and &quot;3L.&quot;

Canadian students use the term ''marks'' (more common in England) or ''grades'' (more common in the US) to refer to their results; usage is very mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech&quot; /&gt;

===Units of measurement===
Unlike in the United States, use of [[SI|metric]] units within a majority of industries (but not all) is standard in Canada, as a result of the national adoption of the Metric System during the mid-to-late 1970s; this has spawned some colloquial usages such as ''klick'' for kilometre (as also heard in the U.S. military). See [[metrication in Canada]]. Nonetheless, Imperial units are still used in many situations. For example, Canadians will usually state their weight and height in pounds and feet/inches, respectively. Temperatures for cooking are often given in Fahrenheit. Directions in the [[Prairie provinces]] are often given using miles, because the country roads generally follow the mile-based grid of the [[Dominion Land Survey]]. Also, the U.S. letter [[paper size]] of 8.5&amp;nbsp;inches × 11&amp;nbsp;inches is used instead of the international and metric [[A series|A4]] size of 210&amp;nbsp;mm × 297&amp;nbsp;mm.

===Transportation===
* Although Canadian lexicon features both [[Usage of the terms railroad and railway|''railway'']] and [[Usage of the terms railroad and railway|''railroad'']], ''railway'' is the usual term in naming (witness [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), though ''railroad'' can be heard fairly frequently in some regions; most [[rail terminology]] in Canada, however, follows American usage (for example,, ''ties'' and ''cars'' rather than ''sleepers'' and ''carriages'').
* A two-way ticket can be either a ''round-trip'' (American term) or a ''return'' (British term).
* The terms ''highway'' (for example, [[Trans-Canada Highway]]), ''expressway'' (Central Canada, as in the [[Gardiner Expressway]]) and ''freeway'' ([[Sherwood Park Freeway]], [[Edmonton]]) are often used to describe various high speed roads with varying levels of access control. Generally, but not exclusively, ''highway'' refers to a provincially funded road. Often such roads will be numbered. Similar to the US, the terms ''[[expressway]]'' and ''[[freeway]]'' are often used interchangeably to refer to divided highways with access only at grade-separated interchanges (for example, a [[400-series highways (Ontario)|400-Series Highway]] in Ontario). However, ''expressway'' may also refer to a road that has control of access but has [[at-grade]] junctions, railway crossings (for example, the [[Harbour Expressway]] in [[Thunder Bay]].) Sometimes the term ''Parkway'' is also used (for example, the [[Hanlon Parkway]] in [[Guelph]]). In Saskatchewan, the term 'grid road' is used to refer to minor highways or rural roads, usually gravel, referring to the 'grid' upon which they were originally designed. In Quebec, freeways and expressways are called [[Autoroutes of Quebec|autoroutes]]. In Alberta, the generic ''Trail'' is often used to describe a freeway, expressway or major urban street (for example, [[Deerfoot Trail]], [[Macleod Trail]] or [[Crowchild Trail]] in Calgary, [[Yellowhead Trail]] in Edmonton). The British term ''[[motorway]]'' is not used. The American terms ''[[Toll road|turnpike]]'' and ''[[tollway]]'' for a toll road are not common. The term ''[[throughway]]'' or ''[[freeway|thruway]]'' was used for first tolled limited-access highways (for example, the Deas Island Throughway, now Highway 99, from [[Vancouver, BC]], to Blaine, Washington, USA or the Saint John Throughway (Highway 1) in [[Saint John, NB]]), but this term is not common anymore. In everyday speech, when a particular roadway is not being specified, the term ''highway'' is generally or exclusively used.
* A railway at-grade junction is a ''level crossing''; the U.S. term ''grade crossing'' is rarely, if ever, used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* A railway or highway crossing overhead is an ''overpass'' or ''underpass'', depending on which part of the crossing is referred to (the two are used more or less interchangeably); the British term ''flyover'' is sometimes used in Ontario, and in the Maritimes as well as on occasion in the prairies (such as the 4th avenue flyover in Calgary, Alberta), ''subway'' is also used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* In Québec, English speakers often use the word &quot;Metro&quot; to mean [[Rapid transit|subway]]. Non-native Anglophones of Québec will also use the designated proper title &quot;Metro&quot; to describe the Montréal subway system.
* The term ''Texas gate'' refers to the type of [[cattle grid|metal grid]] called a ''cattle guard'' in American English or a ''cattle grid'' in British English.
*Depending on the region, large trucks used to transport and deliver goods are referred to as 'transport trucks' (Eg. used in Ontario and Alberta) or 'transfer trucks' (Eg. used in Prince Edward Island)

===Politics===
* While in standard usage the terms [[prime minister]] and [[premier]] are interchangeable terms for the head of an elected parliamentary government, Canadian English today generally follows a usage convention of reserving the title ''prime minister'' for the federal first minister and referring to provincial or territorial leaders as ''premiers''. However, because [[Canadian French]] does not have separate terms for the two positions, using ''premier ministre'' for both, the title ''prime minister'' is sometimes seen in reference to a provincial leader when a francophone is speaking or writing English. As well, until the 1970s the leader of the Ontario provincial government was officially styled ''prime minister''.
* When a majority of the elected members of the House of Commons or a provincial legislature are not members of the same party as the government, the situation is referred to as a minority government rather than a hung Parliament.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* To ''table'' a document in Canada is to present it (as in Britain), whereas in the U.S. it means to withdraw it from consideration. (However in non-governmental meetings using Robert's Rules of Order to table a document can be to postpone consideration until a later date.)
* Several political terms are more in use in Canada than elsewhere, including ''riding'' (as a general term for a [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary]] constituency or [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]]). The term ''[[reeve (Canada)|reeve]]'' was at one time common for the equivalent of a mayor in some smaller municipalities in British Columbia and Ontario, but is now falling into disuse. The title is still used for the leader of a rural municipality in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
* The term ''Tory,'' used in Britain with a [[tory|similar meaning]], denotes a supporter of the federal [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the historic [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|federal]] or provincial Progressive Conservative party. The term [[Red Tory]] is also used to denote the more socially liberal wings of the Tory parties. [[Blue Tory]] is less commonly used, and refers to more strict fiscal (rather than social) conservatism. The U.S. use of ''Tory'' to mean the Loyalists in the time of the American Revolution is not used in Canada,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} where they are called [[United Empire Loyalists]], or simply Loyalists.
* Members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or a provincial Liberal party are sometimes referred to as ''Grits''. Historically, the term comes from the phrase ''Clear Grit'', used in Victorian times in Canada to denote an object of quality or a truthful person. The term was assumed as a nickname by Liberals by the 1850s.
* Members of the [[Bloc Québécois]] are sometimes referred to as ''Bloquistes''. At the purely provincial level, members of Quebec's [[Parti Québécois]] are often referred to as ''Péquistes'', and members of the Quebec provincial [[Action démocratique du Québec]] as ''Adéquistes''.
* The term &quot;Socred&quot; is no longer common due to its namesake party's decline, but referred to members of the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit Party]], and was particularly common in British Columbia&lt;!--and Alberta?--&gt;. It was not used for Social Credit members from Quebec, nor generally used for the federal caucus of that party; in both cases ''Créditiste'', the French term, was used in English.
* Members of the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] are referred to by the title &quot;Senator&quot; preceding their name, as in the United States. Members of the [[Canadian House of Commons]], following British parliamentary nomenclature, are termed &quot;Members of Parliament&quot;, and are referred to as &quot;Jennifer Jones, MP&quot; during their term of office only. This style is extended to the Premiers of the provinces during their service. Senators, and members of the Privy Council are styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life, and the Prime Minister of Canada is styled &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life, as is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Governor-General. This honorific may also be bestowed by Parliament, as it was to retiring deputy prime minister [[Herb Gray]] in 1996. Members of provincial legislatures do not have a pre-nominal style, except in certain provinces, such as Nova Scotia where members of the Queen's [[Executive Council of Nova Scotia]] are styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life, and are entitled to the use of the post-nominal letters &quot;ECNS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/1st_read/b198.htm |title=Gov.ns.ca |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cabinet of Ontario serves concurrently (and not for life) as the [[Executive Council of Ontario]], while serving members are styled &quot;The Honourable&quot;, but are not entitled to post-nominal letters.
* Members of provincial/territorial legislative assemblies are called [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLAs]] in all provinces and territories except: [[Ontario]], where they have been called [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Members of Provincial Parliament]] (MPPs) since 1938; [[Quebec]], where they have been called [[Member of the National Assembly (Quebec)|Members of the National Assembly]] (MNAs) since 1968; and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], where they are called [[Member of the House of Assembly|Members of the House of Assembly]] (MHAs).

===Law===
[[Lawyer]]s in all parts of Canada, except [[Quebec]], which has its own [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, are called &quot;[[barristers]] and [[solicitors]]&quot; because any lawyer licensed in any of the common law provinces and territories must pass bar exams for, and is permitted to engage in, both types of legal practice in contrast to other common-law jurisdictions such as England, Wales, and Ireland where the two are traditionally separated (i.e., Canada has a [[fused profession|fused legal profession]]). The words ''lawyer'' and ''counsel'' (not ''counsellor'') predominate in everyday contexts; the word ''attorney'' refers to any personal representative. Canadian lawyers generally do not refer to themselves as &quot;attorneys&quot;, a term which is common in the United States.

The equivalent of an American ''[[district attorney]]'', meaning the barrister representing the state in criminal proceedings, is called a ''[[crown attorney]]'' (in [[Ontario]]), ''crown counsel'' (in British Columbia), ''crown prosecutor'' or ''the crown'', on account of Canada's status as a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which [[the Crown]] is the locus of state power.

The words ''advocate'' and ''[[civil law notary|notary]]''&amp;nbsp;– two distinct professions in Quebec civil law&amp;nbsp;– are used to refer to that province's equivalent of barrister and solicitor, respectively. In Canada's [[common law]] provinces and territories, the word ''notary'' means strictly a [[notary public]].

Within the Canadian legal community itself, the word ''solicitor'' is often used to refer to any Canadian lawyer in general (much like the way the word ''attorney'' is used in the United States to refer to any American lawyer in general). Despite the conceptual distinction between ''barrister'' and ''solicitor'', Canadian court documents would contain a phrase such as &quot;''John Smith, ''solicitor'' for the Plaintiff''&quot; even though &quot;John Smith&quot; may well himself be the barrister who argues the case in court. In a letter introducing him/herself to an opposing lawyer, a Canadian lawyer normally writes something like &quot;''I am the ''solicitor'' for Mr. Tom Jones.&quot;

The word ''litigator'' is also used by lawyers to refer to a fellow lawyer who specializes in lawsuits even though the more traditional word ''barrister'' is still employed to denote the same specialization.

Judges of Canada's superior courts (which exist at the provincial and territorial levels) are traditionally addressed as ''&quot;My Lord&quot;'' or ''&quot;My Lady&quot;'', like much of the Commonwealth, however there are some variances across certain jurisdictions, with some superior court judges preferring the titles ''&quot;Mister Justice&quot;'' or ''&quot;Madam Justice&quot;'' to ''&quot;Lordship&quot;''.

Masters are addressed as ''&quot;Mr. Master&quot;'' or simply ''&quot;Sir&quot;''.

Judges of provincial or inferior courts are traditionally referred to in person as ''&quot;Your Honour&quot;''. Judges of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and of the federal-level courts prefer the use of ''&quot;Mister/Madam (Chief) Justice&quot;''. [[Justice of The Peace#Canada|Justices of The Peace]] are addressed as ''&quot;Your Worship&quot;''. ''&quot;Your Honour&quot;'' is also the correct form of address for a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]].

As in England, a serious crime is called an [[indictable offence]], while a less-serious crime is called a [[summary offence]]. The older words [[felony]] and [[misdemeanour]], which are still used in the United States, are not used in Canada's current ''[[Criminal Code of Canada|Criminal Code]]'' (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46) or by today's Canadian legal system. As noted throughout the ''Criminal Code'', a person accused of a crime is called ''the accused'' and not ''the defendant'', a term used instead in civil lawsuits.

A [[Counties of British Columbia|county in British Columbia]] means only a regional jurisdiction of the courts and justice system and is not otherwise connected to governance as with counties in other provinces and in the United States. The rough equivalent to &quot;county&quot; as used elsewhere is a &quot;[[Regional District]]&quot;.

===Places===
Distinctive Canadianisms are:
* ''[[Bachelor]]'': bachelor apartment, an apartment all in a single room, with a small bathroom attached (&quot;They have a bachelor for rent&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary'', &quot;bachelor&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual American term is ''studio''. In Quebec, this is known as a ''one-and-a-half'' apartment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federal-realestate.com/info-montreal-apartments/montreal-apartment-sizes.html |title=Federal-Realestate.com |publisher=Federal-Realestate.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; some Canadians, especially in Prince Edward Island, call it a ''loft''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Boberg 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Public house]]'': or more often 'pub'. Drinking establishments which are not pubs may be termed ''bars'', ''taverns'' or ''lounges'', among other terms.
* ''Camp'': in Northern Ontario, it refers to what is called a ''cottage'' in the rest of Ontario and a ''cabin'' in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Boberg 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used, to a lesser extent, in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, as well as in parts of New England.
* ''Fire hall'': [[fire station]], firehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/fire%20hall |title=Fire hall - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''height of land'': a [[drainage divide]]. Originally American.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, Wiley, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Parkade'': a [[parking garage]], especially in [[Western Canada|the West]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;
* ''[[Washroom]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/elt/catalogue/teachersites/oald7/images/un212.gif |title=OUP.com |publisher=OUP.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the general term for what is normally named ''public toilet'' or lavatory in Britain. In the U.S. (where it originated) the word was mostly replaced by ''restroom'' in the 20th century. Generally used only as a technical or commercial term outside of Canada. The word ''bathroom'' is also used.
* [[First Nation]] [[Indian reserve|reserve]], rather than the U.S. term &quot;Federal Indian Reservation.&quot; A slang variant of this term is the shortened ''res'' or ''rez''.
* ''[[Rancherie]]'': the residential area of a First Nation reserve, used in BC only.
* ''[[Quiggly hole]]'' and/or ''quiggly'': the depression in the ground left by a ''[[kekuli]]'' or pithouse. Groups of them are called &quot;quiggly hole towns&quot;. Used in the BC Interior ''only''.
* ''Gasbar'': a [[filling station]] (gas station) with a central island, having pumps under a fixed metal or concrete awning.
* ''Boozcan'': an after-hours establishment where alcohol is served, often illegally.
* The term ''dépanneur'', or the diminutive form ''dep'', is often used by English speakers in Quebec. This is because [[convenience stores]] are called dépanneurs in Québécois French.
* A ''Snye'' is a side-water channel that rejoins a larger river, creating an island.

===Daily life===
Terms common in Canada, Britain, and Ireland but less frequent or nonexistent in the U.S. are:
* ''Tin'' (as in ''tin of tuna''), for ''can'', especially among older speakers. Among younger speakers, ''can'' is more common, with ''tin'' referring to a can which is wider than it is tall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* ''Cutlery'', for ''silverware'' or ''flatware''.
* ''Serviette'', especially in Eastern Canada, for a paper table ''napkin''.
* ''[[Tap (valve)|Tap]]'', conspicuously more common than ''faucet'' in everyday usage.

The following are more or less distinctively Canadian:
* ''ABM'', ''bank machine'': synonymous with [[automated teller machine|ATM]] (which is also used).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, ''ABM''; Boberg 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''BFI bin'': Dumpster, after a [[BFI Canada|prominent Canadian waste management company]], in provinces where that company does business; compare [[Kleenex]], [[Xerox]].
* ''Chesterfield'': originally British and internationally used (as in classic furnishing terminology) to refer to a sofa whose arms are the same height as the back, it is a term for ''any'' couch or sofa in Canada (and, to some extent, Northern California).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl OUP.com] &lt;!-- OALD link: just type &quot;chesterfield&quot; --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/C0279400.html Chesterfield. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Once a hallmark of CanE, ''chesterfield'' as with ''settee'' and ''davenport'', is now largely in decline among younger generations in the western and central regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~chambers/couch.html Utoronto.ca] J.K. Chambers, &quot;The Canada-U.S. border as a vanishing isogloss: the evidence of chesterfield.&quot; Journal of English Linguistics 23 (1995): 156-66.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Couch'' is now the most common term; ''sofa'' is also used.
* ''Eavestroughs'': [[rain gutter]]s. Also used, especially in the past, in the Northern and Western U.S.; the first recorded usage is in [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'': &quot;The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs [''sic''], Flask.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, ''eavestrough''; Oxford English Dictionary; American Heritage Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Garburator'': (rhymes with ''carburetor'') a [[garbage disposal]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'' (second edition), ''garburator'' is &quot;Canadian&quot; and ''garbage disposal'' is &quot;North American.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Homogenized milk'' or ''homo milk'': Milk containing 3.25% milk fat, typically called &quot;whole milk&quot; in the US.
* ''Hydro'': a common synonym for [[mains electricity|electrical service]], used primarily in New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia. Most of the power in these provinces is [[hydroelectricity]], and incorporate the term &quot;Hydro&quot;. Usage: &quot;I didn't pay my hydro bill so they shut off my lights.&quot; Hence ''hydrofield'', a line of electricity transmission towers, usually in groups cutting across a city, and ''hydro lines/poles'', electrical transmission lines/poles.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, ''hydro''.&lt;/ref&gt; These usages of ''hydro'' are also standard in the Australian state of [[Tasmania]]. Also in slang usage can refer to hydroponically grown marijuana.
* ''[[Loonie]]'': the Canadian one-dollar coin; derived from the use of the [[Great Northern Diver|common loon]] on the reverse. The ''[[toonie]]'' (less commonly spelled ''tooney'', ''twooney'', ''twoonie'') is the two-dollar coin. ''Loonie'' is also used to refer to the [[Canadian dollar|Canadian currency]], particularly when discussing the exchange rate with the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]; neither ''loonie'' nor ''toonie'' can describe amounts of money beyond a very small amount. (for example, ''I have thirty dollars'' versus &quot;got a loonie/toonie?&quot;).
* ''Pencil crayon'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Barber, Katherine |title=The Canadian Oxford Dictionary |edition= 1st Edition |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Toronto |isbn=0-19-541120-X |pages=.1075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; coloured pencil.
* ''Pogie'' or ''pogey'': term referring to unemployment insurance, which is now officially called ''Employment'' Insurance in Canada. Derived from the use of pogey as a term for a poorhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~russ1980/stuff/Pogey.pdf |title=Pogey: What Does it Mean? Bonny, 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not used for welfare, in which case the term is ''&quot;the dole&quot;'', as in ''&quot;he's on the dole, eh?&quot;''.

====Apparel====
The following are common in Canada, but not in the U.S. or the U.K.
* ''Runners'':&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, ''runner''.&lt;/ref&gt; running shoes, especially in [[Western Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;American Speech 80.1 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Also used in Australian English&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; and Irish English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2009/0106/1230936690382.html Sometimes the gym doesn't fix it], [[The Irish Times]], Tuesday, January 06, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2008/0322/1206024702849.html?via=me Machismo . . . or masochism?], The Irish Times&amp;nbsp;— Saturday March 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2008/1007/1222959451495.html Stars in the running], The Irish Times, Tueesday October 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic Canada prefers ''sneakers'' while central Canada (including Quebec and Ontario) prefer &quot;running shoes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;American Speech 80.1 (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Toque]]'' (also spelled ''[[tuque]]'' or ''touque''): a knitted winter hat. A similar hat would be called a ''beanie'' in the western U.S. and a ''watch cap'' in the eastern U.S, though these forms are generally closer-fitting, and may lack a brim as well as a pompom. There seems to be no exact equivalent outside Canada, since the tuque is of French Canadian origin.

====Food and beverage====
* Most Canadians as well as Americans in the Northwest, North Central, Prairie and Inland North prefer ''pop'' over ''soda'' to refer to a carbonated beverage (but neither term is dominant in British English; see further at [[Soft drink naming conventions]]). &quot;Soft drink&quot; is also extremely common throughout Canada.
* What Americans call ''Canadian bacon'' is named ''[[back bacon]]'' or, if it is coated in cornmeal or ground peas, [[cornmeal bacon]] or [[peameal bacon]] in Canada.
* What most Americans call a ''[[candy bar]]'' is usually known as a ''chocolate bar''. (as in the UK, however, some in the US, especially older Americans in northern states, occasionally call it a ''[[chocolate bar]]''). In certain areas surrounding the [[Bay of Fundy]], it is sometimes known as a ''nut bar'', however this use is more popular amongst older generations.
* Even though the terms ''French fries'' and ''fries'' are used by Canadians, some speakers use the word ''chips'' (and its diminutive, ''chippies'') (chips is always used when referring to ''[[fish and chips]]'', as elsewhere).
* [[Whole-wheat bread]] is often referred to as ''brown bread'', as in &quot;Would you like white or brown bread for your toast?&quot;

===Vocabulary pertaining to race and ethnicity===
* Aboriginals (aka Natives, Indigenous Peoples, etc.) are not referred to as &quot;Indian&quot;, in part because there is a large and growing East Indian population in Canada. The term [[First Nations]] is used as an adjective when referring in a respectful manner to persons who would be called American Indians in the United States. Northern aboriginal persons are [[Inuit]] and mixed-race (First Nations - European) are [[Métis]].

===Canadianisms===
* ''Double-double'': a cup of coffee with two creams and two sugars, most commonly associated with the [[Tim Hortons]] chain of coffee shops. By the same token, triple-triple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2004/06/30/doubledouble040630.html CBC.ca Arts - 'Double-double'? Now you can look it up]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mickey'': a {{convert|375|mL|USfloz impfloz|abbr=on|lk=out}} bottle of hard liquor (informally called a [[pint]] in the Maritimes and the US).
* ''Two-six'', ''twenty-sixer'', ''twixer'': a {{convert|750|mL|USfloz impfloz|abbr=on}} bottle of hard liquor (called a quart in the Maritimes).
* ''Texas mickey'' (esp. in Saskatchewan; more often a &quot;Saskatchewan mickey&quot;, esp. in western Canada): a {{convert|3|L|USfloz impfloz|0|abbr=on}} bottle of hard liquor. (Despite the name, Texas mickeys are generally unavailable outside of Canada.)
* ''Two-four'': a case of 24 beers, also known as a &quot;flat&quot; in Western Canada
* ''Half-sack'' or ''Poverty-pack'': a case of 6 beers
* ''[[Poutine]]'': a snack of french fries topped with cheese curds and hot gravy.
* ''[[Cheezies]]'': [[Cheese puffs]]. The name is a [[genericized trademark]] based on a brand of crunchy cheese snack sold in Canada.
* ''Freezies'': A [[pop (frozen snack)#Dessert with no wooden stick|frozen flavoured sugar water]] snack common worldwide, but known by this name exclusively in Canada.
* ''Dainty'', dainties: Fancy cookies, pastries, or squares served at a social event (usually plural). Used in western Canada.
* ''Smarties'', Smarties: A bean sized, small candy covered chocolate, similar to [[M&amp;M's]] without peanuts. This is also seen in British English &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smarties.co.uk/home/ Nestlé Smaties - '...It's a brand name after all.']&lt;/ref&gt; Smarties in the United States refer to small, tart powdered disc sold in rolls. In Canada these are sold as &quot;Rockets&quot;.
* The United States of America is almost always called &quot;The States&quot; rather than &quot;America&quot;.

===Informal speech===
A ''rubber'' in the U.S. and Canada is slang for a condom; however, in Canada it is sometimes (rarely except for Newfoundland) another term for eraser (as it is in the United Kingdom and Ireland).

The word ''bum'' can refer either to the buttocks (as in Britain or the U.S.), or, derogatorily, to a [[homeless]] person (as in the U.S.). However, the &quot;buttocks&quot; sense does not have the indecent character it retains in British and Australian use, as it and &quot;butt&quot; are commonly used as a polite or childish euphemism for ruder words such as ''[[buttocks|arse]]'' (commonly used in Atlantic Canada and among older people in Ontario and to the west) or ''[[buttocks|ass]]'', or ''[[mitiss]]'' (used in the Prairie Provinces, especially in northern and central Saskatchewan; probably originally a Cree loanword). Older Canadians may see &quot;bum&quot; as more polite than &quot;butt&quot;, which before the 1980s was often considered rude.

Similarly the word ''pissed'' can refer either to being drunk (as in Britain), or being mad or angry (as in the U.S.), though anger is more often said as ''pissed off'', while ''piss drunk'' or ''pissed up'' is said to describe inebriation (though ''piss drunk'' is sometimes also used in the US, especially in the northern states).

====Canadian colloquialisms====
One of the most distinctive Canadian phrases is the spoken interrogation ''[[eh]]'', which is stereotyped as being said by almost all Canadians in modern culture. The only usage of ''eh'' exclusive to Canada, according to the ''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'', is for &quot;ascertaining the comprehension, continued interest, agreement, etc., of the person or persons addressed&quot; as in, &quot;It's four kilometres away, eh, so I have to go by bike.&quot; In that case, ''eh?'' is used to confirm the attention of the listener and to invite a supportive noise such as ''mm'' or ''oh'' or ''okay''. This usage is also common in Queensland, Australia. Other uses of ''eh''&amp;nbsp;— for instance, in place of ''huh?'' or ''what?'' meaning &quot;please repeat or say again&quot;&amp;nbsp;— are also found in parts of the British Isles and Australia.

The term ''Canuck'' simply means ''Canadian'' in its [[demonym]]ic form, and, as a term used even by Canadians themselves, it is not considered derogatory. In the 19th century and early 20th century it tended to refer to French-Canadians, but [[Janey Canuck]] was used by Anglophone writer [[Emily Murphy]] in the 1920s and the ''[[Johnny Canuck]]'' comic book character of the 1940s. Throughout the 1970s, Canada's winning World Cup men's downhill ski team was called the &quot;[[Crazy Canucks]]&quot; for their fearlessness on the slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/skiing/topics/417/ |title=The Crazy Canucks: Canada's Heroes '&amp;#39;CBC Digital Archives'&amp;#39; Retrieved 27 Oct 2009 |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of [[Vancouver]]'s [[NHL]] [[Vancouver Canucks|team]].

The term ''[[hoser]]'', popularized by [[Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie]], typically refers to an uncouth, beer-swilling male. Bob &amp; Doug also popularised the use of ''Beauty, eh'', another western slang term which may be used in variety of ways. This describes something as being of interest, of note, signals approval or simply draws attention to it.

A ''Newf'' or ''Newfie'' is someone from Newfoundland and Labrador; sometimes considered derogatory.

In the Maritimes, a ''Caper'' or &quot;Cape Bretoner&quot; is someone from [[Cape Breton Island]], a ''Bluenoser'' is someone with a thick, usually southern Nova Scotia accent, while an ''Islander'' is someone from [[Prince Edward Island]] (the same term is used in [[British Columbia]] for people from [[Vancouver Island]], or the numerous islands along it). A ''Haligonian'' refers to someone from the city of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]].

===Miscellaneous Canadianisms===
* The code appended to mail addresses (the equivalent of the British [[postcode]] and the American [[ZIP code]]) is called a ''[[Canadian postal code|postal code]]''.
* The term ''[[First Nations]]'' is often used in Canada to refer to what are called American Indians or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the United States. This term does ''not'' include the [[Métis]] and [[Inuit]], however; the term [[aboriginal peoples]] (and sometimes spelled with a capital &quot;A&quot;: &quot;Aboriginal peoples&quot;) is preferred when all three groups are included. The term &quot;Eskimo&quot; has been replaced by the term [[Inuit]] in the past few decades. It is now considered offensive to use the term Eskimo, but is still used commonly (without pejorative intent) by those born in the early-mid-20th century.
* &quot;Going camping&quot; still refers to staying in a [[tent]] in a [[campground]] or wilderness area, while &quot;going out to camp&quot; may refer to a summer cottage or home in a rural area. &quot;Going to camp&quot; refers to children's [[summer camp]]s. In British Columbia, &quot;camp&quot; was used as a reference for certain company towns (for example, [[Bridge River, British Columbia|Bridge River]]). It is used in western Canada to refer to logging and mining camps such as [[Juskatla Camp]]. It is also is a synonym for a mining district; the latter occurs in names such as [[Camp McKinney]] and usages such as &quot;Cariboo gold camp&quot; and &quot;Slocan mining camp&quot; for the Cariboo goldfields and Slocan silver-galena mining district, respectively. A &quot;cottage&quot; in British Columbia is generally a small house, perhaps with an English design or flavour, while in southern Ontario it more likely means a [[Vacation property|second home]] on a lake. Similarly, &quot;chalet&quot; - originally a term for a small warming hut&amp;nbsp;— can mean a second home of any size, but refers to one located in a ski resort. Outside of southern Ontario and southern Quebec, these second homes tend to be called &quot;camps&quot;.
* A ''stagette'' is a female bachelorette party (US) or hen party (UK).
* A &quot;shag&quot; is thought to be derived from &quot;shower&quot; and &quot;stag&quot;, and describes a dance where alcohol, entry tickets and raffle tickets and so on. are sold to raise money for the engaged couple's wedding. Normally a Northwest Ontario, Northern Ontario and sometimes Manitoba term, A Stag and Doe or Buck and Doe is used elsewhere in Ontario. The more common term for this type of event in Manitoba is a &quot;social&quot;.
* The ''[[humidex]]'' is a measurement used by meteorologists to reflect the combined effect of heat and humidity.
* An ''[[expiry date]]'' is the term used for the date when a perishable product will go bad (similar to the UK ''Use by'' date). The term ''expiration date'' is more common in the United States (where ''expiry date'' is seen mostly on the packaging of Asian food products). The term &quot;Best Before' also sees common use, where although not spoiled, the product may not taste &quot;as good&quot;

'''Czech''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|k}}; ''čeština'' {{IPA-cs|ˈt͡ʃɛʃcɪna}}) is a [[West Slavic language]] with about 12 million native speakers; it is the majority language in the [[Czech Republic]] and spoken by [[Czech people|Czechs]] worldwide. The language was known as '''Bohemian''' in English until the late 19th century. Czech is similar to and [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and, to a considerably lesser extent, to [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]].

== Official status ==
Czech is widely spoken by most inhabitants of the [[Czech Republic]]. As given by appropriate laws, courts and authorities act and make out documents and executions in the Czech language (financial authorities also in the [[Slovak language]]). Czech can be used in all official proceedings also in [[Slovakia]] as granted by Article 6 of Slovak Minority Language Act 184/1999 Zb.

According to article 37, paragraph 4 of [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] people who do not speak Czech have the right to get an interpreter in a court of law. Instructions for use in Czech must be added to all marketed goods. Regarding knowledge of other languages in the Czech Republic, English and German are the most common foreign languages studied and used. Russian is also spoken, but to a much lesser extent than it was prior to the fall of Communism.

The right to one's own language is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]] for all national and ethnic minorities.

Czech is also one of the 23 official languages in the [[European Union]] (since May 2004).

== Mutual intelligibility ==
{{Main|Differences between Slovak and Czech languages}}
Speakers of Czech and Slovak usually understand both languages in their written and spoken form, thus constituting a [[pluricentric language]], though some dialects or heavily accented speech in either language might present difficulties to speakers of the other (in particular, Czech speakers may find Eastern Slovak dialects difficult to comprehend). Younger generations of Czechs living after the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in 1993 (therefore generally less familiar with Slovak) might also have some problems with a certain number of words and expressions which differ considerably in the two languages, and with [[false friends]]. Nevertheless, these differences do not impede [[mutual intelligibility]] significantly.

== Name ==
The name ''&quot;čeština&quot;'', Czech, is derived from a Slavic tribe of [[Czechs]] (&quot;Čech&quot;, pl. &quot;Češi&quot; or &quot;Čechové&quot; (archaic)) that inhabited Central Bohemia and united neighbouring Slavic tribes under the reign of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]] (&quot;Přemyslovci&quot;). According to a legend, it is derived from the [[Forefather Čech]], who brought the tribe of Czechs into its land. The variant English name &quot;Bohemian&quot; was used until the late 19th century, reflecting the original English name of the Czech state derived from the Celtic tribe of [[Boii]] who inhabited the area since the 4th century BCE.

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Czech language}}

The Czech language developed from the [[Proto-Slavic language]] at the close of the [[1st millennium]].

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Czech phonology}}

The [[phonology]] of Czech may seem unattractive to English speakers as some words do not have [[vowel]]s: ''zmrzl'' (frozen solid), ''ztvrdl'' (hardened), ''scvrkl'' (shrunk), ''čtvrthrst'' (quarter-handful), ''blb'' (fool), ''vlk'' (wolf), or ''smrt'' (death). A popular example of this is the phrase &quot;''[[strč prst skrz krk]]''&quot; meaning &quot;stick a finger through your throat&quot; or &quot;''Smrž pln skvrn zvlhl z mlh.''&quot; meaning &quot;''Morel full of spots was dampened by fogs''&quot;. The [[consonant]]s ''l'' and ''r'' can function as the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of a syllable in Czech, since they are [[sonorant]] consonants. A similar phenomenon also occurs in American English, where the reduced syllables at the ends of &quot;butter&quot; and &quot;bottle&quot; are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbʌɾ.ɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ˈbɒɾ.l]}}, with syllabic consonants as syllable nuclei. It also features the consonant ''ř'', a [[phoneme]] that is said to be unique to Czech.  To a foreign ear, it sounds very similar to [ʒ], though a better approximation could be rolled (trilled) [r] combined with [ʒ], which was incidentally sometimes used as an [[orthography]] for this sound (rž) for example in the royal charter of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1609. The phonetic description of the sound is a [[Alveolar trill#Raised alveolar non-sonorant trill|raised alveolar non-sonorant trill]] which can be either voiceless (terminally or next to a voiceless consonant) or voiced (elsewhere), the IPA transcription being [ {{Unicode|r̝}} ].

=== Vowels ===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Czech vowel chart.png|right]]
There are 10 [[vowel]]s in Czech which are regarded as individual [[phoneme]]s. There are 5 short and 5 long vowels.

'''Long vowels''' are indicated by an [[acute accent]] or a [[ring (diacritic)|ring]].

:{{IPA|/iː/}} is represented by letters ''í'' and ''ý''
:{{IPA|/uː/}} is represented by letters ''ú'' and ''ů''
:{{IPA|/ɛː/}} is represented by letter ''é''
:{{IPA|/aː/}} is represented by letter ''á''
:{{IPA|/oː/}} is represented by letter ''ó''

'''Short vowels'''

:{{IPA|/ɪ/}} is represented by letters ''i'' and ''y''
:{{IPA|/u/}} is represented by letter ''u''
:{{IPA|/ɛ/}} is represented by letters ''e'' and ''ě''
:{{IPA|/a/}} is represented by letter ''a''
:{{IPA|/o/}} is represented by letter ''o''


Note that ''[[ě]]'' is not a separate vowel. Analogous to ''y, ý'' and ''[[ů]]'', it is a [[grapheme]] kept for historical reasons (see [[Czech orthography]]).  ''ó'' exists only in loanwords.

{{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} (and sometimes also {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}) can be [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]], i.e. they can take the vowel's role as the nucleus of a [[syllable]], e.g. ''vlk'' (wolf).

=== Diphthongs ===
There are three [[diphthong]]s in Czech:

:{{IPA|/aʊ̯/}} represented by ''au'' (almost exclusively in words of foreign origin)
:{{IPA|/eʊ̯/}} represented by ''eu'' (in words of foreign origin only)
:{{IPA|/oʊ̯/}} represented by ''ou''

When these groups come together at morpheme boundaries, they do not form diphthongs in standard Czech; for instance ''naučit'', ''neučit'', ''poučit''  ({{IPA|[-au-, -eu-, -ou-]}} or {{IPA|[-aʔu-, -eʔu-, -oʔu-]}}).  In native Czech words, only ''ou'' exists as a diphthong. Vowel groups ''ia, ie, ii, io'', and  ''iu'' in foreign words are likewise not regarded as diphthongs; they may also be pronounced with {{IPA|/j/}} between the vowels {{IPA|[ɪja, ɪjɛ, ɪjɪ, ɪjo, ɪju]}}.

* {{IPA|/r̝/}} is a specific [[raised (phonetics)|raised]] alveolar non-sonorant trill which can be pronounced both voiced and voiceless (regarded as two allophones of one phoneme).

The [[consonant]]s in parentheses are regarded as [[allophone]]s of other consonants:

:{{IPA|[ŋ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} when preceding [[velar consonant]]s ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}).
:{{IPA|[g]}} is a voiced allophone of {{IPA|/k/}} when preceding a voiced consonant, except in loanwords
:{{IPA|[d͡z]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/t͡s/}} when preceding a voiced consonant

The [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, which appears as a separator between two vowels or word-initially before a vowel, is not considered a separate [[phoneme]] or an allophone of one.

:{{IPA|/ʃ/}} is represented by the letter ''[[š]]''
:{{IPA|/ʒ/}} is represented by the letter ''[[ž]]''
:{{IPA|/ɲ/}} is represented by the letter ''[[ň]]''
:{{IPA|/c/}} is represented by the letter ''[[ť]]''
:{{IPA|/ɟ/}} is represented by the letter ''[[ď]]''
:{{IPA|/ɦ/}} is represented by the letter ''[[h]]''
:{{IPA|/x/}} is represented by the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]''
:{{IPA|/ts/}} is represented by the letter ''[[c]]''
:{{IPA|/tʃ/}} is represented by the letter ''[[č]]''
:{{IPA|/dʒ/}} is represented by the digraph ''[[dž]]''
:{{IPA|/r̝/}} is represented by the letter ''[[ř]]''

The other consonants are represented by the same characters (letters) as in the [[help:IPA|IPA]].

(See also: [[Czech alphabet]])

=== Stress ===
The primary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is always fixed to the first [[syllable]] of a stressed unit, which is usually identical to a word. The exceptions are:
* Monosyllabic prepositions form a unit with following words (if the following word is not longer than three syllables). The stress is placed on the preposition: e.g. '''''Pra'''ha'' (Prague) → '''''do''' Prahy'' (to Prague).
* Some monosyllabic words (e.g. ''mi'' (me), ''ti'' ((to) you), ''to'' (it), ''se'', ''si'' (oneself), ''jsem'' (am), ''jsi'' (are)) are [[clitic]]s — they are not stressed and form a unit with preceding words. A clitic cannot be the first word in a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], because it requires a preceding word to form a unit with. Example: '''''Na'''psal jsem ti '''ten''' '''do'''pis'', I have written the letter to you.

Long words have secondary stress, which is usually placed on every [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] syllable after the primary stress, e.g. '''''nej'''krás&lt;u&gt;něj&lt;/u&gt;ší'' (the most beautiful).

Stress in Czech denotes boundaries between words, but does not distinguish word meanings. It also has no influence on the quality or quantity of vowels. Vowels are not reduced in unstressed syllables and both long and short vowels can occur in either stressed or unstressed syllables.

== Syntax and Morphology ==
As in most Slavic languages, many words (especially nouns, verbs and adjectives) have many forms ([[inflection]]s).  In this regard, Czech and the Slavic languages are closer to their [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origins than other languages in the same family that have lost much inflection. Moreover, in Czech the rules of morphology are extremely irregular and many forms have official, [[colloquial]] and sometimes semi-official variants.

=== Word order ===
The word order in Czech serves a similar function to sentence stress and articles in English. Often all the [[permutation]]s of words in a [[clause]] are possible. While the permutations mostly share the same meaning, they differ in the [[topic-focus articulation]].

For example: ''Češi udělali revoluci'' (The Czechs made a revolution), ''Revoluci udělali Češi'' (It was the Czechs who made the revolution), and ''Češi revoluci udělali'' (The Czechs did make a revolution). Usually the word order follows the pattern based on importance of the words expressed - from the least important to the most important. By saying ''Revoluci udělali Češi'' the speaker stresses that it were the Czechs and not, e.g. the Germans or Slovaks, who made a revolution. By saying ''Češi revoluci udělali'', the speaker stresses that the revolution has been done, this being far more important than that it was the Czechs who stood behind it. Combined with sentence voice melody, which is the same for each type of sentence - announcing, questioning and an imperative, and which marks the end of each sentence, one can easily understand the important context of what is said by just listening to the final word in each sentence.

=== Parts of speech ===
&lt;!-- give an English translation of each of these --&gt;

* [[Noun]] (''podstatné jméno'')
* [[Adjective]] (''přídavné jméno'')
* [[Pronoun]] (''zájmeno'')
* [[number names|Numeral]] (''číslovka'')
* [[Verb]] (''sloveso'')
* [[Adverb]] (''příslovce'')
* [[Preposition]] (''předložka'')
* [[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]] (''spojka'')
* [[Grammatical particle|Particle]] (''částice'')
* [[Interjection]] (''citoslovce'')

Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numbers are declined (7 cases over a number of declension models) and verbs are conjugated; the other parts of speech are not inflected (with the exception of comparative formation in adverbs).

In the Czech Republic two distinct variants or interdialects of spoken Czech can be found, both corresponding more or less to geographic areas within the country. The first, and most widely used, is &quot;[[Common Czech]]&quot;, spoken especially in [[Bohemia]]. It has some grammatical differences from &quot;standard&quot; Czech, along with some differences in pronunciation.  The most common pronunciation changes include ''-ý'' becoming ''-ej'' in some circumstances, ''-é'' becoming ''-ý-'' in some circumstances (''-ej-'' in others).  Also, noun declension is changed, most notably the instrumental case.  Instead of having various endings (depending on gender) in the instrumental, Bohemians will just put ''-ama'' or ''-ma'' at the end of all plural instrumental declensions. Currently, these forms are very common throughout the entire Czech republic, including [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]]. Also pronunciation changes slightly, as the Bohemians tend to have more open vowels than Moravians. This is said to be especially prevalent among people from Prague.

The second major variant is spoken in [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]]. Nowadays it is very close to the Bohemian form of Common Czech. This variant has some words different from its standard Czech equivalents. For example in [[hantec slang|the dialect spoken in Brno]], ''tramvaj'' (streetcar or tram) is ''šalina'' (originating from German &quot;ElektriSCHELINIE&quot;). Unlike in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia tend to have more local dialects varying from place to place, however just as in Bohemia, most have been already heavily influenced and mostly replaced by Common Czech. Everyday spoken form in Moravia and Silesia would be a mixture of remnants of old local dialect, some Standard Czech forms and especially Common Czech. The most notable difference is a shift in used prepositions and case of noun, for example ''k jídlu'' (to eat - dative) (as in German ''zum Essen'') becomes ''na jídlo'' (accusative), as it is in Slovak ''na jedlo''. It is a common misconception that the use of Standard Czech in everyday situations is more frequent than in Bohemia. The Standard Czech became standardized by the Czech national revivalists in the 19th century, based on an already three hundred year old translation of the Bible ([[Bible of Kralice]]) using an older variant of the then-current language (for example, preferring ''-ý-'' to ''-ej-''). These Standard forms are still common in spoken language both in Moravia and Silesia. Some Moravians and Silesians therefore tend to say that they use &quot;proper&quot; language, unlike their Bohemian compatriots.

A special case is the [[Cieszyn Silesian dialect]], spoken in [[Cieszyn Silesia]] (Těšínsko), which is a transitional dialect between the Czech and [[Polish language|Polish]] languages.

Some south Moravian dialects are also sometimes, although rarely, considered (also by Czech linguists in the 90's or later, e.g. Václav Machek in his &quot;Etymologický slovník jazyka českého&quot;, 1997, ISBN 80-7106-242-1, p.&amp;nbsp;8, who speaks about a &quot;Moravian-Slovak&quot; dialect from the region of Moravian &quot;Slovácko&quot;) to be actually dialects of the Slovak language, which has its roots in the Moravian empire when Slovaks and Moravians were one nation (without Bohemians) with one language. Those dialects still have the same suffixes (for inflected nouns and pronouns and for conjugated verbs) as Slovak.

The minor dialect spoken in the [[Plzeň Region]] and parts of Western Bohemia and in wester parts of former [[Prachens]] region differs, among other things, by intonation of questions: all the words except for the last word of a sentence have a high pitch. This is the reason why the people from Plzeň are said to be &quot;singing&quot;. Words that start questions are often given an additional &quot;-pa&quot;: &quot;Kolipa je hodin?&quot; (regular Czech: &quot;Kolik je hodin?&quot;; English: &quot;What time is it?&quot;). The words like &quot;this&quot; (regular Czech: &quot;tento/tato/toto&quot;) are often replaced by &quot;tuten/tuta/tuto&quot;); some examples: &quot;What is this?&quot;  is &quot;Copa to je?&quot; and &quot;What's happening?&quot; is &quot;Copa?&quot; instead of &quot;Co se stalo? / Co je to?&quot; or &quot;Why?&quot; is &quot;Pročpa?&quot; instead of &quot;Proč?&quot;.
The region of Chodsko is the home of a very special dialect of the [[Chodové|Chods]] people who were displaced in about the 10th century from Silesia owing to the protection of the western border of [[Bohemia]].

=== Declension ===
{{Main|Czech declension}}

Czechs typically refer to the noun cases by number and learn them by means of the question to which they are the answer. These numbers do not necessarily correspond to numbered cases in other languages (e.g., the [[Slovene language|Slovene]] locative and instrumental are known as the 5th and 6th cases). When learning a new word, Czech children recite the cases using a set of example phrases, shown as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|1. ||''kdo/co?'' (who/what?) ||[[nominative case|nominative]]
|-
|2. ||''bez koho/čeho?'' (without whom/what?) ||[[genitive case|genitive]]
|-
|3. ||''ke komu/čemu?'' (to whom/what?) ||[[dative case|dative]]
|-
|4. ||''vidíme koho/co?'' (We see whom/what?) ||[[accusative case|accusative]]
|-
|5. ||''oslovujeme/voláme'' (We address/call) ||[[vocative case|vocative]]
|-
|6. ||''o kom/čem?'' (about whom/what?) ||[[locative case|locative]]
|-
|7. ||''s kým/čím?'' (with whom/what?) ||[[instrumental case|instrumental]]
|}

The case used depends on a number of variables.

==== Prepositions with certain cases ====
The simplest of the rules governing noun declension is the use of [[prepositions]] (''předložky'').  Excepting expressions and common phrases, each preposition is matched with a certain noun declension case depending on use.  The following are basic examples of common prepositions and their corresponding noun cases (note: these examples represent only one circumstance.  Often each preposition can be used with two or more noun cases depending on the sentence).
* '''Genitive''': ''během'' (during), ''podle/dle'' (according to/along), ''vedle'' (beside), ''kolem'' (around), ''okolo'' (around), ''do'' (into), ''od(e)'' (away from), ''z(e)'' (out of/from), ''bez(e)'' (without), ''místo'' (instead of), ''u'' (at/by the).
* '''Dative''': ''k(e)'' (towards), ''proti'' (against), ''díky'' (thanks to), ''naproti'' (opposite).
* '''Accusative''': ''skrz(e)'' (through), ''pro'' (for), ''na'' (to/for).
* '''Locative''': ''o'' (around, about), ''na'' (on), ''při'' (into, in, around), ''v'' (in), ''po'' (after, around).
*'''Instrumental''': ''za'' (behind), ''před'' (in front of), ''mezi'' (between), ''pod(e)'' (below), ''s(e)'' (with), ''nad(e)'' (above).

Many of the above prepositions are used in different circumstances.  For instance, when motion or a change of position is expressed, prepositions of place such as ''nad'', ''mezi'', ''na'' and ''pod'' are used with the accusative case.

The second factor affecting noun declension is the verb used.  In Czech grammar, the accusative case serves as the direct [[object (grammar)|object]], and the dative case serves as the indirect object.  Some verbs require the genitive case to be used.  For example, the verb &quot;zeptat se&quot; (to ask) requires that the person being asked the question be in the genitive case (Zeptat se koho/čeho), and that the thing being asked about follow the preposition &quot;na&quot; and be in the accusative case (Zeptat se koho/čeho na koho/co).

==== Counting and declension ====
The third factor affecting noun declension is [[Grammatical number|number]].  Czech has a typical Slavic counting system, explained as follows with the example masculine animate [[noun]] ''muž'' (man):
* For the number one, the singular number is used: ''jeden muž''.
* For the numbers 2, 3, and 4, any case may be used, depending on the function of the noun in the sentence: ''dva muži'' (nominative).  &quot;Vidím dva muže&quot; (accusative).
* For all numbers from 5 on, the genitive plural is used when the noun would normally be in the nominative, accusative or vocative case: ''pět mužů''.  &quot;Pět mužů je tam.&quot;  Five men are over there.  &quot;Vidím pět mužů.&quot;  I see five men.  For other cases, however, the noun is not placed in the genitive. &quot;Nad pěti muži.&quot;  Above the five men (instrumental).

The example above shows colloquial use. In literary use, there is an additional rule: The above system is based only on the last word of the number. Thus a number like 101 uses the singular (''sto jeden muž'') and 102 uses the ordinary plural (''sto dva muži''). For numbers that can be read in two ways, such as 21, the grammar may depend on which one is chosen (''dvacet jeden muž'' or ''jednadvacet mužů'').  This system is becoming less common and is not used in everyday speech, as well as becoming harder to find in modern literature.

'''Numbers''' have declension patterns in Czech.  The number two, for instance, declines as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Nominative ||dva/dvě
|-
|Genitive ||dvou
|-
|Dative ||dvěma
|-
|Accusative ||dva/dvě
|-
|Vocative ||dva/dvě
|-
||Locative ||(o) dvou
|-
|Instrumental ||dvěma
|}

The numbers are singular (''jednotné číslo''), plural (''množné číslo''), and remains of [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]].  The number two, as declined above, is an example of the now-diminished dual number.  The dual number is only used for certain parts of the human body: hands, shoulders, eyes, ears, knees, legs, and breasts.  In all but two of the above body parts (eyes and ears) the dual number is only vestigial and affects very few aspects of declension (mostly the genitive and prepositional cases).  However, in Common Czech this dual ending of the instrumental case is used as the regular instrumental plural form, for example, ''s kluky'' (with the boys) becomes ''s klukama'', and so on for all nouns.

==== Gender ====
The three [[grammatical gender|genders]] are masculine, feminine, and neuter, with masculine further subdivided into animate and inanimate. Words for individuals with biological gender usually have the corresponding grammatical gender, with only a few exceptions; similarly, among the masculine nouns, the distinction between animate and inanimate also follows meaning. Other words have arbitrary grammatical genders. Thus, for instance, ''pes'' (dog) is masculine animate, ''stůl'' (table) is masculine inanimate, ''kočka'' (cat) and ''židle'' (chair) are feminine, and ''morče'' (guinea-pig) and ''světlo'' (light) are neuter.

=== Verb tenses ===
{{Main|Czech verb}}
Compared to [[English language|English]] or [[Romance languages]], Czech has a rather simple set of tenses.  They are [[present tense|present]], [[past]], and [[future]].

Past is used in almost all instances of past action, and replaces every past tense in English (past simple, past perfect and in some cases the present perfect).  The past tense is usually formed by affixing an -l- on the end of the verb, sometimes with a minor (rarely significant) stem change.  After adding the -l-, letters are added in order to agree with the subject (-a for feminine, -o for neuter, -i, -y or -a for plural).

The present tense is also used to describe ongoing actions which continue to the present, where in English a present perfect would be used, for instance,  &quot;I've been doing this for three hours&quot;.  In Czech, as there is no present perfect, the present indicative is used and is directly translated as &quot;I do this for three hours&quot;. However, when the present perfect is used to denote past actions without a time reference (e.g. &quot;I've been to Italy three times&quot;), the past tense would be used.

There are also sometimes second forms of certain verbs (such as &quot;to go&quot;, &quot;to do&quot;) that indicate a habitual or repeated action.  These are known as iterative forms.  For instance, the verb ''jít'' (&quot;to go by foot&quot;) has the iterative form ''chodit'' (&quot;to go regularly&quot;).

There is also no tense shifting, as in reported speech, for example in the sentence &quot;he said he loved her&quot;, reporting &quot;he loves her&quot;, the tense of the verb is shifted from present to past. In Czech it is &quot;Má ji rád&quot; -&gt; &quot;Řekl, že ji má rád&quot;. The &quot;má rád&quot; remains in the present tense in both cases.

The future tense is another fickle part of Czech grammar. Verbs in Czech can be divided into two [[grammatical aspect|aspects]], one expressing an ongoing action ([[imperfective aspect]]) and one expressing the outcome of an action ([[perfective aspect]]). Most verbs have different counterparts in each aspect which form pairs. Perfective verbs can only express an action that is already completed (past) or one that is yet to be completed (future), but the latter is expressed in Czech using the present tense.  Thus, the future tense (e.g. ''budu psát'' for ''psát'', to write) can only be used for imperfective verbs; however, the present tense of ''napsat'' (perfective counterpart of ''psát'') also indicates a future action.

Aspectual pairs are in general of two kinds:
* the perfective is obtained by prefixing the imperfective with a preposition, for example ''psát'' becomes ''napsat'';
* the forms differ in the endings, for example ''dát'' (perfective) becomes ''dávat'' (imperfective) or ''koupit'' (perfective) becomes ''kupovat'' (imperfective);

Czech also makes heavy use of prepositional prefixes to modify the precise meaning to the verb.  For example, ''podepsat'' is a prefixed form of the verb ''psát'' meaning ''to sign'' (literally ''to write under'').  Analogously to the first case above, the addition of such prefixes almost always changes the [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] of the verb to the [[perfective aspect]].  In this case, a modified imperfective form ''podepisovat'' forms a pair with ''podepsat''.

:''For the leaf bug, see [[Miridae]].''

A '''capsid''' is the protein shell of a [[virus (biology)|virus]]. It consists of several [[oligomer]]ic structural subunits made of [[protein]] called [[protomer]]s. The observable 3-dimensional morphological subunits, which may or may not correspond to individual proteins, are called [[capsomere]]s.  The capsid encloses the [[genetic material]] of the virus.

Capsids are broadly classified according to their structure.  The majority of viruses have capsids with either [[helical]] or [[icosahedral]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lidmar J, Mirny L, Nelson, DR| title=Virus shapes and buckling transitions in spherical shells | journal = [[Phys. Rev.

Some viruses, such as [[bacteriophages]], have developed more complicated structures due to constraints of elasticity and electrostatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Vernizzi G, Sknepnek R, Olvera de la Cruz M| title=Platonic and Archimedean geometries in multi-component elastic membranes | journal = [[Proc.

For example, the [[foot-and-mouth disease]] virus capsid has faces consisting of three proteins named VP1–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web-books.com/MoBio/Free/Ch1E1.htm|title=Virus Structure (web-books.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Adenovirus.jpg|thumb|left|Icosahedral capsid of an [[Adenoviridae|Adenovirus]]]]

Some viruses are ''enveloped'', meaning that the capsid is coated with a lipid membrane known as the ''[[viral envelope]]''.  The envelope is acquired by the capsid from an intracellular membrane in the virus' host; some examples would include the inner nuclear membrane, the [[golgi]] membrane, and the cell's outer [[cell membrane|membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|edition=4|pages=280|author=Alberts, Bruce; Bray, Dennis; Lewis, Julian; Raff, Martin; Roberts, Keith; [[James D. Watson|Watson, James D.]]|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the virus has infected the cell, it will start replicating itself, using the mechanisms of the infected host cell. During this process, new capsid subunits are synthesized according to the genetic material of the virus, using the [[protein biosynthesis]] mechanism of the cell.  During the assembly process, a '''portal''' subunit is assembled at one vertex of the capsid.  Through this portal, viral [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] is transported into the capsid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16051846&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Involvement of the portal at an early step in herpes simplex virus capsid assembly|author=Newcomb WW, Homa FL, Brown JC|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=79|issue=16|year=2005 | month=August|pmid=16051846|pages=10540–6|doi=10.1128/JVI.79.16.10540-10546.2005|pmc=1182615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure and assembly of the [[herpes]] virus capsid portal protein has been imaged via [[cryo-electron microscopy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17188319&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Visualization of the herpes simplex virus portal in situ by cryo-electron tomography|author=Cardone G, Winkler DC, Trus BL, Cheng N, Heuser JE, Newcomb WW, Brown JC, Steven AC|journal=Virology|date=2007-05-10|volume=361|issue=2|pmid=17188319|pages=426–34|doi=10.1016/j.virol.2006.10.047|pmc=1930166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this capsid or protein shell that makes protective vaccines a possibility. Structural analyses of major capsid protein (MCP) architectures have been used to categorise viruses into families. For example, the bacteriophage PRD1, Paramecium bursaria Chlorella algal virus, and mammalian [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] have been placed in the same family.&lt;ref&gt;Khayat et al. classified Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) and Laurinmäki et al. classified bacteriophage Bam35  – Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 3669 (2006); 102, 18944 (2005); Structure 13, 1819 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== T-number ==

[[Image:Virus capsid T number.tif|thumb|right|Virus capsid T-numbers]]

Icosahedral virus capsids are typically assigned a T-number to describe the relation between the number of [[pentagons]] and [[hexagons]] ''i.e.'' their quasi-symmetry in the capsid shell. The T-number idea was originally developed to explain the quasi-symmetry by Caspar and Klug in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Caspar, D. L. D. and Klug, A. |year=1962 |title=Physical Principles in the Construction of Regular Viruses |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. |volume=27 |pages=1–24 |PMID=14019094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a purely [[icosahedral]] virus has a T-number of 1 (usually written, T=1) and a [[truncated icosahedron]] is assigned T=3. The T-number is calculated by (1) applying a grid to the surface of the virus with coordinates ''h'' and ''k'', (2) counting the number of steps between successive pentagons on the virus surface, (3) applying the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;T = h^2 + h \cdot k + k^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h \ge k&lt;/math&gt; and ''h'' and ''k'' are the distances between the successive pentagons on the virus surface for each axis (see figure on right). The larger the T-number the more hexagons are present relative to the pentagons.&lt;ref&gt;Mannige RV, Brooks CL III, 2010 &quot;Periodic Table of Virus Capsids: Implications for Natural Selection and Design.&quot; PLoS ONE 5(3): e9423. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0009423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://viperdb.scripps.edu/virus.php |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |title=T-number index |work=[http://viperdb.scripps.edu/ VIPERdb] |publisher=[[The Scripps Research Institute]] |location=[[La Jolla, CA]] |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T-numbers can be represented in different ways, for example T=1 can only be  represented as a [[Icosahedron]] or a [[Dodecahedron]] and, depending on the type of quasi-symmetry, T=3 can be presented as a [[Truncated_dodecahedron]], an [[Icosidodecahedron]], or a [[Truncated icosahedron]] and their respective duals a [[Triakis icosahedron]], a [[Rhombic triacontahedron]], or a [[Pentakis dodecahedron]].

'''Chloramphenicol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[bacteriostatic]] [[antimicrobial]]. It is considered a prototypical [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]], alongside the [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]]s. 

Chloramphenicol is effective against a wide variety of [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] [[bacteria]], including most [[anaerobic organism]]s. Due to resistance and safety concerns, it is no longer a [[first-line agent]] for any indication in developed nations, although it is sometimes used topically for [[conjunctivitis|eye infections]]. Nevertheless, the global problem of advancing bacterial resistance to newer drugs has led to renewed interest in its use.&lt;ref name=Falagas&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falagas ME, Grammatikos AP, Michalopoulos A |title=Potential of old-generation antibiotics to address current need for new antibiotics |journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=593–600 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18847400 |doi=10.1586/14787210.6.5.593 |url=http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14787210.6.5.593?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In low-income countries, chloramphenicol is still widely used because it is inexpensive and readily available.

The most serious [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effect]] associated with chloramphenicol treatment is [[bone marrow]] toxicity, which may occur in two distinct forms: [[bone marrow suppression]], which is a direct toxic effect of the drug and is usually reversible, and [[aplastic anemia]], which is [[idiosyncratic drug reaction|idiosyncratic]] (rare, unpredictable, and unrelated to dose) and generally fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich1950&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rich M, Ritterhoff R, Hoffmann R | title = A fatal case of aplastic anemia following chloramphenicol (chloromycetin) therapy. | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 1459–67 | year = 1950 | month=December | pmid = 14790529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectrum of activity==
Because it functions by inhibiting bacterial [[protein]] synthesis, chloramphenicol has a very broad spectrum of activity: it is active against [[Gram-positive]] bacteria (including most strains of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), [[Gram-negative]] bacteria and [[anaerobes]].&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book | author = Neu HC, Gootz TD | chapter = Antimicrobial Chemotherapy:Antimicrobial Inhibitors of Ribosome Function | title = Baron's Medical Microbiology  |editor=Baron S,''et al.'' | edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.688  |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not active against ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', [[Chlamydiae]], or ''[[Enterobacter]]'' species.  It has some activity against ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', but is no longer routinely used to treat infections caused by this organism (it has been superseded by [[ceftazidime]] and [[meropenem]]).  In the West, chloramphenicol is mostly restricted to topical uses because of the worries about the risk of [[aplastic anaemia]].

==Therapeutic uses==
The original indication of chloramphenicol was in the treatment of [[typhoid]], but the now almost universal presence of multiple drug-resistant ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'' has meant it is seldom used for this indication except when the organism is known to be sensitive.  Chloramphenicol may be used as a second-line agent in the treatment of [[tetracycline]]-resistant [[cholera]]. 

Because of its excellent [[blood brain barrier|BBB]] penetration (far superior to any of the [[cephalosporins]]), chloramphenicol remains the first choice treatment for [[Staphylococcus aureus|staphylococcal]] [[brain abscess]]es.  It is also useful in the treatment of brain abscesses due to mixed organisms or when the causative organism is not known.

Chloramphenicol is active against the three main bacterial causes of [[meningitis]]: ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.  In the West, chloramphenicol remains the drug of choice in the treatment of meningitis in patients with severe [[penicillin]] or [[cephalosporin]] allergy and [[General Practitioner|GP]]s are recommended to carry intravenous chloramphenicol in their bag.  In low income countries, the WHO recommend that oily chloramphenicol be used first-line to treat [[meningitis]].

Chloramphenicol has been used in the U.S. in the initial [[empirical treatment]] of children with fever and a [[petechial rash]], when the [[differential diagnosis]] includes both ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' [[septicaemia]] as well as [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], pending the results of diagnostic investigations.

Chloramphenicol is also effective against ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'', which has led to it being considered for treatment of [[vancomycin-resistant enterococcus]].

Although unpublished, recent research suggests chloramphenicol could also be applied to frogs to prevent their widespread destruction from fungal infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kim Griggs |title=Frog killer fungus 'breakthrough' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7067613.stm |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chloramphenicol has recently been discovered to be a life-saving cure for [[chytridiomycosis]] in [[amphibians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzfrogs.org/site/nzfrog/files/poulter.pdf Chloramphenicol cures chytridiomycosis] R. T. M. Poulter, J. N. Busby, P. J. Bishop, M. I. Butler, R. Speare, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7067613.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease, blamed for the extinction of one-third of the 120 frog species lost since 1980.

==Adverse effects==
===Aplastic anemia===

The most serious [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of chloramphenicol treatment is [[aplastic anaemia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich1950&quot;/&gt;  This effect is rare and is generally fatal:  there is no treatment and no way of predicting who may or may not get this side effect.  The effect usually occurs weeks or months after chloramphenicol treatment has been stopped, and there may be a genetic predisposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM196907032810102 | author = Nagao T, Mauer A | title = Concordance for drug-induced aplastic anemia in identical twins. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 281 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–11 | year = 1969 |pmid = 5785754|month =Jul 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not known whether monitoring the [[blood count]]s of patients can prevent the development of aplastic anaemia, but patients are recommended to have a blood count check twice weekly while on treatment.  The highest risk is with oral chloramphenicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holt R | journal=Lancet | title=The bacterial degradation of chloramphenicol | year=1967 | volume=i | pages=1259 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(67)92720-1 | pmid=4165044}}&lt;/ref&gt; (affecting 1 in 24,000–40,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wallerstein R, Condit P, Kasper C, Brown J, Morrison F | title = Statewide study of chloramphenicol therapy and fatal aplastic anemia. | journal = JAMA | volume = 208 | issue = 11 | pages = 2045–50 | year = 1969 | month=Jun 16 | pmid = 5818983 | doi = 10.1001/jama.208.11.2045}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lowest risk occurs with eye drops (affecting less than 1 in 224,716 prescriptions).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancaster1998&quot;/&gt;

[[Thiamphenicol]], a related compound with a similar spectrum of activity, is available in Italy and China for human use, and has never been associated with aplastic anaemia {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.  Thiamphenicol is available in the U.S. and Europe as a [[veterinary]] antibiotic, and is not approved for use in humans.

===Bone marrow suppression===
Chloramphenicol commomly causes [[bone marrow suppression]] during treatment; this is a direct toxic effect of the drug on human [[mitochondria]].  This effect manifests first as a fall in [[hemoglobin]] levels, occurs quite predictably once a cumulative dose of 20&amp;nbsp;g has been given, is fully reversible once the drug is stopped, and does not predict future development of aplastic anaemia.

===Leukemia===
There is an increased risk of childhood [[leukemia]], as demonstrated in a Chinese [[case-controlled study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shu X, Gao Y, Linet M, Brinton L, Gao R, Jin F, Fraumeni J | title = Chloramphenicol use and childhood leukaemia in Shanghai. | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8565 | pages = 934–7 | year = 1987 | month=Oct 24 | pmid = 2889862 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(87)91420-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the risk increases with length of treatment.

'''Possible Related Adverse Effects'''

Chloramphenicol is particularly toxic to people sensitive to benzene-based preservatives, such as preservatives 210 and 211.
Chloramphenicol poisoning can cause sensitivity reactions to organic acids and salicylates.   
It is also known to cause [[tinnitus]] and balance problems through inner ear damage. 
It also causes [[folic acid]] depletion, resulting in adverse effects to the thyroid, pituitary and prostate through effects on PABA levels. There may also be links to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) through folic acid &quot;depletion&quot; and resultant high levels of folic acid in the mutant lymphocytes that characterize CLL. Chloramphenicol stops the body's production of vitamin D and [[pregnenolone]]. This results in major hormone depletion, including DHEA and testosterone, that can result in death and also lowers the body's resistance to viral infection.
Chloramphenicol can cause testes pain, possibly through hormone effects. 
Chinese research showed chloramphenicol affects motor neurones. It also affects insulin Igf1 levels and glutamate levels. Both conditions are considered indicative of a type of motor neurone disease. The adverse genetic effects of chloramphenicol are considered heritable.

===Gray baby syndrome===
Intravenous chloramphenicol use has been associated with the so-called [[gray baby syndrome]].&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name=McIntyre_2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = McIntyre J, Choonara I | title = Drug toxicity in the neonate. | journal = Biol Neonate | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15249753 | doi = 10.1159/000079656}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This phenomenon occurs in newborn infants because they do not yet have fully functional liver enzymes (i.e. UDP-glucuronyl transferase), so chloramphenicol remains unmetabolized in the body.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name=Piñeiro-Carrero_2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piñeiro-Carrero V, Piñeiro E | title = Liver. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = 1097–106 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15060205}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This causes several adverse effects, including [[hypotension]] and [[cyanosis]]. The condition can be prevented by using the drug at the recommended doses, and monitoring blood levels.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Feder H | title = Chloramphenicol: what we have learned in the last decade. | journal = South Med J | volume = 79 | issue = 9 | pages = 1129–34 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3529436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

==Pharmacokinetics==
Chloramphenicol is extremely lipid soluble; it remains relatively [[plasma protein binding|unbound to protein]] and is a small molecule. It has a large apparent [[volume of distribution]] of 100 litres, and penetrates effectively into all tissues of the body, including the brain.  The concentration achieved in brain and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) is around 30 to 50%, even when the meninges are not inflamed; this increases to as high as 89% when the meninges are inflamed.

Chloramphenicol increases the absorption of [[Human iron metabolism|iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Pill Book, The |title= Iron Supplements |pages= 593–596 |editor= Harold M. Silverman, Pharm.D. (editor-in-chief) |publisher= Bantam Dell |location= New York |edition= 12th revised ed. |id= ISBN 978-0-553-58892-7 |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in special populations===
Chloramphenicol is metabolized by the liver to chloramphenicol [[glucuronic acid|glucuronate]] (which is inactive).  In liver impairment, the dose of chloramphenicol must therefore be reduced.  There is no standard dose reduction for chloramphenicol in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations.  

The majority of the chloramphenicol dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, chloramphenicol glucuronate.  Only a tiny fraction of the chloramphenicol is excreted by the kidneys unchanged.  Plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory.  Chloramphenicol succinate ester (the inactive intravenous form of the drug) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than chloramphenicol base, and this is the major reason why levels of chloramphenicol in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Chloramphenicol passes into [[breast milk]], so should therefore be avoided during breast feeding, if possible.&lt;ref name=kidsgrowth&gt;[http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 kidsgrowth.org --&gt; Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk] Retrieved on June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dose monitoring===
[[Blood plasma|Plasma]] levels of chloramphenicol must be monitored in neonates and in patients with abnormal liver function.  Plasma levels should be monitored in all children under the age of four, the elderly and patients with renal failure.
Peak levels (one hour after the dose is given) should be 15–25&amp;nbsp;[[Wiktionary:milligram|mg]]/[[Wiktionary:litre|l]]; trough levels (taken immediately before a dose) should be less than 15&amp;nbsp;mg/l.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Drug interactions===
Administration of chloramphenicol concomitantly with [[bone marrow depressant]] drugs is contraindicated, although concerns over aplastic anaemia associated with ocular chloramphenicol have largely been discounted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/otcchlorampheneyedropsguid.pdf PRACTICE GUIDANCE: OTC CHLORAMPHENICOL EYE DROPS] June 2005.

==Mechanism of action==

Chloramphenicol is [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]] (that is, it stops bacterial growth). It is a [[protein synthesis inhibitor]] (more specifically inhibiting [[protein synthesis|protein chain elongation]]), causing inhibition of [[peptidyl transferase]] activity of the bacterial [[ribosome]], binding to A2451 and A2452 residues in the [[23S ribosomal RNA|23S rRNA]] of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing peptide bond formation.&lt;ref&gt;http://merck.com/mmpe/sec14/ch170/ch170d.html&lt;/ref&gt; While chloramphenicol and the [[macrolide]] class of antibiotics both interact with  ribosomes, chloramphenicol is not a macrolide.  It directly interferes with substrate binding; macrolides sterically block the progression of the growing peptide.

==Resistance==

There are three mechanisms of [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to chloramphenicol: reduced membrane permeability, mutation of the 50S ribosomal subunit and elaboration of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.  It is easy to select for reduced membrane permeability to chloramphenicol ''in vitro'' by serial passage of bacteria, and this is the most common mechanism of low-level chloramphenicol resistance.  High-level resistance is conferred by the ''cat''-gene; this [[gene]] codes for an [[enzyme]] called [[chloramphenicol acetyltransferase]] which inactivates chloramphenicol by covalently linking one or two [[acetyl]] groups, derived from acetyl-S-coenzyme A, to the [[hydroxyl]] groups on the chloramphenicol molecule. The acetylation prevents chloramphenicol from binding to the ribosome.  Resistance-conferring mutations of the 50S ribosomal subunit are rare.

Chloramphenicol resistance may be carried on a plasmid that also codes for resistance to other drugs.  One example is the [[ACCoT]] plasmid (A=[[ampicillin]], C=chloramphenicol, Co=[[co-trimoxazole]], T=[[tetracycline]]) which mediates multiple drug resistance in typhoid (also called [[R factors]]).

==Formulations==
Chloramphenicol is available as 250&amp;nbsp;mg capsules or as a liquid (125&amp;nbsp;[[Wiktionary:milligram|mg]]/5&amp;nbsp;[[Wiktionary:millilitre|ml]]).  In some countries, it is sold as chloramphenicol [[palmitate]] [[ester]] (CPE).  CPE is inactive, and is [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] to active chloramphenicol in the [[small intestine]].  There is no difference in [[bioavailability]] between chloramphenicol and CPE.

The [[Wiktionary:intravenous|intravenous]] (IV) preparation of chloramphenicol is the [[succinate]] [[ester]], because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water.  This creates a problem: chloramphenicol succinate ester is an inactive [[prodrug]] and must first be hydrolysed to chloramphenicol; the hydrolysis process is incomplete, and 30% of the dose is lost unchanged in the urine; therefore, serum concentrations of IV chloramphenicol are only 70% of those achieved when chloramphenicol is given orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Glazko AJ, Dill WA, Kinkel AW | title=Absorption and excretion of parenteral doses of chloramphenicol sodium succinate in comparison with per oral doses of chloramphenicol (abstract) | journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther | year=1977 | volume=21 | pages=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, the dose needs to be increased to 75&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day when administered IV to achieve levels equivalent to the oral dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bhutta Z, Niazi S, Suria A | title = Chloramphenicol clearance in typhoid fever: implications for therapy. | journal = Indian J Pediatr | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–9 | year =1992 | month=Mar-Apr | pmid = 1398851 | doi = 10.1007/BF02759987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oral route is therefore preferred to the intravenous route.

Manufacture of oral chloramphenicol in the U.S. stopped in 1991, because the vast majority of chloramphenicol-associated cases of aplastic anaemia are associated with the oral preparation.  There is now no oral formulation of chloramphenicol available in the U.S.

===Oily===
Dose: 100&amp;nbsp;[[Wiktionary:milligram|mg]]/[[Wiktionary:kilogram|kg]] (maximum dose 3&amp;nbsp;[[Wiktionary:gram|g]]) as a single intramuscular injection.  The dose is repeated if there is no clinical response after 48 hours.  A single injection costs approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]5.

Oily chloramphenicol (or chloramphenicol oil suspension) is a long-acting preparation of chloramphenicol first introduced by Roussel in 1954; marketed as Tifomycine, it was originally used as a treatment for [[typhoid]].  Roussel stopped production of oily chloramphenicol in 1995; the [[International Dispensary Association]] has manufactured it since 1998, first in [[Malta]] and then in [[India]] from December 2004.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  

Oily chloramphenicol is recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as the first-line treatment of [[meningitis]] in low-income countries, and appears on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|WHO essential drugs list]].  It was first used to treat meningitis in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rey M, Ouedraogo L, Saliou P, Perino L | title=Traitement minute de la méningite  cérébrospinale épidémique par injection intramusculaire unique de  chloramphénicol (suspension huileuse) | journal=Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses | year=1976 | volume=6 | pages=120–24 | doi=10.1016/S0399-077X(76)80134-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous studies since have demonstrated its efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wali S, Macfarlane J, Weir W, Cleland P, Ball P, Hassan-King M, Whittle H, Greenwood B | title = Single injection treatment of meningococcal meningitis. 2.

It has the great advantage of requiring only a single injection, whereas ceftriaxone is traditionally given daily for five days.  This recommendation may yet change now that a single dose of ceftriaxone (cost US$3) has been shown to be equivalent to one dose of oily chloramphenicol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ceftriaxone as effective as long-acting chloramphenicol in short-course treatment of meningococcal meningitis during epidemics: a randomised non-inferiority study | journal=Lancet | author=Nathan N, Borel T, Djibo A | year=2005 | volume=366 | issue=9482 | pages=308–13 | pmid=16039333 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66792-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oily chloramphenicol is not currently available in the U.S. or Europe.

===Eye drops===
In [[Western World|the West]], chloramphenicol is still widely used in topical preparations ([[ointment]]s and [[eye drop]]s) for the treatment of bacterial [[conjunctivitis]].  Isolated case reports of [[aplastic anaemia]] following use of chloramphenicol eyedrops exist, but the risk is estimated to be less than 1 in 224,716 prescriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancaster1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lancaster T, Stewart AM, Jick H | title=Risk of serious haematological toxicity with use of chloramphenicol eye drops in a British general practice database | journal=Brit Med J | year=1998 | volume=316 | pages=667 | pmid=9522792 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/316/7132/667 | issue=7132 | pmc=28473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40025037/ suggests the link between chloramphenicol eye drops and aplastic anemia is &quot;not well founded&quot;.  In [[Mexico]], this is the treatment used prophylactically in newborns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|the decorative art|decoupage}}
The '''cut-up technique''' is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a [[Writing|text]] is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. Most commonly, cut-ups are used to offer a [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] alternative to traditional reading and writing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} 

The concept can be traced to at least the [[Dadaists]] of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer [[William S. Burroughs]], and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

==Technique==
The cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:

*''Cut-up'' is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text.
*''Fold-in'' is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page.

==History in literature==
A precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which [[Tristan Tzara]] offered to create a [[poem]] on the spot by pulling words at [[random]] from a hat. [[Collage]], which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 with in the poem by Tzara, ''dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love'' under the sub-title, ''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Burroughs cited [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) and [[John Dos Passos]]' [[U.S.A. trilogy]], which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized. 

[[Gil J. Wolman]] developed cut-up techniques as part of his [[lettrism|lettrist]] practice in the early 1950s. 

Also in the 1950s, painter and writer [[Brion Gysin]]  more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a [[razor blade]]. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposition]]s of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book ''Minutes to Go'' resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet [[Sinclair Beiles]] also used this technique and co-authored ''Minutes To Go''. 

Gysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the [[Beat Hotel]]. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and [[audio recording]]s in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, [[Hypothesis|hypothesizing]] that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text.  Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of [[divination]] saying, &quot;When you cut into the present the future leaks out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r541727|pure_url=yes}} Break Through in Grey Room]&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs also further developed the &quot;fold-in&quot; technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published ''[[The Third Mind]]'', a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Apart from this publication, at the time, another important outlet for, the then radical technique, was Jeff Nuttall's publications entitled &quot;[[My Own Mag]]&quot;

Argentine writer [[Julio Cortázar]] often used cut ups in his 1963 novel ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Hopscotch]]''.

Since the 1990s, [[Jeff Noon]] uses a similar ''remixing'' technique in his writing based on practices prevalent in [[Dub music]]. He expanded upon this with his Cobralingus system, which breaks down a piece of writing, going as far as turning individual words into anagrams, then melding the results into a narrative.

==Musical influence==
From the early 1970s, [[David Bowie]] has used cut-ups to create some of his lyrics. This technique influenced [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;See the notes for ''[[The &quot;Priest&quot; They Called Him]]'', a 1993 collaboration between Burroughs and Cobain, released by Tim/Kerr records.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thom Yorke]] applied a similar method in [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs.

Burroughs taught the cut-up technique to musician [[Genesis P-Orridge]] in 1971 as a method for &quot;altering reality&quot;. His explanation was that everything is recorded, and if it is recorded, then it can be edited (P-Orridge, 2003)&lt;!-- This needs to be properly sourced. --&gt;.

[[Stephen Mallinder]] of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] reported to ''[[Inpress]]'' magazine's [[Andrez Bergen]] that &quot;I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days - the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating tape loops and all that - has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vintage Cab Sav,&quot; Andrez Bergen. ''[[Inpress]]'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cretinism''' is a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth due to untreated [[congenital disorder|congenital]] deficiency of [[thyroid]] [[hormone]]s ([[congenital hypothyroidism]]) usually due to maternal [[hypothyroidism]].

==Etymology and use of ''cretin''==
The term ''cretin'' is a medical term which describes a person so affected with the condition, but, as with words such as ''[[spastic]]'' and ''[[lunatic]]'', it can also have a vulgar connotation and can be used disparagingly. ''Cretin'' became a medical term in the 18th century, from an [[Alps|Alpine]] [[French language|French]] dialect; it saw wide medical use in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and then spread more widely in popular English as a markedly derogatory term for a person who behaves stupidly. Because of its pejorative connotations in popular speech, health-care workers have mostly abandoned ''cretin''. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Other speculative etymologies have been offered:
*From ''creta'', Latin for ''chalk'', because of the pallor of those affected.
*From &quot;Crete&quot;, where iodine insufficiency (Hypothyroidism) was common prior to the modern era.[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=20497295]
*From ''cretira'', Grisson-Romance ''creature'', from Latin ''creatus''.
*From ''cretine'', French for ''alluvium'' (soil deposited by flowing water), an allusion to the affliction's suspected origin in inadequate soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = VC | last = Medvei | title = The History of Clinical Endocrinology | location = Pearl River, New York | publisher = Parthenon Publishing Group | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*From &quot;chretien,&quot; French for &quot;Christian&quot; or &quot;Christlike,&quot; because those affected were so mentally handicapped that they were considered incapable of sinning &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Robbins and Cotran - Pathologic basis of disease 8/E | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Sauders Elsevier | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sporadic cretinism due to congenital hypothyroidism==
[[Congenital hypothyroidism]] can be endemic, genetic, or sporadic. If untreated, it results in mild to severe impairment of both physical and mental growth and development.

Poor length growth is apparent as early as the first year of life. Adult stature without treatment ranges from 1 to 1.6 metres (3'4 to 5'3), depending on severity, sex and other genetic factors. [[Bone maturation]] and [[puberty]] are severely delayed. [[Ovulation]] is impeded and [[infertility]] is common.

Neurological impairment may be mild, with reduced muscle tone and coordination, or so severe that the person cannot stand or walk. Cognitive impairment may also range from mild to so severe that the person is nonverbal and dependent on others for basic care. Thought and reflexes are slower.

Other signs may include thickened skin, enlarged tongue, or a protruding abdomen. 

Sporadic and genetic cretinism results from abnormal development or function of the foetal thyroid gland. This type of cretinism has been almost completely eliminated in developed countries by early diagnosis by [[newborn screening]] schemes followed by life long treatment with [[thyroxine]] (T4).

Cretinism arises from a diet deficient in [[iodine]]. It has affected many people worldwide and continues to be a major [[public health]] problem in many countries. Iodine is an essential trace element, necessary primarily for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency is the most common preventable cause of brain damage worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chen |first= Zu-Pei |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date= |year= 2010 |month= February |title= Cretinism Revisited |journal= Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume= 24 |issue= 1|page= |pages= 39–50|at= |publisher= |location= |issn= |pmid= 20172469|pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.beem.2009.08.014

The soils of many inland areas on all continents are iodine deficient, and plants and animals grown there are correspondingly deficient.

Iodine deficiency results in the impairments in varying degrees of physical and mental development. It also causes gradual enlargement of the thyroid gland, referred to as a [[goitre]]. It is being combated in many countries by public health campaigns of iodine administration.

==History==
Endemic cretinism was especially common in areas of southern Europe around the Alps and was described by ancient Roman writers, and often depicted by medieval artists. The earliest Alpine mountain climbers sometimes came upon whole villages of cretins.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Fleming, ''Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps'', 2000, Grove Press, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Alpine cretinism was described from a medical perspective by several travellers and physicians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[William Coxe]], &quot;Account of the [[Valais|Vallais]], and of the Goiters and Idiots of that Country,&quot; ''Universal Magazine of Knowledge &amp; Pleasure'', vol. 67, Dec. 2, 1780.&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time the cause was not known and it was often attributed to &quot;stagnant air&quot; in mountain valleys or &quot;bad water.&quot; The proportion of people affected varied markedly throughout southern Europe and even within very small areas it might be common in one valley and not another. The number of severely affected persons was always a minority, and most persons were only affected to the extent of having a goitre and some degree of reduced cognition and growth. The majority of such cases were still socially functional in their pastoral villages.

===Nineteenth century===
More mildly affected areas of Europe and North America in the 19th century were referred to as &quot;goiter belts&quot;. The degree of iodine deficiency was milder and manifested primarily as thyroid enlargement rather than severe mental and physical impairment. In Switzerland, for example, where soil is poor in iodine, cases of cretinism were very abundant and even considered genetically caused. As the variety of food sources dramatically increased in Europe and North America and the populations became less than completely dependent on locally grown food, the prevalence of endemic goitre diminished.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===
The early 20th century saw the discovery of the relationships of sporadic cretinism with congenital hypothyroidism, and of endemic cretinism with hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency. Both have been largely eliminated in the developed world.

The '''Council of Trent''' ({{lang-la|Concilium Tridentinum}}) was the 16th-century  [[Ecumenical Council]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It is considered to be one of the Church's most important&lt;ref name = &quot;World History&quot;/&gt; councils. It convened in [[Trento|Trent]] (then capital of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Trent]], in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], now in modern [[Italy]]) between December 13, 1545, and December 4, 1563 in twenty-five sessions for three periods. Council fathers met for the first through eight sessions in Trent (1545&amp;ndash;7), and for the ninth through eleventh sessions in [[Bologna]] (1547) during the pontificate of [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Jedin, Konciliengeschichte, Herder Freiburg, 138&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Pope Julius III]], the council met in Trent (1551&amp;ndash;52) for the twelfth through sixteenth sessions. Under [[Pope Pius IV]], the seventeenth through twenty-fifth sessions took place in Trent (1559&amp;ndash;63). 

The council issued condemnations on what it defined as Protestant heresies and defined Church teachings in the areas of Scripture and [[Sacred Tradition|Tradition]], Original Sin, Justification, Sacraments, the Eucharist in Holy Mass and the veneration of saints. It issued numerous reform decrees.&lt;ref&gt;Jedin, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; By specifying Catholic doctrine on [[salvation]], the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacraments]], and the [[Biblical canon]], the Council was answering Protestant disputes.&lt;ref name = &quot;World History&quot;/&gt; The Council entrusted to the Pope the implementation of its work; as a result, [[Pope Pius IV]] issued the [[Tridentine Creed]] in 1565; and [[Pope Pius V]] issued in 1566 the [[Roman Catechism]], in 1568 a revised [[Liturgy of the Hours|Roman Breviary]], and in 1570 a revised [[Roman Missal]], thus initiating what since the 20th century has been called the [[Tridentine Mass]] (from the city's [[Latin]] name ''Tridentum''), and [[Pope Clement VIII]] issued in 1592 a revised edition of the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ODCC&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3), article ''Trent, Council of''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Trent, delayed and interrupted several times because of political or religious disagreements, was a major reform council and the most impressive embodiment of the ideals of the [[Counter-Reformation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC&quot;/&gt; It would be over 300 years until the [[Vatican I|next Ecumenical Council]]. When announcing [[Vatican II]], [[Pope John XXIII]] stated that the precepts of the Council of Trent continue to the modern day, a position that was reaffirmed by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;What was, still is, quoted in [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the Council ==
===Obstacles and events before the Council===
[[Image:Tizian 083b.jpg|240px|thumb|left| Pope Paul III invoked the Council of Trent]]
On March 16, 1517, the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] closed its activities with a number of reform proposals (on the selection of bishops, taxation, censorship and preaching) but not on the major problems that confronted the Church in Germany and other parts of Europe. A few months later, October 31, 1517, [[Martin Luther]] issued his [[95 Theses]] in [[Wittenberg]].

===A general, free Council in Germany ===
Luther’s position on ecumenical councils shifted over time,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Hubert | last = Jedin | title = Konziliengeschichte | publisher = Herder | year = 1959 | page = 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1520 Luther appealed to the German princes to attack the Church, if necessary with a council in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = An den Adel deutscher Nation | year = 1520 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; open and free of the Papacy. After the Pope condemned in [[Exsurge Domine]] fifty-two sentences of Luther as [[heresy]], German opinion considered a council the best method to reconcile existing differences. German Catholics, diminished in number, hoped for a council to clarify matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jedin 81&quot;&gt;Jedin 81&lt;/ref&gt;

It took a generation for the council to materialize, partly because of Papal reluctance —the Lutherans demanded his exclusion from the Council— and partly because of ongoing political rivalries between France and Germany and the Turkish dangers in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name =&quot;Jedin 81&quot; /&gt; Under [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523&amp;ndash;34), troops of the Catholic [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Papal Rome]] in 1527, “raping, killing burning, stealing, the like had not been seen since the [[Vandals]]”. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]] were used for horses.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kühner Papstgeschichte, Fischer, Frankfurt 1960, 118&lt;/ref&gt; This, together with the Pontiff's ambivalence between France and Germany, led to his hesitation.  Charles V strongly favoured a council, but needed the support of France, which attacked him militarily. Faced with a Turkish attack, Charles held the support of the Protestant German rulers, all of whom delayed the opening of the Council of Trent.&lt;ref&gt;Jedin 79&amp;ndash;82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure in Mantua-Vicenza===

The council was ordered by the Emperor and Pope to convene in [[Mantua]] on May 23, 1537. It failed to convene after another war broke out between France and Charles V, resulting in a non-attendance of French [[prelate]]s. Protestants, just defeated by Charles V, refused to attend as well. Financial difficulties in Mantua led the Pope in the fall of 1537 to move the council to [[Vicenza]], where participation was poor. The Council was postponed indefinitely on May 21, 1539. [[Pope Paul III]] then initiated several internal Church reforms while Emperor Charles V convened a meeting with Protestants in [[Regensburg]], seat of the German diet, to reconcile differences. Unity failed between Catholic and Protestant representatives “because of different concepts of ''Church'' and ''[[Justification (theology)|justification]]''”.&lt;ref&gt;Jedin 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occasion, sessions, and attendance==
[[Image:Council of Trent by Pasquale Cati.jpg|thumb|right|The Council, depicted by Cati da Iesi]]
In reply to the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' of [[Pope Leo X]] (1520), [[Martin Luther]] burned the document and appealed for a general council. In 1522 German [[diet (assembly)|diets]] joined in the appeal, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] seconding and pressing for a council as a means of reunifying the Church and settling the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] controversies. [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523–34) was vehemently against the idea of a council, agreeing with [[Francis I of France]].  After [[Pope Pius II]], in his bull ''[[Execrabilis]]'' (1460) and his reply to the University of Cologne (1463), set aside the theory of the supremacy of general councils laid down by the [[Council of Constance]], it was the papal policy to avoid councils. 

[[Pope Paul III]] (1534–49) —seeing that the [[Protestant Reformation]] was no longer confined to a few preachers, but had won over various princes, particularly in Germany, to its ideas— desired a council. Yet when he proposed the idea to his cardinals, it was unanimously opposed. Nonetheless, he sent [[nuncio]]s throughout Europe to propose the idea. Paul III issued a decree for a general council to be held in Mantua, Italy, to begin May 23, 1537. Martin Luther wrote the [[Smalcald Articles]] in preparation for the general council. The Smalcald Articles were designed to sharply define where the Lutherans could and could not compromise.

However, the council was delayed until 1545, and convened right before Luther's death. Unable, however, to resist the urging of Charles V, the pope, after proposing Mantua as the place of meeting, convened the council at Trent (at that time a free city of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under a prince-bishop), on December 13, 1545; the Pope's decision to transfer it to [[Bologna]] in March, 1547 on the pretext of avoiding a plague&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC&quot;/&gt; failed to take effect and the Council was indefinitely prorogued on 17 September 1549.

Reopened at Trent on 1 May 1551 by convocation of [[Pope Julius III]] (1550–5), it was broken up by the sudden victory of [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]] over the Emperor Charles V and his march into surrounding state of [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] on 28 April 1552.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc12/htm/ii.ii.htm |title=Council of Trent|author=Trenkle, Franz Sales|date=2003-03-03|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no hope of reassembling the council while the very [[Anti-Protestantism|anti-Protestant]] [[Paul IV]] was Pope.&lt;ref name =&quot;ODCC&quot;/&gt; The council was reconvened by [[Pope Pius IV]] (1559–65) for the last time, meeting from 18 January 1562, and continued until its final adjournment on 4 December 1563. It closed with a series of ritual acclamations honouring the reigning Pope, the Popes who had convoked the Council, the emperor and the kings who had supported it, the [[papal legate]]s, the cardinals, the ambassadors present, and the bishops, followed by acclamations of acceptance of the faith of the Council and its decrees, and of anathema for all heretics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Acclamations of the Fathers at the Close of the Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the council is thus divided into three distinct periods: 1545–49, 1551–52 and 1562–63. During the second period, the Protestants present asked for renewed discussion on points already defined and for bishops to be released from their oaths of allegiance to the Pope.  When the last period began, all hope of conciliating the Protestants was gone and the [[Jesuits]] had become a strong force.&lt;ref name =&quot;ODCC&quot;/&gt;

The number of attending members in the three periods varied considerably. The council was small to begin with.&lt;ref name =&quot;ODCC&quot;/&gt; It increased toward the close, but never reached the number of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (which had 318 members) nor of the [[First Vatican Council]] (which numbered 744). The decrees were signed by 255 members, including four papal legates, two cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops, and 168 bishops, two-thirds of whom were Italians.  The Italian and Spanish prelates were vastly preponderant in power and numbers. At the passage of the most important decrees, not more than sixty prelates were present.

==Objects and general results==
The main object of the council was twofold, although there were other issues that were also discussed:

#To condemn the principles and doctrines of [[Protestantism]] and to define the doctrines of the Catholic Church on all disputed points. It is true that the emperor intended it to be a strictly general or truly ecumenical council, at which the Protestants should have a fair hearing. He secured, during the council's second period, 1551&amp;ndash;53, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the right of discussion, but denied them a vote. [[Melanchthon]] and [[Johannes Brenz]], with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trent. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than [[Nuremberg]], took with him the ironic statement known as the ''Confessio Saxonica''. But the refusal to give the Protestants the right to vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.
#To effect a reformation in discipline or administration. This object had been one of the causes calling forth the reformatory councils and had been lightly touched upon by the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] under [[Pope Julius II]] and [[Pope Andrew Davi]]. The obvious corruption in the administration of the Church was one of the numerous causes of the Reformation. Twenty-five public sessions were held, but nearly half of them were spent in solemn formalities. The chief work was done in committees or congregations. The entire management was in the hands of the papal legate. The liberal elements lost out in the debates and voting. The council abolished some of the most notorious abuses and introduced or recommended disciplinary reforms affecting the sale of [[indulgence]]s, the morals of convents, the education of the clergy, the non-residence of bishops (also bishops having plurality of [[benefice]]s, which was fairly common), and the careless fulmination of censures, and forbade dueling. Although evangelical sentiments were uttered by some of the members in favor of the supreme authority of the Scriptures and justification by faith, no concession whatever was made to Protestantism.
#The church's interpretation of the Bible was final. Any Christian who substituted his or her own interpretation was a heretic. Also, the Bible and Church Tradition (not mere customs but the ancient tradition that made up part of the Catholic faith) were equally authoritative.
#The relationship of faith and [[Good works|works]] in salvation was defined, following controversy over [[Martin Luther]]'s doctrine of &quot;[[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]]&quot;.
#Other Catholic practices that drew the ire of reformers within the Church, such as [[indulgences]], pilgrimages, the veneration of [[saint]]s and [[relics]], and the veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]] were strongly reaffirmed, though abuses of them, such as the sale of indulgences, were forbidden. Decrees concerning [[Counter-Reformation#Church and its music|sacred music]] and religious art, [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|though inexplicit, were subsequently amplified]] by theologians and writers to condemn many types of Renaissance and medieval styles and [[iconography|iconographies]], impacting heavily on the development of these art forms.

The doctrinal decisions of the council are divided into decrees (''decreta''), which contain the positive statement of the conciliar [[dogma]]s, and into short canons (''canones''), which condemn the dissenting Protestant views with the concluding &quot;''anathema sit''&quot; (&quot;let him be anathema&quot;).

==Canons and decrees==
{{Ecumenical councils of the Catholic Church}}
The '''doctrinal''' acts are as follows: after reaffirming the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] (third session), the [[Canon of Trent|decree]] was passed (fourth session) confirming that the [[deuterocanonical books]] were on a par with the other books of the [[biblical canon|canon]] (against Luther's placement of these books in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] of [[Luther Bible|his edition]]) and coordinating church tradition with the Scriptures as a rule of faith. The [[Vulgate]] translation was affirmed to be authoritative for the text of Scripture.

[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] (sixth session) was declared to be offered upon the basis of faith and good works as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of faith alone, and faith was treated as a progressive work. The idea of man being utterly passive under the influence of [[divine grace|grace]] was also rejected.

The greatest weight in the Council's decrees is given to the [[sacrament]]s. The seven sacraments were reaffirmed and the [[Eucharist]] pronounced to be a true propitiatory sacrifice as well as a sacrament, in which the bread and wine were [[consecration|consecrated]] into the Eucharist (thirteenth and twenty-second sessions). The term [[transubstantiation]] was used by the Council, but the specific [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] explanation given by [[Scholasticism]] was not cited as dogmatic. Instead, the decree states that [[Jesus|Christ]] is &quot;really, truly, substantially present&quot; in the consecrated forms. The sacrifice of the [[Roman Mass|Mass]] was to be offered for dead and living alike and in giving to the apostles the command &quot;do this in remembrance of me,&quot; Christ conferred upon them a [[sacerdotal]] power. The practice of withholding the cup from the laity was confirmed (twenty-first session) as one which the [[Church Fathers]] had commanded for good and sufficient reasons; yet in certain cases the Pope was made the supreme arbiter as to whether the rule should be strictly maintained.

[[Holy Orders|Ordination]] (twenty-third session) was defined to imprint an [[sacramental character|indelible character]] on the soul. The priesthood of the New Testament takes the place of the Levitical priesthood. To the performance of its functions, the consent of the people is not necessary.

In the decrees on marriage (twenty-fourth session) the excellence of the [[celibacy|celibate]] state was reaffirmed (see also [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]), concubinage condemned and the validity of marriage made dependent upon its being performed before a priest and two witnesses—although the lack of a requirement for parental consent ended a debate that had proceeded from the 12th century. In the case of a [[divorce]], the right of the innocent party to marry again was denied so long as the other party is alive, even if the other may have committed adultery.

In the twenty-fifth and last session,&lt;ref&gt;Council of Trent: Decree ''De invocatione, veneratione et reliquiis sanctorum, et de sacris imaginibus'', 3.12.1563, Sessio 25.&lt;/ref&gt; the doctrines of [[purgatory]], the invocation of [[saint]]s and the veneration of [[relic]]s were reaffirmed, as was also the efficacy of indulgences as dispensed by the Church according to the power given her, but with some cautionary recommendations, and a ban on the sale of indulgences. Short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, were to have [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|great impact]] on the development of [[Art in Roman Catholicism|Catholic art]]. Much more than the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787) the Council fathers of Trent stressed the pedagogical purpose of Christian images.&lt;ref&gt;Bühren 2008, p. 635f.; about the historical context of the decree on sacred images cf. Jedin 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council appointed, in 1562 (eighteenth session), a commission to prepare a list of forbidden books (''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''), but it later left the matter to the Pope. The preparation of a [[Roman Catechism|catechism]] and the revision of the [[Breviary]] and [[Missal]] were also left to the pope. The catechism embodied the council's far-reaching results, including reforms and definitions of the sacraments, the Scriptures, church dogma, and duties of the clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;World History&quot;&gt;Wetterau, Bruce. World history. New York: Henry Holt and company. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

On adjourning, the Council asked the supreme pontiff to ratify all its decrees and definitions. This petition was complied with by [[Pope Pius IV]], January 26, 1564, in the [[papal bull]], ''[[Benedictus Deus]]'', which enjoins strict obedience upon all Catholics and forbids, under pain of [[excommunication]], all unauthorized interpretation, reserving this to the Pope alone and threatens the disobedient with &quot;the indignation of Almighty God and of his blessed apostles, Peter and Paul.&quot; Pope Pius appointed a commission of cardinals to assist him in interpreting and enforcing the decrees.

The ''[[Index librorum prohibitorum]]'' was announced 1564 and the following books were issued with the papal [[imprimatur]]: the Profession of the Tridentine Faith and the [[Roman Catechism|Tridentine Catechism]] (1566), the Breviary (1568), the Missal (1570) and the [[Vulgate]] (1590 and then 1592).

The decrees of the council were acknowledged in Italy, Portugal, Poland and by the Catholic princes of Germany at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1566. [[Philip II of Spain]] accepted them for Spain, the Netherlands and Sicily insofar as they did not infringe the royal prerogative. In France they were officially recognized by the king only in their doctrinal parts. The disciplinary sections received official recognition at provincial synods and were enforced by the bishops. No attempt was made to introduce it into England. Pius IV sent the decrees to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], with a letter dated June 13, 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but she dared not do it in the face of [[John Knox]] and the Reformation.

These decrees were later supplemented by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1870.

The most comprehensive description is still [[Hubert Jedin]]'s ''The History of the Council of Trent (Geschichte des Konzils von Trient'' with about 2500 pages in four volumes: The History of the Council of Trent, The fight for a Council (Vol I, 1951); The History of the Council of Trent The first Sessions in Trent (1545&amp;ndash;1547) (Vol II, 1957); The History of the Council of Trent Sessions in Bologna 1547&amp;ndash;1548 and Trent 1551&amp;ndash;1552 (Vol III, 1970, 1998); The History of the Council of Trent Third Period and Conclusion (Vol IV, 1976).

The canons and decrees of the council have been published very often and in many languages (for a large list consult ''British Museum Catalogue'', under &quot;Trent, Council of&quot;). The first issue was by [[Paulus Manutius]] (Rome, 1564). The best Latin editions are by [[J. Le Plat]] (Antwerp, 1779) and by F. Schulte and [[A. L. Richter]] (Leipzig, 1853). Other good editions are in vol. vii. of the ''Acta et decreta conciliorum recentiorum. Collectio Lacensis'' (7 vols., Freiburg, 1870&amp;ndash;90), reissued as independent volume (1892); ''Concilium Tridentinum: Diariorum, actorum, epastularum, ... collectio'', ed. [[S. Merkle]] (4 vols., Freiburg, 1901 sqq.; only vols. i.&amp;ndash;iv. have as yet appeared); not to overlook [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi|Mansi]], ''Concilia'', xxxv. 345 sqq. Note also [[Mirbt]], ''Quellen'', 2d ed, pp.&amp;nbsp;202&amp;ndash;255. The best English edition is by [[James Waterworth]] (London, 1848; ''With Essays on the External and Internal History of the Council'').

The original acts and debates of the council, as prepared by its general secretary, Bishop [[Angelo Massarelli]], in six large folio volumes, are deposited in the [[Vatican Library]] and remained there unpublished for more than 300 years and were brought to light, though only in part, by [[Augustin Theiner]], priest of the oratory (d. 1874), in ''Acta genuina sancti et oecumenici Concilii Tridentini nunc primum integre edita'' (2 vols., Leipzig, 1874).

Most of the official documents and private reports, however, which bear upon the council, were made known in the 16th century and since. The most complete collection of them is that of J. Le Plat, ''Monumentorum ad historicam Concilii Tridentini collectio'' (7 vols., Leuven, 1781&amp;ndash;87). New materials(Vienna, 1872); by [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger|JJI von Döllinger]] ''(Ungedruckte Berichte und Tagebücher zur Geschichte des Concilii von Trient)'' (2 parts, Nördlingen, 1876); and A. von Druffel, ''Monumenta Tridentina'' (Munich, 1884&amp;ndash;97).

[[File:Chloroplast diagram.svg|thumb|300px|The simplified internal structure of a chloroplast]]
'''Chloroplasts''' ({{IPA-en|ˈklɒrəplæsts}}) are [[organelle]]s found  in [[plant cell]]s and other [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms that conduct [[photosynthesis]]. Chloroplasts capture [[light]] [[energy]] to conserve [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in the form of [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] and reduce [[NADP]] to [[NADPH]] through a complex set of processes called photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Neil A. | authorlink = | coauthors = Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden | title = Biology: Exploring Life | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | location = Boston, Massachusetts | pages = | url = http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-13-250882-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chloroplasts are green because they contain the pigment [[chlorophyll]]. The word ''chloroplast'' (χλωροπλάστης) is derived from the Greek words ''chloros'' (χλωρός), which means green, and ''plastis'' (πλάστης), which means &quot;the one who forms&quot;. Chloroplasts are members of a class of organelles known as [[plastid]]s.

==Evolutionary origin==

[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|250px|Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''[[Plagiomnium affine]]'' — Many-fruited Thyme-moss]]
[[File:Überseemuseum Bremen 2009 238.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A model chloroplast]]
Chloroplasts are one of the many different types of organelles in the plant cell. In general, they are considered to have originated from [[cyanobacteria]] through [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]]. This was first suggested by [[Konstantin Mereschkowski|Mereschkowsky]] in 1905&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Mereschkowsky C | title= Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche | journal= Biol Centralbl | year=1905 | volume=25 | pages=593–604}}&lt;/ref&gt; after an observation by [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Schimper]] in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Schimper AFW | title= Über die Entwicklung der Chlorophyllkörner und Farbkörper | journal= Bot. Zeitung | year=1883 | volume=41 | pages=105–14, 121–31, 137–46, 153–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; All chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single endosymbiotic event (in the [[Archaeplastida]]), except for ''[[Paulinella]] chromatophora'', which has recently acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont which is not closely related to chloroplasts of other eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J. Keeling |  url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/z1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481–1493 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1481 }}{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that they derive from an endosymbiotic event, chloroplasts are similar to [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], but chloroplasts are found only in [[plant]]s and [[protist]]a. The chloroplast is surrounded by a double-layered composite membrane with an intermembrane space; further, it has reticulations, or many infoldings, filling the inner spaces. The chloroplast has its own [[DNA]],&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/articles/view/158858/?topic=49496 ''Deoxyribonucleic acid''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment.] eds. S.Draggan and C.Cleveland. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; which codes for redox proteins involved in electron transport in photosynthesis; this is termed the [[plastome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krause K |title=From chloroplasts to &quot;cryptic&quot; plastids: evolution of plastid genomes in parasitic plants |journal=Curr. Genet. |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=111–21 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18696071 |doi=10.1007/s00294-008-0208-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In green plants, chloroplasts are surrounded by two [[cell membrane|lipid-bilayer membranes]]. They are believed to correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joyard J Block MA, Douce R|title=Molecular aspects of plastid envelope biochemistry.  |journal=Eur J Biochem. |volume=199 |pages=489–509 |year=1991 |pmid=1868841 |doi= 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16148.x |issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloroplasts have their own genome, which is considerably [[genome reduction|reduced]] compared to that of free-living cyanobacteria, but the parts that are still present show clear similarities with the cyanobacterial genome. Plastids may contain 60-100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often contain more than 1500 genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin W, Rujan T, Richly E |title=Evolutionary analysis of Arabidopsis, cyanobacterial, and chloroplast genomes reveals plastid phylogeny and thousands of cyanobacterial genes in the nucleus |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=99 |issue=19 |pages=12246–51 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12218172 |pmc=129430 |doi=10.1073/pnas.182432999 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12218172|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjjsvvn |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the missing genes are encoded in the nuclear genome of the host. The transfer of nuclear information has been estimated in [[tobacco]] plants at one [[gene]] for every 16000 pollen grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang CY, Ayliffe MA, Timmis JN |title=Direct measurement of the transfer rate of chloroplast DNA into the nucleus |journal=Nature |volume=422 |issue=6927 |pages=72–6 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12594458 |doi=10.1038/nature01435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some algae (such as the [[heterokont]]s and other protists such as [[Euglenozoa]] and [[Cercozoa]]), chloroplasts seem to have evolved through a secondary event of endosymbiosis, in which a eukaryotic cell engulfed a second eukaryotic cell containing chloroplasts, forming chloroplasts with three or four membrane layers. In some cases, such secondary [[endosymbiont]]s may have themselves been engulfed by still other eukaryotes, thus forming tertiary endosymbionts. In the alga ''[[Chlorella]]'', there is only one chloroplast, which is bell-shaped.

In some groups of [[mixotrophic]] [[protist]]s such as the [[dinoflagellate]]s, chloroplasts are separated from a captured alga or [[diatom]] and used temporarily. These [[kleptoplasty|klepto chloroplasts]] may only have a lifetime of a few days and are then replaced.&lt;ref name=Skovgaard&gt;{{cite journal |author=Skovgaard A |title=Role of chloroplast retention in a marine dinoflagellate |journal=Aquatic Microbial Ecology |volume=15 |pages=293–301 |year=1998 |url=http://www.alfskovgaard.dk/publications/Skovgaard1998.pdf |doi=10.3354/ame015293|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjjzB0M |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Chloroplasts are observable as flat discs usually 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter and 1 micrometer thick. In land plants, they are, in general, 5 μm in diameter and 2.3 μm thick. The chloroplast is contained by an envelope that consists of an inner and an outer phospholipid membrane. Between these two layers is the intermembrane space.  A typical [[parenchyma]] cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.

]]

The material within the chloroplast is called the stroma, corresponding to the [[cytosol]] of the original bacterium, and contains one or more molecules of small circular DNA. It also contains [[ribosome]]s; however most of its proteins are encoded by genes contained in the host cell nucleus, with the protein products transported to the chloroplast.

[[File:Chloroplast in leaf of Anemone sp TEM 12000x.png|thumb|250px|left|[[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] image of a chloroplast]]

Within the stroma are stacks of [[thylakoid]]s, the sub-organelles, which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana (singular: granum).&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2006&quot;/&gt;
A thylakoid has a flattened disk shape. Inside it is an empty area called the thylakoid space or lumen. Photosynthesis takes place on the thylakoid membrane; as in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, it involves the coupling of cross-membrane [[flux]]es with [[biochemistry|biosynthesis]] via the dissipation of a proton electrochemical gradient.

In the electron microscope, thylakoid membranes appear as alternating light-and-dark bands, each 0.01 μm thick.  Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are antenna complexes, each of which consists of the light-absorbing pigments, including [[chlorophyll]] and [[carotenoids]], as well as proteins that bind the pigments. This complex both increases the surface area for light capture, and allows capture of photons with a wider range of wavelengths. The energy of the incident photons is absorbed by the pigments and funneled to the reaction centre of this complex through [[resonance energy transfer]]. Two chlorophyll molecules are then ionised, producing an excited electron, which then passes onto the photochemical reaction centre.

Recent studies have shown that chloroplasts can be interconnected by tubular bridges called [[stromule]]s, formed as extensions of their outer membranes.&lt;ref name=Köhler2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Köhler RH, Hanson MR |title=Plastid tubules of higher plants are tissue-specific and developmentally regulated |journal=J.

==Transplastomic plants==
Recently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of [[genetically modified plant]]s. In most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stegemann S, Hartmann S, Ruf S, Bock R |title=High-frequency gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the nucleus |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=100 |issue=15 |pages=8828–33 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12817081 |pmc=166398 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1430924100 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12817081 |quote=most angiosperm species inherit their chloroplasts maternally |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjlpWlQ |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruf2007/&gt; although in plants such as pines, chloroplasts are inherited from males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powell W, Morgante M, McDevitt R, Vendramin GG, Rafalski JA |title=Polymorphic simple sequence repeat regions in chloroplast genomes: applications to the population genetics of pines |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=92 |issue=17 |pages=7759–63 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7644491 |pmc=41225 |quote=In the pines, the chloroplast genome is transmitted through pollen |doi=10.1073/pnas.92.17.7759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where chloroplasts are inherited only from the female, [[transgene]]s in these plastids cannot be disseminated by [[pollen]]. This makes [[plastid transformation]] a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This [[biological containment]] strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture]]. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.&lt;ref name=ruf2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ruf S, Karcher D, Bock R |title=Determining the transgene containment level provided by chloroplast transformation |journal=Proc.

'''Camp David''' is the country retreat of the [[President of the United States]] and his guests. It is located in low wooded hills about 100&amp;nbsp;km (60&amp;nbsp;mi) north-northwest of [[Washington, D.C.]], on the property of [[Catoctin Mountain Park]] in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]], [[Maryland]], near [[Thurmont]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nps.gov/pwr/customcf/apps/maps/showmap.cfm?alphacode=cato&amp;parkname=Catoctin%20Mountain%20Park Park Map Viewer].&quot; [[Catoctin Mountain Park]].

It is officially known as '''Naval Support Facility Thurmont''' and technically a military installation; staffing is primarily provided by the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps.

First known as Hi-Catoctin, Camp David was originally built as a camp for federal government agents and their families, by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], starting in 1935, opening in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =12 WPA Projects that Still Exist | work =How Stuff Works | publisher =Publications International, Ltd. | url =http://people.howstuffworks.com/12-wpa-projects-that-still-exist.htm | accessdate =2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 it was converted to a presidential retreat by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and renamed [[Shangri-La]]. Camp David received its present name from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], in honor of his grandson, [[David Eisenhower|David]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/campdavid1.html History of Camp David: A brief history of the Presidential mountain retreat and its famous guests by David Johnson]&lt;/ref&gt; Camp David is not open to the general public.

Roosevelt hosted [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] in May 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/camp_david/ |title=Camp David |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry S. Truman]] rarely visited Camp David, because his wife [[Bess Truman|Bess]] found it &quot;dull&quot;. [[Dwight Eisenhower]] held the first cabinet meeting there. [[John F. Kennedy]] and his family often enjoyed horseback riding and other recreational activities. Kennedy often allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use the retreat when he or his family were not there. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] often met with important advisors at the retreat and hosted Australian Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]]. [[Richard Nixon]] was a frequent visitor and did much to add to and modernize the facilities. [[Gerald Ford]] often rode his snowmobile around Camp David and hosted Indonesian President [[Suharto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/campdavid1.html |title=Camp David: A History of the Presidential Retreat |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=1942-07-18 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Carter]] brokered the [[Camp David Accords]] there in September 1978 between Egyptian President [[Anwar al-Sadat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;/&gt; [[Ronald Reagan]] visited the retreat more than any other president. [[Dorothy Bush Koch]], the daughter of [[George H.W. Bush]] was the first person ever to be married there, in 1992. [[Bill Clinton]] used Camp David more as his tenure in office progressed, and hosted then British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] on several occasions in addition to numerous celebrities. [[George W.

==Navy operations==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2010}}
Camp David is a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] installation, commanded by a [[Commander (United States)|Naval Commander]]. Sailors are mostly [[Seabees]] and most officers are in the civil engineering field. The Navy Seabee Detachment performs maintenance and beautification. The sailors must undergo a &quot;[[Yankee White]]&quot; level background check, which involves passing the most rigorous background check conducted by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD). The sailors are hand-picked for their service at Camp David, and are among the best of the U.S. Navy. Some of the sailors include: grounds and maintenance personnel, electricians, carpenters, corpsmen, and the President's [[Culinary Specialist (US Navy)|cooks]].

The Camp is alleged to be one of the most secure facilities in the world, as reported by a Department of Defense journal in 1998. The facility is guarded by one of the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine Corps']] most elite units, [[Marine Security Company, Camp David]] (MSC-CD). Each Marine is hand-picked from the [[infantry]] field and sent through a battery of psychological and physical tests. Selected Marines must then undergo specialized security training at the [[Marine Corps Security Forces|Marine Corps Security Forces School]] in [[Chesapeake, Virginia]]. The candidates then report to the [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.]], where they provide protection for the barracks, the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] and the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. Assuming a Marine successfully completes his &quot;pre-assignment&quot; in Washington, he still must undergo the &quot;[[Yankee White]]&quot; background check. Only then is the candidate eligible for assignment to Camp David. After 12 months of service at Camp David, a Marine is awarded the [[Presidential Service Badge]]. Tours of duty at Camp David typically last for 18 months.

'''Crux''' is the [[List of constellations by area|smallest]] of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s, but is one of the most distinctive. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[cross]], and it is dominated by a cross-shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that is commonly known as the '''Southern Cross'''.

==Visibility==
Crux is easily visible from the [[southern hemisphere]] at practically any time of year. It is also visible near the horizon from [[Tropics|tropical latitudes]] of the [[northern hemisphere]] for a few hours every night during the northern winter and spring. For instance, it is visible from [[Cancun]] or any other place at latitude 25° N or less at around 10 pm at the end of April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Field Guide to the Stars and Planets | author=Pasachoff, Jay M | year=2000 | publisher=Houghton Miflin | isbn=9780395934319 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Ian Ridpath.com: Constellations | accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and identification==
[[Image:Cruxaustralisphoto.png|thumb|left|200px| The five brightest stars in Crux are clearly visible in this picture. The [[red giant]] [[Gacrux]] and orange giant [[Epsilon Crucis|Epsilon]] are distinctly different from the three other major stars of the constellation, which are blue-white in colour]]
Contrary to popular belief, Crux is not opposite to [[Ursa Major]]. In fact, in tropical regions both Crux (low in the south) and Ursa Major (low in the north) can be seen in the sky from April to June. Crux is exactly opposite to [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] on the celestial sphere, and therefore it cannot be in the sky with the latter at the same time. For locations south of 34°S, Crux is circumpolar and thus always visible in the night sky. 

Crux is bordered by the constellations [[Centaurus]], which surrounds it on three sides, and [[Musca]].

Crux is sometimes confused with the nearby [[Vela (constellation)#False Cross|False Cross]] by stargazers. Crux is somewhat [[kite (geometry)|kite]]-shaped, and it has a fifth star ([[Epsilon Crucis|ε Crucis]]). The False Cross is [[diamond]]-shaped, somewhat dimmer on average, does not have a fifth star and lacks the two prominent &quot;Pointer Stars.&quot;

[[File:Crux-20100220.jpg|thumb|right|Stacked image of six identical frames of Crux.]]

Three of the five main Crux stars—[[Alpha Crucis|Acrux]], [[Beta Crucis|Mimosa]], and [[Delta Crucis]]—are co-moving B-type members of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]], the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]] to the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Nearest OB Association: Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco OB2)|author=Preibisch, T., Mamajek, E.|year=2008|journal=Handbook of Star-Forming Regions|volume=2|pages=0|bibcode=2008hsf2.book..235P|arxiv=0809.0407}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are among the highest-mass stellar members of the Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the association, with ages of roughly 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989A&amp;A...216...44D | author=de Geus, E. J., de Zeeuw, P. T., &amp; Lub, J. | title= Physical Parameters of Stars in the Scorpio-Centaurus OB Association| journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]]| volume=216 | issue=3 | year=1989 | pages=44–61 | doi=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=2002AJ....124.1670M | doi = 10.1086/341952 | author=Mamajek, E.E., Meyer, M.R., &amp; Liebert, J. | title= Post-T Tauri Stars in the Nearest OB Association| journal=[[Astronomical Journal]]| volume=124 | issue = 3 | year=2002 | pages=1670–1694|arxiv = astro-ph/0205417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Markers====
Since the [[celestial sphere|southern sky]] lacks an easily visible [[pole star]], Alpha and Gamma (known as [[Acrux]] and [[Gacrux]] respectively) are commonly used to mark south. Tracing a line from Gacrux to Acrux and extending it for approximately 4.5 times the distance between the 2 stars leads to a point close to the Southern Celestial Pole. Alternatively, if a line is constructed perpendicularly between [[Alpha Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri]], the point where the above mentioned line and this line intersect marks the Southern Celestial Pole. The two stars of Alpha and Beta Centauri are often referred to as the &quot;Southern Pointers&quot; or just &quot;The Pointers&quot;, allowing people to easily find the asterism of the Southern Cross or the constellation of Crux.

====Letters and names====
* α is named Acrux, a concatenation of &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Crux&quot; and named by American Elijah Burritt in the 19th Century.
* β is named Mimosa
* γ is named Gacrux, a concatenation of &quot;Gamma&quot; and &quot;Crux&quot;.
* δ is the fourth brightest star, but it has no designated name.
* ε is inside the cross.

===Deep sky objects===
The [[Coalsack Nebula]] is the most prominent [[dark nebula]] in the skies, easily visible to the naked eye as a big dark patch in the southern Milky Way.

Another [[deep sky object]] within Crux is the [[Open Cluster]] [[Open Cluster NGC 4755|NGC 4755]], better known as the [[Jewel Box (star cluster)|Jewel Box]] or [[Kappa Crucis]], that was discovered by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in 1751–1752. It lies at a distance of 1.9±0.3 kiloparsecs or 6,900 [[light year]]s and consists of approximately 100 stars spread across an area of about 20 square light-years.

==History==
Crux was visible to the [[Ancient Greeks]], who regarded it as part of the constellation Centaurus. At the latitude of [[Athens]] in 1000 BC, Crux was clearly visible, though low in the sky. However, the [[precession of the equinoxes]] gradually lowered its stars below the [[Europe]]an horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes. By AD 400, most of the constellation never rose above the horizon for Athenians.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[[Image:Crux in greece2.gif|this second star chart]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; 

[[Image:Southern Celestial Map of Mestre João Faras.gif|thumb|Depiction of the Crux (labelled 'Las Guardas') by physician-astronomer Mestre [[João Faras]] in his letter of May 1, 1500 to King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] from the newly-discovered land of [[Brazil]]]]
Crux was rediscovered by Europeans during the [[Age of Discovery]]. The Portuguese while rounding Africa mapped it and discovered its nautical use.

The separation of Crux from Centaurus is generally attributed to the French astronomer [[Augustin Royer]] in 1679. Other historians attribute the invention of Crux to [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1613, noting that the constellation was later published by [[Jakob Bartsch]] in 1624.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Cultural significance==
As a highly distinctive asterism, Crux has great significance in the cultures of the southern hemisphere. 
In [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]], Crux and the [[Coalsack]] mark the head of the 'Emu in the Sky' in several [[Aboriginal cultures]], while Crux itself is said to be a [[possum]] sitting in a tree and a representation of the sky deity Mirrabooka. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In Australia it also has significance, it resides on [[Flag_terminology#Description_of_standard_flag_parts_and_terms|fly]] of the [[Flag of Australia|national flag]], and was on the [[Eureka Flag]] - the battle flag of the [[Eureka Stockade]]. It has since continued as a symbol of revolution against oppression, including both ends of the political spectrum, but mostly for its original association with class equality.

In Brazil, where it is known as ''Cruzeiro do Sul'' or just ''Cruzeiro'', it resides in the [[Brazilian flag|flag]] and coat of arms, is mentioned in the national anthem, and even featured as the name of the [[Brazilian cruzeiro|currency]] (from 1942 to 1986 and again from 1990 to 1994). The constellation is displayed in all coins of the current series of the [[Brazilian real]]. 

A stone image of the constellation has been found at the archaeological site of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In [[Mapudungun]], the language of Patagonian [[Mapuche]]s, the name of Crux is ''Melipal'', which means &quot;four stars&quot;. In [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the language of the [[Inca]] civilization, Crux is known as &quot;[[Chakana]]&quot;, which means literally &quot;stair&quot; (''chaka'', bridge, link; ''hanan'', high, above), but carries a deep symbolism within Quechua mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/941062 Chakana: Inca Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name for Crux is &quot;''Te Punga''&quot; – &quot;the [[anchor]]&quot;. It is thought of as the anchor of Tama-rereti's [[waka (canoe)|''waka'']] (the [[Milky Way]]), where the Pointers are its rope. In [[Tonga]] it is known as ''Toloa''—duck; it is a duck flying over, heading south, and one of his wings (δ) is wounded because ''Ongo tangata''—two men—α and Β Centauri threw a stone at it. The Coalsack is known as ''Humu''—triggerfish, because of its shape.&lt;ref&gt;Kik Velt; Stars over Tonga&lt;/ref&gt; In Samoa the constellation is called &quot;Sumu&quot; (triggerfish) because of its rhomboid shape, while α and Β Centauri are called &quot;Luatagata&quot; (Two Men), as they are in Tonga. 

In Indonesia and Malaysia, it is known as ''Buruj Pari'' (constellation [[Stingray]]). In ancient [[Jyotisha|Hindu astrology]], the modern Crux is referred to as &quot;''[[Trishanku]]''&quot;.

The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] people of Indonesia called this constellation as ''Gubug pèncèng'' (&quot;raking hut&quot;) or ''lumbung'' (&quot;the granary&quot;), because the shape of the constellation which was like a raking hut.&lt;ref&gt;Daldjoeni N. 1984. Pranatamangsa, the javanese agricultural calendar – Its bioclimatological and sociocultural function in developing rural life.

Among [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]s, the four most visible stars of Crux are considered ''iggaren'', i.e. four ''[[Maerua crassifolia]]'' trees.

[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Gaucho]]s are well known for using it for night orientation in the vast [[Pampa]]s and [[Patagonia|Patagonic]] regions. It is also of cultural significance, as it is referenced in several songs and literature, including the [[Martin Fierro]].

This constellation was classified in ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'' (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') as ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Cross]]'' (十字架, ''Shízìjià'') by [[Xu Guangqi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060729.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 29 日]&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly ''[[Beta Crucis|Becrux or Mimosa]]'' (Beta Crucis), ''[[Alpha Crucis|Acrux]]'' (Alpha Crucis) and ''[[Gamma Crucis|Gacrux]]'' (Gamma Crucis) are bright stars in this constellation that is never seen in Chinese sky.

===The Southern Cross in popular culture===

In the Victory At Sea suite, Richard Rogers wrote &quot;Beneath The Southern Cross&quot; to depict the battleships in convoy and the lonliness of the sailors in the Southern Pacific during World War II.

{{main|Southern Cross Flag}}
[[Image:Southern cross appearing on a number of flags.PNG|thumb|250px|Crux, appearing on a number of flags and insignia]]
Beginning in the colonial age, Crux became used as a national symbol by several southern nations. The brightest stars of Crux appear on the flags of [[flag of Australia|Australia]], [[flag of Brazil|Brazil]], [[flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Samoa]]. They also appear on the flags of the [[flag of Victoria|Australian state of Victoria]], the [[flag of Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]], the [[flag of Northern Territory|Northern Territory]], as well as the flag of [[Magallanes Region of Chile]], the flag of [[Londrina]] (Brazil) and several [[Argentina|Argentine]] provincial flags and emblems (for example,, ''[[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]]'' and ''[[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]]''). The flag of the [[Mercosur]] trading zone displays the four brightest stars. Crux also appears on the [[Coat of arms of Brazil|Brazilian coat of arms]].

The five stars are also in the logo of the Brazilian football team [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]]. A stylized version of Crux appears on the [[Eureka Flag]].

===Cultural references to the flag symbol===
In Australia, the Southern Cross played a crucial role as symbol of the [[Eureka Stockade]]. In the Eureka Oath from [[Peter Lalor]]'s famous speech in 1854 under the flag he proclaimed: &lt;blockquote&gt;''We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1893, Australian poet [[Banjo Paterson]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The English flag may flutter and wave,&lt;br&gt; where the world wide oceans toss,&lt;br&gt;but the flag the Australian dies to save,&lt;br&gt;is the flag of the Southern Cross.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Southern Cross was written into the lyrics of [[Advance Australia Fair]] in 1901; the song was adopted as the Australian National Anthem in 1984: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Beneath our radiant Southern Cross''.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Southern Cross was included in the lyrics of the [[Brazilian National Anthem]] written in 1909, &lt;blockquote&gt;''A imagem do Cruzeiro resplandece''. (&quot;The image of the Cross shines.&quot;)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The victory song of the Australian national cricket team is entitled &quot;Beneath the Southern Cross&quot;.

'''Cetus''' is a [[constellation]]. Its name refers to [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], a [[sea monster]] in [[Greek mythology]], although it is often called 'the [[whale]]' today. Cetus is located in the region of the sky known as the [[Water (astronomy)|Water]], along with other watery constellations such as [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Cetus was divided into two areas. The areas are:
* ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|The Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'')
* ''[[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|The White Tiger of the West]]'' (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ'')

==Notable features==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cetus.png|thumb|left|Cetus in [[Stellarium]]]] --&gt;

===Ecliptic===
Although Cetus is not considered part of the [[zodiac]], the [[ecliptic]] passes close to its constellation boundary, and thus the planets may be seen in Cetus for brief periods of time.  This is even more true of asteroids, since their orbits usually have a greater [[inclination]] to the ecliptic than planets. For example, the [[asteroid]] [[4 Vesta]] was discovered in this constellation in 1807.

===Stars===
This constellation's most notable [[star]] is [[Mira]] (or ο Ceti), the first [[variable star]] to be discovered. Over a period of 331.65 days it can reach a maximum [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] as high as 2.0&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, one of the brightest in the sky and easily visible to the unaided eye, then drop to 10.1&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and back again. Its discovery in 1596 by [[David Fabricius]] further dented the supposed unchangeability of the heavens and lent support to the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican revolution]].

Other stars in the constellation include [[Alpha Ceti|α Ceti]] (Menkar); [[Beta Ceti|β Ceti]] (Deneb Kaitos), brightest in the constellation; and [[Tau Ceti|τ Ceti]], the [[list of nearest stars|17th closest star to Earth]].

See [[List of stars in Cetus]]

===Deep sky objects===
Cetus lies far from the [[galactic plane]], so that many distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] are visible, unobscured by dust from the [[Milky Way]]. Of these, the brightest is [[Messier 77]] (NGC 1068), a 9th magnitude [[spiral galaxy]] near [[Delta Ceti|δ Ceti]]. Recently, the galactic cluster [[JKCS 041|JKCS&amp;nbsp;041]] was confirmed to be the most distant [[cluster of galaxies]] yet discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?Scientists_identify_new_galaxy&amp;in_article_id=756711&amp;in_page_id=34 Scientists identify new galaxy cluster]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
This constellation has been recognized since antiquity. In [[Mesopotamia]], it was identified with the primordial cosmic female principle, the sea-monster [[Tiamat]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} 

In [[Ancient Greece]], it was identified with the sea monster Cetus, and together with the constellations above it, ([[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]], [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and possibly [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]), it may be the source of the myth of the [[Boast of Cassiopeia]], with which it is usually identified.{{Or|date=December 2008}}

In certain earlier Greek legends, Cetus also represented the gates (and gateposts) of the underworld (considered to be the area under the [[ecliptic]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} As such, together with other features in the [[zodiac]] sign of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] (including Pisces itself, as well as prominent stars behind Cetus), it may have formed the basis of the myth of the capture of [[Cerberus]] in [[the Twelve Labours]] of [[Heracles]].{{Or|date=December 2008}}

According to [[Arab]] astronomers, one of the hands of the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] (''Al-Thurayya'') extended into part of the constellation of Cetus. The Arabs also saw two pearl necklaces among the stars of Cetus: one pearl necklace was fully tied together and undamaged, but the other pearl necklace was broken and its pearls were scattered. Another generation of Arabs, like the ancient [[Hebrews]] and Greeks, portrayed an enormous [[Leviathan|Leviathan-like]] sea creature among the stars of Cetus.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Cetus as the name==
[[USS Cetus (AK-77)]] was a ship in the [[United States Navy]].

'''Carina''' is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[keel]] of a ship, and it was formerly part of the larger constellation of [[Argo Navis]] (the ship ''Argo'') until that constellation was divided in three.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Carina were divided in two areas. The areas are:
* ''[[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermillion Bird of the South]]'' (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què''),  only ''[[Canopus]]'' (Alpha Carinae). Canopus is &quot;south pole&quot; in Chinese sky.
* ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'' (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu''). Constellation Carina in Chinese sky is almost not seen and were classified in ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'' (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') by [[Xu Guangqi]], based on the knowledge of western star charts. Possibly ''[[Beta Carinae|Miaplacidus]]'' (Beta Carinae), ''[[Iota Carinae|Aspidiske]]'' (Iota Carinae) and ''[[Epsilon Carinae|Avior]]'' (Epsilon Carinae) are bright stars in this constellation that never seen in Chinese sky.

==Notable features==
Carina contains [[Canopus]], the second brightest [[star]] in the night sky, and the supermassive star [[Eta Carinae|η Carinae]] which is embedded in the giant [[Eta Carinae Nebula]] (NGC 3372).

Since the [[Milky Way]] runs through Carina, there are a large number of [[open cluster]]s in the constellation. These include [[NGC 2516]] and [[IC 2602]], the latter popularly known as the &quot;Southern Pleiades.&quot; The most notable object in Carina is [[Homunculus Nebula]] in [[NGC 3372]], the Eta Carinae Nebula. It is a planetary nebula visible to the naked eye that is being ejected by the erratic variable star [[Eta Carinae]], one of the Milky Way's largest stars and one not far from becoming a supernova. [[NGC 3532]] is a large binocular cluster having about 150 stars. Carina also contains the naked-eye [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 2808]]. [[Epsilon Carinae]] and [[Upsilon Carinae]] are double stars visible in small telescopes.

Carina contains the radiant of the [[Eta Carinids]] meteor shower, which peaks around January 21 each year.

'''Camelopardalis''' is a large but faint [[constellation]] in the [[celestial sphere|northern sky]]. The constellation was introduced in 1612 (or 1613) by [[Petrus Plancius]]. In older astronomy books, one will sometimes see an alternative spelling of the name, '''Camelopardus'''.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1785, the word ''camelopardalis'' comes from the [[Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcamelopardalis camelopardalis],
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the [[romanisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;καμηλοπάρδαλις&quot; meaning &quot;giraffe&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkamhlopa%2Frdalis καμηλοπάρδαλις],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from &quot;κάμηλος&quot; (''kamēlos''), &quot;camel&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dka%2Fmhlos κάμηλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + &quot;πάρδαλις&quot; (''pardalis''), &quot;leopard&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Frdalis πάρδαλις], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; due to its having a long neck like a camel and spots like a leopard.

==Notable features==
===Stars===
Although Camelopardalis is the 18th largest constellation, it is not a particularly bright constellation, as the brightest stars are only of fourth magnitude. [[Beta Camelopardalis|β Camelopardalis]] is the brightest star, at [[apparent magnitude]] 4.03. This star is a [[double star]], with components of magnitudes 4.0 and 7.4. The second brightest is [[CS Camelopardalis]], which has neither a [[Bayer designation|Bayer]] nor a [[Flamsteed designation]]. It is of magnitude 4.21 and is slightly [[variable star|variable]]. Other double stars interesting to [[Amateur astronomy|amateurs]] are [[OΣ 67 Camelopardalis]] with a greenish companion, [[19 Camelopardalis]] (probably an [[Double star#Optical doubles|optical double]]), and [[Sigma 1694|Σ 1694 Camelopardalis]] (a blue and yellow optical double).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Norton |first=Arthur P. |title=Norton's Star Atlas |year=1973 |pages=118–119 |isbn=0-85248-900-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other variable stars are [[U Camelopardalis]], [[VZ Camelopardalis]], and [[Mira variable]]s [[T Camelopardalis]], [[X Camelopardalis]], and [[R Camelopardalis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nor&quot;/&gt;

In 2011 a supernova was discovered in the constellation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/10-year-old-canadian-girl-youngest-discover-supernova&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep sky objects===
[[Spiral Galaxy NGC 2403|NGC 2403]] is a [[spiral galaxy]] approximately 11 million light years distant. It is of magnitude 8.4. [[NGC 1502]] is a magnitude 6.0 [[open cluster]] about 6,800 [[light year]]s distant. NGC1501 is a planetary nebula. NGC 2655 is a small galaxy. [[IC 342]] is one of the brightest two galaxies in the [[IC 342/Maffei Group]] of galaxies. The dwarf irregular galaxy [[NGC 1569]] is a magnitude 11.9 [[starburst galaxy]], about 11 million light years away.

==History==
[[Image:Camelopardalisurania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Camelopardalis as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Above it are shown the now-abandoned constellations of [[Tarandus (constellation)|Tarandus]] and [[Custos Messium]].]]
The faintness of the constellation, and that of the nearby constellation [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]], led to the early Greeks considering this area of the sky to be empty. Camelopardalis was not defined as a constellation until the seventeenth century and thus has no mythology associated with its stars.

==Visualizations==
{{Incomplete|section|date=February 2009}}

[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars of Camelopardalis into a [[giraffe]] figure.
[[Image:Camelopardalis constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of [[H. A. Rey]]'s method of connecting the stars of the constellation Camelopardalis, in order to show a giraffe.]] &lt;br clear=left&gt;The giraffe's body consists of the quadrangle of stars [[Alpha Camelopardalis|α Cam]], [[beta Camelopardalis|β Cam]], [[BE Camelopardalis|BE Cam]], and [[Gamma Camelopardalis|γ Cam]]: α Cam and β Cam being of the fourth magnitude. The stars [[HD 42818]] (HR 2209) and [[M Camelopardalis|M Cam]] form the [[head]] of the giraffe, and the stars M Cam and α Cam form the giraffe's long [[neck]]. Stars β Cam and [[7 Camelopardalis|7 Cam]] form the giraffe's front leg, and [[variable star]]s BE Cam and [[CS Camelopardalis|CS Cam]] form the giraffe's hind leg.

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Camelopardalis are located within a group of circumpolar stars called the [[Purple Forbidden Enclosure]] (紫微垣 ''Zǐ Wēi Yuán'').

[[File:Foreigners in Yokohama in 1854.jpg|thumb|Foreigners in [[Yokohama]] in 1854.]] 
On March 31, 1854, the {{Nihongo|'''Convention of Kanagawa'''|日米和親条約|Nichibei Washin Jōyaku|&quot;Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Friendship&quot;}} or {{Nihongo|'''Kanagawa Treaty'''|神奈川条約|Kanagawa Jōyaku}} was concluded between [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry]] of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

==Treaty of Peace and Amity (1854)==
The treaty opened the Japanese ports of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] and [[Hakodate]] to [[United States]] trade and guaranteed the safety of shipwrecked U.S. sailors; however, the treaty did not create a basis for establishing a permanent residence in these locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE2D9113CE13BBC4052DFB667838E649FDE  &quot;From Washington; The Japanese Treaty-Its Advantages and Disadvantages-The President and Col. Rinney, &amp;c.,&quot;] ''New York Times.'' October 18, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty did establish a foundation for the Americans to maintain a permanent consul in Shimoda. The arrival of the fleet would trigger the end of Japan's 200 year policy of seclusion ([[Sakoku]]).&lt;ref&gt;*Perry, Matthew Calbraith. (1856). [http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B36599566/ ''Narrative of the expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan, 1856.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KanagawaTreaty.gif|thumb|left|English text of the Kanagawa Treaty.]]
Perry initially refused to deal with Japanese officials and demanded to speak with the Japanese Head of State. At the time, [[Shogun]] [[Tokugawa Ieyoshi]] was the de-facto ruler of Japan; for the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] to interact in any way with foreigners was out of the question. Perry concluded the treaty with representatives of the [[Shogun]], led by plenipotentiary [[Hayashi Akira]] (林韑ら) and the text was reluctantly endorsed subsequently by [[Emperor Komei]].&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Louis M. (2003). ''A History of Japan, 1582-1941: Internal and External Worlds,'' p. 173-185.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Treaty was ratified on 21 February 1855.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)]] exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later treaties==	 
The Kanagawa treaty was followed by the [[United States-Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce]], the &quot;Harris Treaty&quot; of 1858, which allowed the establishment of foreign concessions, extraterritoriality for foreigners, and minimal import taxes for foreign goods. The Japanese chafed under the &quot;[[unequal treaty]] system&quot; which characterized Asian and western relations during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Edström, Bert. (2000). [http://books.google.com/books?id=ltmXn9rUGD8C&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=unequal+treaty+japan&amp;lr=#PPA101,M1  ''The Japanese and Europe: Images and Perceptions,'' p. 101.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kanagawa treaty became a significant causative factor leading to serious internal conflicts within Japan — an upheaval which was only resolved in 1867 with the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} 

Similar treaties were subsequently negotiated by the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty]], October 1854), the [[Russians]] ([[Treaty of Shimoda]], 7 February 1855), the [[French people|French]] ([[Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and Japan]], 9 October 1858).

==Kanagawa Treaty House==
The Convention was negotiated and was then signed in a purpose-built house in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]].

'''Canis Major''' is one of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s, and was included in the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations. Its name is [[Latin]] for 'greater dog', and is commonly represented as one of the dogs following [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter (see also [[Canis Minor]] the 'lesser dog'). Canis Major contains [[Sirius]], the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, known as the 'dog star', which is part of the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the [[Winter Triangle]] in the Northern Hemisphere, or the Summer Triangle in the Southern. The star is also recognized as Canis Major's nose.

==Notable features==
===Stars===
{{See also|list of stars in Canis Major}}

There are several other fairly bright stars (in order of brightness) in Canis Major, all with Arabic names: 

* [[Epsilon Canis Majoris|ε CMa]]: (1.51v) [[Epsilon Canis Majoris|Adhara]] – Virgins
* [[Delta Canis Majoris|δ CMa]]: (1.83) [[Wezen]] – The Weight
* [[Beta Canis Majoris|β CMa]]: (1.98v) [[Murzim]] – The Announcer
* [[Eta Canis Majoris|η CMa]]: (2.45v) [[Aludra]] – The Virgin
* [[Zeta Canis Majoris|ζ CMa]]: (3.02) [[Furud]] – Bright Single One
* [[Gamma Canis Majoris|γ CMa]]: (4.11) [[Muliphen]] – Arabic rendering of the Greek for &quot;Dog's Ear&quot;

===Deep sky objects===
There are not many bright [[deep sky object]]s in this region of sky. The only [[Messier object]] in Canis Major is [[Messier 41]] (NGC 2287), an [[open cluster]] of [[visual magnitude]] 4.6. It is located about 4 degrees directly south of Sirius. Messier 41 is roughly 2350 light years away from Earth, contains about 8,000 stars, and is about 24 light years in diameter. It is also noted for containing a number of [[spectral classification|K-class]] stars.

The band of the [[Milky Way]] goes through Canis Major and therefore background [[galaxy|galaxies]] are hidden behind [[cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] clouds. However, in 2003, [[Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy|Canis Major Dwarf]], the closest [[satellite galaxy]] to Earth, was found within the constellation.
[[Sirius]], its brightest star, means &quot;scorching star&quot;, since the summer heat occurred just after Sirius' [[heliacal rising]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] referred to such times in the summer as ''dog days'', as only dogs would be mad enough to go out in the heat, leading to the star being known as the ''Dog Star''. Consequently, the constellation was named after it, as 'The Big Dog'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In early classical Europe, Canis Major represented the dog{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], a gift from [[Zeus]] to [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]; or sometimes the hound of [[Procris]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana's]] nymph; or the one given by [[Eos|Aurora]] to [[Cephalus]], so famed for its speed that [[Zeus]] elevated it to the sky.

It was also considered to represent Orion's hunting dog, pursuing [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] the [[Hare]] or helping Orion fight [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] the [[Bull]]; and is referred to in this way by [[Aratos]], [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] refer only to one dog, but by [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Canis Minor]] appears as Orion's second dog.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Sirius was considered a dog in its own right, early Greek mythology sometimes the constellation to represent a two-headed dog. As such, together with the area of the sky that is deserted (now considered as the new and extremely faint constellations [[Camelopardalis]] and [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]]), and the other features of the area in the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] (i.e. the [[Milky Way]], and the constellations [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], and [[Canis Minor]]), this may be the origin of the myth of the cattle of [[Geryon]], which forms one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Heracles]].{{Or|date=December 2008}}

Roman myth refers to Canis Major as ''[[Custos Europae]]'', the dog guarding [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] but failing to prevent her abduction by [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in the form of a bull; and as ''[[Cerberus|Janitor Lethaeus]]'', the watchdog. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Canis Major is lied in ''[[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermillion Bird of the South]]'' (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què'').&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}  [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060716.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 16 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the faintness of stars considered, Canis Major can be shown to resemble a dog facing either above or below the [[ecliptic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Popular culture===
In the original [[television]] [[mini-series]] [[V (1983 miniseries)|V]], the Visitors claim to be from a star &quot;in your constellation Canis Major&quot;.

'''Canis Minor''' is a small [[constellation]]. It was included in the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations, and is still included among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;smaller [[dog]]&quot; in contrast to [[Canis Major]], the larger dog, and it is commonly represented as one of the dogs following the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter.

==Notable features==
Canis Minor is a small constellation containing only two bright stars, [[Procyon]] (α CMi, 0.38&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Gomeisa]] (β CMi , 2.9&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;). Procyon is the seventh [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, as well as one of the [[List of nearest stars|closest]]. Procyon means &quot;before the dog&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]], as it rises an hour before the 'Dog Star', [[Sirius]], of [[Canis Major]].

Canis Minor has no [[deep sky]] object brighter than [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 15.

==History and mythology==
The ancient Greeks did not recognize Canis Minor as a distinct constellation, and considered Orion to have had one dog, [[Canis Major]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Canis Minor is sometimes connected with the [[Teumessian fox|Teumessian Fox]], a beast turned into stone with its hunter, [[Laelaps]], by [[Zeus]], who placed them in heaven as Canis Major (Laelaps) and Canis Minor (Teumessian Fox).&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3,192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Canis Minor lies in ''[[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermillion Bird of the South]]'' (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què'').&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}  [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060716.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 16 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centaurus''' is a bright constellation in the [[celestial sphere|southern sky]]. [[list of constellations by area|One of the largest]] constellations in the sky, Centaurus was included among the 48 [[constellation]]s listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

==Notable features==
===Stars===
Centaurus contains the [[Alpha Centauri]] system, a [[triple star system]] consisting of a bright [[binary star]] to which the much fainter [[red dwarf]] [[Proxima Centauri]] is gravitationally bound; Proxima is the nearest known [[star]] to the [[Sun]].

In addition to Alpha Centauri (the [[list of brightest stars|4th brightest star]] in the sky), a second [[apparent magnitude|first magnitude]] star, [[Beta Centauri|Hadar]], is part of Centaurus.

One of the stars in Centaurus ([[BPM 37093]]) is a [[white dwarf]] whose [[carbon]] atoms are thought to have formed a crystalline structure. Since [[diamond]] also consists of carbon arranged in a crystalline lattice (though of a different configuration), scientists have nicknamed this star &quot;Lucy&quot; after the Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azom.com/news.asp?newsID=993|title=Discovery of largest known diamond|date=February 15, 2004|work=AZoM|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep sky objects===
Centaurus contains [[Omega Centauri|ω Centauri]] (NGC 5139) which, despite being the constellation's &quot;omega&quot; listing, is the brightest [[globular cluster]] and largest of its kind in the [[Milky Way]].

The nearby [[lenticular galaxy]], [[astronomical radio source|radio source]] [[Centaurus A]] (NGC 5128), the [[elliptical galaxy]] [[ESO 325-G004]], and the spiral galaxy [[NGC 4444]] are all located in this constellation.

==History==
Mentioned by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in the 4th century BCE and [[Aratus]] in the 3rd century BCE, Centaurus is an ancient constellation. Large as it is now, in earliest times it was even larger, as the constellation [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]] was a sectional [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] within Centaurus as an unspecified animal, possibly a wolf, considered to be either in the centaur's grasp or impaled on its spear. The [[Crux|Southern Cross]], which now is pictured as overlaying the centaur's lower hind legs, was also originally a mere asterism formed of the stars composing those legs. Additionally, what is now the minor constellation [[Circinus]] was then just random stars under the centaur's front hooves. In the 2nd century AD, [[Claudius Ptolemy]] catalogued 37 stars in Centaurus.

While Centaurus now has a high southern latitude, at the dawn of civilization it was an equatorial constellation. [[Precession (astronomy)|Precession]] has been slowly shifting it southward for millennia, and it is now close to its maximal southern [[declination]]. Thousands of years from now it will, once again, be at lower latitudes and be visible worldwide.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Centaurus were divided in three areas. The areas are:
* ''[[Azure Dragon|The Azure Dragon of the East]]'' (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng'')
* ''[[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|The Vermillion Bird of the South]]'' (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què'')
* ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'' (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu''). Constellation Centaurus in Chinese sky is not fully seen and the unseen part were classified in ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'' (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') by [[Xu Guangqi]], based on the knowledge of western star charts. The bright stars of this constellation ([[Alpha Centauri|α Cen]], [[Theta Centauri|θ Cen]], [[Epsilon Centauri|ε Cen]] and [[Eta Centauri|η Cen]]) are seen in Chinese sky, except, possibly ''[[Beta Centauri|Hadar]]'' (Beta Centauri).

===Origins===
The figure of Centaurus can be traced back to a Babylonian constellation known as the Bison-man (MUL.GUD.ALIM). This being was found in two major forms: firstly, as a 4-legged bison with a human head, and secondly, as a being with a man's head and torso attached to the rear legs and tail of a bull or bison. It has been closely associated with the Sun god Utu-Shamash from very early times.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 57ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Centaurus has traditionally been identified as a [[centaur]], a mythological creature, half man, half horse. According to the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (''Fasti'' v.379), the constellation honors the centaur [[Chiron]], who was tutor to many of the earlier Greek heroes including [[Heracles]] (Hercules), Theseus, and [[Jason]], the leader of the Argonauts. However, most authorities consider [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] to be the civilized Chiron, while Centaurus represents a more uncouth member of the species.&lt;ref name=Sagittarius&gt;Sagittarius - &quot;[http://www.stellardays.com/Signs/Sagittarius.aspx The Archer].&quot; Retrieved on September 03, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Centaurus in mythology is given not to a centaur but a human who would later mate with mares and spawn the centaur race.

Centaurus, the [[Centaur]], is one of the largest [[constellations]] in the sky. It represents [[Chiron]], one of the half-man, half-horse beasts of [[Greek mythology]]. [[Chiron]] was accidentally wounded by [[Hercules]]. After his death, [[Hercules]] honored him by giving him a place in the stars. Under a dark sky, the outline of the [[constellation]] does indeed resemble a [[centaur]]. Centaurus is the site of the third brightest star in the sky, [[Rigel Kentaurus]], at magnitude -0.01. This star is actually part of a triple star system, which includes the well-known star, [[Alpha Centauri]]. These are actually the closest stars to our own solar system. Another star in Centaurus, [[Agena]], is the tenth brightest star in the night sky. This [[constellation]] contains no Messier objects.

==Centaurus as the name==
[[USS Centaurus (AKA-17)]] and [[USS Centaurus (AK-264)]], both of [[United States]] navy ships.

[[Image:Tycho crater on the Moon.jpg|thumb|300px|The prominent impact crater [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho]] on the [[Moon]].]]
In the broadest sense, the term '''impact crater'''  can be applied to any depression, natural or manmade, resulting from the high velocity impact of a projectile with a larger body. In most common usage, the term is used for the approximately circular [[depression (geology)|depression]] in the surface of a [[planet]], [[natural satellite|moon]] or other solid body in the [[Solar System]], formed by the [[hypervelocity]] [[collision|impact]] of a smaller body with the surface. In contrast to [[volcanic crater]]s, which result from explosion or internal collapse,&lt;ref&gt;Basaltic Volcanism Study Project. (1981). Basaltic Volcanism on the Terrestrial Planets; Pergamon Press, Inc: New York, p. 746. http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/book/bvtp./1981//0000746.000.html.&lt;/ref&gt; impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Consolmagno, G.J.; Schaefer, M.W. (1994). ''Worlds Apart: A Textbook in Planetary Sciences;'' Prentice Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; Impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. [[Meteor Crater]] is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on the Earth.

Impact craters are the dominant landforms on many solid Solar System objects including the [[Moon]], [[mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and most small moons and [[asteroid]]s.  On other planets and moons that experience more-active surface geological processes, such as [[Earth]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[io (moon)|Io]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], visible impact craters are less common because they become [[erosion|eroded]], buried or transformed by [[tectonics]] over time.  Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography, the terms [[impact structure]] or astrobleme are more commonly used.  In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms [[cryptoexplosion]] or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;French, B.M. (1998). ''Traces of Catastrophe: A Handbook of Shock-Metamorphic Effects in Terrestrial Meteorite Impact Structures;'' Simthsonian Institution: Washington DC, p. 97. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/CB-954.intro.html.&lt;/ref&gt;           

In the early Solar System, rates of impact cratering were much higher than today.  The large multi-ringed impact basins, with diameters of hundreds of kilometers or more, retained for example on Mercury and the Moon, record a period of [[Late Heavy Bombardment|intense early bombardment]] in the inner Solar System that ended about 3.8 billion years ago.  Since that time, the rate of crater production on Earth has been considerably lower, but it is appreciable nonetheless; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20&amp;nbsp;km diameter crater about once every million years on average.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, M.H. (2006) ''The surface of Mars;'' Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grieve R.A.; Shoemaker, E.M. (1994). The Record of Past Impacts on Earth in ''Hazards due to Comets and Asteroids,'' T. Gehrels, Ed.; University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ, pp. 417-464.&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far. 

Although the Earth’s active surface processes quickly destroy the impact record, about 170 terrestrial impact craters have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Grieve, R.A.F.; Cintala, M.J.; Tagle, R. (2007). Planetary Impacts in ''Encyclopedia of the Solar System,'' 2nd ed., L-A. McFadden et al. Eds, p. 826.&lt;/ref&gt;  These range in diameter from a few tens of meters up to about 300&amp;nbsp;km, and they range in age from recent times (e.g. the [[Sikhote-Alin Meteorite|Sikhote-Alin craters]] in [[Russia]] whose creation were witnessed in 1947) to more than two billion years, though most are less than 500 million years old because geological processes tend to obliterate older craters. They are also selectively found in the [[craton|stable interior regions of continents]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, E.M.; Shoemaker, C.S. (1999). The Role of Collisions in ''The New Solar System,'' 4th ed., J.K. Beatty et al., Eds., p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Few undersea craters have been discovered because of the difficulty of surveying the sea floor, the rapid rate of change of the ocean bottom, and the [[subduction|subduction of the ocean floor]] into the Earth's interior by processes of [[plate tectonics]].

Impact craters are not to be confused with other landforms that in some cases appear similar, including [[caldera]]s and [[ring dike]]s.

==History==
[[Image:Eugene Shoemaker.jpg|thumb|left|Eugene Shoemaker, pioneer impact crater researcher, here at a stereoscopic microscope used for asteroid discovery]]

[[Daniel Barringer (geologist)|Daniel Barringer]] (1860–1929) was one of the first to identify an impact crater, [[Meteor Crater]] in [[Arizona]]; to crater specialists the site is referred to as [[Barringer Crater]] in his honor. Initially Barringer's ideas were not widely accepted, and even when the origin of Meteor Crater was finally acknowledged, the wider implications for impact cratering as a significant geological process on Earth were not.

In the 1920s, the American geologist [[Walter H. Bucher]] studied a number of sites now recognized as impact craters in the USA. He concluded they had been created by some great explosive event, but believed that this force was probably [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin.  However, in 1936, the geologists [[John D. Boon]] and [[Claude C. Albritton Jr.]] revisited Bucher's studies and concluded that the craters that he studied were probably formed by impacts. 

The concept of impact cratering remained more or less speculative until the 1960s. At this time a number of researchers, most notably [[Eugene M. Shoemaker]], (co-discoverer of the comet [[Shoemaker-Levy 9]]), conducted detailed studies of a number of craters and recognized clear evidence that they had been created by impacts, specifically identifying the [[Shock metamorphism|shock-metamorphic]] effects uniquely associated with impact events, of which the most familiar is [[shocked quartz]]. 

Armed with the knowledge of shock-metamorphic features, [[Carlyle S. Beals]] and colleagues at the [[Dominion Observatory]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and [[Wolf von Engelhardt]] of the [[University of Tübingen]] in [[Germany]] began a methodical search for impact craters. By 1970, they had tentatively identified more than 50. Although their work was controversial, the American [[Apollo program|Apollo]] Moon landings, which were in progress at the time, provided supportive evidence by recognizing the rate of impact cratering on the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;Grieve, R.A.F. (1990) Impact Cratering on the Earth. ''Scientific American,'' April 1990, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Processes of erosion on the Moon are minimal and so craters persist almost indefinitely. Since the Earth could be expected to have roughly the same cratering rate as the Moon, it became clear that the Earth had suffered far more impacts than could be seen by counting evident craters.

==Crater formation==
[[Image:Impact movie.ogg|thumb|A laboratory simulation of an impact event and crater formation]]
Impact cratering involves high velocity collisions between solid objects, typically much greater than the [[speed of sound|velocity of sound]] in those objects.  Such hyper-velocity impacts produce physical effects such as [[melting]] and [[Evaporation|vaporization]] that do not occur in familiar sub-sonic collisions.  On Earth, ignoring the slowing effects of travel through the atmosphere, the lowest impact velocity with an object from space is equal to the gravitational [[escape velocity]] of about 11&amp;nbsp;km/s.  The fastest impacts occur at more than 70&amp;nbsp;km/s, calculated by summing the escape velocity from Earth, the escape velocity from the Sun at the Earth's [[orbit]], and the motion of the Earth around the Sun.  The [[median]] impact velocity on Earth is about 20 to 25&amp;nbsp;km/s.

Impacts at these high speeds produce [[shock wave]]s in solid materials, and both impactor and the material impacted are rapidly [[compression (physical)|compressed]] to high density. Following initial compression, the high-density, over-compressed region rapidly depressurizes, exploding violently, to set in train the sequence of events that produces the impact crater. Impact-crater formation is therefore more closely analogous to cratering by [[explosive material|high explosives]] than by mechanical displacement. Indeed, the [[energy density]] of some material involved in the formation of impact craters is many times higher than that generated by high explosives. Since craters are caused by [[explosion]]s, they are nearly always circular – only very low-angle impacts cause significantly elliptical craters.&lt;ref&gt;Melosh, H.J., 1989, Impact cratering: A geologic process: New York, Oxford University Press, 245 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is convenient to divide the impact process conceptually into three distinct stages: (1) initial contact and compression, (2) excavation, (3) modification and collapse.  In practice, there is overlap between the three processes with, for example, the excavation of the crater continuing in some regions while modification and collapse is already underway in others.

===Contact and compression===
In the absence of [[atmosphere]], the impact process begins when the impactor first touches the target surface.  This contact [[acceleration|accelerates]] the target and decelerates the impactor.  Because the impactor is moving so rapidly, the rear of the object moves a significant distance during the short-but-finite time taken for the deceleration to propagate across the impactor.    As a result, the impactor is compressed, its density rises, and the [[pressure]] within it increases dramatically.  Peak pressures in large impacts exceed 1 [[Tera-|T]][[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] to reach values more usually found deep in the interiors of planets, or generated artificially in [[nuclear explosions]].

In physical terms, a [[supersonic]] shock wave initiates from the point of contact.  As this shock wave expands, it decelerates and compresses the impactor, and it accelerates and compresses the target. Stress levels within the shock wave far exceed the strength of solid materials; consequently, both the impactor and the target close to the impact site are irreversibly damaged.  Many crystalline minerals can be transformed into higher-density phases by shock waves; for example, the common mineral quartz can be transformed into the higher-pressure forms [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]].  Many other shock-related changes take place within both impactor and target as the shock wave passes through, and some of these changes can be used as diagnostic tools to determine whether particular geological features were produced by impact cratering.

As the shock wave decays, the shocked region decompresses towards more usual pressures and densities. The damage produced by the shock wave raises the temperature of the material. In all but the smallest impacts this increase in temperature is sufficient to melt the impactor, and in larger impacts to vaporize most of it and to melt large volumes of the target. As well as being heated, the target near the impact is accelerated by the shock wave, and it continues moving away from the impact behind the decaying shock wave.

===Excavation===
Contact, compression, decompression, and the passage of the shock wave all occur within a few tenths of a second for a large impact. The subsequent excavation of the crater occurs more slowly, and during this stage the flow of material is largely sub-sonic. During excavation, the crater grows as the accelerated target material moves away from the impact point. The target's motion is initially downwards and outwards, but it becomes outwards and upwards. The flow initially produces an approximately hemispherical cavity. The cavity continues to grow, eventually producing a [[paraboloid]] (bowl-shaped) crater in which the centre has been pushed down, a significant volume of material has been ejected, and a topographically elevated crater rim has been pushed up.  When this cavity has reached its maximum size, it is called the transient cavity.  

[[Image:Mimas moon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herschel (Mimantean crater)|Herschel Crater]] on Saturn's moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]]]]

The depth of the transient cavity is typically a quarter to a third of its diameter. [[Ejecta]] thrown out of the crater do not include material excavated from the full depth of the transient cavity; typically the depth of maximum excavation is only about a third of the total depth.  As a result, about one third of the volume of the transient crater is formed by the ejection of material, and the remaining two thirds is formed by the displacement of material downwards, outwards and upwards, to form the elevated rim.  For impacts into highly porous materials, a significant crater volume may also be formed by the permanent compaction of the [[pore space]]. Such compaction craters may be important on many asteroids, comets and small moons. 

In large impacts, as well as material displaced and ejected to form the crater, significant volumes of target material may be melted and vaporized together with the original impactor.  Some of this impact melt rock may be ejected, but most of it remains within the transient crater, initially forming a layer of impact melt coating the interior of the transient cavity.  In contrast, the hot dense vaporized material expands rapidly out of the growing cavity, carrying some solid and molten material within it as it does so.  As this hot vapor cloud expands, it rises and cools much like the archetypal mushroom cloud generated by large nuclear explosions.  In large impacts, the expanding vapor cloud may rise to many times the scale height of the atmosphere, effectively expanding into free space.

Most material ejected from the crater is deposited within a few crater radii, but a small fraction may travel large distances at high velocity, and in large impacts it may exceed [[escape velocity]] and leave the impacted planet or moon entirely.  The majority of the fastest material is ejected from close to the center of impact, and the slowest material is ejected close to the rim at low velocities to form an overturned coherent flap of ejecta immediately outside the rim.  As ejecta escapes from the growing crater, it forms an expanding curtain in the shape of an inverted cone; the trajectory of individual particles within the curtain is thought to be largely ballistic.

Small volumes of un-melted and relatively un-shocked material may be [[spall]]ed at very high relative velocities from the surface of the target and from the rear of the impactor.  Spalling provides a potential mechanism whereby material may be ejected into inter-planetary space largely undamaged, and whereby small volumes of the impactor may be preserved undamaged even in large impacts.  Small volumes of high-speed material may also be generated early in the impact by jetting.  This occurs when two surfaces converge rapidly and obliquely at a small angle, and high-temperature highly shocked material is expelled from the convergence zone with velocities that may be several times larger than the impact velocity.

===Modification and collapse===
[[Image:Conical mound in trough on Mars' north pole.jpg|thumb|Weathering may change the aspect of a crater drastically. This mound on [[Mars]]' north pole may be the result of an impact crater that was buried by [[sediment]] and subsequently re-exposed by [[erosion]].]]
In most circumstances, the transient cavity is not stable: it collapses under gravity.  In small craters, less than about 4&amp;nbsp;km diameter on Earth, there is some limited collapse of the crater rim coupled with debris sliding down the crater walls and drainage of impact melts into the deeper cavity.  The resultant structure is called a simple crater, and it remains bowl-shaped and superficially similar to the transient crater.   In simple craters, the original excavation cavity is overlain by a lens of collapse [[breccia]], ejecta and melt rock, and a portion of the central crater floor may sometimes be flat.

[[Image:Valhalla crater on Callisto.jpg|thumb|left|Multi-ringed impact basin Valhalla on Jupiter's moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]]]  

Above a certain threshold size, which varies with planetary gravity, the collapse and modification of the transient cavity is much more extensive, and the resulting structure is called a [[complex crater]].  The collapse of the transient cavity is driven by gravity, and involves both the uplift of the central region and the inward collapse of the rim.  The central uplift is not the result of ''elastic rebound'' which is a process in which a material with elastic strength attempts to return to its original geometry; rather the collapse is a process in which a material with little or no strength attempts to return to a state of gravitational equilibrium.  

Complex craters have uplifted centers, and they have typically broad flat shallow crater floors, and terraced walls.  At the largest sizes, one or more exterior or interior rings may appear, and the structure may be labeled an ''impact basin'' rather than an impact crater.  Complex-crater morphology on rocky planets appears to follow a regular sequence with increasing size: small complex craters with a central topographic peak are called ''central peak craters'', for example [[tycho (crater)|Tycho]]; intermediate-sized craters, in which the central peak is replaced by a ring of peaks, are called ''peak-ring craters'', for example [[schrodinger (crater)|Schrödinger]]; and the largest craters contain multiple concentric topographic rings, and are called ''multi-ringed basins'', for example [[mare orientale|Orientale]].  On icy as opposed to rocky bodies, other morphological forms appear which may have central pits rather than central peaks, and at the largest sizes may contain very many concentric rings – [[Valhalla (crater)|Valhalla]] on Callisto is the type example of the latter.

==Identifying impact craters==
[[File:Craterstructure.gif|thumb|right|250px|Impact crater structure]]
[[Image:Azuara-impact-structure-Shocked breccia.jpg|thumb|Shocked polymictic [[breccia]] from the [[Azuara impact structure]], Spain.]]
[[Image:GneissBoulderOsmussaar.jpg|thumb|Boulder of [[gneiss]] [[breccia]] on [[Osmussaar]], [[Estonia]], apparently thrown there by the [[Neugrund]] impact.]]
Some volcanic features can resemble impact craters, and [[breccia]]ted [[clastic rocks|rocks]] are associated with other geological formations besides impact craters. Non-explosive volcanic craters can usually be distinguished from impact craters by their irregular shape and the association of volcanic flows and other volcanic materials. An exception is that impact craters on Venus often have associated flows of melted material.

The distinctive mark of an impact crater is the presence of rock that has undergone shock-metamorphic effects, such as [[shatter cone]]s, melted rocks, and crystal deformations. The problem is that these materials tend to be deeply buried, at least for simple craters. They tend to be revealed in the uplifted center of a complex crater, however.

Impacts produce distinctive [[Shock metamorphism|shock-metamorphic]] effects that allow impact sites to be distinctively identified. Such shock-metamorphic effects can include:

[[Image:Wells creek shatter cones 2.JPG|thumb|right|Close-up of shatter cones developed in fine grained [[dolomite]] from the [[Wells Creek crater]], USA.]]
* A layer of shattered or &quot;[[breccia]]ted&quot; rock under the floor of the crater. This layer is called a &quot;breccia lens&quot;.
* [[Shatter cone]]s, which are chevron-shaped impressions in rocks. Such cones are formed most easily in fine-grained rocks.
* High-temperature rock types, including laminated and welded blocks of sand, [[spherulite]]s and [[tektite]]s, or glassy spatters of molten rock. The impact origin of tektites has been questioned by some researchers; they have observed some volcanic features in tektites not found in impactites. Tektites are also drier (contain less water) than typical impactites. While rocks melted by the impact resemble volcanic rocks, they incorporate unmelted fragments of bedrock, form unusually large and unbroken fields, and have a much more mixed chemical composition than volcanic materials spewed up from within the Earth. They also may have relatively large amounts of trace elements that are associated with meteorites, such as nickel, platinum, iridium, and cobalt. Note: it is reported in the scientific literature that some &quot;shock&quot; features, such as small shatter cones, which are often reported as being associated only with impact events, have been found in terrestrial volcanic ejecta.
* Microscopic pressure deformations of minerals. These include fracture patterns in crystals of quartz and feldspar, and formation of high-pressure materials such as diamond, derived from graphite and other carbon compounds, or [[stishovite]] and [[coesite]], varieties of [[shocked quartz]].

'''Corona Borealis''' is a small [[constellation]] in the northern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;northern crown&quot;, a name inspired by its shape; its main [[star]]s form a semicircular arc. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Corona Borealis is lied in ''[[Heavenly Market enclosure]]'' (天市垣, ''Tiān Shì Yuán'')&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0606/ap060626.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 6 月 26 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep sky objects ===
Corona Borealis contains no bright deep sky objects.  [[Abell 2065]] is a highly concentrated [[galaxy cluster]] containing over 400 members, the
brightest of which are of [[apparent magnitude|16th magnitude]].

== Mythology ==
Corona Borealis was sometimes considered to represent a crown that was given by [[Dionysus]] to [[Ariadne]], the daughter of [[Minos]] of Crete (the story is told by [[Ovid]], &quot;Fasti&quot; III 459-516). At other points it was considered to belong, in a sense, to [[Boötes]], the herdsman.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The [[Cheyenne]] nation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] called it the &quot;Camp Circle&quot; as they arranged their camps in a semicircle.

In [[Welsh mythology]], the Northern Crown was called [[Caer]] [[Arianrhod]], ‘the Castle of the Silver Circle,’ and was the heavenly abode of the Lady [[Arianrhod]] (Squire, 2000:154-155).

'''Cygnus''' is a northern [[constellation]] lying on the plane of the [[Milky Way]]. Its name is the [[Latin]]ized [[Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]) word for [[swan]]. One of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, it features a prominent [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the '''Northern Cross''' (in contrast to the [[Southern Cross]]). Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

== Notable features ==
=== Stars ===
[[Albireo]] (β Cygni, designated by the Greek letter β in the diagram), a double star with blue and yellow components is at the &quot;head&quot;. [[Deneb]] (α Cygni), its brightest star, is at the tail and is one star of the [[summer triangle]].

[[Image:Albireo.jpg|thumb|left|The two component stars of Albireo are easily distinguished, even in a small telescope.]]

=== Deep sky objects ===
[[Image:IRAS 19475+3119.jpg|thumb|right|This Hubble Space Telescope picture captures a brief but beautiful phase late in the life of a star. The curious cloud around this bright star is called IRAS 19475+3119. It lies in the constellation of Cygnus (the Swan) about 15 000 light-years from Earth in the plane of our Milky Way galaxy.]]
Several [[star cluster]]s and [[nebula]]e are found in Cygnus due to its position on the Milky Way. The [[North America Nebula]] ([[New General Catalogue|NGC]] 7000) is found a bit to the east of Deneb. Its resemblance to the continent is best appreciated in photographs. The [[Pelican Nebula]] ([[Index Catalog|IC]] 5070) is nearby.

To the south of [[Epsilon Cygni]] is the [[Veil Nebula]] (NGC 6960, 6962, 6979, 6992, and 6995) which is an ancient [[supernova remnant]] covering approximately 3 degrees of the sky. 

Also of note is the [[Crescent Nebula]] (NGC 6888), located between Gamma and Eta Cygni, which was formed by the [[Wolf-Rayet star]] [[WR 136|HD 192163]].

More [[supernova]]e have been seen in the [[Fireworks Galaxy]] (NGC 6946) than in any other [[galaxy]].

The constellation also contains the X-ray source [[Cygnus X-1]], which is now thought to be caused by a black hole accreting matter in a binary star system. The system is located close to the star Eta Cygni on star charts.

=== Extrasolar planets ===
Several [[extrasolar planet]]s including [[HAT-P-7b]], [[HAT-P-11b]], [[HD 185269 b]], [[HD 187123 b]] and [[HD 187123 c|c]], [[Gliese 777 b]] and [[Gliese 777 c|c]], and [[16 Cygni Bb]], have been discovered in Cygnus. In January 2010 the [[Kepler Mission]] announced the discovery of the additional planets [[Kepler-5b]] and [[Kepler-6b]], which are expected to be the first of many discovered by the mission, which has a significant part of its field of view in Cygnus.

== History and mythology ==
One story based in Greek mythology told of two close friends, Cygnus and Phaeton, who were continually competing. One day, they each challenged the other to a race across the sky, around the Sun, and back to Earth. In an effort to gain the advantage, they both cut too closely to the Sun and their
chariots were burned up. They both fell to the Earth and were knocked unconscious. Upon recovering, Cygnus began looking for his friend, Phaeton, and discovered his body trapped by the roots of a tree at the bottom of the Eridanus River. In an effort to retrieve his friend’s body and give it a proper burial, Cygnus repeatedly dove into the river, but could not reach his friend’s body. While he sat grieving on the bank of the river, Cygnus begged for Zeus to help him. Zeus replied that if he gave Cygnus the body of a swan, he would be able to dive deeply enough to retrieve his friend’s body. However, if Cygnus did take on the body of a swan, he would also be giving up his immortality and
would only live as long as a swan would normally live. Cygnus readily agreed to this in order to retrieve his friend’s body and give him a proper burial, allowing his friend’s spirit to travel into the afterlife. In honor of this great unselfish act, Zeus placed Cygnus’ image (that of a swan) into the night sky.

[[Image:Cygnusurania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cygnus as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Surrounding it are Lacerta, Vulpecula and Lyra.]]
The constellation can be represented as looking like a wide winged, long necked bird, in graceful flight&lt;!-- [http://borghetto.astrofili.org/costellazioni/cygnus.JPG] dead link--&gt;.

In [[Greek mythology]], it has been identified with several different legendary swans. [[Zeus]] disguised himself as a swan to seduce [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], who gave birth to the [[Castor and Pollux|Gemini]], [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Clytemnestra]]; [[Orpheus]] was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his [[lyre]] ([[Lyra]]); and the King [[Cycnus]] was transformed into a swan.

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', there are three people named Cygnus, all of whom are transformed into swans. Alongside Cycnus, noted above, he mentions a boy from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]] who commits suicide when [[Phyllius]] refuses to give him a tamed bull that he demands, but is transformed into a swan and flies away. He also mentions a son of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] who is an invulnerable warrior in the [[Trojan War]] who is eventually defeated by [[Achilles]], but Neptune saves him by transforming him into a swan.

Cygnus, together with other [[bird|avian]] constellations near the [[summer solstice]], [[Lyra#History|Vultur cadens]] and [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], may be a significant part of the origin of the myth of the [[Stymphalian Birds]], one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1963) p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese mythology]], the constellation Cygnus is the site of the once-a-year [[magpie]] bridge ([[:zh:鹊桥|鹊桥]], Que Qiao) which connects the lovers Niu Lang and Zhi Nu (see [[Qi Xi]]).

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation ''[[Cygnus]]'' is lied in ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|The Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the unit of energy|its use in nutrition and food labeling regulations|Food energy|the study of reduced calorie intake|CALERIE}}
{{Redirect|Calories|the 1951 short story|Calories (story)}}

The '''calorie'''  is a pre-[[SI]] [[metric system|metric]] [[unit of energy]]. It was first defined by [[Nicolas Clément]] in 1824 as a unit of [[heat]], entering French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology: French ''calorie'', from Latin ''calor'' meaning &quot;heat&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In most fields its use is archaic, having been replaced by the SI unit of energy, the [[joule]]. However, in many countries it remains in common use as a unit of [[food energy]].

Definitions of a calorie fall into two classes:
* The '''small calorie''' or '''gram calorie''' (symbol: cal)&lt;ref name=mw&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary Def 1a http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calorie&lt;/ref&gt; approximates the energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 [[gram]] of [[water]] by 1&amp;nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]]. This is about 4.2 joules.
* The '''large calorie''', '''kilogram calorie''', '''dietary calorie''' or '''food calorie''' (symbol: Cal)&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; approximates the energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 [[kilogram]] of water by 1&amp;nbsp;°C. This is exactly 1000 small calories or about 4.2 [[kilojoule]]s.

In an attempt to avoid confusion the large calorie is sometimes written as ''Calorie'' (with a capital ''C'').  This convention, however, is not always followed, and not explained to the average person clearly (and is sometimes impossible&lt;!-- like at the start of a sentence --&gt;). Whether the large or small calorie is intended often must be inferred from context. When used in scientific contexts, the term ''calorie'' refers to the small calorie.

The gram calorie, however, is a very small unit for use in nutritional contexts. Larger units are therefore used. The '''kilocalorie''' (symbol: '''kcal'''), being 1000 small calories, is one such unit. The large calorie, usually referred to simply as ''calorie'', is also used.  These are equivalent (1&amp;nbsp;kcal  = 1&amp;nbsp;Cal).&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; Therefore, in nutritional contexts the ''calorie'' and ''kilocalorie'' are the same size.

==Variations==
The energy needed to increase the temperature of a gram of water by 1&amp;nbsp;°C depends on the starting temperature and is difficult to measure precisely. Accordingly, there have been several definitions of the calorie. The two perhaps most popular definitions used in older literature are the 15&amp;nbsp;°C calorie and the thermochemical calorie.

The factors used to convert measurements in calories to their equivalents in joules are numerically equivalent to expressions of the [[specific heat capacity]] of water in joules per gram or kilojoules per kilogram.

==Conversions==
The [[Conversion of units#Energy, work, or amount of heat|conversion]] factor between calories and joules is numerically equivalent to the [[specific heat capacity]] of liquid water (in SI units).

One '''gram''' calorie is approximately:
* {{val|4.184|u=J}} ([[joule]]s)
* {{val|.003964|u=BTU}} ([[British thermal unit]]s)
* {{val|1.163|e=-6|u=kWh}} ([[kilowatt hour]]s)
* {{val|2.611|e=19|u=eV}} ([[electron volt]]s)

One '''kilogram''' calorie (food calorie) is approximately:
* {{val|4.184|u=kJ}}
* {{val|3.964|u=BTU}}
* {{val|.001163|u=kWh}}
* {{val|2.611|e=22|u=eV}}

'''Corona Australis''' or '''Corona Austrina''' is a [[constellation]]. Its name means &quot;[[south]]ern [[crown (headgear)|crown]]&quot;, and it contrasts with [[Corona Borealis]], the northern crown. Corona Australis was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Corona Australis lies in ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|The Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'')&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}   [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060702.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 2 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

The only star in the constellation to have received a name is [[Alpha Coronae Australis|Alfecca Meridiana, or Alpha CrA]]. The name combines the [[Arabic]] name of the constellation with the [[Latin]] for 'middle'.

CrA also harbours [[RX J1856.5-3754]], an isolated [[neutron star]] that is one of the closest to the earth at approximately 200 light years and suspected to be a [[Quark star#Strange star|strange star]].

[[Image:Cristo Redentor Rio de Janeiro 2.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Cristo Redentor]] atop Corcovado]]

'''Corcovado''', meaning &quot;[[hunchback]]&quot; in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno/ingles/index.php?lingua=portugues-ingles&amp;palavra=corcovado]&lt;/ref&gt; is a mountain in central [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The {{convert|710|m|ft|0|adj=on}} [[granite]] peak is located in the [[Tijuca Forest]], a national park.  

Corcovado hill lies just west of the city center but is wholly within the city limits and visible from great distances. It is known worldwide for the 38-meter (125&amp;nbsp;ft) statue of [[Jesus]] atop its peak, entitled ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Cristo Redentor]]'' or &quot;[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]&quot;.

==Access==
The peak and statue can be accessed via a narrow road or by the 3.8 kilometer (2.4&amp;nbsp;mi) [[Corcovado Rack Railway]] which was opened in 1884 and refurbished in 1980. The railway uses two-car electrically powered trains, with a passenger capacity of 360 passengers per hour.  The rail trip takes approximately 20 minutes and departs every half hour.  Due to its limited passenger capacity, the wait to board at the entry station can take several hours.  The year-round schedule is 8:30 to 18:30.

From the train terminus and road, the observation deck at the foot of the statue is reached by 223 steps, or by [[elevator]]s and [[escalator]]s. Among the most popular year-round tourist attractions in Rio, the Corcovado railway, access roads, and statue platform are commonly crowded.

==Attractions==
The most popular attraction of Corcovado mountain is the statue and viewing platform at its peak, drawing over 300,000 visitors per year. From the peak's platform the panoramic view includes downtown Rio, [[Sugarloaf Mountain, Brazil|Sugarloaf Mountain]], the [[Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas]] (lake), [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] and [[Ipanema]] beaches, [[Estádio do Maracanã]] (Maracanã Stadium), and several of Rio's [[favela]]s.  Cloud cover is common in Rio and the view from the platform is often obscured.  Sunny days are recommended for optimal viewing.

Notable past visitors to the mountain peak include [[Pope Pius XII]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], [[German Sueiro Vasquez]], [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. An additional attraction of the mountain is [[rock climbing]]. The south face had 54 climbing routes as of 1992. The easiest way starts from Park Lage.

==Geology==
The peak of Corcovado is a big [[granite dome]], which describes a generally vertical rocky formation. It is claimed to be the highest such formation in Brazil, the second highest being Pedra Agulha, situated near to the town of [[Pancas, Espírito Santo|Pancas]] in Esprito Santo.

==Popular culture==
[[Corcovado (song)|Corcovado]] is a famous [[bossa nova]] song written by [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]] in the mid-1960s. It is also mentioned in the [[Ben Harper]] song titled &quot;Blessed to be a Witness&quot;.

Corcovado is also a [[electronic house]] song by Ray Knox that became popular in late 2010.

Corcovado shows resemblance to the [[Modern Warfare 2]] map Favela.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Cheddar''' is a large [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Sedgemoor]] district of the English county of [[Somerset]]. It is situated on the southern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]], {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} north-west of [[Wells]]. The civil parish includes the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s of Nyland and Bradley Cross. The village, which has its own parish council, has a population of 5,093 and the parish has an acreage of {{convert|8592 |acres}} as of 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheddar CP/AP through time acreage|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&amp;data_cube=N_AREA_ACRES&amp;u_id=10423909&amp;c_id=10001043&amp;add=Y|work=A vision of Britain through time|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheddar Gorge]] is the largest [[canyon|gorge]] in the United Kingdom and includes several show caves including [[Gough's Cave]]. The gorge has been a centre of human settlement since [[Neolithic]] times, including a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] palace. It has a temperate climate and provides a unique geological and biological environment that has been recognised by the designation of several [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheddar Gorge and Caves|url=http://www.bristol-link.co.uk/entertainment/cheddar-gorge.htm|publisher=Bristol-link | accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the site of several limestone quarries. The village gave its name to [[Cheddar cheese]] and has been a centre for [[Fragaria|strawberry]] growing, with the crop being transported on the [[Cheddar Valley line]], which closed in the late 1960s but is now a cycle path. It is now a major tourist destination with several cultural and community facilities, including the Cheddar Show Caves Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chedder Man—Museum of Prehistory|url=http://www.cheddarcaves.co.uk/section.php?xSec=20 | accessdate=31 January 2011|publisher=Cheddar Caves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village supports a variety of community groups including religious, sporting and cultural organisations. Several of these are based on the site of [[The Kings of Wessex School]], which is the largest educational establishment.

== History ==

There is evidence of occupation from the [[Neolithic]] period in Cheddar.

The remains of a Roman villa have been excavated in the grounds of the current [[Rectory|vicarage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;curio&quot;/&gt;

The village of Cheddar had been important during during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Saxon]] eras.

== Geography ==

[[Image:Cheddar Village - Mendip Hills - Somerset - England - Project Gutenberg eText 12287.jpg|thumb|right|Cheddar Gorge c.&amp;nbsp;1907]]

The area is underlain by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the [[Carboniferous]] [[Limestone]] Series, which contain [[Oolite|ooliths]] and [[fossil]] debris on top of [[Old Red Sandstone]], and by [[Dolomite|Dolomitic Conglomerate]] of the [[Keuper]]. Evidence for [[Variscan orogeny]] is seen in the sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.&lt;ref name=&quot;sssi&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Cheddar Complex | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | accessdate=2006-07-17|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gorge and caves ===
{{Main|Cheddar Gorge}}
[[Cheddar Gorge]], which is located on the edge of the village, is the largest [[canyon|gorge]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/may05/Travels0505.html | title= Cheddar Gorge: Not entirely cheesy | month= May | year= 2005 | work= Geotimes, a publication of the American Geological Institute | accessdate=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gorge is the site of the Cheddar Caves, where [[Cheddar Man]] was found in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourist hotspots—Cheddar Gorge&quot;/&gt; Older remains from the [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Late Palaeolithic]] era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;webapp1.somerset.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; The caves, produced by the activity of an underground river, contain [[stalactites]] and [[stalagmites]]. [[Gough's Cave]], which was discovered in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=033406&amp;itemw=4&amp;itemf=0001&amp;itemstep=1&amp;itemx=1 |title=Gough's Cave excavation site |publisher=Natural History Museum|accessdate=7 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leads around {{convert|400|m|yd|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} into the rock-face, and contains a variety of large rock chambers and formations.

Cheddar Gorge, including Cox's Cave, Gough's Cave and other attractions, has become a [[tourism|tourist]] destination, attracting about 500,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebmc.co.uk/Feature.aspx?id=1843 | title = Access Q&amp;A: Cheddar Gorge | work = British Mountaineering Council | year = 1999 | accessdate =12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2005 [[opinion poll|poll]] of ''[[Radio Times]]'' readers, following its appearance on the 2005 television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'', Cheddar Gorge was named as the second greatest natural wonder in Britain, surpassed only by the [[Dan yr Ogof]] caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/mid_/4735935.stm |title = Caves win 'natural wonder' vote | work = [[BBC]] | date =2 August 2005 | accessdate =7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sites of Special Scientific Interest ===

[[Image:Cheddarreser.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cheddar Reservoir]] at dusk, looking towards the western edge of the [[Mendip Hills]] and [[Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill|Crook Peak]]]]
There are several large and unique [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) around the village.

[[Cheddar Reservoir]] is a near-circular artificial reservoir operated by [[Bristol Water]]. Dating from the 1930s, it has a capacity of 135&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;gallons (614,000&amp;nbsp;cubic&amp;nbsp;metres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/cheddar-info.asp|title=Cheddar Reservoir Introduction|publisher=Bristol Water|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reservoir is supplied with water taken from the [[Cheddar Yeo]], which rises in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge and is a tributary of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]]. The inlet grate for the {{convert|54|in|m|1|adj=on|abbr=off}} water pipe that is used to transport the water can be seen next to the [[sensory garden]] in Cheddar Gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axbridge Raw Water Treatment Works|url=http://www.ceequal.co.uk/awards_035.htm|work=Axbridge Raw Water|publisher=CEEQUAL|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its wintering waterfowl populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1003948 |title=English Nature SSSI information for Cheddar Reservoir |publisher=[[English Nature]] |accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheddar Wood]] and the smaller Macall's Wood form a [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] from what remains of the wood of the [[Bishops of Bath and Wells]] in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century and of [[Edmund I of England|King Edmund]] the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make [[strawberry]] fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was [[coppice]]d until 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the medieval landscape of Somerset |last=Aston |first=Michael |authorlink=Mick Aston |coauthors= |year= 1988|publisher=[[Somerset County Council]] |location= |isbn=0861831292 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of [[calcareous grassland]] and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for [[Starved Wood-sedge]] (''Carex depauperata'').&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarwoodsssi&quot;/&gt; [[Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum|Purple Gromwell]] (''Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum''), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarwoodsssi&quot;/&gt; [[Butterflies]] include [[Silver-washed Fritillary]] (''Argynnis paphia''), [[Dark Green Fritillary]] (''Argynnis aglaja''), [[Pearl-bordered Fritillary]] (''Boloria euphrosyne''), [[Holby Blue]] (''Celastrina argiolus'') and [[Brown Argus]] (''Aricia agestis''). The [[slug]] (''Arion fasciatus''), which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the [[Soldier beetle]] (''Cantharis fusca'') also occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarwoodsssi&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Cheddar Wood | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003970.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the largest of the SSSIs is called [[Cheddar Complex]] and covers {{convert|441.3|ha|acre|1|abbr=off}} of the gorge, caves and the surrounding area. It is important for both biological and geological features. It includes four SSSIs, formerly known as Cheddar Gorge SSSI, August Hole/Longwood Swallet SSSI, GB Cavern Charterhouse SSSI and Charterhouse on-Mendip SSSI.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarcomplexsssi&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=The Cheddar Complex | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partly owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] who acquired it in 1910&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature and the National Trust|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-nature/w-nature-strategy.htm|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly managed by the [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarcomplexsssi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheddar Complex|url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/cheddar_complex.html|publisher=Somerset Wildlife Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quarries ===
[[File:Batts Combe Quarry from tower.JPG|alt=Exposed stone face of quarry, and buildings|thumb|Batts Combe Quarry from the lookout tower above [[Cheddar Gorge]]]]
Close to the village and gorge are [[Batts Combe quarry]] and [[Callow Rock quarry]], two of the active [[Quarries of the Mendip Hills]] where [[limestone]] is still extracted. Operating since the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Batts Combe is owned and operated by [[Hanson plc|Hanson Aggregates]]. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to an on-site lime kiln, which closed in 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper= Cheddar Valley Gazette | date= 26 March 2009 | url= http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/cheddarvalley/news/Jobs-kiln-closed/article-843237-detail/article.html | title= Jobs may go as kiln is closed | accessdate= 29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99&amp;nbsp;percent [[carbonate]] of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ([[dolomite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Atthill |first=Robin |authorlink= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=_KMwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Atthill%2C+Robin+Mendip%3A+A+new+study&amp;q=99%25#search_anchor |coauthors= |title=Mendip: A new study |year=1976 |pages=22 |publisher=David &amp; Charles |location=Newton Abbott |isbn= 0715372971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chelmscombe Quarry finished its work as a limestone quarry in the 1950s and was then used by the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]] as a [[Tower testing station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Mendip Quarries|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mendips/more_info/west_mendip_quarries_history.htm|publisher=British Geological Survey|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s it was also used to test the ability of containers of radioactive material to withstand impacts and other accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dropping a nuclear brick|journal=New Scientist|year=1973|month=October|volume=60|issue=868|pages=185|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RWRmXO0ut6YC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=National+Tower+Testing+Station+Cheddar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6GMK_ltJ7P&amp;sig=8SniOpiYGgR4eje3WI0pVAnIxAE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6wNkTZerK5W34Abxu9CSCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20Tower%20Testing%20Station%20Cheddar&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===

Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Cheddar has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|°C|°F|1|lk=on}}. [[Temperateness|Seasonal temperature variation]] is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea, which moderates temperature. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately {{convert|21|°C|°F|1}}. In winter mean minimum temperatures of {{convert|1|°C|°F|1}} or {{convert|2|°C|°F|1}} are common.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt; In the summer the [[Azores]] high-pressure system affects the south-west of England. [[Convective]] cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine; annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt; In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic depressions]] or by [[convection]]. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which are most active during those seasons. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}. About 8–15 days of snowfall per year is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt;

It has a central octagonal pier, a socket raised on four steps, hexagonal shelter with six arched four-centred openings, shallow two-stage buttresses at each angle, an and embattled parapet. The shaft is crowned by an [[abacus]] with figures in niches, probably from the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century, although the cross is now missing.

It was on the [[Cheddar Valley line]], a railway line that was opened in 1869 and closed in 1963. It became known as The Strawberry Line because of the large volume of locally-grown [[Strawberry|strawberries]] that it carried. It ran from [[Yatton railway station]] through {{stnlnk|Cheddar}} to [[Wells (Tucker Street) railway station]] and joined the [[East Somerset Railway]] to make a through route via [[Shepton Mallet (High Street) railway station]] to [[Witham (Somerset) railway station|Witham]]. Sections of the now-disused railway have been opened as the Strawberry Line Trail, which currently runs from Yatton to Cheddar. The Cheddar Valley line survived until the &quot;[[Beeching Axe]]&quot;. Towards the end of its life there were so few passengers that diesel [[railcar]]s were sometimes used. The Cheddar branch closed to passengers on 9&amp;nbsp;September 1963 and to goods in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;daniels&quot;/&gt; The line closed in the 1960s, when it became part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve,&lt;ref name=&quot;Strawberry Line&quot;/&gt; and part of the [[National Cycle Network]] route&amp;nbsp;26. The cycle route also interests with the West [[Mendip Way]] and various other footpaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movingsomersetforward.co.uk/files/uploads/maps/CheddarWEB.pdf|title=Cycling Map 10 Cheddar and Axbridge|publisher=Moving Somerset Forward | forma
