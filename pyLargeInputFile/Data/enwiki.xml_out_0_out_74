yles have also developed, including theatre, television, and film clowns. Peter Berger writes that &quot;It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society&quot;.&lt;ref name=BergerP78&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a [[physical theatre|physical performance]] discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.&lt;ref name=CalleryP64&gt;{{Harvnb|Callery|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[coulrophobia]] has been coined to describe those individuals who report a fear of clowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=14&amp;nbsp;February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of clowns ==
{{refimprovesect|date=June 2010}}
The most ancient clowns have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bala2010&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to court jests, clown have traditionally served a socio-religious and psychological role, and traditionally the role of [[priest]] and clown have been held by the same persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bala2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.es/books?id=HE3kv720yyEC&amp;pg=PA774 New Scientist 14 Sep 1978] p.774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Lucile Hoerr (1945) [http://www.jstor.org/pss/535333 ''The Clown's Function''] in ''The Journal of American Folklore'' Vol. 58, No. 227 (Jan. - Mar., 1945), pp. 25-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Dozier[http://books.google.es/books?id=plkMAAAAYAAJ The Pueblo Indians of North America] p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

Clowning was developed from a broad tradition of historical performances, and it is difficult to point out a singular tradition or even a few different ones as being the primary precursors to clowns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However there are a few past prominent forms of entertainment contemporarily linked to clowning as its possible antecedents.

Examples of historical, clown-like comedic performers have been the [[pantomime|pantomimus]] in [[ancient Greece]], the [[Lazzi]] of [[Commedia dell'Arte]], [[bouffon]]s, court [[jester]]s, as well as the French [[mime]] tradition. On top of this there are many non-European clowning traditions (including clown-like figures in [[Japan]]ese [[Kabuki]] theatre), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American native]] [[shamen]] traditions to consider which may or may not have influenced what we now think of as a clown in the [[Western world]].

{{Main|Circus clown}}

=== Whiteface ===
A '''whiteface''' character does not always wear the classic whiteface makeup.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Additionally, a character can wear traditional whiteface makeup and be an [[Clown#Auguste|auguste]].

'''Classic appearance.'''  Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses &quot;clown white&quot; makeup to cover his or her entire face and neck with none of the underlying flesh color showing. In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red. Features, in red and black, are delicate. He or she is traditionally costumed far more extravagantly than the other two clown types, sometimes wearing the ruffled collar and pointed hat which typify the stereotypical &quot;clown suit&quot;.
[[File:Clown.1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Clown and the tightrope walker]]

'''Character.'''  The whiteface character-type is often serious, all-knowing (even if not particularly smart), bossy and cocky. He is the ultimate authority figure. He serves the role of &quot;straight-man&quot; and sets up situations that can be turned funny.

Some circus examples include Pipo Sossman, [[François Fratellini]] (the Fratellini family), [[Felix Adler (clown)|Felix Adler]], Paul Jung, Harry Dann, Chuck Burnes, Albert White, [[Blinko - Ernie Burch|Ernie Burch]], Bobby Kaye, Jack and Jackie LeClaire, Joe and Chester Sherman, Keith Crary, Charlie Bell, Tim Tegge, Kenny Dodd, Frankie Saluto, Tammy Parish, David Konyot (Circus Barum and The Toni Alexis trio), Jay Stewart and Prince Paul Albert.

=== Auguste ===
====Appearance====
The auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. The auguste is dressed (appropriate to character) in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit – either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize auguste costumes.

====Character====
The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing the task given which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and is screwing up less deliberately.

====The contra-auguste====
The contra-auguste plays the role of the mediator between the whiteface character and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the whiteface but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the whiteface and often mimics everything the whiteface does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Character clown ===
The '''character clown''' adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

=== North American character clown types ===
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the hobo, tramp or bum clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is attitude. According to American circus expert Hovey Burgess, they are (in order of class):
*'''The Hobo''' Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive attitude.
*'''The Tramp''' Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his luck and depressed about his situation.
*'''The Bum''' Non-migratory and non-working.
[[Emmett Kelly]] was the preeminent clown of this type. Others include [[Barry Lubin]], [[Tom Dougherty]], [[Bill Irwin]], [[David Shiner (clown)|David Shiner]], [[Geoff Hoyle]], Funny Man Poodles, John Gilkey, Peter Shub, Poodles Hanneford, Bluch Landolf, Larry Pisoni, John Lepiarz, Bobo Barnett, Happy Kellams, [[Fumagalli]], [[Charlie Cairoli]], [[Bebe]], Jojo Lewis, Abe Goldstein&lt;!--not the boxer--&gt;, [[Rhum]], David Larible, Scott Linker, Kenny Raskin, [[Oleg Popov]], Rik Gern, and [[Bello Nock]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== Native American clowning ===
Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology which explores his or her personal experiences and innocences.

=== Rodeo clown ===
A [[rodeo clown]] is a [[Cowhand|cowboy]], or [[Wrangler (profession)|animal wrangler]], dressed in wild costumes. They are used in [[bull riding]] riding competitions where their primary job is to distract the bull from the rider when the rider dismounts either at the conclusion of the ride (typically 8 seconds) or by being thrown before the conclusion of the ride.  Rodeo clowns are also referred to as ''bull fighters'' and ''cowboy protection'' within rodeo circles. Rodeo clowns usually work in pairs or in threes and move towards the bull, waving and yelling to attract the bull's attention to themselves as soon as a bull rider dismounts or is thrown from the bull. This action allows the rider to escape to safety.  In situations where a rider becomes entangled and unable to free him or herself from the bull, the rodeo clowns put themselves at risk by rushing to the bull and placing themselves between the bull's horns and rider while at the same time attempting to free the rider from bull.  Many modern rodeos will showcase rodeo clowns by featuring them in a segment separate from bull riding where the clowns demonstrate their bull fighting prowess by directly confronting bulls, jumping over them and using other specialized evasive maneuvers.

=== Commedia dell'Arte ===
(*''see [[Harlequinade]]'')

There are two distinct types of clown characters, which originated in [[Commedia dell'Arte]] but which still hold some favor today, ''Pierrot'' and '' ''Arlecchino''.

'''Pierrot/Pirouette.'''  Derived from the commedia dell'arte character Pedrolino – the youngest actor of the troupe, deadpan and downtrodden. Although Pedrolino appeared without mask, Pierrot usually appears in whiteface, typically with very little other color on the face. Like Arlecchino, Pedrolino's character changed enormously with the rising popularity of pantomime in the late 19th century, becoming Pierrot. This clown character prefers black and white or other a simple primary color in his or her costume. (le Pierrot is often female, and has also been called &quot;Pirouette&quot; or &quot;Pierrette&quot;. When [[Bernard Delfont]] was made a [[life peer]], he chose &quot;Pierrot and Pierrette&quot; as the heraldic supporters of his [[coat of arms]].).
::The tragic [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] song ''&quot;Reuben and Cerise&quot;'' mentions Pirouette twice, in symbolic colors:
:::''...Cerise was dressing as Pirouette in white''
:::''when a fatal vision gripped her tight''
:::''Cerise beware tonight...''

::Cerise is Reuben's &quot;true love&quot;, but Ruby Claire was a temptress:

:::''...Sweet Ruby Claire at Reuben stared''
:::''At Reuben stared''
:::''She was dressed as Pirouette in red''
:::''and her hair hung gently down...''
:Both women have names which translate as &quot;red&quot;, but Reuben's true love is dressed in pure white. The other, to whom he played his fateful song, is the &quot;lady in red.&quot; This symbolism might imply that Reuben was Pierrot's companion, Arlecchino:
'''[[Harlequin]]''', or '''Arlecchino''', is a &quot;motley&quot; clown. In the ''Commedia'', Arlecchino always carries a cane with which to strike the other performers, although this cane is normally taken from him by the other performers and used against him. This is believed to be the origin of the [[slapstick]] form of comedy. A slapstick (''battacio'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]), is a prop with two flat flexible wooden pieces mounted in parallel so that the two sticks slap together when the implement is struck, causing a slapping sound, exaggerating the effect of a comedic blow. Despite the slapstick, Arlecchino is not malicious, but mischievous, the slapstick being a classic example of carnivalesque phallic imagery (see also the commedia masks' noses). Like a cross between the characters of [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] and [[Nick Bottom]] in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]], Arlecchino is nimble and adept at the same time as being clumsy and dim, and is normally the 'messenger' character in a comedy — the catalyst for mayhem. Arlecchino has a female counterpart, Arlecchina, or Rosetta, but more often he is in love with the character of Columbina, a straightforward and intelligent maid, who is usually given the prologue and epilogue. Arlecchino has other derivatives with slightly different features: Traccagnino, Bagattino, Tabarrino, Tortellino, Naccherino, Gradelino, Mezzettino, Polpettino, Nespolino, Bertoldino, Fagiuolino, Trappolino, Zaccagnino, Trivellino, Passerino, Bagolino, Temellino, Fagottino, Fritellino, Tabacchino, whose names could all be considered [[Inherently funny word|funny-sounding names]], even to an [[Italy|Italian]]. Arlecchino's name is probably derived from &quot;hellech&quot; plus the diminutive suffix &quot;-ino&quot;, meaning little devil. In the same way, &quot;Trufflino&quot; is &quot;Little Truffler&quot;, Trivellino is (Arlecchino's) &quot;Little Brother&quot;, and so on. The Harlequin often loses much of Arlecchino's character in pantomime, as he becomes more of a ballet character, to a large extent stripped of dialogue and subversive content. [[Joseph Grimaldi]] as the most celebrated of English clowns, his performances made the Clown character the central character in British harlequinades.

== Clowning terminology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}

=== Egg Register ===
When a clown joins Clowns International in England, which claims to be the oldest clown society in the world, he can register his individual make-up. An eggshell is decorated as a miniature version of the clown's head and added to the &quot;Egg Gallery&quot; which then acts as sort of clown copyright.

=== Skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform another circus role:
* Walk a tightrope, a highwire, a slack rope or a piece of rope on the ground.
* Ride a [[horse]], a [[zebra]], a [[donkey]], an [[elephant]] or even an [[ostrich]].
* Substitute himself in the role of &quot;lion tamer&quot;.
* Act as &quot;emcee&quot;, from M.C. or [[Master of Ceremonies]], the preferred term for a clown taking on the role of &quot;Ringmaster&quot;.
* &quot;Sit in&quot; with the [[orchestra]], perhaps in a &quot;pin spot&quot; in the center ring, or from a seat in the audience.
* Anything any other circus performer might do. It is not uncommon for an [[Acrobatics|acrobat]], a horse-back rider or a [[lion tamer]] to secretly stand in for the clown, the &quot;switch&quot; taking place in a brief moment offstage.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act. Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Joey, the Auguste and the ringmaster ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Joey]] --&gt;
In clown duos, Clowns often rely on the Joey &amp; Auguste framework, or Manipulator/Victim.  The Ringmaster relationship is the addition of an '''ur-manipulator''', or '''ur-victim''' to this chemistry. This often takes the form of a mutual enemy or nemesis. An example of this situation might be as follows:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;
A husband comes home late, he's drunk, and has a collar covered in lipstick. His wife wants to know where he's been and a manipulator-victim relationship occurs. Suddenly their child enters the scene and the dynamic changes in an attempt to avoid traumatizing him/her. The child wants to know why there's a strange man in their bedroom, and the manipulator-victim dymnamic shifts during the next argument. Then it turns out that the child has constructed this elaborate ruse in order to steal cookies and watch late-night TV without notice, giving him ur-manipulator status.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is an example of a ringmaster situation. Clowns in the ringmaster position are often '''character clowns''', where Joey and Auguste duos are typically made up of a Whiteface Clown and an Auguste.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
&quot;Business&quot; is the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character. A &quot;gag&quot; is a very short piece of clown comedy which when repeated within a bit or routine may become a &quot;running gag&quot;. Gags may be loosely defined as &quot;the jokes clowns play on each other&quot;. Bits are the clown's sketches or routines made up of one or more gags either worked out and timed before going on stage or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material. A gag may have a beginning, a middle and an end to them, or they may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.

=== Menu ===
'''Entrées''' are feature clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. They are typically made up of various gags and bits, and usually use a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a blow-off. (The blow-off is the comedic ending of a show segment, bit, gag, stunt or routine.)

'''Side dishes''' are shorter feature acts. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the Entrée, typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Side dishes are typically made up of various gags and bits, and usually use a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a blow-off.

=== Interludes ===
&quot;Clown Stops&quot; or &quot;interludes&quot; are the brief appearances of clowns while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few gags or several bits. Clown Stops almost always end with a blow-off. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle and an end to them. These are also called reprises or run-ins by many and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves, originally they were bits of &quot;business&quot; usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a wire walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the artiste by trying to walk between them with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today they are far more complex and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the &quot;[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]&quot; stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over ones own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or &quot;[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]&quot;. Individual prop stunts are generally considered to be individual bits.

==Fear of clowns==

Clown costumes tend to exaggerate the facial features and some body parts, such as hands and feet and noses. This can be read as monstrous or deformed as easily as it can be read as comical. Some have suggested, however, that a fear of clowns may stem from early childhood experience, when infants begin to process and make sense of facial features.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The significant aberrations in a clown's face may frighten a child so much that they carry this phobia throughout their adult life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The term [[coulrophobia]] has been proposed to denote an abnormal, exaggerated, or irrational fear of clowns. The term is of recent use but is not commonly used in [[psychology]], and according to one analyst, &quot;has been coined more on the Internet than in printed form because it does not appear in any previously published, psychiatric, unabridged, or abridged dictionary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;phobiasbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=An Excess of Phobias and Manias|last=Robertson|first=John G.|publisher=Senior Scribe Publications|year=2003|isbn=9780963091932|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r4PgawVAzB8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Coulrophobia&amp;hl=sv&amp;sig=ACfU3U3aM0dDtzkFRivqCOPVqX1K24Dplg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the term is not recognised as a specific disorder by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in its [[DSMIV|latest categorisation of disorders]], nor is it recognised by the [[World Health Organisation]] as a valid disorder.

The British arts and music festival [[Bestival]] cancelled its planned clown theme in 2006 after many adult ticketholders contacted the organizers expressing a fear of clowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article684697.ece|title=Don't send in the clowns: they scare the crowd|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2008-09-29 | location=London | date=July 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coffea''''' is a large genus (containing more than 90 species)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnhn.fr/publication/adanson/a01n2a15.pdf 337_346.pdf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[Rubia|madder]] family, [[Rubiaceae]]. They are [[shrub]]s or small [[tree]]s, native to subtropical [[Africa]] and southern [[Asia]]. [[Seed]]s of several species are the source of the popular [[drink|beverage]] [[coffee]]. Coffee ranks as one of the world's most valuable and widely traded [[commodity]] crops and is an important export of a number of countries. The leaves and the outer part of the fruit are also sometimes eaten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coffeed.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=587 Ever Eat A Coffee Cherry?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botany ==
[[File:CoffeeBerry.jpg|thumb|180px|left|''Coffea berries, Bali'']]
There are several species of ''Coffea'' that may be grown for the beans. The trees produce red or purple fruits called &quot;cherries&quot; that are [[drupe]]s. The cherries contain two seeds, the so-called &quot;coffee beans&quot;, which — despite their name  — are not true [[bean]]s (which are the seeds of the [[legume]] family). In about 5-10% of any crop of coffee cherries, there is only a single bean, rather than the two usually found. This is called a &quot;[[peaberry]]&quot;, which is smaller and rounder than a normal coffee bean. It is often removed from the yield and either sold separately, (as in New Guinea peaberry) or discarded.

[[File:Detail of Coffea canephora branch and leaves.jpg|thumb|180px|left|''[[Coffea canephora]]'']]
When grown in the tropics, coffee is a vigorous bush or small tree which usually grow to a height of 3&amp;ndash;3.5 m (10&amp;ndash;12 feet). Most commonly cultivated coffee species grow best at high elevations, but are nevertheless intolerant of subfreezing temperatures.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} 

The tree of ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' will grow fruits after three to five years, and will produce for about 50 to 60 years (although up to 100 years is possible). The white flowers are highly scented. The fruit takes about nine months to ripen.

== Ecology ==
The [[caffeine]] in coffee &quot;beans&quot; is a natural [[plant defense against herbivory]], i.e. a [[Toxin|toxic]] substance that protects the seeds of the plant.

Several insect pests affect coffee production, including the [[coffee borer beetle]] (''Hypothenemus hampei'') and the coffee leafminer ''[[Leucoptera caffeina]]''.

Coffee is used as a food plant by the [[Caterpillar|larvae]] of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, including napoleon jacutin (''[[Dalcera|Dalcera abrasa]]''), [[turnip moth]] and some members of the genus ''[[Endoclita]]'', including ''E. damor'' and ''E. malabaricus''.

==New coffee species==
In 2008 and 2009, researchers from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] named seven species of ''Coffea'' from the mountains of northern [[Madagascar]], including ''C. ambongensis'', ''C. boinensis'', ''C. labatii'', ''C. pterocarpa'', ''C. bissetiae,'' and ''C. namorokensis.''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Seven species of wild coffee amongst Kew's haul of new discoveries&quot; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, 22 December 2009. [http://www.kew.org/news/new-discoveries-coffee.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, two new [[species]] of coffee plants have been discovered in [[Cameroon]]: [[Charrier coffee|''Coffea charrieriana'']], which is caffeine-free, and ''Coffea anthonyi''.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} By crossing the new species with other known coffees, two new features might be introduced to cultivated coffee plants: beans without [[caffeine]] and  self-[[pollination]].&lt;ref&gt;Science Connection 22 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cycling''', also called '''bicycling''' or '''biking''', is the use of [[bicycle]]s for [[transport]], [[recreation]], or for [[sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Bicycle]]s were introduced in the 19th century and now number about one billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;DidYouKnow.cd.  [http://www.didyouknow.cd/bicycles.htm There are about a billion or more bicycles in the world.]. Retrieved 30 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the principal means of transportation in many regions.

Cycling is an extremely efficient and effective mode of transportation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question527.htm |title=HowStuffWorks &quot;Is there a way to compare a human being to an engine in terms of efficiency?&quot; |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; optimal for short to moderate distances. Bicycles provide numerous benefits compared to [[motor vehicle]]s, including [[exercise]], an alternative to the use of [[fossil fuel]]s, no [[air pollution|air]] or [[noise pollution]], much reduced [[traffic congestion]], easier [[parking]], greater maneuverability, and access to both [[road]]s and [[bike path|paths]]. The advantages are at less financial cost to the user as well as society (negligible damage to roads, and less pavement required).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doitgreen.org/article/transportation/bicycle |title=A Case for Bicycle Commuting | work=Do It Green!  |date= |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms and disadvantages of cycling include reduced protection in crashes, particularly with motor vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wardlaw MJ |title=Three lessons for a better cycling future |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1582–5 |year=2000 |pmid=11124188 |pmc=1119262 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1582 }}&lt;/ref&gt; longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the skill and fitness required.

==Equipment==
{{Main|Bicycle}}

In many countries, the most commonly used [[vehicle]] for [[road transport]] is a [[utility bicycle]]. These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks from the road, and easing steering at low speeds.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend forward more, utilizing stronger muscles and reducing air resistance at high speed.

The price of a new bicycle can range from US$50 to more than US$20,000 (the highest priced bike in the world is the custom Madone by Damien Hirst, sold at $500,000 USD&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/stages/hirst/&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-1-2-15285-1,00.html Custom Bike Builders: Groupe de Tete&amp;nbsp;– bicycling.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; depending on quality, type and weight (the most exotic road bicycles can weigh as little as 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg (7&amp;nbsp;lb)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.light-bikes.com/bikegallery/BikeListing.asp?id=1507 SPIN Custom...7.04 lbs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). Being measured for a bike and taking it for a test ride are recommended before buying.

The [[bicycle#Drivetrain and gearing|drivetrain]] components of the bike should also be considered. A middle grade [[dérailleur]] is sufficient for a beginner, although many utility bikes come equipped with [[hub gear]]s. If the rider plans a significant amount of [[hillclimbing (cycling)|hillclimbing]], a triple-[[crankset|crank]] (three chainrings) front [[bicycle gearing|gear system]] may be preferred. Otherwise, the relatively lighter and less expensive two chainrings may be better. Much simpler fixed wheel bikes are also available, and may be more suitable for commuters.

Many road bikes along with mountain bikes include [[clipless pedal]]s to which special shoes attach, via a [[cleat (shoe)|cleat]], permitting the rider to pull on the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and back lights, bells or horns, disc brakes, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.

For basic maintenance and repairs, cyclists can choose to carry a [[bicycle pump|pump]] (or a [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridge]]), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and [[tire levers]]. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special [[cycling shoe|shoes]], [[cycling gloves|gloves]], and [[cycling shorts|shorts]]. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, pants and overshoes.

Items legally required in some jurisdictions, or voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include [[bicycle helmet]]s, generator or battery operated lights, [[retroreflector|reflectors]], and audible signaling devices such as a bell or horn. Extras include [[studded tires]] and a [[cyclocomputer|bicycle computer]].

Bikes can also be heavily customized, with different seat designs and handle bars, for example.

==Skills==
{{Main|Vehicular cycling}}
Learning to ride efficiently and safely in traffic is important. In the [[United Kingdom]], many primary school children took the [[Cycling Proficiency Test]] (now branded as 'Bikeability'), to help them cycle more safely. In countries such as the Netherlands, where cycling is popular, cyclists sometimes ride in bike lanes at the side of, or separate from, main highways and roads. Many primary schools participate in the national road test in which children individually complete a circuit on roads near the school while being observed by testers.

==Types==
===Urban===

[[Image:Bicycle Parking Lot Niigata.jpg|thumb|right|A parking lot for bicycles in [[Niigata, Niigata]], [[Japan]].|alt=Hundreds of bicycles, grouped in rectangular parking places with driving paths in between.]]
[[File:Bicycle racks on Briggate, Leeds (4th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|In an attempt to encourage cycling some cities have placed bicycle [[bicycle stand]]s around the city centres such as these on [[Briggate]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].]]
Cyclists, pedestrians and motorists make different demands on road design which may lead to conflicts. Some jurisdictions give priority to motorized traffic, for example setting up one-way street systems, free-right turns, high capacity roundabouts, and [[interchange (road)|slip roads]]. Others may apply [[traffic calming|traffic restraint]] measures to limit the impact of motorized transport. In the former cases, cycling has tended to decline while in the latter it has tended to be maintained. Occasionally, extreme measures against cycling may occur. In [[Shanghai]], where bicycles were once the dominant [[mode of transport]], bicycle travel on a few city roads was banned temporarily in December 2003.

In areas in which cycling is popular and encouraged, cycle-parking facilities using [[bicycle stand]]s, lockable mini-garages, and patrolled cycle parks are used in order to reduce theft. Local governments promote cycling by permitting the carriage of bicycles on public transport or by providing external [[Bicycle carrier|attachment devices]] on public transport vehicles. Conversely, an absence of secure cycle-parking is a recurring complaint by cyclists from cities with low modal share of cycling.

Extensive [[bicycle path]] systems may be found in some cities. Such dedicated paths often have to be shared with in-line skaters, scooters, skateboarders, and pedestrians. Segregating bicycle and automobile traffic in cities has met with mixed success, both in terms of safety and bicycle promotion. At some point the two streams of traffic inevitably intersect, often in a haphazard and congested fashion. Studies have demonstrated that, due to the high incidence of accidents at these sites, some such segregated schemes can actually ''increase'' the number of car-bike collisions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bicycling Life&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles are considered a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and relatively shorter distances when used for transport (compared to recreation). Case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate this kind of functional cycling in cities can be found at [[Eltis]], Europe's portal for local transport.

In the Netherlands, bicycle paths are widespread and are (in the cities) closed to [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]s. Cyclists in the Netherlands are well protected as the law assumes the stronger participant (i.e. the car driver) is guilty until proved innocent (i.e. is the guilty party in all accidents involving weaker traffic unless evidence of the opposite is provided). Furthermore, drivers know to expect a high volume of cyclist traffic. Due to these issues the number of car-bike collisions with serious consequences is not alarmingly high in the Netherlands

===Utility===
[[Image:coconut bunch.jpg|thumb|right|A bicycle loaded with [[tender coconut]] for sale. [[Karnataka]], [[India]].|alt=A bicycle loaded with so many green fruits that the rear wheel can not be seen.]]
{{Main|utility cycling}}

Utility cycling refers both to cycling as a mode of daily [[commuting]] transport as well as the use of a bicycle in a commercial activity, mainly to transport goods.

The [[mail|postal services]] of many countries have long relied on bicycles. The British [[Royal Mail]] first started using bicycles in 1880; now bicycle delivery fleets include 37,000 in the UK, 25,700 in [[Germany]], 10,500 in [[Hungary]] and 7000 in [[Sweden]]. The [[London Ambulance Service]] has recently introduced bicycling [[paramedic]]s, who can often get to the scene of an incident in [[Central London]] more quickly than a motorized ambulance.

Late in the 20th century, urban [[police bicycle]]s became more common, as the mobility of car-borne officers was increasingly limited by traffic congestion and [[Auto-free zone|pedestrianisation]].

Bicycles enjoy substantial use as general delivery vehicles in many countries. In the UK and North America, generations of teenagers have got their first jobs delivering newspapers by bicycle. London has many delivery companies that use bicycles with trailers. Most cities in the West, and many outside it, support a sizeable and visible industry of [[Bicycle messenger|cycle couriers]] who deliver documents and small packages. In India, many of [[Mumbai]]'s [[Dabbawala]]s use bicycles to deliver home cooked lunches to the city’s workers. In [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] the city’s largest bakery recently replaced most of its delivery trucks with bicycles. Even the car industry uses bicycles. At the huge [[Mercedes-Benz]] factory in [[Sindelfingen]], Germany workers use bicycles, color-coded by department, to move around the factory.

===Recreational===
;Bicycle Touring
{{Main|bicycle touring}}
[[Image:WhiteBikesVeluwe.jpg|thumb|right|In the Netherlands, bicycles are freely available for use in the Hoge Veluwe National Park|alt=A white bicycle parked in the grass.]]

Bicycles are used for recreation at all ages. [[Bicycle touring]], also known as cyclotourism, involves touring and exploration or sightseeing by bicycle for leisure. A [[brevet (cycling)|brevet]] or randonnée is an organized long-distance ride.

One popular [[Netherlands|Dutch]] pleasure is the enjoyment of relaxed cycling in the [[rural|countryside]] of the Netherlands. The land is very flat and full of public [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle trails]] where cyclists are not bothered by [[automobile|cars]] and other traffic, which makes it ideal for cycling recreation. Many [[Dutch people]] subscribe every [[year]] to an event called ''[[fietsvierdaagse]]''&amp;nbsp;— four days of organised cycling through the local environment. [[Paris–Brest–Paris]] (PBP), which began in 1891, is the oldest bicycling event still run on a regular basis on the open road, covers over {{convert|1200|km|0|abbr=on}} and imposes a 90-hour time limit. Similar if smaller institutions exist in many countries.

;Organized rides
[[Image:Bikes in Portland.jpg|thumb|right|Tour de Fat group ride in [[Portland, Oregon]]|alt=Many bicyclists with colorful clothes]]
Many [[cycling club]]s hold organized rides in which bicyclists of all levels participate. The typical organized ride starts with a large group of riders, called the mass, bunch or even [[peloton]]. This will thin out over the course of the ride. Many riders choose to ride together in groups of the same skill level to take advantage of [[drafting (racing)|drafting]].

Most organized rides, for example [[Cyclosportive]]s, [[Challenge riding|Challenge Rides]] or [[reliability trial]]s, and [[Hillclimbing (cycling)|hill climbs]] include registration requirements and will provide information either through the mail or online concerning start times and other requirements. Rides usually consist of several different routes, sorted by mileage, and with a certain number of rest stops that usually include refreshments, first aid and maintenance tools. Routes can vary by as much as 100 miles.

;Mountain
[[Mountain biking]] began in the 1970s, originally as a downhill sport, practiced on customized [[cruiser bikes]] around [[Mount Tamalpais]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sonic.net/~ckelly/Seekay/clunker.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Most mountain biking takes place on dirt roads, trails and in purpose-built parks. Downhill mountain biking has just evolved in the recent years and is performed at places such as Whistler Mountain Bike Park. Slopestyle, a form of downhill, is when riders do tricks such as tailwhips, 360s, backflips and frontflips.

===Racing===

{{Main|bicycle racing}}
Shortly after the introduction of bicycles, competitions developed independently in many parts of the world. Early races involving [[boneshaker]] style bicycles were predictably fraught with injuries. Large races became popular during the 1890s &quot;Golden Age of Cycling&quot;, with events across Europe, and in the U.S. and Japan as well. At one point, almost every major city in the US had a [[velodrome]] or two for [[Track cycling|track racing]] events, however since the middle of the 20th century cycling has become a minority sport in the US whilst in Continental Europe it continues to be a major sport, particularly in France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The most famous of all bicycle races is the [[Tour de France]]. This began in 1903, and continues to capture the attention of the sporting world.

In 1899, [[Mile-a-Minute Murphy]] became the first man to ride his bicycle a mile in under a minute, which he did by drafting a [[locomotive]] at [[New York's]] [[Long Island]].

As the bicycle evolved its various forms, different racing formats developed. Road races may involve both team and individual competition, and are contested in various ways. They range from the one-day road race, [[criterium]], and time trial to multi-stage events like the Tour de France and its sister events which make up cycling's [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. [[Recumbent bicycle]]s were banned from bike races in 1934 after [[Marcel Berthet]] set a new [[hour record]] in his ''Velodyne streamliner'' (49.992&amp;nbsp;km on November 18, 1933). [[Track bicycle]]s are used for [[track cycling]] in [[Velodrome]]s , while [[cyclo-cross]] races are held on rugged outdoor terrain, which is performed on road, grass, and mud. Riders in cyclocross must get off their bikes at certain intervals and hop over barriers. [[Individual time trial|Time trial]] races, another form of road racing require a rider to ride against the clock. Time trials can be performed as a team or as a single rider. Bikes are changed for time trial races, using [[Bicycle_handlebar#Triathlon_or_aero|aero bars]]. In the past decade, [[mountain biking|mountain bike racing]] has also reached international popularity and is even an Olympic sport.

Professional racing organizations place limitations on the bicycles that can be used in the races that they sanction. For example, the Union Cycliste Internationale, the governing body of international cycle sport (which sanctions races such as the Tour de France), decided in the late 1990s to create additional rules which prohibit racing bicycles weighing less than 6.8 kilograms (14.96 pounds). The UCI rules also effectively ban some [[bicycle frame]] innovations (such as the [[recumbent bicycle]]) by requiring a double triangle structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldsite.uci.ch/english/about/rules/ch01_general.pdf |format=PDF|title=UCI Cycling Regulations |accessdate=2006-08-04 |author=Union Cycliste International |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War===
{{Main|Bicycle infantry}}
The bicycle is not suited for combat, but it has been used as a method of [[reconnaissance]] as well as transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of [[horses in warfare]]. In the [[Second Boer War]], both sides used bicycles for scouting. In [[World War I]], France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's march or &quot;roll&quot; through [[Malaysia]] in [[World War II]]. Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne &quot;Cycle-commandos&quot; with [[folding bike]]s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], communist forces used bicycles extensively as cargo carriers along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].

The last country known to maintain a regiment of bicycle troops was Switzerland, who disbanded their final unit in 2003.

==Activism==

Two broad and correlated themes run in bicycle activism: one is about advocating the bicycle as an alternative mode of transport, and the other is about the creation of conditions to permit and/or encourage bicycle use, both for utility and recreational cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1899_reg.html One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility] |last=Furness |first=Zack |year=2010 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1592136131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first, which emphasizes the potential for energy and resource conservation and health benefits gained from cycling versus automobile use, is relatively undisputed, the second is the subject of much debate.

[[Image:Critical Mass, San Francisco, April 29, 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Francisco]] [[Critical Mass]], April 29, 2005.|alt=Many cyclists on a road, all going in the same direction.]]

It is generally agreed that improved local and [[inter-city rail]] services and other methods of mass transportation (including greater provision for cycle carriage on such services) create conditions to encourage bicycle use. However, there are different opinions on the role of the use of [[segregated cycle facilities]] and other items of the [[Utility cycling#Cycling infrastructure|cycling infrastructure]] in building [[bicycle-friendly]] cities and roads.

Some bicycle activists (including some traffic management advisers) seek the construction of segregated cycle facilities for journeys of all lengths. Other activists, especially those from the more established tradition, view the safety, practicality, and intent of many segregated cycle facilities with suspicion. They favour a more holistic approach based on [[Traffic psychology#Accident prevention and improvement of traffic safety|the 4 'E's]]; ''education'' (of everyone involved), ''encouragement'' (to apply the education), ''enforcement'' (to protect the rights of others), and ''engineering'' (to facilitate travel while respecting every person's equal right to do so). In some cases this opposition has a more ideological basis: some members of the [[Vehicular cycling|Vehicular Cycling movement]] oppose segregated public facilities, such as on-street bike lanes, on principle. Some groups offer [[Vehicular cycling#Education|training courses]] to help cyclists integrate themselves with other traffic. This is part of the ongoing [[cycle path debate]].

[[Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in [[city|cities]] around the [[world]] where bicyclists take to the streets ''en masse''. While the ride was originally founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the [[direct action]] of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city streets.

There is a long-running [[Bicycle helmet#Opinions for and against the use of helmets|cycle helmet debate]] among activists. The most heated controversy surrounds the topic of [[Bicycle helmet#Legislation and culture|compulsory helmet use]].

==Associations==
[[File:Bike Week 3090.JPG|thumb|right|Cyclists assemble for a ride organized by the [[London Cycling Campaign]].|alt=A group of people standing with their bicycles.]]
Cyclists form associations, both for specific interests (trails development, road maintenance, urban design, racing clubs, touring clubs, and so on.) and for more global goals ([[energy conservation]], pollution reduction, promotion of fitness). Some bicycle clubs and national associations became prominent advocates for improvements to roads and highways. In the [[United States]], the [[League of American Wheelmen]] lobbied for the improvement of roads in the last part of the 19th century, founding and leading the national [[Good Roads Movement]]. Their model for political organization, as well as the paved roads for which they argued, facilitated the growth of the automobile.

As a sport, cycling is governed internationally by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] in [[Switzerland]], [[USA Cycling]] (merged with the United States Cycling Federation in 1995) in the United States, (for [[upright bicycle]]s) and by the [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] (for other HPVs, or human-powered vehicles). Cycling for transport and touring is promoted on a European level by the [[European Cyclists' Federation]], with associated members from Great Britain, Japan and elsewhere. Regular conferences on cycling as transport are held under the auspices of [[Velo City]]; global conferences are coordinated by [[Velo Mondial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Health==
===Benefits===
The [[physical exercise]] gained from cycling is generally linked with increased health and well-being. According to the [[World Health Organization]], physical inactivity is second only to [[tobacco smoking]] as a health risk in developed countries,&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e75662.pdf|format=PDF|title=A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE LIFE THROUGH EVERYDAY TRANSPORT|publisher=World health Organisation|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is associated with many tens of billions of dollars of healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/economic_consequences.htm|title=Overweight and Obesity: Economic Consequences|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's report&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;/&gt; suggests that increasing physical activity is a public health 'best buy', and that cycling is a 'highly suitable activity' for this purpose. The charity [[Sustrans]] reports that investment in cycling provision can give a 20:1 return from health and other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1158137684156|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312033043/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1158137684156|archivedate=2007-03-12|title=How transport can save the NHS|publisher=sustrans.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that, on average, approximately 20 life-years are gained from the health benefits of road bicycling for every life-year lost through injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=British Medical Association|coauthors=Mayhew Hillman, David Morgan|title=Cycling: Towards Health and Safety|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-286151-4|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles are often used by people seeking to improve their fitness and cardiovascular health. In this regard, cycling is especially helpful for those with [[arthritis]] of the lower limbs who are unable to pursue sports that cause impact to the knees and other joints. Since cycling can be used for the practical purpose of transportation, there can be less need for self-discipline to exercise.

Cycling while seated is a relatively non-[[weight bearing]] exercise that, like [[Human swimming#As recreation and exercise|swimming]], does little to promote bone density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nichols JF, Palmer JE, Levy SS |title=Low bone mineral density in highly trained male master cyclists |journal=Osteoporos Int |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=644–9 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12856112 |doi=10.1007/s00198-003-1418-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycling up and out of the saddle, on the other hand, does a better job by transferring more of the rider's body weight to the legs. However, excessive cycling while standing can cause knee damage&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonbrown.com/pain.html#knees|title=Bicycling and Pain|accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2011}} It used to be thought that cycling while standing was less energy efficient, but recent research has proven this not to be true. Other than air resistance, there is no wasted energy from cycling while standing if it is done correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/?pg=fullstory&amp;id=4512| title=Sit or Stand: Tradeoffs in Efficiency?| publisher=[http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/]  | date=November 21, 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycling on a stationary cycle is frequently advocated as a suitable exercise for rehabilitation, particularly for lower limb injury, owing to the low impact which it has on the joints. In particular, cycling is commonly used within knee rehabilitation programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kneeguru.co.uk/KNEEnotes/node/1071 | title=Cycling for Knee Rehabilitation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the increased global sedentarity and consequent [[overweight]] and [[obesity]], one response that has been adopted by many organizations concerned with health and environment is the promotion of [[Active travel]], which seeks to promote walking and cycling as safe and attractive alternatives to motorized transport. Given that many journeys are for relatively short distances, there is considerable scope to replace car use with walking or cycling, though in many setting this may require some infrastructure modification, particularly to attract the less experienced and confident.

===Injuries===
[[File:Santa-Maria-Patroness-of-bicyclists-4606.jpg|thumb|[[Virgin Mary]] venerated as the holy protector of bicyclists on the roads of the mountainous [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]|alt=A statue, covered with flowers.]]
Cycling suffers from a perception that it is unsafe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On Your Bike! |first=Matt |last=Seaton |page=103 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Black Dog Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=1-904772-40-4 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; although use of appropriate safety equipment and observance of road rules can reduce risk of serious injury. In the UK, fatality rates per mile or kilometre are slightly less than those for walking.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK fatalities by mode&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/adobepdf/162469/221412/221549/227755/rcgb2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Road Casualties Great Britain 2007&amp;nbsp;– Annual Report (page 82, &quot;Fatality rates by mode of travel&quot;)|publisher=Department for Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, bicycling fatality rates are less than 2/3 of those walking the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_statistics_annual_report/2004/html/chapter_02/daily_travel_by_walking_and_bicycling.html|title=Daily Travel by Walking and Bicycling|publisher=Bureau of Transportation Statistics|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/|title=Fatality Analysis Reporting System|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a child cyclist the rate per mile or kilometre travelled is around 55 times that for a child occupant of a car {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, while the fatality and serious injury rates ''per hour of travel'' are just over double for cycling than for walking (owing to the reduced travel time), in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK fatalities by mode&quot; /&gt; It should be noted that calculated fatality rates based on distance for bicycling (as well as for walking) can have an exceptionally large margin of error, since there are generally no annual registrations or odometers required for bicycles (as there are with motor vehicles), and this means the distance traveled must be estimated.

Most cycle deaths result from a collision with a car or heavy goods vehicle, both motorist and cyclist having been found responsible for collisions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/articles/cyclingingreatbritain1|title=Cycling in Great Britain|publisher=Department of Transport|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camcycle.org.uk/newsletters/53/article4.html|title=44 tonne articulated trucks and towns don't mix|publisher=Cambridge Cycling Campaign UK|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://showcase.commedia.org.uk/article/articleview/390/1/13/|title=Lorries and Towns Don't Mix (video) | publisher=Robert Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, around a fifth of non-fatal injuries to cyclists do not involve any other person or vehicle.

A Danish study in 2000 concluded that &quot;bicycling to work decreased risk of mortality in approximately 40% after multivariate adjustment, including leisure time physical activity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andersen LB, Schnohr P, Schroll M, Hein HO |title=All-cause mortality associated with physical activity during leisure time, work, sports, and cycling to work |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=160 |issue=11 |pages=1621–8 |year=2000 |month=June |pmid=10847255 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/160/11/1621 |doi=10.1001/archinte.160.11.1621 |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries (to cyclists, from cycling) can be divided into two types:
* [[Physical trauma]] (extrinsic)
* Overuse (intrinsic).

[[Acute (medical)|Acute]] physical trauma includes injuries to the head and extremities resulting from falls and collisions. Since a large percentage of the collisions between motor and pedal vehicles occur at night, [[Bicycle lighting#Safety|bicycle lighting]] is required for [[bicycle safety|safety when bicycling]] at night.

[[Image:Taiwan 2009 HuaLien Taroko Gorge Biking FRD 5416 Pano Extracted.jpg|thumb|Bicyclist pedals uphill at the [[Taroko National Park|Taroko Gorge]] in [[Taiwan]]]]

The most common cycling overuse injury occurs in the knees, affecting cyclists at all levels. These are caused by many factors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.biomech.com/db_area/archives/1996/9607sports.bio.html  | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928070212/http://www.biomech.com/db_area/archives/1996/9607sports.bio.html  | archivedate=2007-09-28  | title=Knee Pain in Cycling: New Twist on an old Injury  | publisher=BioMechanics  | date=July/August, 1996  | accessdate=2006-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Incorrect bicycle fit or adjustment, particularly the saddle.
*Incorrect adjustment of clipless pedals.
*Too many hills, or too many miles, too early in the training season.
*Poor training preparation for long touring rides.
*Selecting too high a gear. A lower gear for uphill climb protects the knees, even though your muscles are well able to handle a higher gear.

Excessive saddle height can cause [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] knee pain, while setting the saddle too low can cause pain in the [[anterior]] of the knee. An incorrectly fitted saddle may eventually lead to muscle imbalance. A 25 to 35 degree knee angle is recommended to avoid an overuse injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |  url=http://www.nasm.org/nasmpro/library/showarticle.aspx?id=14202  | title=Avoid Repetitive Knee Injuries While Riding A Bike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overuse injuries, including chronic nerve damage at weight bearing locations, can occur as a result of repeatedly riding a bicycle for extended periods of time. Damage to the [[ulnar nerve]] in the palm, [[carpal tunnel syndrome|carpal tunnel]] in the wrist, the genitourinary tract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leibovitch I, Mor Y |title=The vicious cycling: bicycling related urogenital disorders |journal=Eur. Urol. |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=277–86; discussion 286–7 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15716187 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2004.10.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or bicycle seat neuropathy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.emedicine.com/SPORTS/topic12.htm | title=Bicycle Seat Neuropathy, follow up  | publisher=[[eMedicine]]  | date=February 8, 2006  | accessdate=2006-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; may result from overuse. [[Recumbent bicycle]]s are designed on different [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] principles and eliminate pressure from the saddle and handlebars, due to the relaxed riding position.

Note that overuse is a relative term, and capacity varies greatly between individuals. Someone starting out in cycling must be careful to increase length and frequency of cycling sessions slowly, starting for example at an hour or two per day, or a hundred miles or kilometers per week. Muscular pain is a normal by-product of the training process, but joint pain and numbness are early signs of overuse injury.

Cycling has been linked to sexual impotence due to pressure on the perineum from the seat, but fitting a proper sized seat prevents this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/149268.stm|title=Cycle of despair|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-29|date=1998-08-12}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/363070.stm|title=Cycling linked to impotence|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-29|date=1999-06-07}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=November 2010}} In extreme cases, [[Pudendal Nerve Entrapment]] can be a source of intractable perineal pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ramsden CE, McDaniel MC, Harmon RL, Renney KM, Faure A |title=Pudendal nerve entrapment as source of intractable perineal pain |journal=Am J Phys Med Rehabil |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=479–84 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12820792 |doi=10.1097/00002060-200306000-00013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cyclists with induced pudendal nerve pressure neuropathy gained relief from improvements in saddle position and riding techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Silbert PL, Dunne JW, Edis RH, Stewart-Wynne EG |title=Bicycling induced pudendal nerve pressure neuropathy |journal=Clin Exp Neurol |volume=28 |issue= |pages=191–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1821826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has investigated the potential health effects of prolonged bicycling in police bicycle patrol units, including the possibility that some bicycle saddles exert excessive pressure on the urogenital area of cyclists, restricting blood flow to the genitals. NIOSH is investigating whether saddles developed without protruding noses (which remove the pressure from the urogenital area) will alleviate any potential health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bike/ |title=NIOSH -Bicycle Saddles and Reproductive Health |accessdate=2007-10-10|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Spain|Spanish]] study of top [[triathlete]]s found those who cover more than 186 miles (300&amp;nbsp;km) a week on their bikes have less than 4% normal looking [[sperm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8124458.stm BBC: Elite cyclists 'risk infertility']&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumors to the contrary, there is no [[scientific evidence]] linking cycling with [[testicular cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/library/TesticlarCancerFactSheet.pdf |format=PDF|title=Testiclar Cancer Fact Sheet |accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=Monash Institute of Medical Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution===
One concern often expressed (both by non-cyclists and some cyclists) is the thought that riding in traffic exposes the cyclist to higher levels of air pollution, especially if he or she travels on or along busy roads. Some authors have claimed this to be untrue, showing that the pollutant and irritant count within cars is consistently higher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chertok M, Voukelatos A, Sheppeard V,  [[Christopher Rissel|Rissel C]] |title=Comparison of air pollution exposure for five commuting modes in Sydney&amp;nbsp;– car, train, bus, bicycle and walking |journal=Health Promot. J. Austr. |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2004 |url=http://www.austroads.com.au/documents/Air_pollutants_exposure_by_travel_mode.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (presumably because of limited circulation of air within the car and due to the air intake being directly in the stream of other traffic). Other authors have found small or inconsistent differences in concentrations but claim that exposure of cyclists is higher due to increased minute [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] &lt;ref&gt;Int Panis et al. 2010. Exposure to particulate matter in traffic: A comparison of cyclists and car passengers. Atmospheric Environment, Volume 44, Issue 19, June 2010, Pages 2263-2270.&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with minor biological changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacobs et al. |title=Subclinical responses in healthy cyclists briefly exposed to traffic-related air pollution: an intervention study  |journal= Environmental Health |volume=9 |issue=64 |year=2010 |url=http://www.ehjournal.net/content/pdf/1476-069X-9-64.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the associated health effect, if any, is unclear but probably much smaller than the health impacts associated with accidents and the health benefits derived from additional physical activity.

[[Image:Lactose.svg|thumb|right|310px|[[Lactose]] is a [[disaccharide]] found in [[milk]]. It consists of a molecule of [[galactose|D-galactose]] and a molecule of [[glucose|D-glucose]] bonded by beta-1-4 [[glycosidic linkage]]. It has a formula of C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

A '''carbohydrate''' ({{IPA-en|kɑ:bəˈhaɪdreɪt|pron}}) is an [[organic compound]] with the empirical formula C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; that is, consists only of [[carbon]],  [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]], with a hydrogen:oxygen [[atom]] ratio of 2:1 (as in [[water]]).  Carbohydrates can be viewed as [[hydrate]]s of carbon, hence their name. Structurally however, it is more accurate to view them as [[Polyhydroxyaldehyde|polyhydroxy aldehydes]] and [[ketone]]s.

The term is most common in [[biochemistry]], where it is  a synonym of '''saccharide'''. The carbohydrates (saccharides) are divided into four chemical groupings:  [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s. In general, the monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are smaller (lower [[molecular weight]]) carbohydrates, are commonly referred to as [[sugar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Flitsch, SL &amp; Ulijn, RV (2003). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/pdf/421219a.pdf &quot;Sugars tied to the spot.&quot; ''Nature'' 421: 219&amp;ndash;220].&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''saccharide'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σάκχαρον'' (''sákkharon''), meaning &quot;[[sugar]]&quot;. While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix [[-ose]]. For example, [[blood sugar]] is the monosaccharide [[glucose]], table sugar is the disaccharide [[sucrose]], and milk sugar is the disaccharide [[lactose]] (see illustration).

Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living things. Polysaccharides serve for the storage of [[energy]] (e.g., [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]), and as structural components (e.g., [[cellulose]] in plants and [[chitin]] in arthropods). The 5-carbon monosaccharide [[ribose]] is an important component of [[coenzyme]]s (e.g., [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[FAD]], and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as [[RNA]]. The related [[deoxyribose]] is a component of [[DNA]]. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important [[biomolecules]] that play key roles in the [[immune system]], [[fertilization]], preventing [[pathogenesis]], [[blood clotting]], and [[developmental biology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Maton |first = Anthea |coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D. Wright |title = Human Biology and Health |publisher = Prentice Hall |year = 1993 |location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA |pages = 52–59 |isbn = 0-13-981176-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[food science]] and in many informal contexts, the term carbohydrate often means any [[food]] that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate [[starch]] (such as [[cereal]]s, [[bread]], and [[pasta]]) or simple carbohydrates, such as [[sugar]] (found in [[candy]], [[jam]]s, and [[dessert]]s).

==Structure==
Formerly the name &quot;carbohydrate&quot; was used in [[chemistry]] for any compound with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Following this definition, some chemists considered [[formaldehyde]] CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be the simplest carbohydrate,&lt;ref name=&quot;coulter&quot;&gt;
  John Merle Coulter, Charler Reid Barnes, Henry Chandler Cowles (1930), [http://books.google.com.br/books?id=WyZnVpCiTHIC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=simplest+carbohydrate A Textbook of Botany for Colleges and Universities]&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed that title for [[glycolaldehyde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tietz&quot;&gt;
  Carl A. Burtis, Edward R. Ashwood, Norbert W. Tietz (2000), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=l5hqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=simplest+carbohydrate Tietz fundamentals of clinical chemistry]''
&lt;/ref&gt; Today the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons.

Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called [[monosaccharide]]s with general formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n'' is three or more.  A typical monosaccharide has the structure H-(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(C=O)-(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;-H, that is, an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with many [[hydroxyl]] groups added, usually one on each [[carbon]] [[atom]] that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone [[functional group]].   Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[glyceraldehyde]].  However, some biological substances commonly called &quot;monosaccharides&quot; do not conform to this formula (e.g., [[uronic acids]] and deoxy-sugars such as [[fucose]]), and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g., formaldehyde CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[inositol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;
  Matthews, C. E.; K. E. Van Holde; K. G. Ahern (1999) ''Biochemistry''. 3rd edition. Benjamin Cummings. ISBN 0-8053-3066-6
&lt;/ref&gt;

The open-chain form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a [[heterocyclic compound|closed ring form]] where the [[aldehyde]]/[[ketone]] [[carbonyl]] group carbon (C=O) and [[hydroxyl]] group (-OH) react forming a [[hemiacetal]] with a new C-O-C bridge.

Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, [[deoxyribose]], a component of [[DNA]], is a modified version of [[ribose]]; [[chitin]] is composed of repeating units of [[N-acetylglucosamine]], a [[nitrogen]]-containing form of glucose.

==Monosaccharides==
{{Main|Monosaccharide}}
[[Image:D-glucose color coded.png|130px|right|thumb|[[Glucose|D-glucose]] is an aldohexose with the formula (C·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The red atoms highlight the [[aldehyde]] group, and the blue atoms highlight the [[chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric center]] furthest from the aldehyde; because this -OH is on the right of the [[Fischer projection]], this is a D sugar.]]
Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups. The general [[chemical formula]] of an unmodified monosaccharide is C•(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, literally a &quot;carbon hydrate.&quot; Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids. The smallest monosaccharides, for which n = 3, are dihydroxyacetone and D- and L-glyceraldehyde.

=== Classification of monosaccharides ===
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:187px;&quot;&gt;

The [[α]] and [[Beta (letter)|β]] [[anomer]]s of glucose. Note the position of the hydroxyl group (red or green) on the anomeric carbon relative to the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group bound to carbon 5: they are either on the opposite sides (α), or the same side (β).
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics: the placement of its [[carbonyl]] group, the number of [[carbon]] atoms it contains, and its [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] handedness. If the carbonyl group is an [[aldehyde]], the monosaccharide is an [[aldose]]; if the carbonyl group is a [[ketone]], the monosaccharide is a [[ketose]]. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called [[triose]]s, those with four are called [[tetrose]]s,  five are called [[pentose]]s, six are [[hexose]]s, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Neil A. | authorlink = | coauthors = Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden | title = Biology: Exploring Life | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | location = Boston, Massachusetts | pages = | url = http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-250882-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, [[glucose]] is an [[aldohexose]] (a six-carbon aldehyde), [[ribose]] is an [[aldopentose]] (a five-carbon aldehyde), and [[fructose]] is a [[ketohexose]] (a six-carbon ketone).

Each carbon atom bearing a [[hydroxyl group]] (-OH), with the exception of the first and last carbons, are [[Chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric]], making them [[Stereogenic|stereocenter]]s with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of [[isomer]]s may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. The aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, of which all but two of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16 possible [[stereoisomer]]s. In the case of [[glyceraldehyde]], an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are [[enantiomers]] and [[epimer]]s. [[Dihydroxyacetone|1,3-dihydroxyacetone]], the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehyde, is a symmetric molecule with no stereocenters). The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The &quot;D-&quot; and &quot;L-&quot; prefixes should not be confused with  &quot;d-&quot; or &quot;l-&quot;, which indicate the direction that the sugar [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] plane [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]]. This usage of &quot;d-&quot; and &quot;l-&quot; is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pigman |first=Ward |coauthors=Horton, D. |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton |series= |edition=2nd|date= |year=1972  |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn= |pages=1–67 |chapter= Chapter 1: Stereochemistry of the Monosaccharides }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ring-straight chain isomerism===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|200px|right||[[Glucose]] can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
The aldehyde or ketone group of a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]], forming a [[heterocyclic]] ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called [[furanose]] and [[pyranose]] forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.&lt;ref name=pigman&gt;{{cite book |last=Pigman |first=Ward |coauthors=Anet, E.F.L.J.  |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton |series= |edition=2nd|date= |year=1972  |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn= |pages=165–194 |chapter= Chapter 4: Mutarotations and Actions of Acids and Bases }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conversion from straight-chain form to the cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the [[anomeric carbon]], becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring. The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers are called [[anomer]]s. In the ''α anomer'', the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side ([[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]) of the ring from the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the ''β anomer''. You can remember that the β anomer is cis by the mnemonic, &quot;It's always better to βe up&quot;. Because the ring and straight-chain forms readily interconvert, both anomers exist in [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=pigman/&gt;  In a [[Fischer Projection]], the α anomer is represented with the anomeric hydroxyl group ''trans'' to the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and ''cis'' in the β anomer.

===Use in living organisms===
Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for [[metabolism]], being used both as an energy source (glucose being the most important in nature) and in [[biosynthesis]]. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space efficient forms, often [[polysaccharide]]s. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is [[glycogen]], especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, [[starch]] is used for the same purpose.

==Disaccharides==
[[Image:sucrose 3Dprojection.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Sucrose]], also known as table [[sugar]], is a common disaccharide. It is composed of two monosaccharides: [[glucose|D-glucose]] (left) and [[fructose|D-fructose]] (right).]]
{{Main|Disaccharide}}
Two joined monosaccharides are called a [[disaccharide]] and these are the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a [[covalent]] bond known as a [[glycosidic linkage]] formed via a [[dehydration reaction]], resulting in the loss of a [[hydrogen]] atom from one monosaccharide and a [[hydroxyl group]] from the other. The [[chemical formula|formula]] of unmodified disaccharides is C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.

[[Sucrose]], pictured to the right, is the most abundant disaccharide, and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in [[plant]]s. It is composed of one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule and one [[fructose|D-fructose]] molecule. The [[systematic name]] for sucrose, ''O''-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-D-fructofuranoside, indicates four things:
* Its monosaccharides: glucose and fructose
* Their ring types: glucose is a [[pyranose]], and fructose is a [[furanose]]
* How they are linked together: the oxygen on carbon number 1 (C1) of α-D-glucose is linked to the C2 of D-fructose.
* The ''-oside'' suffix indicates that the [[anomeric carbon]] of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond.

[[Lactose]], a disaccharide composed of one [[galactose|D-galactose]] molecule and one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian [[milk]]. The [[systematic name]] for lactose is ''O''-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include [[maltose]] (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4).
disaccharides can be classified into two types.They are reducing and non-reducing disaccahrides if the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit it is called as reducing disaccharide.

==Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides==
[[Image:amylose 3Dprojection.corrected.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Amylose]] is a linear [[polymer]] of [[glucose]] mainly linked with α(1→4) bonds. It can be made of several thousands of glucose units. It is one of the two components of [[starch]], the other being [[amylopectin]].]]
{{Main|Oligosaccharide|Polysaccharide}}
Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides are composed of longer chains of monosaccharide units bound together by glycosidic bonds. The distinction between the two is based upon the number of monosaccharide units present in the chain. Oligosaccharides typically contain between three and ten monosaccharide units, and polysaccharides contain greater than ten monosaccharide units. Definitions of how large a carbohydrate must be to fall into each category vary according to personal opinion. Examples of oligosaccharides include the disaccharides mentioned above, the trisaccharide [[raffinose]] and the tetrasaccharide stachyose.

Oligosaccharides are found as a common form of [[protein]] [[posttranslational modification]]. Such posttranslational modifications include the Lewis and ABO oligosaccharides responsible for [[blood type|blood group]] classifications and so of tissue incompatibilities, the alpha-Gal epitope responsible for hyperacute rejection in xenotransplantation, and O-GlcNAc modifications.

Polysaccharides represent an important class of biological [[polymer]]s. Their [[function (biology)|function]] in living organisms is usually either structure- or storage-related. [[Starch]] (a polymer of glucose) is used as a storage polysaccharide in plants, being found in the form of both [[amylose]] and the branched [[amylopectin]]. In animals, the structurally similar glucose polymer is the more densely branched [[glycogen]], sometimes called 'animal starch'. Glycogen's properties allow it to be metabolized more quickly, which suits the active lives of moving animals.

[[Cellulose]] and [[chitin]] are examples of structural polysaccharides. Cellulose is used in the [[cell wall]]s of plants and other organisms, and is claimed to be the most abundant organic molecule on earth.&lt;ref&gt;N.A.Campbell (1996) ''Biology'' (4th edition). Benjamin Cummings NY. p.23 ISBN 0-8053-1957-3&lt;/ref&gt; It has many uses such as a significant role in the paper and textile industries, and is used as a feedstock for the production of rayon (via the [[viscose]] process), cellulose acetate, celluloid, and nitrocellulose. Chitin has a similar structure, but has [[nitrogen]]-containing side branches, increasing its strength. It is found in [[arthropod]] [[exoskeleton]]s and in the cell walls of some [[fungi]]. It also has multiple uses, including [[surgical thread]]s.

Other polysaccharides include [[callose]] or [[laminarin]], [[chrysolaminarin]], [[xylan]], [[arabinoxylan]], [[mannan]], [[fucoidan]] and [[galactomannan]].

==Nutrition==
[[Image:starchy-foods..jpg|thumb|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of carbohydrates]]

Foods high in carbohydrate include fruits, sweets, soft drinks, [[bread]]s, [[pasta]]s, [[bean]]s, [[potato]]es, [[bran]], [[rice]], and [[cereal]]s. Carbohydrates are a common source of energy in living organisms, however, no carbohydrate is an [[essential nutrient]] in humans.

Carbohydrates are not necessary building blocks of other molecules, and the body can obtain all its energy from protein and fats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/75/5/951-a Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition? - Westman 75 (5): 951 - American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/136/5/1256?ijkey=ebf0450b5cf21e8d83dd43f62b5559254694f65f A High-Protein, High-Fat, Carbohydrate-Free Diet Reduces Energy Intake, Hepatic Lipogenesis, and Adiposity in Rats - Pichon et al. 136 (5): 1256 - Journal of Nutrition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The brain and neurons generally cannot burn fat for energy, but use glucose or [[Ketone bodies|ketones]]. Humans can synthesize some glucose (in a set of processes known as [[gluconeogenesis]]) from specific amino acids, from the [[glycerol]] backbone in [[triglyceride]]s and in some cases from fatty acids. Carbohydrate contains 15.8 [[kilo-|kilo]][[joule]]s (3.75 [[kilocalorie]]s){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and proteins 16.8 kilojoules (4 kilocalories) per [[gram]], while fats contain 37.8 kilojoules (9 kilocalories) per gram. In the case of protein, this is somewhat misleading as only some amino acids are usable for fuel. 

Organisms typically cannot metabolize all types of carbohydrate to yield energy. Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of calories. Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other [[monosaccharide]]s and [[Disaccharide]]s, though glucose is preferred. In ''Escherichia coli'', for example, the ''lac'' operon will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present, but if both lactose and glucose are present the ''lac'' operon is repressed, resulting in the glucose being used first. [[Polysaccharide]]s are also common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose, however, most organisms cannot metabolize cellulose or other polysaccharides like [[chitin]] and [[arabinoxylans]]. These carbohydrates types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. [[Ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, for example, use microorganisms to process [[cellulose]]. Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible, they may comprise important dietary elements for humans. Called dietary fiber, these carbohydrates enhance digestion among other benefits.

Based on the effects on risk of heart disease and obesity, the [[Institute of Medicine]] recommends that American and Canadian adults get between 45–65% of [[food energy|dietary energy]] from carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board (2002/2005). ''[http://newton.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids]''.

ISBN 0-309-08537-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and [[World Health Organization]] jointly recommend that national dietary guidelines set a goal of 55–75% of total energy from carbohydrates, but only 10% directly from sugars (their term for simple carbohydrates).&lt;ref&gt;Joint WHO/FAO expert consultation (2003). ''[http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH/docs/who_fao_expert_report.pdf Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases]'' ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]). Geneva: [[World Health Organization]]. Pages 55–56.   ISBN 92-4-120916-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Historically nutritionists have classified carbohydrates as either simple or complex, however, the exact delineation of these categories is ambiguous. Today, simple carbohydrate typically refers to [[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s and complex carbohydrate means [[polysaccharide]]s (and [[oligosaccharide]]s). However, the term ''complex carbohydrate'' was first used in slightly different context in the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] publication ''Dietary Goals for the United States'' (1977). In this work, complex carbohydrate were defined as &quot;fruit, vegetables and whole-grains&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Joint WHO/FAO expert consultation (1998), ''Carbohydrates in human nutrition'', [http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8079E/w8079e07.htm  chapter 1]. ISBN 92-5-104114-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Some nutritionists use complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food, where fiber, vitamins and minerals are also found (as opposed to processed carbohydrates, which provide calories but few other nutrients).

A commonly held belief, even among nutritionists, is that complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides, e.g. starches) are digested more slowly than simple carbohydrates (sugars) and thus are healthier. &lt;ref&gt;The Diet Channel ''Good Carbs vs. Bad Carbs: How To Pick The Best Carbs For Your Diet'', [http://www.thedietchannel.com/Good-Carbs-Vs-Bad-Carbs-How-To-Pick-The-Best-Carbs-For-Your-Diet.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; However, there appears to be no significant difference between simple and complex carbohydrates in terms of their effect on blood sugar.&lt;ref&gt;The Nutrition Source, [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/carbohydrates/index.html  Carbohydrates].&lt;/ref&gt; Some simple carbohydrates (e.g. fructose) are digested very slowly, while some complex carbohydrates (starches), especially if processed, raise blood sugar rapidly. The speed of digestion is determined by a variety of factors including which other nutrients are consumed with the carbohydrate, how the food is prepared, individual differences in metabolism, and the chemistry of the carbohydrate.

The [[glycemic index|glycemic index (GI)]] and [[glycemic load]] concepts have been developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion. They rank carbohydrate-rich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on [[blood glucose]] levels. Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food glucose is absorbed, while glycemic load is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in foods. The [[insulin index]] is a similar, more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on [[insulin|blood insulin]] levels, which are caused by glucose (or starch) and some amino acids in food.

Dietary guidelines generally recommend that complex carbohydrates (starches) and nutrient-rich simple carbohydrates such as [[fruit]]s and vegetables, and [[dairy product]]s make up the bulk of carbohydrate consumption. Highly processed sources of carbohydrate such as corn or potato chips, candy, sugary drinks, pastries and white rice are generally considered unhealthy in excess. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA's]] ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005'' dispensed with the simple/complex distinction, instead recommending fiber-rich foods and whole grains.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005'', [http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/html/chapter7.htm Chapter 7 Carbohydrates]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catabolism===
Catabolism is the metabolic reaction cells undergo to extract energy. There are two major [[metabolic pathway]]s of monosaccharide [[catabolism]]: [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].

In glycolysis, oligo/polysaccharides are cleaved first to smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called [[glycoside hydrolase]]s. The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide catabolism. In some cases, as with humans, not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present.

==Carbohydrate chemistry==

'''CSS ''Virginia''''' was the first steam-powered [[ironclad warship]] of the [[Confederate States Navy]], built during the first year of the [[American Civil War]]; she was constructed as a [[casemate ironclad]] using the raised and cut down hull of the [[scuttling|scuttle]]d {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}}. ''Virginia'' was one of the participants in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]], opposing the Union's {{USS|Monitor}} in March, 1862. The battle is chiefly significant in naval history as the first battle between [[ironclads]].

==USS ''Merrimack'' becomes CSS ''Virginia''==
When the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] seceded from the Union in 1861, one of the important federal military bases threatened was Gosport Navy Yard (now [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]]) in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia]]. Accordingly, the order was sent to destroy the base rather than allow it to fall into [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hands. Unfortunately for the Union, the execution of these orders was bungled on 20 April. The [[steam engine|steam]] [[frigate]] USS ''Merrimack'' sank in shallow water before she completely burned. When the Confederate government took possession of the yard, the base commander, [[Flag Officer]] [[French Forrest]], contracted on 18 May to [[Marine salvage|salvage]] the wreck of the ''Merrimack''. This was completed by 30 May and she was moved into the shipyard's only [[graving dock]] where the burned structures were removed.&lt;ref&gt;Quarstein, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;  

The wreck was surveyed and her lower hull and machinery were undamaged so she was selected for conversion into an [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] by [[Stephen Mallory]], [[Confederate States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], as she was the only large ship with intact engines available to the Confederacy in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area. Preliminary sketch designs were submitted by [[Lieutenant]]s [[John Mercer Brooke|John Brooke]] and [[John L. Porter]], each of which envisaged the ship as a casemate ironclad. Brooke's design showed the ends of the ship as submerged and was selected, although detailed design work would be done by Porter as he was a trained [[Naval architecture|naval constructor]]. Porter had overall responsibility for the conversion,&lt;ref&gt;Egan, pp. 373, 376&lt;/ref&gt; but Brooke was responsible for her iron plate and armament while William P. Williamson, Chief Engineer of the Navy, was responsible for the ship's machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Quarstein, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mariners Museum 2007 015a.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Cut away view showing the {{convert|4|in|0}} of iron armor and {{convert|24|in|0}} of wood backing it.]]
The burned hull timbers were cut down past the waterline, and a new deck and armored casemate were added. The deck was {{convert|4|in|0|adj=on}} thick iron. The casemate was built up of {{convert|24|in|cm|0}} of oak and pine in several layers, topped with two {{convert|2|in|0|adj=on}} layers of iron plating oriented perpendicular to each other, and angled to deflect shot hits.  The battery consisted of four single-banded [[Brooke rifle]]s and six {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[Dahlgren gun|Dahlgren]] guns. Two of the rifles, bow and stern [[pivot gun]], were {{convert|7|in|0|adj=on}}, of 14,500 pounds; the other two were {{convert|6.4|in|adj=on}} of 9000 pounds, one on each broadside. The {{convert|9|in|0|adj=on}} gun on each side nearest the furnaces was fitted for firing hot shot. A few 9-inch shot with extra windage (slightly smaller diameter) were cast for hot shot. No other solid shot were on board during the fight.  

As ''Virginia''{{'}}s designers had heard of plans by the North to build an ironclad, and figuring her guns would be unable to harm such a ship, they equipped her with a [[naval ram|ram]]&amp;mdash;at that time an anachronism in a warship.&lt;ref&gt;deKay, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merrimack'''s steam engines, now part of ''Virginia'', were in poor working order (the ship had been slated for an engine rebuild prior to the decision to abandon the Norfolk naval yard), and the salty [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] water and addition of tons of iron armor and ballast did not improve the situation. As completed CSS Virginia had a turning radius of about one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) and required 45 minutes to complete a full circle, which was a major handicap in its battle with the far more nimble USS Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rpi.edu/~fiscap/history_files/monitor.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The commanding officer, Flag Officer &lt;ref&gt;Franklin Buchanan&lt;/ref&gt;, arrived to take command only a few days before sailing. The ship was placed in commission and equipped by the &lt;ref&gt;executive officer&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Catesby ap R. Jones&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Battle of Hampton Roads==
[[File:Monitorvirginia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Painting depicting the Battle of Hampton Roads]]
{{Main|Battle of Hampton Roads}}
The Battle of Hampton Roads began on March 8, 1862 when ''Virginia'' took on the blockading Union fleet. Despite an all-out effort to complete her, the new ironclad still had workmen on board when she sailed into Hampton Roads with her [[flotilla]] of five support ships [[CSS Raleigh (1861)|''Raleigh'']] and [[CSS Beaufort|''Beaufort'']], [[CSS Patrick Henry|''Patrick Henry'']], [[CSS Jamestown|''Jamestown'']], and [[CSS Teaser|''Teaser'']].

The first Union ship engaged, the all wood and sail-powered [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']], was sunk after being rammed by ''Virginia''. However, as ''Cumberland'' sank, ''Virginia's'' iron ram was broken off, causing a bow leak. Seeing what happened to ''Cumberland'', the captain of [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']] ordered his ship into shallow water, where she soon grounded. ''Congress'' and ''Virginia'' traded fire for an hour, after which the badly-damaged ''Congress'' surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of ''Congress'' were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on ''Virginia''. In retaliation, the captain of ''Virginia'' gave the order to open fire on the surrendered ''Congress'' with red-hot shot, setting her ablaze; she burned for many hours, well into the night.

''Virginia'' did not emerge from the battle unscathed. Shot from ''Cumberland'', ''Congress'', and the shore-based Union troops had riddled her smokestack, reducing her already low speed. Two of her guns were out of order, and a number of armor plates had been loosened. Even so, her captain attacked [[USS Minnesota (1855)|USS ''Minnesota'']], which had run aground on a sandbank trying to escape ''Virginia''. However, because of her deep [[draft (ship)|draft]], ''Virginia'' was unable to do significant damage. It being late in the day, ''Virginia'' left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the destruction of the Union blockaders.

Later that night, USS ''Monitor'' finally arrived at Union-held [[Fort Monroe]]. She had been rushed to [[Hampton Roads]], still not quite completed, all the way from the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], in hopes of defending the Union force of wooden ships and preventing &quot;the rebel monster&quot; from further threatening the blockading fleet and nearby Union cities, like [[Washington, D.C.]]. While being towed south, she almost foundered in a storm on the way to Hampton Roads. She still had workmen aboard when she arrived by the firelight from the still burning triumph of ''Virginia''{{'}}s first day of handiwork. 

The next day, on March 9, 1862, the world's first battle between ironclads took place. The smaller, nimbler ''Monitor'' was able to outmaneuver ''Virginia'', but neither ship proved able to do significant damage, despite numerous hits. ''Monitor'' had a much lower freeboard, and thus much harder to hit by the ''Virginia's'' guns, but vulnerable to ramming and boarding. Finally, ''Monitor'' retreated. This was because the captain of the ''Monitor'' was hit by gunpowder in his eyes while looking through the pilothouse's peepholes, which caused ''Monitor'' to haul off.  The ''Monitor'' had retreated off into the shoals and remained there, and so the battle was a draw.  The captain of ''Virginia'', Lieutenant [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]], CSN received the advice from his pilots to take the midnight high tide to depart back over the bar toward the CS Navy base at Norfolk until noon of the next day.  Lieutenant Jones wanted, instead, to re-attack, but to &quot;turn the ship and fight the starboard gun, was impossible, for heading up stream on a strong flood-tide, she would have been wholly unmanageable.&quot;  The pilots emphasized that the ''Virginia'' had &quot;nearly three miles to run to the bar&quot; and that she could not remain and &quot;take the ground on a falling tide.&quot;  So to prevent getting stuck, Lieutenant Jones called off the battle and moved back toward harbor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/cssvirginia.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  After the battle with the ''Monitor'', the ''Virginia'' retired to the Gosport Naval Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for repairs and remained in drydock until April 4, 1862. 

In the following month, the crew of the ''Virginia'' were unsuccessful in their attempts to break the Union blockade. The blockade had been bolstered by the hastily ram-fitted ''SS Vanderbilt'',&lt;ref&gt;T.J Stiles, &quot;The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt&quot; (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and SS Illinois as well as the SS Arago and [[USS Minnesota (1855)|USS ''Minnesota'']] which had been repaired. The ''Virginia'' made several sorties back over to Hampton Roads hoping to draw ''Monitor'' into battle. ''Monitor'', however, was under orders not to engage.  

On April 11, the Confederate Navy sent Lieutenant [[Joseph Nicholson Barney]] in command of the side-paddle [[CSS Jamestown|CSS ''Jamestown'']], along with the ''Virginia'' and five other ships in full view of the Union squadron, enticing them to fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1862services_of_virginia.htm C.A.R. Jones, ''Services of the Virginia''(1883)]&lt;/ref&gt;  When it became clear that the US Navy ships were unwilling to fight, the [[James River Squadron|CS Navy squadron]] moved in and captured three merchant ships, the brigs ''Marcus'' and ''Sabout'' and the schooner ''Catherine T. Dix''.  Their flags were then hoisted &quot;Union-side down&quot; to further taunt the US Navy into a fight, as they were towed back to Norfolk, with the help of the [[CSS Raleigh|CSS ''Raleigh'']].

[[Image:Destruction of Merrimac, May 11, 1862.png|left|thumb|alt=Print: Destruction of the rebel vessel &quot;Merrimac&quot; off Crany Island; published by Currier and Ives|''Destruction of the rebel vessel ''Merrimac'' off Craney Island, May 11, 1862,'' by [[Currier and Ives]]]] 
Neither ironclad was ever to fight again.  By late April the new Union ironclads [[USS Naugatuck (1844)|USS Naugatuck/USRC E. A. Stevens]] and [[USS Galena (1862)|USS Galena]] had also joined the blockade. On May 8, 1862, ''Virginia'' and the [[James River Squadron]] ventured out when the Union ships began shelling the Confederate fortifications near Norfolk but the Union ships retired under the shore batteries on the north side of the James River and on [[Rip Raps]] island.

On May 10, 1862, advancing Union troops occupied [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. Since ''Virginia'' was a steam-powered battery and not a cruiser, she was not seaworthy enough to enter the ocean even if she was able to pass the Union blockade. ''Virginia'' was also unable to retreat further up the James River due to her deep {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=on}} draft. In an attempt to reduce her draft, supplies and coal were dumped overboard but this exposed the unclad, wooden hull.  Without a home port, ''Virginia'' was ordered blown up to keep her from being captured. This task fell to Lieutenant Jones, the last man to leave CSS ''Virginia'' after all of her guns had been safely removed and carried to the CS Marine Corps base and fortifications at Drewy's Bluff to fight again. Early on the morning of May 11, 1862, off [[Craney Island]], fire reached her magazine and she was destroyed by a great explosion. Her thirteen star [[Stars and Bars]] [[battle ensign]] was saved from destruction and today resides in the collection of the [[Chicago Historical Society]], minus three of its stars.

The USS Monitor was lost on December 31 of the same year, when the vessel was swamped by high waves in a violent storm while under tow by the tug ''Rhoad Island'' off [[Cape Hatteras]] North Carolina. Some of her crew went down with the ironclad but others were saved by lifeboats sent from ''Rhoad Island''.

==Historical names: ''Merrimack'', ''Virginia'', ''Merrimac''==
The name of the warship which served the Confederacy in the Battle of Hampton Roads has become a source of confusion, which continues to the present day.

When she was first commissioned into the United States Navy in 1856, her name was ''Merrimack'', with the ''K''. The name derived from the [[Merrimack River]] near where she was built. She was the second ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the Merrimack River, which is formed by the junction of the [[Pemigewasset River|Pemigewasset]] and [[Winnipesaukee River]]s at [[Franklin, New Hampshire|Franklin]], [[New Hampshire]]. The Merrimack flows south across [[New Hampshire]], and then eastward across northeastern [[Massachusetts]] before emptying in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]], [[Massachusetts]].

The Confederacy bestowed the name ''Virginia'' on her when she was raised, restored, and outfitted as an ironclad warship, but the Union preferred to call the Confederate ironclad warship by either its earlier name, &quot;''Merrimack''&quot;, or by the nickname, &quot;The Rebel Monster&quot;.

Perhaps because the Union won the Civil War, the [[history of the United States]] generally records the Union version. In the aftermath of the battle, the names ''Virginia'' and ''Merrimack'' were used equally by both sides, as attested by the newspapers and correspondence of the day.  Some Navy reports and pre-1900 historians misspelled the name as &quot;Merrimac,&quot; which is actually an unrelated ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancivilwar.com/monitor.html Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimack C.S.S. Virginia Civil War Naval Battle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence &quot;the Battle of the ''Monitor'' and the ''Merrimac''&quot;. Both spellings are still in use in the Hampton Roads area.

==Memorial, heritage==
*It is said the most popular exhibit at [[Jamestown Exposition]] held in 1907 at [[Sewell's Point]] was the &quot;Battle of the ''Merrimac'' and ''Monitor'',&quot; a diorama that was in a special building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
*The small community in [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery County]], [[Virginia]] near where the coal burned by the Confederate ironclad was mined is now known as [[Merrimac, Virginia|Merrimac]], [[Virginia]].
*The October 8, 1867 issue of the ''Norfolk Virginian'' newspaper carried a prominent classified advertisement in the paper's &quot;Private Sales&quot; section for the salvaged iron ram of the CSS ''Virginia''. The ad states verbatim &quot;A RELIC OF WAR FOR SALE: The undersigned has had several offers for the IRON PROW! of the first iron-clad ever built, the celebrated Ram and Iron Clad Virginia, formerly the Merrimac. This immense RELIC WEIGHS 1,340 POUNDS, wrought iron, and as a sovereign of the war, and an object of interest as a revolution in naval warefare, would suit a Museum, State Institute, or some great public resort. Those desiring to purchase will please address D. A. UNDERDOWN, Wrecker, care of ''Virginian'' Office, Norfolk, Va.&quot; It is unclear from the above whether this was the first iron ram that broke off and lodged in the starboard bow of the sinking USS ''Cumberland'' during the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads or was the second iron ram affixed to ''Virginia''{{'}}s bow at the time she was run aground and burned to avoid capture by Union forces. No further mention has been found concerning the final disposition of this historic artifact.
*Other pieces of ''Virginia'' did survive and are on display at the [[Mariners' Museum]] in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and the [[Museum of the Confederacy]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], where one of her [[anchors]] has resided on its front lawn for many years.
*In 1907, an armor plate from the ship was melted down and used in the casting of the [[Pokahuntas Bell]] for the [[Jamestown Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]], &quot;[http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/lccn/sn85038615/1907-04-13/ed-1/seq-2 Pokahuntas Bell for Exposition]&quot;, April 13, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;{{Wikisource|Joint Resolution Authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to Furnish Metal for a Bell}}
*Starting around 1883, numerous souvenirs, made from recently salvaged iron and wood raised from ''Virginia''{{'}}s sunken hulk, found a ready and willing market among eastern seaboard residents who remembered the historic first battle between ironclads. Various tokens, medals, medalets, sectional watch fobs, and other similar metal keepsakes are known to have been struck by private mints in limited quantities. Known examples still exist today, being held in both public and private collections, rarely coming up for public auction. Nine examples made from ''Virginia''{{'}}s iron and copper can be found cataloged in great detail, with front and back photos, in David Schenkman's 1979 numismatic booklet listed in the Reference section (below).
*The name of the [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]], built in Hampton Roads in the general vicinity of the famous engagement, with both Virginia and federal funds, also reflects the more recent version.

}}'''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' (abbreviated as the '''LDS Church''' and colloquially referred to as the '''Mormon Church''') is a [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[religion]] and the largest denomination originating from the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in [[Upstate New York]] in 1830. The church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], and has established [[local church|congregations]] (called ''[[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]]'' or ''branches'') and built [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] worldwide. The church currently claims a growing [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics|membership]] of over 14.1 million.&lt;ref name=statistics2011&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/2010-statistical-report-for-2011-april-general-conference|title=2010 Statistical Report for 2011 April General Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the other churches of the Latter Day Saint movement, the LDS Church considers itself to be a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saint)|restoration]] of the [[Early Christianity|early]] [[Christian Church]] started by [[Jesus]], which was later lost in the centuries after Christ in a [[Great Apostasy]]. Adherents—referred to as ''Latter-day Saints'' or, more commonly, ''[[Mormons]]''—view faith in Jesus Christ as the central tenet of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith (1976), 121 (&quot;The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.&quot;).

Monson, “The Way of the Master,” Ensign, Jan 2003, 2–7.&lt;/ref&gt; LDS theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; Book of Mormon; Mosiah 3:12&lt;/ref&gt; though LDS doctrines regarding the [[God in Mormonism|nature of God]] and [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|the potential of mankind]] differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an [[biblical canon|open canon]] which includes four [[religious text|scriptural texts]]:&lt;ref&gt;Articles of [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1/8#8 Faith 1:8]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bible]] (both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s), the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation dictated by Joseph Smith and includes commentary and [[exegesis]] about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient [[prophet]]s.

Under the doctrine of [[continuous revelation|continuing]] [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]], Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus leads the church by revealing his will to its [[President of the Church|President]], whom adherents regard as a modern-day &quot;[[prophet, seer, and revelator]].&quot; The current President is [[Thomas S. Monson]]. Individual members can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Perhaps the puzzle some feel can be explained by the reality that each of us has two different channels to God. We have a channel of governance through our prophet and other leaders. This channel, which has to do with doctrine, ordinances, and commandments, results in obedience. We also have a channel of personal testimony, which is direct to God. This has to do with His existence, our relationship to Him, and the truth of His restored gospel. This channel results in knowledge.&quot; Elder Dallin H.

==History==
{{Main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The history of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] which is in common with all Latter Day Saint movement churches, (2) a &quot;pioneer era&quot; under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his 19th century successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as [[Utah]] achieved statehood.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints traces its current dispensation beginnings to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] on April 6, 1830 in Western [[New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholars and eye-witnesses disagree whether the church was organized in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]] at the Smith log home, or in [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer]]. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=109}}; {{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23}} (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements).

Years later, the church established the principle that Young, and any other senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]]  of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]], would be ordained [[President of the Church]] as a matter of course upon the death of the former President, subject to unanimous agreement of the Quorum of the Twelve.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups of Latter Day Saints followed other leaders to form other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|pp=198–211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneer era===
[[Image:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brigham Young]] led the LDS Church from 1844 until his death in 1877.]]
For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war,&lt;ref&gt;In 2004, the State of Illinois recognized the expulsion of the Latter-day Saints as the &quot;largest forced migration in American history&quot; and stated in the adopted resolution that, &quot;WHEREAS, The biases and prejudices of a less enlightened age in the history of the State of Illinois caused unmeasurable hardship and trauma for the community of Latter-day Saints by the distrust, violence, and inhospitable actions of a dark time in our past; therefore, be it resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-third General Assembly of the State of Illinois, that we acknowledge the disparity of those past actions and suspicions, regretting the expulsion of the community of Latter-day Saints, a people of faith and hard work.&quot; [http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=3&amp;SessionID=3&amp;GA=93&amp;DocTypeID=HR&amp;DocNum=0793&amp;LegID=12984&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= &quot;Official House Resolution HR0793 (LRB093 21726 KEF 49525 r), Illinois General Assembly, April 1, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigham Young]] led his followers, the [[Mormon pioneers]] constituting most of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], to [[Nebraska]] and then in 1847 to what became the [[Utah Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;emigration-religious-freedom&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/mopi/historyculture/index.htm &quot;Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail: History &amp; Culture&quot;], U.S. National Park Service. &quot;The great Mormon migration of 1846–1847 was but one step in the LDS' quest for religious freedom and growth.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As groups arrived over a period of years, LDS settlers branched out and colonized a large region now known as the [[Mormon Corridor]].

Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity, and initially governed both the church and the state as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader. He also publicized the previously secret practice of [[plural marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;The Mormon doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by one of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Twelve Apostles]] [[Orson Pratt]] and [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith]]'s successor [[Brigham Young]] in a special conference of the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints assembled in the [[Mormon Tabernacle]] on 28 August 1852, and reprinted in an extra edition of the ''[[Deseret News]]''

By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah territory by Brigham Young.&lt;ref&gt;See Tullidge, Edward, History of Salt Lake City, 132-35 (Original from the University of Michigan, 1886).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Utah War|Utah Mormon War]] ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful&lt;!--

The Mormons feared further illegal theft of land, and murders which had plagued them back east.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other [[President of the Church|LDS Presidents]], who resisted efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized all its assets.  Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Official Declaration —|od|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this Manifesto did not yet dissolve existing plural marriages, and did not entirely stop the practice of polygamy, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a [[U.S. state]]. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a &quot;[[Second Manifesto]]&quot; calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today seeks to actively distance itself from “[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]” groups still practicing polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;In 1998 President Gordon B. Hinckley stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;
“If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.” [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=7c86605ff590c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 Gordon B.

===Modern times===
During the 20th century, the church grew substantially and became an international organization, due in part to the spread of missionaries around the globe. In 2000, the church reported 60,784 missionaries&lt;ref name=Stats2000&gt;“Statistical Report, 2000,” ''Ensign'', May 2001, 22&lt;/ref&gt; and global church membership stood at just over 11 million.&lt;ref name=Stats2000/&gt; Worldwide membership surpassed 13 million in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Deseret Morning News ''2008 Church Almanac'' pg. 655&lt;/ref&gt; and reached 14 million in July 2010,&lt;ref name=14million&gt;Michael De Groote, [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700103390/14-million-Mormons-and-counting.html &quot;14 million Mormons and counting&quot;], ''[[Deseret News]]'', 2011-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; with about six million of those within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Fletcher Stack, [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50253113-76/church-lds-says-news.html.csp &quot;LDS Church ramps up on global stage&quot;], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2010-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The church cautions against overemphasis of growth statistics for comparison with other churches because relevant factors—including activity rates and death rates, methodology used in registering or counting members, what factors constitute membership, and geographical variations—are rarely accounted for in the comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/church/facts?lang=eng Basic Facts about the Church: Church Membership], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has become a stronger and more public champion of the [[nuclear family]] and at times played a prominent role in political matters, including opposition to [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper|MX Peacekeeper missile]] bases in Utah and [[Nevada]],&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=b0d6fc3157a6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 First Presidency Statement on Basing of MX Missile]”, ''Ensign'', June 1981, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; opposition to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=f8a4615b01a6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “The Church and the Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: A Moral Issue”], ''Ensign'', March 1980, insert.&lt;/ref&gt; opposition to legalized [[gambling]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=4ace94bf3938b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “Church’s Stand against Gambling&quot;], ''Ensign'', March 1992, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; opposition to [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Same-Gender Attraction|publisher=Newsroom.lds.org|date=2005-05-26|url= http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=27f71f1dd189f010VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=726511154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD|accessdate=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposition to legalized [[euthanasia|physician-assisted death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Euthanasia and Prolonging Life|publisher=Newsroom.lds.org|date=|url=http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=aae4b28d7cb9f010VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=726511154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD|accessdate=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from issues that it considers to be ones of morality, however, the church usually maintains a position of political neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Political Neutrality|publisher=Newsroom.lds.org|date=2006-10-19|url= http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=6203d93c8688f010VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=726511154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD|accessdate=March 2007}}; see also Newsroom.lds.org, [http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=37ba9f4d1e031110VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f5f411154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD &quot;No Thumbs Up or Down To Legislature&quot;], Retrieved May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of official changes have taken place to the organization during the modern era. One significant change was the [[Black people and the Latter Day Saint movement|ordination of black men]] to the priesthood in 1978, which reversed a policy originally instituted by Brigham Young in 1852.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mauss-70&quot;&gt;[http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3 Bush &amp; Mauss 1984: 70]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also periodic changes in the structure and organization of the church, mainly to accommodate the organization's growth and increasing international presence. For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations.

==Teachings and practices==
[[Image:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[Standard Works]]''.]]

===Sources of authority===
{{See also|Standard Works|revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
The theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith, Jr. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the ''[[Standard Works]]''. Included in the ''Standard Works'' are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Among these books, the church holds in equal esteem as the other Standard Works the Book of Mormon, said by the church to be &quot;Another Testament of Jesus Christ&quot; that Joseph Smith translated from buried golden plates. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as &quot;the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [their] religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Church, 4:461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be &quot;the word of God as far as it is translated correctly&quot;.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}} (&quot;We believe the ''Bible'' to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Joseph Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.

Another source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the prophet and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets&lt;ref name=&quot;oct09_conference&quot;&gt;{{Cite conference

===Distinctive doctrines and practices===
{{Main|Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
[[Image:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|left|A couple after their [[Celestial marriage|marriage]] in the [[Manti Utah Temple]]]]
Several doctrines and practices of the LDS Church are unique within Christianity.  The [[Mormon cosmology]] and [[Plan of Salvation|plan of salvation]] include the doctrines of [[pre-mortal life]], [[Degrees of Glory|three degrees of heaven]], and [[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]]. According to these doctrines every human spirit is a literal spirit child of God, and humans may achieve ''exaltation'', which means that they may become gods and goddesses just as Jesus Christ became a god.  Achieving this same status that Jesus achieved is also referred to as becoming a &quot;joint-heir with Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/EoM,3735|&quot;Godhood,&quot; Encyclopedia of Mormonism, p. 554,] &quot;Those who achieve this state of perfection will become joint-heirs with Christ.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine of exaltation includes the reuniting of the mortal family after the [[resurrection]] and the ability to have spirit children in the afterlife.&lt;!--

--&gt; To obtain this state of godhood, the church teaches that one must have [[faith]] in Jesus, keep the commandments and participate in a sequence of ceremonial [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] (called ''[[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]]'').&lt;!--

The LDS sealing ceremony reflects a singular LDS view with respect to families. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be ''sealed'' to each other so that their marital bond continues in the afterlife.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A man may be sealed to more than one wife if his previous wives are either dead or legally divorced from him; a living woman, however, may only be sealed to one husband. See {{Citation

--&gt; The most significant LDS ordinances may be performed via proxy in behalf of those who have died. (See, e.g., [[baptism for the dead]]). The Church teaches that all will have the opportunity to hear and accept or reject the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the benefit of its sacraments, in this life or the next.

The LDS faithful observe a health code called the Word of Wisdom in which they abstain from the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[tobacco]]. The Word of Wisdom also encourages the use of wholesome herbs and fruits within season, moderate consumptions of meats, and consumption of grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89 |title=The Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - section 89 HE |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their moral code includes a [[law of chastity]] that prohibits sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriage.

LDS faithfuls donate a 10 percent [[tithe]] on their income annually.

They also perform volunteer service in their local church. Moreover, all unmarried young men between 19–25 years old who are sufficiently healthy and many retired couples are encouraged to volunteer up to two years as a missionary to proselytize and/or provide humanitarian service. Unmarried women 21 years and older also may serve as missionaries for 18 months, but it is not considered their duty to do so as it is with the young men who are ordained elders.

Members are further instructed to set aside one night a week, typically Monday, for a [[Family Home Evening]], where they gather together as a family to study gospel principles and participate in different activities.

===Comparisons with mainstream Christianity===
{{See also|Mormonism and Christianity}}
[[Image:Christus statue temple square salt lake city.jpg|right|thumb|Latter-day Saints believe in the [[resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], as depicted in this replica of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s Christus statue located in the North Visitors' Center on [[Temple Square]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]]]]

In addition to a belief in the Bible (&quot;as far as it is translated correctly&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Adherents believe in the Bible &quot;as far as it is translated correctly&quot; See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the divinity of Jesus, and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and [[resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]], other LDS teachings are shared with other branches of Christianity. For example, LDS theology includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; his [[virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (via a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|Restoration of Christ's church given through Joseph Smith, Jr.]]), [[millennialism]], [[continuationism]], [[penal substitution]],&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, Alma 34:8-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and a form of [[Apostolic succession]]. The practices of [[baptism#Submersion|baptism by immersion]] and the [[Eucharist]] (referred to as ''the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|Sacrament]]'') are also held in common. However, most mainstream Christian groups will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as they will between themselves; for example, between [[Catholics]] and [[Baptists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm|title=''The Question of the Validity of Baptism Conferred in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints''|author=Fr. Luis Ladaria, S.J.|accessdate=01Nov2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from the many other churches within Christianity, and many people do not accept the LDS Church as part of Christianity.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, a 2007 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 31% of Americans surveyed do not consider Mormons to be Christian. See [http://pewforum.org/surveys/religionviews07/ Public Expresses Mixed Views of Islam, Mormonism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; From the perspective of Christians who agree with creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a [[Trinity]] of three separate persons with &quot;[[Homoousian|one substance]]&quot;. LDS Church theology includes the belief in a &quot;[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]&quot; composed of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct beings making one Godhead. Other significant differences relate to the church's acceptance of additional scripture, doctrine, and practices beyond what is found in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] versions of the Bible.

===Comparison with other Latter Day Saint movement faiths===
{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
[[Image:MISSIONNAIRES MORMONS.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Missionary (LDS Church)|Missionaries]] typically commit to 18-24 months of full-time service.]]
The LDS Church shares a common heritage with a number of smaller faith groups that are collectively called the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].  The largest of these smaller groups is the [[Community of Christ]] (previously known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), based in Independence, Missouri, followed by the [[Church of Jesus Christ]], based in Monongahela, Pennsylvania. In common with the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith, Jr. as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the ''Doctrine and Covenants''.  However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church on matters of doctrine and church leadership.

The main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith, Jr.  Other branches may be considered later off-shoots of the LDS Church branch, mainly as a result of disagreements about plural marriage. In the LDS Church, the practice of plural marriage was abandoned around the turn of the 20th century, but it has continued among the fundamentalist groups, who believe the practice is a requirement for exaltation. The LDS Church, by contrast, believes that a single celestial marriage is sufficient for exaltation. Fundamentalists also believe in a number of other doctrines taught and practiced by Brigham Young in the 19th century, which the LDS Church has either abandoned, repudiated, or put in abeyance; e.g., the church has long excommunicated any members caught practicing polygamy.

--&gt; After Smith died, Brigham Young and the largest body of Smith's followers incorporated the LDS Church in 1851 by legislation of the [[State of Deseret]]&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The initial incorporation by the non-existent [[State of Deseret]] {{cite web |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/uthisstat&amp;CISOPTR=1756&amp;REC=4 |title=(1851) Laws and Ordinances of the State of Deseret (Utah) Compilation 1851 |publisher=}} was not legally valid, but was soon ratified by the [[Utah Territory]] in 1851 {{cite web |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Futhisstat&amp;CISOPTR=448&amp;REC=3&amp;CISOBOX=Church+of+jesus+christ+of+latter-day+saints |title=(1851) Acts Resolutions and Memorials Passed by the First Annual and Special Sessions of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah, 1851}} and 1855. See ''Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Romney'', 136 U.S. 44&amp;ndash;45 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; under the name ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' which included a hyphenated &quot;Latter-day&quot; and a lower-case &quot;d&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/uthisstat&amp;CISOPTR=1756&amp;REC=4 |title=State of Deseret: An Ordinance, incorporating the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |date=February 4, 1851}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1887, the LDS Church was legally dissolved in the United States by the [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] because of the church's practice (now abandoned) of polygamy. The Edmunds-Tucker Act was repealed in 1978. The church has continued to operate under what remains its formal name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Accepted informal names include the ''LDS Church'', the ''Latter-day Saints'', and the ''Mormons''. The term ''Mormon Church'' is in common use,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Associated Press]] continues to says that &quot;Mormon Church&quot; is a proper second reference in its ''Style Guide'' for journalists. {{cite web |url=http://www.westminster-mo.edu/academics/resources/library/resources/Pages/GuidetoAPStyle.aspx |title=? }}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the church began discouraging its use in the late 20th century, though takes no issue with the term ''Mormon'' itself. The church requests that the official name be used when possible or, if necessary, shortened to &quot;the Church&quot; or &quot;the Church of Jesus Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Style Guide|publisher=Newsroom.lds.org|date=2009-03-24|url= http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ca07ae4af9c7e010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD|accessdate=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the ''Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of Utah to acquire, hold, and dispose of [[real property]]. In 1923, the church incorporated the ''Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' in Utah to receive and manage money and church donations. In 1997, the church incorporated ''[[Intellectual Reserve|Intellectual Reserve, Inc.]]'' to hold all the church's [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, and other [[intellectual property]]. The church also holds several non-tax-exempt corporations. See [[Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

===Geographic distribution and membership===
{{See also|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership history}}

[[Image:LDS Church presence 2008.png|thumb|300px|left|{{legend|#336699|Countries and territories with at least one LDS temple}} {{legend|#99CCFF|Countries and territories with no LDS temple, but with organized congregations and missionaries}} {{legend|#CCCCCC|Countries and territories with no official LDS presence}}]]

Church congregations are organized geographically. Members are generally expected to attend the congregation with their assigned geographical area; however, some geographical areas also provide separate congregations for single adults or for speakers of alternate languages.   For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]], or smaller congregations known as branches. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a [[chapel]], the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard [[meetinghouse]], of which the church maintains [http://www.mormon.org/virtualchapel/virtualchapel.html a virtual tour of a typical example] and also an [http://maps.lds.org online meetinghouse locator] which can be used to find the locations and meeting times of its congregations all over the world. Regional church organizations larger than single congregations include [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]], [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]], and regions.

The church reports a worldwide membership of over 13 million&lt;ref name = SLT13&gt;This is the church's own estimate, based on membership records.  {{Harvtxt|Hales|2009}}. The church's definition of &quot;membership&quot; includes all persons who were ever baptized, or whose parents were members while the person was under the age of eight (called &quot;members of record&quot;) {{Harvtxt|LDS Church|2006|pp=145–46}}, who have neither been excommunicated nor asked to have their names removed from church records. {{Harvtxt|LDS Church|2006|pp=116, 148–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 6.7 million residing outside the United States. According to these statistics it is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicChurch.org ''2005 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''], National Council of Churches. See article by [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html Information Please Database], Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The church membership report includes all baptized members and their children. Although the church does not release attendance figures to the public, researchers estimate that actual attendance at weekly LDS worship services globally is around 4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Stack|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Members living in the U.S. and Canada constitute 46% of membership, [[Latin America]] 38%, and members in the rest of the world 16%.&lt;ref name=&quot;currentmembership&quot;&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d10511154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD Statistical Information], Retrieved December 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the [[City College of New York]] in 2001 extrapolated that there were 2,787,000 self-identified LDS adults in the United States in 2001, 1.3% of the US population, making the LDS Church the 10th-largest religious body in their phone survey of over 50,000 households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=American Religious Identification Survey|work=cuny.edu|url= http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm|author=Egon Mayer, Ph.D.; Barry A.

===Priesthood hierarchy===
{{Main|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}

[[Image:Thomas S Monson.jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas S. Monson]], [[President of the Church|President]] of the LDS Church since 2008.]]

The LDS Church is organized in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by men. Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus leads the church through revelation and has chosen a single man, called &quot;the Prophet&quot; or [[President of the Church]], as his spokesman on the earth. The current president is [[Thomas S. Monson]]. He and two counselors (who usually are ordained [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]]) form the [[First Presidency]], the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haight, David B. 1986&quot;&gt;Haight, David B., &quot;A Prophet Chosen of the Lord&quot;, Ensign, May 1986, 7&lt;/ref&gt; When a president dies, his successor is invariably the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who then reconstitutes a new First Presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haight, David B. 1986&quot;/&gt;  These men, and the other male members of the church-wide leadership (including the first two [[Quorums of Seventy]] and the [[Presiding Bishopric]]) are called [[general authority|general authorities]]. They exercise both [[ecclesiastical]] and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and [[mission president]]s work full-time and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, Ch. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

At the local level, the church leadership are drawn from the laity and work on a part-time volunteer basis without stipend.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a time, the church had a paid local clergy; however, that practice was discontinued in the early 1900s. See D. Michael Quinn (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Like all members, they are asked to donate a tithe of 10 percent of their income to the church. An exception to that rule is for LDS missionaries who work at the local level and are paid basic living expenses from a fund that receives contributions from their home congregations; however, prospective missionaries are encouraged to contribute the cost of their missions to this fund themselves when possible. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.

All worthy males are generally considered for the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and are ordained to the priesthood as early as age 12. Ordination occurs by a ceremony where [[laying on of hands|hands are laid]] on the head of the one ordained. The priesthood is divided into an [[Aaronic priesthood]] for young men 12 and up and a [[Melchizedek Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] for men 18 and up.

===Church programs and auxiliary organizations===
{{See also|Auxiliary organization (LDS Church)}}

Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five auxiliary organizations that fill various roles in the church: [[Relief Society]] (a women's organization),&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Relief Society]] was founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]], and with the motto &quot;Charity Never Faileth&quot;, the organization today includes more than 5 million women in more than 165 countries. {{Citation|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1--43-2-125,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=From Pioneer Group to Worldwide Society}}. Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; the [[Young Men Organization]] and [[Young Women Organization]] (for adolescents aged 12 to 17), [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]] (an organization for children up to age 12), and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] (which provides a variety of Sunday classes for adolescents and adults). The church also operates several programs and organizations in the fields of proselytizing, education, and church welfare such as [[LDS Humanitarian Services]].  Many of these auxiliaries and programs are coordinated by the [[Priesthood Correlation Program]], which is designed to provide a systematic approach to maintain worldwide consistency, orthodoxy, and control of the church's ordinances, doctrines, organizations, meetings, materials, and other programs and activities.

[[Image:BYUclarillon.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Brigham Young University Centennial Carillon Tower|carillon tower]] at [[Brigham Young University]], one of several educational institutions sponsored by the church]]
The LDS Church operates a large [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] program. Some members of the church are encouraged to serve as missionaries either full-time, part-time, over the internet, or as &quot;service missionaries&quot; in one of hundreds of [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]] throughout the world. All missionaries serve on a volunteer basis, and their expenses are paid by savings of the missionaries themselves, their families, their local congregations, and in some cases from a general church fund.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=LDS Church|title=Church Handbook of Instructions|year=2006|volume=1|page=155}} (&quot;Contributions to the General Missionary Fund help spread the gospel in ways such as providing partial financial support for missionaries who need it to supplement contributions from themselves, their families, and the ward missionary fund.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Missionaries include young single men between 19 and 25 (who serve two year missions), single women over the age of 21 (who serve 18-month missions), and mature couples who are generally [[retired]] (who serve terms ranging from three to 36 months&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/missionary/mormon_missionaries.html|title=Mormon Missionaries|publisher=Light Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;). Young single men are strongly encouraged and expected to serve a mission; women and couples are encouraged but not expected to serve missions. Missionaries generally have no input on what part of the world they serve their missions, and if necessary, the church will teach them a new language.  Missionaries are held to high standards of personal worthiness, which is determined by interviews by ecclesiastical leaders about how well the missionary has followed church standards such as the [[Word of Wisdom]] (not consuming alcohol, tobacco, coffee, or tea) and the [[law of chastity]] (abstaining from pre- or extra-marital sex).  During their missions missionaries are rarely allowed to contact their parents by phone though they are actively encouraged to communicate with their families and friends through weekly emails or letters. The missionaries are typically only permitted to talk to their families on the telephone on Mother's Day and Christmas though special circumstances sometimes call for temporary individual adaptations to this rule. They are assigned one companion of the same sex, who is also a missionary.  They have a strict schedule which allows one day to sightsee and do laundry.&lt;ref&gt;http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/08/hfr-for-tues-amelizabeth-smarts-other-journey/ CNN's Jessica Ravitch, Elizabeth Smart's Other Journey, CNN. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The church operates a [[Church Educational System]] which includes [[Brigham Young University]], [[Brigham Young University–Idaho]] (formerly Ricks College), [[Brigham Young University–Hawaii]], and [[LDS Business College]]. The church also operates [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]] and an [[LDS Student Association]] near the campuses of many colleges and universities.  For high-school aged youth, the church operates a four-year [[LDS Seminary|Seminary program]], which provides religious classes for students to supplement their secular education.  The church also sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]], which provides educational opportunities to students from [[developing nations]].
[[File:LDS geneology library slc utah.jpg|thumb|right|The church's [[Family History Library]] is the world's largest library dedicated to [[genealogy|genealogical research]]]]
The church's welfare system, initiated during the [[Great Depression]], provides aid to the poor. It is financed by [[fast offering]]s: monthly donations beyond the normal 10 percent tithe, which represents the cost of foregoing two meals on monthly ''[[Fast Sunday]]s''. Money from the program is used to operate [[Bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food at low cost.  Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] (congregational [[pastor]]s).  The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Philanthropies]] division to disaster victims worldwide.

Other church programs and departments include [[LDS Family Services]], which provides assistance with [[adoption]], [[relationship counseling|marital and family counseling]], [[psychotherapy]], and [[intervention (counseling)|addiction counseling]]; the LDS Church History Department, which collects church history and records; and the Family History Department, which administers the church's large [[family history]] efforts and operates the world's largest [[Family History Library|library]] dedicated to [[genealogy|genealogical research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm |title=AAG International Research |author=AAG International Research |date= |work= |publisher=[http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm AAG] |accessdate=2009-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church is also a major sponsor of [[Scouting]] programs for boys, particularly in the United States, where it provides more [[Boy Scout|members]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] than any other church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Boy Scouts of America Membership Report&amp;nbsp;– 2007 |date=2008-01-07 |url=http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=P.R.A.Y. |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finances===
{{Main|Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The church has not released church-wide financial statements since 1959, but in 1997, [[Time Magazine|''Time'']] magazine called it one of the world's wealthiest churches [[per capita]].&lt;ref&gt;Biema, David Van. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986794,00.html Kingdom Come]. ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Vol. 150 No. 5, August 4, 1997 (estimating the church's value at over $30 billion).&lt;/ref&gt; Its for-profit, non-profit, and educational subsidiary entities are audited by an independent accounting firm: {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1995/04/10/00/0000950134-95-000692/Section3.asp Belo Corp Form 8-K.]  Accessed May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://finserve.byu.edu/files/archives/Handouts/November%202005/Finance%20Section%20Draft%207-Without%20Requirements.doc Financial Planning]&quot;. finserve.byu.edu. Accessed May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the church employs an independent [[audit]] department that provides its certification at each annual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] that church contributions are collected and spent in accordance with church policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cantwell |first=Robert W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |month=May |title=Church Auditing Department Report, 2006 |journal=Ensign |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=6 |id= |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=48fdb5658af22110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1 |accessdate=2008-02-22 |quote=The Church Auditing Department has been granted access to all records and systems necessary to evaluate the adequacy of controls over receipts of funds, expenditures, and safeguarding of church assets.

Based upon audits performed, the Church Auditing Department is of the opinion that, in all material respects, contributions received, expenditures made, and assets of the church for the year 2006 have been recorded and administered in accordance with appropriate accounting practices, approved budgets, and church policies and procedures.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church receives significant funds from [[tithe]]s (ten percent of a member's income) and [[fast offering]]s (money given to the church to assist individuals in need). According to the church, tithing and fast offering moneys collected are devoted to ecclesiastical purposes and not used in for-profit ventures.

The church has also invested in for-profit business and real estate ventures such as [[Bonneville International]], [[Deseret Book Company]], and cattle ranches in Utah, [[Florida]], and Canada. However, these ranches are split between Church Welfare Work (Bishops' Storehouse and Welfare Square) for which funds are used from tithing and are not for profit.
On June 9, 2010, California Progress Report and CBS-News, reported The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be the first religious organization to be fined for political malfeasance in California. On June 10, 2010, the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) of California fined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for failing to “timely report making non-monetary contributions totaling $36,928 in connection with the November 4, 2008 General Election”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fppc.ca.gov/agenda.php?id=442 |title=Meeting Agenda: June 10, 2010 |publisher=California Fair Political Practices Commission |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with Proposition 8. California Government Code Section 84203 requires that non-monetary contributions be reported on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fppc.ca.gov/agendas/06-10/Church.pdf |title=Fair Political Practices Commission - Late Contribution Violations Stipulation, Decision and Order |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's enforcement included levying a 15% punitive fine against the LDS Church totaling $5,539. The church reported all contributions but failed to report them on a daily basis. In a statement the church said, “In the last two weeks leading up to the election, the Church mistakenly overlooked the daily reporting requirement for non-monetary contributions and instead reported those contributions together in a later filing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/statement-regarding-fppc-settlement |title=Statement Regarding FPPC Settlement |publisher=newsroom.lds.org |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the church. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Intermountain West]], but as membership of the church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices follow, such as adhering to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code,&lt;ref&gt;(D&amp;C 89)&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Leviticus chapter 11 in the Bible, prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea, and other addictive substances.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89 ''Doctrine &amp; Covenants, Section 89''].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Word of Wisdom, the culture in areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS tends to  be reflected.&lt;ref&gt;Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, [http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 ''Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/living-well-usn/2008/12/15/americas-10-fittest-citiesand-10-least-fit-too.html |title=America's 10 Fittest Cities—and 10 Least Fit, Too |author= Megan Johnson |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of Latter-day Saint culture.

===Home and family===
In 1995, the church presidency issued &quot;[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]&quot;, which stresses the importance of the family. The presidency proclaimed that &quot;marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.&quot; The document further explains that &quot;gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose,&quot; that the father and mother have differing but equal roles in raising children, and that successful marriages and families, founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, can last eternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?sourceId=1aba862384d20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=e1fa5f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0 |title=The Family: A Proclamation to the World |publisher=LDS Church |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This document is widely cited by LDS members as a statement of principle.&lt;ref&gt;Together forever: Gospel perspectives for marriage and family By Douglas E. Brinley page 48 ISBN 1-57008-540-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Four times a year, the adult women (members of the church's [[Relief Society]]) attend a Home, Family and Personal Enrichment Meeting. The meeting may consist of a service project, of attending a social event, or of various classes being offered. Additional Enrichment activities are offered for women with similar needs and interests.

After interviewing and polling thousands of youth across America, evangelical statistician Christian Smith writes, &quot;... in general comparisons among major U.S. religious traditions using a variety of sociological measures of religious vitality and salience... it is Mormon teenagers who are sociologically faring the best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers'', Authors: Christian Smith, Melinda Lundquist Denton, page 261 (Oxford Univ Pr. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social events and gatherings===

[[Image:Mormon Tabernacle Choir.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] has received a [[Grammy Award]], an [[Emmy Award]], two [[Peabody Award]]s, and the [[National Medal of Arts]].]]
In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. The church's [[Young Men]]'s and [[Young Women]]'s organizations (formerly known as the [[Mutual Improvement Association]] - MIA, or simply &quot;Mutual&quot;) meet at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities and work on [[Duty to God Award|Duty to God]], Scouting, or [[Personal Progress]]. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances, and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve the building at no cost for weddings, receptions, and funerals.

===Media and arts===
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. Such communities include [[LDS cinema|cinema]], [[LDS fiction|fiction]], websites, and graphical art like photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called [[Deseret Book]], which provide a channel through which publications are sold. Titles including ''[[The Work and the Glory]]'' and ''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' have found acceptance both within and outside the church; [[BYU TV]], the church-sponsored television station, also airs on several networks. The church also produces [[List of pageants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|six pageants]] annually depicting various events of the primitive and modern-day church. Its [[Mesa Arizona Easter Pageant|Easter pageant ''Jesus the Christ'']] has been identified as the &quot;largest annual outdoor Easter pageant in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EVT&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 | title = Mesa Mormon temple prepares for Easter pageant | publisher = ''[[East Valley Tribune]]'' |date=2007-03-24 |first=Lawn |last=Griffiths | accessdate = 2008-11-30 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian services==

{{See also|LDS Philanthropies|LDS Humanitarian Services}}
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is widely known for its worldwide [[humanitarianism|humanitarian services]]. The church's extensive welfare system, [[LDS Philanthropies]], is a branch of the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishop]]ric. Initiated during the [[Great Depression]], it provides aid for the poor, financed by monthly donations in the form of tithes from church members. It is responsible for philanthropic donations to the LDS Church and other affiliated charities, such as the [[Church History Library]], [[Brigham Young University]] and the [[Church Educational System]], the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]], the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]], and efforts dedicated to providing funds for [[missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]] and [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/ |title=LDS Philanthropies: Helping Change and Save Lives |publisher=[[LDS Philanthropies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money from the program is also used to operate [[bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food for the poor at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]]. These local storehouses distribute commodities to the needy as requested by local bishops on a &quot;Bishop's Order for Commodities&quot; form (referred to as a bishop's order). Bishop's storehouses also provide service opportunities for those receiving assistance and for those desiring to serve missions or to volunteer in the church's welfare program. The day-to-day operations of the storehouses are run by elder missionaries as store managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.lds.org/welfareoperations/overview.jsf?operation=bishops.storehouses |title=Overview of Bishops’ Storehouses |publisher=LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Humanitarian Services|Humanitarian Services]] division to natural disaster victims worldwide. The church's Humanitarian Center, established in 1991, prepares emergency relief supplies for shipment worldwide to disaster victims, and offers service opportunities to church members. The emergency relief supplies that the church donates typically include clothing, personal care kits, and medical supplies. According to the LDS Humanitarian Center website, it ships about 12 million pounds of shoes and clothing, 1 million hygiene kits, and 1 million pounds of medical supplies per year, to relieve suffering in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/service/humanitarian/center?lang=eng |title=Humanitarian Center |publisher=LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church has been involved in providing relief aid for victims of disasters such as [[Hurricane Katrina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]|title=Church Providing Relief to Hurricane Katrina Victims|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/church-providing-relief-to-hurricane-katrina-victims|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latter-day Saints to Mobilize Another 4,000 Volunteers in Chainsaw Brigade’s Second Wave|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/latter-day-saints-to-mobilize-another-4-000-volunteers-in-chainsaw-brigade-s-second-wave|date=2005-09-16|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mormon Helping Hands Make a Difference|publisher=[[Meridian Magazine]]|url=http://www.meridianmagazine.com/articles/051020helpinghands.html|year=2005|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/haiti-relief/relief/landing.htm |title=Haiti Efforts: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti |publisher=LDS Church |date=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/church-update-on-response-to-japan-earthquake-and-tsunami |title=Church Update on Response to Japan Earthquake and Tsunami |publisher=LDS Newsroom |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The church has been subject to criticism and sometimes [[Anti-Mormonism|discrimination]] since its early years in New York and [[Pennsylvania]]. In the late 1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith, Jr. to have been led to a set of golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.

In the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio, and the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]]. In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on the church's [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois, and the practice of plural marriage, criticism which appeared in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' and led to a series of events culminating in Smith's murder in 1844.
[[Image:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]

As the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under Brigham Young during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nation-wide criticism for that practice (which was banned by the church in 1890), as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.

Academic critics have [[Criticism of Joseph Smith, Jr.|questioned the legitimacy of Smith]] as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and [[Fawn Brodie]].

In recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of Mormonism,&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chemical thermodynamics''' is the study of the interrelation of [[heat]] and [[thermodynamic work|work]] with [[chemical reactions]] or with physical changes of [[thermodynamic state|state]] within the confines of the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. Chemical thermodynamics involves not only laboratory measurements of various thermodynamic properties, but also the application of mathematical methods to the study of chemical questions and the ''spontaneity'' of processes.    

The structure of chemical thermodynamics is based on the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]].  Starting from the first and second laws of thermodynamics, four equations called the &quot;fundamental equations of Gibbs&quot; can be derived.  From these four, a multitude of equations, relating the thermodynamic properties of the [[thermodynamic system]] can be derived using relatively simple mathematics.  This outlines the mathematical framework of chemical thermodynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Book1&quot; &gt;{{cite book | last = Ott | first = Bevan J.  | coauthors = Boerio-Goates, Juliana | title = Chemical Thermodynamics – Principles and Applications | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-12-530990-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, the German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]], in his ''Mechanical Theory of Heat'', suggested that the principles of [[thermochemistry]], e.g. such as the [[heat]] evolved in [[combustion reactions]], could be applied to the principles of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Clausius, R. (1865). ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat – with its Applications to the Steam Engine and to Physical Properties of Bodies.'' London: John van Voorst, 1 Paternoster Row. MDCCCLXVII.&lt;/ref&gt;  Building on the work of Clausius, between the years 1873-76 the American mathematical physicist [[Willard Gibbs]] published a series of three papers, the most famous one being the paper ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]''.  In these papers, Gibbs showed how the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]] could be measured graphically and mathematically to determine both the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] of chemical reactions as well as their tendencies to occur or proceed.  Gibbs’ collection of papers provided the first unified body of thermodynamic theorems from the principles developed by others, such as Clausius and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]].

During the early 20th century, two major publications successfully applied the principles developed by Gibbs to chemical processes, and thus established the foundation of the science of chemical thermodynamics.  The first was the 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]].  This book was responsible for supplanting the [[chemical affinity]] for the term [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in the English-speaking world.  The second was the 1933 book ''Modern Thermodynamics by the methods of Willard Gibbs'' written by [[E. A. Guggenheim]].  In this manner, Lewis, Randall, and Guggenheim are considered as the founders of modern chemical thermodynamics because of the major contribution of these two books in unifying the application of [[thermodynamics]] to [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Book1&quot; /&gt;

== Overview ==
The primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is the establishment of a criterion for the determination of the feasibility or [[spontaneity]] of a given transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, I. (1950). ''Chemical Thermodynamics.'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, chemical thermodynamics is typically used to predict the [[energy]] exchanges that occur in the following processes:
#[[Chemical reactions]]
#[[Phase changes]]
#The formation of solutions

The following [[state function]]s are of primary concern in chemical thermodynamics:

*[[Internal energy]] (''U'')
*[[Enthalpy]] (''H'').
*[[Entropy]] (''S'')
*[[Gibbs free energy]] (''G'')

Most identities in chemical thermodynamics arise from application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, particularly the [[Conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], to these state functions.

'''The 3 laws of thermodynamics''':
#The energy of the universe is constant.
#In any spontaneous process, there is always an increase in entropy of the universe
#The entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 kelvins is zero

==Chemical energy==
{{Main|Chemical energy}}
'''Chemical energy''' is the potential of a [[chemical substance]] to undergo a transformation through a [[chemical reaction]] or to transform other chemical substances. Breaking or making of chemical bonds involves [[energy]], which may be either absorbed or evolved from a chemical system. 

Energy that can be released (or absorbed) because of a reaction between a set of chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants. This change in energy is called the change in [[internal energy]] of a chemical reaction. Where &lt;math&gt;\Delta {U_f^\circ}_{\mathrm {reactants}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[internal energy]] of formation of the reactant molecules that can be calculated from the [[bond energy|bond energies]] of the various chemical bonds of the molecules under consideration and &lt;math&gt;\Delta {U_f^\circ}_{\mathrm {products}}&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy of formation of the product molecules. The internal energy change of a process is equal to the heat change if it is measured under conditions of constant volume, as in a closed rigid container such as a [[Calorimeter|bomb calorimeter]]. However, under conditions of constant pressure, as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change, because pressure-volume work also releases or absorbs energy. (The heat change at constant pressure is called the [[enthalpy]] change; in this case the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]]). 

Another useful term is the [[heat of combustion]], which is the energy released due to a [[combustion]] reaction and often applied in the study of [[fuels]]. Food is similar to hydrocarbon fuel and carbohydrate fuels, and when it is oxidized, its caloric content is similar (though not assessed in the same way as a hydrocarbon fuel — see [[food energy]]).  

In chemical thermodynamics the term used for the chemical potential energy is [[chemical potential]], and for chemical transformation an equation most often used is the [[Gibbs-Duhem equation]].

==Chemical reactions==
{{Main|Chemical reaction}}
In most cases of interest in chemical thermodynamics there are internal [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and processes, such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[phase transition]]s, which always create [[entropy]] unless they are at equilibrium, or are maintained at a &quot;running equilibrium&quot; through &quot;quasi-static&quot; changes by being coupled to constraining devices, such as [[piston]]s or [[electrode]]s, to deliver and receive external work. Even for homogeneous &quot;bulk&quot; materials, the free energy functions depend on the [[chemical compound|composition]], as do all the [[extensive quantity|extensive]] [[thermodynamic potentials]], including the internal energy. If the quantities {&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, the number of [[chemical species]], are omitted from the formulae, it is impossible to describe compositional changes.

===Gibbs function===
For a &quot;bulk&quot; (unstructured) system they are the last remaining extensive variables. For an unstructured, homogeneous &quot;bulk&quot; system, there are still various ''extensive'' compositional variables {&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} that ''G'' depends on, which specify the composition, the amounts of each chemical [[Chemical substance|substance]], expressed as the numbers of molecules present or (dividing by [[Avogadro's number]]), the numbers of [[mole (unit)|moles]]

:&lt;math&gt; G = G(T,P,\{N_i\})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For the case where only ''PV'' work is possible

:&lt;math&gt; dG = -SdT + VdP + \sum_i \mu_i dN_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

in which μ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] for the ''i''-th [[component (thermodynamics)|component]] in the system

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_i  = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial N_i}\right)_{T,P,N_{j\ne i},etc. } \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for d''G'' is especially useful at constant ''T'' and ''P'', conditions which are easy to achieve experimentally and which approximates the condition in [[life|living]] creatures

:&lt;math&gt; (dG)_{T,P} = \sum_i \mu_i dN_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Chemical affinity===
{{main|Chemical affinity}}
While this formulation is mathematically defensible, it is not particularly transparent since one does not simply add or remove molecules from a system. There is always a ''process'' involved in changing the composition; e.g., a chemical reaction (or many), or movement of molecules from one phase (liquid) to another (gas or solid). We should find a notation which does not seem to imply that the amounts of the components (&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} can be changed independently. All real processes obey [[conservation of mass]], and in addition, conservation of the numbers of [[atom]]s of each kind. Whatever molecules are transferred to or from should be considered part of the &quot;system&quot;.

Consequently we introduce an explicit variable to represent the degree of advancement of a process, a progress [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]&amp;nbsp;ξ for the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' (Prigogine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;18; Prigogine, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–7; Guggenheim, p.&amp;nbsp;37.62), and to the use of the [[partial derivative]] ∂''G''/∂ξ (in place of the widely used &quot;Δ''G''&quot;, since the quantity at issue is not a finite change). The result is an understandable [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] for the dependence of d''G'' on [[chemical reaction]]s (or other processes). If there is just one reaction

:&lt;math&gt;(dG)_{T,P} = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi}\right)_{T,P} d\xi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If we introduce the ''[[stoichiometric coefficient]]'' for the ''i-th'' component in the reaction

::&lt;math&gt;\nu_i = \partial N_i / \partial \xi \,&lt;/math&gt;

which tells how many molecules of ''i'' are produced or consumed, we obtain an algebraic expression for the partial derivative

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi} \right)_{T,P} = \sum_i \mu_i \nu_i = -\mathbb{A}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where, (De Donder; Progoine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;69; Guggenheim, pp.&amp;nbsp;37,240), we introduce a concise and historical name for this quantity, the &quot;[[chemical affinity|affinity]]&quot;, symbolized by '''A''', as introduced by [[Théophile de Donder]] in 1923. The minus sign comes from the fact the affinity was defined to represent the rule that spontaneous changes will ensue only when the change in the Gibbs free energy of the process is negative, meaning that the chemical species have a positive affinity for each other. The differential for ''G'' takes on a simple form which displays its dependence on compositional change

:&lt;math&gt;(dG)_{T,P} = -\mathbb{A}\, d\xi  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If there are a number of chemical reactions going on simultaneously, as is usually the case

:&lt;math&gt;(dG)_{T,P} = -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, d\xi_k  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

a set of reaction coordinates {&amp;nbsp;ξ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, avoiding the notion that the amounts of the components (&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} can be changed independently. The expressions above are equal to zero at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], while in the general case for real systems, they are negative because all chemical reactions proceeding at a finite rate produce entropy. This can be made even more explicit by introducing the reaction ''rates'' dξ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t''. For each and every &lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;''physically independent''&lt;/font&gt; ''process'' (Prigogine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;38; Prigogine, p.&amp;nbsp;24)

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{A}\ \dot{\xi} \le 0  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a remarkable result since the chemical potentials are intensive system variables, depending only on the local molecular milieu. They cannot &quot;know&quot; whether the temperature and pressure (or any other system variables) are going to be held constant over time. It is a purely local criterion and must hold regardless of any such constraints. Of course, it could have been obtained by taking partial derivatives of any of the other fundamental state functions, but nonetheless is a general criterion for (&amp;minus;''T'' times) the entropy production from that spontaneous process; or at least any part of it that is not captured as external work. (See ''Constraints'' below.)

We now relax the requirement of a homogeneous “bulk” system by letting the [[chemical potential]]s and the affinity apply to any locality in which a chemical reaction (or any other process) is occurring. By accounting for the [[entropy production]] due to irreversible processes, the inequality for d''G'' is now replace by an equality

:&lt;math&gt; dG = - SdT + VdP -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, d\xi_k  + W'\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; dG_{T,P} = -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, d\xi_k  + W'.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Any decrease in the [[Gibbs function]] of a system is the upper limit for any [[isothermal process|isothermal]], [[isobaric process|isobaric]] work that can be captured in the [[surroundings]], or it may simply be [[dissipation|dissipated]], appearing as ''T'' times a corresponding increase in the entropy of the system and/or its surrounding. Or it may go partly toward doing external work and partly toward creating entropy. The important point is that the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' for a chemical reaction may be coupled to the displacement of some external mechanical or electrical quantity in such a way that one can advance only if the other one also does. The coupling may occasionally be ''rigid'', but it is often flexible and variable.

===Solutions===
In solution [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], the [[Gibbs free energy]] decrease (∂''G''/∂ξ, in molar units, denoted cryptically by Δ''G'') is commonly used as a surrogate for (&amp;minus;''T'' times) the entropy produced by spontaneous [[chemical reaction]]s in situations where there is no work being done; or at least no &quot;useful&quot; work; i.e., other than perhaps some ±&amp;nbsp;''P''d''V''. The assertion that all ''spontaneous reactions have a negative ΔG'' is merely a restatement of the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]], giving it the [[dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]] of energy and somewhat obscuring its significance in terms of entropy. When there is no useful work being done, it would be less misleading to use the [[Legendre transform]]s of the entropy appropriate for constant ''T'', or for constant ''T'' and ''P'', the Massieu functions  &amp;minus;''F''/''T'' and &amp;minus;''G''/''T'' respectively.

==Non equilibrium==
{{Main|non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

Generally the systems treated with the conventional chemical thermodynamics are either at equilibrium or near equilibrium. [[Ilya Prigogine]] developed the thermodynamic treatment of [[open systems]] that are far from equilibrium. In doing so he has discovered phenomena and structures of completely new and completely unexpected types. His generalized, nonlinear and irreversible thermodynamics has found surprising applications in a wide variety of fields.

The non equilibrium thermodynamics has been applied for explaining how ordered structures e.g. the biological systems, can develop from disorder. Even if Onsager's relations are utilized, the classical principles of equilibrium in thermodynamics still show that linear systems close to equilibrium always develop into states of disorder which are stable to perturbations and cannot explain the occurrence of ordered structures.

Prigogine called these systems [[dissipative systems]], because they are formed and maintained by the dissipative processes which take place because of the exchange of energy between the system and its environment and because they disappear if that exchange ceases. They may be said to live in [[symbiosis]] with their environment.

The method which Prigogine used to study the stability of the dissipative structures to perturbations is of very great general interest. It makes it possible to study the most varied problems, such as city traffic problems, the stability of insect communities, the development of ordered biological structures and the growth of cancer cells to mention but a few examples.

===System constraints===

In this regard, it is crucial to understand the role of walls and other ''constraints'', and the distinction between ''independent'' processes and ''coupling''. Contrary to the clear implications of many reference sources, the previous analysis is not restricted to [[wiktionary:Homogenous|homogenous]], [[isotropy|isotropic]] bulk systems which can deliver only ''P''d''V'' work to the outside world, but applies even to the most structured systems. There are complex systems with many chemical &quot;reactions&quot; going on at the same time, some of which are really only parts of the same, overall process. An ''independent'' process is one that ''could'' proceed even if all others were unaccountably stopped in their tracks. Understanding this is perhaps a “[[thought experiment]]” in [[chemical kinetics]], but actual examples exist.

A gas reaction which results in an increase in the number of molecules will lead to an increase in volume at constant external pressure. If it occurs inside a cylinder closed with a piston, the equilibrated reaction can proceed only by doing work against an external force on the piston. The extent variable for the reaction can increase only if the piston moves, and conversely, if the piston is pushed inward, the reaction is driven backwards.

Similarly, a [[redox]] reaction might occur in an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] cell with the passage of [[electrical current|current]] in [[wire]]s connecting the [[electrodes]]. The half-cell reactions at the [[electrodes]] are constrained if no current is allowed to flow. The current might be dissipated as [[joule heating]], or it might in turn run an electrical device like a [[electric motor|motor]] doing [[mechanical work]]. An [[automobile]] [[lead]]-[[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]] can be recharged, driving the chemical reaction backwards. In this case as well, the reaction is not an independent process. Some, perhaps most, of the Gibbs free energy of reaction may be delivered as external work.

The [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[phosphate]] can drive the [[force]] times [[distance]] work delivered by living [[muscle]]s, and synthesis of ATP is in turn driven by a redox chain in [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, which involves the transport of [[ion]]s across the membranes of these [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular [[organelle]]s. The coupling of processes here, and in the previous examples, is often not complete. Gas can leak slowly past a piston, just as it can slowly leak out of a [[rubber]] [[balloon]]. Some reaction may occur in a battery even if no external current is flowing. There is usually a coupling [[coefficient]], which may depend on relative rates, which determines what percentage of the driving free energy is turned into external work, or captured as &quot;chemical work&quot;; a misnomer for the free energy of another chemical process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Quadruple Combination format of the ''Standard Works'']]

The '''Standard Works''' of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) consists of several books that constitute its [[continuous revelation|open]] [[sacred text|scriptural]] [[biblical canon|canon]], and include the following:
* The [[King James Version of the Bible|Holy Bible (King James version)]]&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church uses the [[King James Version]] (KJV) in English-speaking countries; other versions are used in non-English speaking countries.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ]]
* The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
* The [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]

The Standard Works are printed and distributed by the LDS church in a single binding called a '''Quadruple Combination''' or a set of two books, with [[LDS edition of the Bible|the Bible in one binding]], and the other three books in a second binding called a '''Triple Combination'''. Current editions of the standard works include a [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|bible dictionary]], photographs, maps and [[gazetteer]], topical guide, index, footnotes, cross references, excerpts from the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (JST) and other study aids.

==Continuing revelation==
Under the Church's doctrine of [[continuous revelation|continuing revelation]] (see the [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1/9#9 Ninth] [[Articles of Faith (Mormonism)|Article of Faith]]), [[Latter-day Saints]] believe literally in the principle of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] from God to his children.  Individual members are entitled to divine revelation for confirmation of truths, gaining knowledge or wisdom, meeting personal challenges, etc. Parents are entitled to revelation for raising their families.  

Divine revelation for the direction of the entire Church comes from God to the [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]], who is viewed by [[Latter-day Saints]] as a [[prophet]] in the same sense as [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and other biblical leaders.  When prophets and [[General authority|General Authorities]] of the Church speak as &quot;moved upon by the Holy Ghost&quot;, ''...shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.''(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 68:4).  Members are encouraged to ponder these revelations and pray to determine for themselves the truthfulness of doctrine.

===Adding to the canon of scripture===
The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that &quot;all things must be done in order, and by [[common consent]] in the church.&quot;({{lds|D&amp;C|dc|28|13}}).  This applies to adding new scripture.  [[President of the Church]] [[Harold B. Lee]] taught &quot;The only one authorized to bring forth any new doctrine is the President of the Church, who, when he does, will declare it as revelation from God, and it will be so accepted by the Council of the Twelve and sustained by the body of the Church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harold B. Lee, The First Area General Conference for Germany, Austria, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and Spain of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held in Munich Germany, August 24–26, 1973, with Reports and Discourses, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are six recorded instances of this happening in the LDS church:
*April 6, 1830 - When the church was organized, the Bible and Book of Mormon were unanimously accepted as scripture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
*August 17, 1835 - Select revelations from Joseph Smith were unanimously accepted as scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith, B.F. Roberts (ed.) (1902). ''[[History of the Church]]'', '''2''':243–246.&lt;/ref&gt;  These were later printed in the Doctrine and Covenants.
*October 10, 1880 - The Pearl of Great Price was unanimously accepted as scripture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/pgp/introduction Introductory Note&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also at that time, other revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants which had not been accepted as scripture because they were received after 1835 were unanimously accepted as scripture.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I hold in my hand the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and also the book, The Pearl of Great Price, which books contain revelations of God. In Kirtland, the Doctrine and Covenants in its original form, as first printed, was submitted to the officers of the Church and the members of the Church to vote upon. As there have been additions made to it by the publishing of revelations which were not contained in the original edition, it has been deemed wise to submit these books with their contents to the conference, to see whether the conference will vote to accept the books and their contents as from God, and binding upon us as a people and as a Church&quot; [[George Q. Cannon]], &quot;Comments,&quot; ''[[Millennial Star]]'' 42/46 (15 November 1880): 724. (10 October 1880, General Conference)&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 6, 1890 - [[Official Declaration—1]] was accepted unanimously as scripture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/1 Official Declaration 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*April 3, 1976 - Two visions were accepted as scripture and initially added to The Pearl of Great Price, and later moved to the Doctrine and Covenants as sections 137 and 138.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When a doctrine undergoes this procedure, the LDS Church treats it as the word of God, and it is used as a standard to compare other doctrines. Lee taught &quot;It is not to be thought that every word spoken by the General Authorities is inspired, or that they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost in everything they speak and write. Now you keep that in mind. I don't care what his position is, if he writes something or speaks something that goes beyond anything that you can find in the standard works, unless that one be the prophet, seer, and revelator—please note that one exception—you may immediately say, &quot;Well, that is his own idea!&quot; And if he says something that contradicts what is found in the standard works (I think that is why we call them &quot;standard&quot;—it is the standard measure of all that men teach), you may know by that same token that it is false; regardless of the position of the man who says it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harold B. Lee, &quot;The Place of the Living Prophet, Seer, and Revelator,&quot; Address to Seminary and Institute of Religion Faculty, [[Brigham Young University]], 8 July 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

{{seealso|The Bible|LDS edition of the Bible}}
[[English language|English]]-speaking [[Latter-day Saint]]s typically own and study the [[LDS edition of the Bible|LDS Church-published edition]] of the [[King James Version of the Bible]], which includes LDS-oriented chapter headings, footnotes referencing books in the Standard Works, and select passages from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/basic/bible/lds_publication_eom.htm LDS Publication of the Bible&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though the King James Version (KJV) was always commonly used, it was officially adopted in the 1950s when [[J.

A Spanish version, with a similar format and using a slightly revised version of the 1909 [[Reina-Valera]] translation, was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/santabiblia/index_sp.html Santa Biblia: Reina-Valera 2009]&quot; (Holy Bible: Reina-Valera 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Latter-day Saints in other non-English speaking areas may use other versions of the Bible.  

Though the Bible is part of the LDS canon and members believe it to be the word of God, they believe that omissions and mistranslations are present in even the earliest known manuscripts. They claim that the errors in the Bible have led to incorrect interpretations of certain passages. Thus, as church founder Joseph Smith, Jr. explained, the church believes the Bible to be the word of God &quot;as far as it is translated correctly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith, Jr., [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1/8#8 ''Articles of Faith'' No. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; The church teaches that &quot;[t]he most reliable way to measure the accuracy of any biblical passage is not by comparing different texts, but by comparison with the Book of Mormon and modern-day revelations&quot;.&lt;ref name = ensignkjv/&gt;

===The Apocrypha===
Although the [[Apocrypha]] was part of the 1611 edition of the KJV, the Church does not currently use the Apocrypha as part of its canon.  Joseph Smith Jr. taught that while the contemporary edition of the Apocrypha was not to be relied on for doctrine, it was potentially useful when read with a spirit of discernment.&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine and Covenants: {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible===
{{Main|Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible}}
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]] translated selected verses of the Bible, working by subject. Smith did not complete the entire text of the Bible during his lifetime. However, his incomplete work is known as the '''Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible''', or the ''Inspired Version''. Although this selected translation is not generally quoted by members of the Church, the English Bible issued by the Church and commonly used by [[Latter-day Saints]] contains cross references to the Joseph Smith Translation (JST), as well as an appendix containing major excerpts from it. However, with the exceptions of Smith's translation of portions of the book of [[Book of Genesis]] (renamed the [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/contents Selections from the Book of Moses]) and the translation of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_m/1 23:39-24:51], no portions of the Joseph Smith Translation have been officially canonized by the LDS Church.

==The Book of Mormon==
[[File:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover page of The Book of Mormon from an original 1830 edition, by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]&lt;br /&gt;(Image from the U.S. Library of Congress ''Rare Book and Special Collections Division''.)]]
{{mainarticle|Book of Mormon}}
Latter-day Saints consider The Book of Mormon as a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It contains a record of God’s dealings with the prophets and ancient inhabitants of the [[Americas]]. The introduction to the book asserts that it ''.... contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting [[gospel]]. The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon.''

Segments of the Book of Mormon provide an account of the culture, religious teachings and civilizations of groups who immigrated to the New World. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, identified in the book as the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s. Some years after their arrival, the Nephites met with a similar group, the [[Mulekites]] who left the Middle East during the same period. An older group arrived in America much earlier, when the Lord confounded the tongues at the [[Tower of Babel]]. This group is known as the [[Jaredite]]s and their story is condensed in the [[Book of Ether]]. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of Jesus Christ among Nephites soon after his [[resurrection]]. This account presents the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and offers men peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.  The latter segments of the Book of Mormon details the destruction of these civilizations, as all were destroyed except the Lamanites. The book asserts that the Lamanites are among the ancestors of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

According to his record, Joseph Smith, Jr. translated the Book of Mormon by gift and power of God through the [[Urim and Thummim]]. Eleven witnesses signed testimonies of its authenticity, which are now included in the preface to the Book of Mormon. [[Three Witnesses|Three witnesses]] testified to having seen an [[angel]] present the gold plates, and to having heard God bear witness to its truth. [[Eight Witnesses|Eight]] others stated that Joseph Smith, Jr. showed them the plates and that they handled and examined them.

==The Doctrine and Covenants==
[[Doctrine and Covenants|The Doctrine and Covenants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is a collection of revelations, policies, letters, and statements given to the modern Church by past [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|Presidents of the Church]].  This record contains points of Church doctrine and direction on Church government. The book has existed in numerous forms, with varying content, throughout the history of the Church and has also been published in differing formats by the various [[Latter Day Saint]] denominations. When the Church chooses to canonize new material, it is typically added to the Doctrine and Covenants; the most recent changes were made in 1981.

==The Pearl of Great Price==
[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|The Pearl of Great Price]] is a selection of material produced by Joseph Smith, Jr. and deals with many significant aspects of the faith and doctrine of the Church.  Many of these materials were initially published in Church periodicals in the early days of church.  

The ''Pearl of Great Price'' contains five sections:
* ''Selections from the [[Book of Moses]]'':  portions of the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' from the ''[[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]]''.
* ''The [[Book of Abraham]]'':a translation from [[papyrus|papyri]] acquired by Smith in 1835, dealing with [[Abraham]]'s journeys in [[Egypt]].  The work contains many distinctive [[Mormon]] doctrines such as [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]].
* ''[[Joseph Smith—Matthew]]'': portions of the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'' from the ''[[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]]''.
* ''[[Joseph Smith—History]]'':a first-person narrative of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith's]] life before the founding of the Church. The material is taken from ''[[Documentary History of the Church]]'' and is based on a letter written by Joseph Smith in 1838.
* ''[[Articles of Faith (Mormonism)|The Articles of Faith]]'':concise listing of thirteen fundamental doctrines of Mormonism [[Wentworth letter|composed]] by Joseph Smith in 1842.

==Church instruction==
In the Church's [[Sunday School (Mormonism)|Sunday School]] and [[Church Educational System]] classes, the Standard Works are studied and taught in a four-year rotation:

:Year One : [[Old Testament]] (also includes some coverage of related topics in the [[Book of Moses]] and [[Book of Abraham]] from the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]])
:Year Two : [[New Testament]]
:Year Three: [[Book of Mormon]]
:Year Four: [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church History]]

However, in recent times, leaders of the Church have emphasized that [[Latter-day Saints]] should not restrict their study of the Standard Works to the particular book being currently studied in Sunday School or other religious courses. Specifically, [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|Church President]] [[Ezra Taft Benson]] taught:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''At present, the Book of Mormon is studied in our Sunday School and seminary classes every fourth year. This four-year pattern, however, must ''not'' be followed by Church members in their personal and family study. We need to read daily from the pages of [that] book'' ....&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=4697d7630a27b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ &quot;Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon&quot;], ''Ensign'', Nov. 1988, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|the book series on the LDS Church's early history|History of the Church}}

The '''history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' (LDS Church) is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] which is in common with all [[Latter Day Saint movement]] churches, (2) a &quot;pioneer era&quot; under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his 19th Century successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as the practice of [[polygamy]] was discontinued.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] traces its origins to western [[New York]], where [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] was born and raised. Joseph Smith gained a small following in the late 1820s as he was dictating the [[Book of Mormon]], which he said was a translation of words found on a set of [[golden plates]] that had been buried near his home in western [[New York]] by an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] prophet. On April 6, 1830, in western [[New York]], Smith organized the religion's first legal church entity, the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. The church rapidly gained a following, who viewed Smith as their [[prophet]]. The main body of the church moved first to [[Kirtland, Ohio]] in the early 1830s, then to [[Missouri]] in 1838, where the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] with other Missouri settlers ensued, culminating in adherents being expelled from the state under [[Missouri Executive Order 44]] signed by [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]]. After Missouri, Smith built the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], near which [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith was assassinated]]. After Smith's death, a [[succession crisis]] ensued, and the majority voted to accept the [[Quorum of the Twelve]], led by [[Brigham Young]], as the church's leading body.

After continued difficulties and persecution in [[Illinois]], Young left [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] in 1846 and led his followers, the [[Mormon pioneers]], to the Great [[Salt Lake Valley]]. The group branched out in an effort to pioneer a large state to be called [[State of Deseret|Deseret]], eventually establishing colonies from Canada to present-day Mexico. Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity, and governed his followers as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader serving in both political and religious positions. He also publicized the previously-secret practice of [[plural marriage]], a form of [[polygamy]]. By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of church teachings on polygamy and theocracy. The [[Utah War|Utah Mormon War]] ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful invasion of Utah by the [[United States Army]], after which Young agreed to step down from power and be replaced by a non-Mormon territorial governor, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]]. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the [[Utah Territory]] as part of a [[shadow government]]. At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other powerful members, who continued the practice of polygamy despite opposition by the [[United States Congress]]. After tensions with the U.S. government came to a head in 1890, the church [[1890 Manifesto|officially abandoned]] the public practice of polygamy in the United States, and eventually stopped performing official polygamous marriages altogether after a [[Second Manifesto]] in 1904. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today seeks to actively distance itself from “[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]” groups still practicing polygamy.

During the 20th century, the church grew substantially and became an international organization. Distancing itself from polygamy, the church began engaging, first with mainstream American culture, and then with international cultures, particularly those of [[Latin America]], by sending out thousands of [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] across the globe. The church became a strong and public champion of [[monogamy]] and the [[nuclear family]], and at times played a prominent role in political matters. Among the official changes to the organization during the modern area include the [[Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|ordination of black men]] to the priesthood in 1978, reversing a policy originally instituted by [[Brigham Young]]. The church has also periodically changed its [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|temple ceremony]], gradually omitting certain controversial elements. There are also periodic changes in the structure and organization of the church, mainly to accommodate the organization's growth and increasing international presence.

==Early history (c. 1820s to c. 1846)==
{{Main|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}

The early history of the LDS Church is shared with other denominations of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], who all regard [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] as the founder of their religious tradition. Smith gained a small following in the late 1820s as he was dictating the [[Book of Mormon]], which he said was a translation of words found on a set of [[golden plates]] that had been buried near his home in western [[New York]] by an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] prophet. Smith said he had been in contact with an [[angel Moroni]], who showed him the plates' location and had been grooming him for a role as a religious leader.&lt;!--

On April 6, 1830, in western [[New York]],&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] was organized in the log cabin of [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] in the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] area, near [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], followed by a meeting the next Sunday in nearby [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the house of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] Nevertheless, one of Smith's histories and an 1887 reminiscence by [[David Whitmer]] say the church was organized at the Whitmer house in Fayette. (Whitmer, however, had already told a reporter in 1875 that the church was organized in Manchester. {{Citation

--&gt; Smith organized the religion's first legal church entity, the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. The church rapidly gained a following, who viewed Smith as their [[prophet]]. In late 1830, Smith envisioned a [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|&quot;city of Zion&quot;]], a Utopian city in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands near [[Independence, Missouri]]. In October 1830, he sent his [[Assistant President of the Church|Assistant President]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and others on a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|D&amp;C|dc|32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing through [[Kirtland, Ohio]], the missionaries converted a congregation of [[Disciples of Christ]] led by [[Sidney Rigdon]], and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until lands in the [[Missouri]] area could be purchased. In the meantime, the church's headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838; and there the church built [[Kirtland Temple|its first temple]] and continued to grow in membership from 680 to 17,881.&lt;ref&gt;The Desert Morning News ''2008 Church Almanac'' pg.655&lt;/ref&gt;

While the main church body was in Kirtland, many of Smith's followers had attempted to establish settlements in Missouri, but had met with resistance from other Missourians who believed Mormons were [[abolitionism|abolitionists]], or who distrusted their political ambitions. After Smith and other Mormons in Kirtland emigrated to Missouri in 1838, hostilities escalated into the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]], culminating in adherents being expelled from the state under an Extermination Order signed by [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]].

[[Image:Ovalportrait-josephsmith-Carter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] (pictured), founder of the church, and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were killed in [[Carthage, Illinois]], by a [[wikt:mob|mob]] on June 27, 1844]]

After Missouri, Smith built the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] as the new church headquarters, and served as the city's mayor and leader of the militia. As church leader, Smith also instituted the then-secret practice of [[plural marriage]], and taught a form of [[Millennialism]] which he called &quot;[[theodemocracy]]&quot;, to be led by a [[Council of Fifty]] which had secretly and symbolically anointed him as king of this Millennial theodemocracy.&lt;!--

--&gt; Partly in response to these trends, on June 7, 1844, an newspaper called the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', edited by dissident Mormon [[William Law (Latter Day Saints)|William Law]], issued a scathing criticism of polygamy and Nauvoo theocratic government, including a call for church reform based on earlier Mormon principles.&lt;!--

The paper also contained editorials and letters to the editor that were highly critical of Joseph Smith's political actions and his 1844 candidacy for [[President of the United States]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Considering the paper to be [[libel]]lous, Smith and the Nauvoo city council voted to shut down the paper as a public nuisance. Relations between Mormons and residents of surrounding communities had been strained, and some of them instituted criminal charges against Smith for [[treason]]. Smith surrendered to police in the nearby [[Carthage, Illinois]], and while in state custody, he and his brother [[Hyrum Smith]], who was second in line to the church presidency,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding [[Hyrum Smith]], [[Brigham Young]] later stated: &quot;Did Joseph Smith ordain any man to take his place. He did. Who was it? It was Hyrum, but Hyrum fell a martyr before Joseph did. If Hyrum had lived he would have acted for Joseph&quot; (''[[Times and Seasons]],'' 5 [Oct. 15, 1844]: 683).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

After Smith's death, a [[succession crisis]] ensued. In this crisis a number of church leaders campaigned to lead the church. The majority of adherents voted on August 8, 1844 to accept the argument of [[Brigham Young]], senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]], that there could be no true successor to Joseph Smith, but that the Twelve had all the required authority to lead the church, and were best suited to take on that role. Later, adherents bolstered their succession claims by referring to a March 1844 meeting in which Joseph committed the &quot;keys of the kingdom&quot; to a group of members within the [[Council of Fifty]] that included the [[Quorum of the Twelve]].&lt;!--

==Pioneer era (c. 1846 to c. 1890)==
===Migration to Utah and Colonization of the West===
[[Image:LDS1846-1869.svg|right|thumb|250px|Map showing the westward exodus of the LDS church between 1846 and 1869. Also shown are a portion of the route followed by the Mormon Battalion and the path followed by the handcart companies to the Mormon Trail.]]
{{Main|Mormon pioneers|History of Utah}}
Under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]], Church leaders planned to leave [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] in April 1846, but amid threats from the state militia, they were forced to cross the Mississippi River in the cold of February. They eventually left the boundaries of the United States to what is now [[Utah]] where they founded [[Salt Lake City]].

The groups that left Illinois for Utah became known as the [[Mormon pioneers]] and forged a path to Salt Lake City known as the [[Mormon Trail]]. The arrival of the original Mormon Pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847 is commemorated by the [[U.S. state holiday|Utah State holiday]] [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]].

[[Image:LDS expansion western north america.svg|thumb|right|250px|Locations of major LDS settlements in North America prior to 1890. Included are major cities originally founded by LDS settlers who later abandoned the area.]]

Groups of converts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere were encouraged to gather to Utah in the decades following. Both the original Mormon migration and subsequent convert migrations resulted in much sacrifice and quite a number of deaths. Brigham Young organized a great colonization of the American West, with Mormon settlements extending from Canada to Mexico. Notable cities that sprang from early Mormon settlements include [[San Bernardino, California]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and [[Mesa, Arizona]].

===Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership===
{{see also|Council of Fifty|Theodemocracy}}

Following the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young stated that the Church should be led by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (see [[Succession crisis (Mormonism)#Conference of August 8, 1844|Succession Crisis]]). Later, after the migration to Utah had begun, Brigham Young was sustained as a member of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] on December 25, 1847, (Wilford Woodruff Diary, Church Archives), and then as [[President of the Church (Mormonism)|President of the Church]] on October 8, 1848. (Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, 3:318).

One of the reasons the Saints had chosen the Great Basin as a settling place was that the area was at the time outside the territorial borders of the [[United States]], which Young had blamed for failing to protect Mormons from political opposition from the states of [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]]. However, in the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]] [[Mexican Cession|ceded]] the area to the United States. As a result, Brigham Young sent emissaries to [[Washington, D.C.]] with a proposal to create a vast [[State of Deseret]], of which Young would naturally be the first governor. Instead, Congress created the much smaller [[Utah Territory]] in 1850, and Young was appointed governor in 1851. Because of his religious position, Young exercised much more practical control over the affairs of Mormon and non-Mormon settlers than a typical territorial governor of the time.

For most of the 19th century, the LDS Church maintained an ecclesiastical court system parallel to federal courts, and required Mormons to use the system exclusively for civil matters, or face church discipline. {{Harv|Mangrum|1983|pp=80–81}}

===The Mormon Reformation===
In 1856-1858, the Church underwent what is commonly called the [[Mormon Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Paul H. &quot;The Mormon Reformation of 1856-1857: The Rhetoric and the Reality.&quot; 15 ''Journal of Mormon History'' 59-87 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, a drought struck the flourishing territory. Very little rain fell, and even the dependable mountain streams ran very low. An infestation of grasshoppers and crickets destroyed whatever crops the Mormons had managed to salvage. During the winter of 1855-56, flour and other basic necessities were very scarce and very costly. [[Heber C. Kimball]] wrote his son, ''Dollars and cents do not count now, in these times, for they are the tightest that I have ever seen in the territory of Utah.''

In September 1856, as the drought continued, the trials and difficulties of the previous year led to an explosion of intense soul searching. [[Jedediah M. Grant]], a counselor in the First Presidency and a well-known conservative voice in the extended community, preached three days of fiery sermons to the people of [[Kaysville, Utah]] territory. He called for repentance and a general recommitment to moral living and religious teachings. 500 people presented themselves for &quot;rebaptism&quot; &amp;mdash; a symbol of their determination to reform their lives. The zealous message spread from Kaysville to surrounding Mormon communities. Church leaders traveled around the territory, expressing their concern about signs of spiritual decay and calling for repentance. Members were asked to seal their rededication with rebaptism.

Several sermons [[Willard Richards]] and [[George A. Smith]] had given earlier in the history of the church had touched on the concept of [[blood atonement]], suggesting that [[apostate]]s could become so enveloped in sin that the voluntary shedding of their own blood might increase their chances of eternal salvation. On 21 September 1856, while calling for sincere repentance, Brigham Young took the idea further, and stated:

:&quot;''I know that there are transgressors, who, if they knew themselves and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke might ascend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course.''&quot; Journal of Discourses 4:43.

Although this belief was never widely accepted by church members, it became part of the public image of the church at the time and was pilloried in Eastern newspapers along with the practice of polygamy. The concept was frequently criticized by many Mormons and eventually repudiated as official church doctrine by the LDS Church in 1978. However, modern critics of the church and popular writers often attribute a formal doctrine of blood atonement to the Church, to the confusion of some modern members.

Throughout the winter special meetings were held and Mormons urged to adhere to the commandments of God and the practices and precepts of the church. Preaching placed emphasis on the practice of [[plural marriage]], adherence to the [[Word of Wisdom]], attendance at church meetings, and personal prayer. On December 30, 1856, the entire all-Mormon territorial legislature was rebaptized for the remission of their sins, and confirmed under the hands of the Twelve Apostles. As time went on, however, the sermons became excessive and intolerant, and some verged on the hysterical.

===Utah War and Mountain Meadows massacre===
In 1857-1858, the church was involved in an armed, but bloodless conflict with the U.S. government, entitled the [[Utah War]]. The settlers and the [[United States]] government battled for [[hegemony]] over the culture and government of the territory. Tensions over the Utah War (and possibly other factors) resulted in settlers and (reportedly) Indians in southern Utah massacring a wagon train from Arkansas, known as [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]. The result of the Utah War was the succeeding of the governorship of the Utah territory from Brigham Young to [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]], an outsider appointed by President [[James Buchanan]].

===Brigham Young's later years===
The church had attempted unsuccessfully to institute the [[United Order]] numerous times, most recently during the [[Mormon Reformation]]. In 1874, Young once again attempted to establish a permanent Order, which he now called the '''United Order of Enoch''' in at least 200 Mormon communities, beginning in [[St. George, Utah]] on February 9, 1874.
In Young's Order, producers would generally deed their property to the Order, and all members of the order would share the cooperative's net income, often divided into shares according to how much property was originally contributed. Sometimes, the members of the Order would receive wages for their work on the communal property. Like the United Order established by Joseph Smith, Young's Order was short-lived. By the time of Brigham Young's death in 1877, most of these United Orders had failed. By the end of the 19th century, the Orders were essentially extinct.

Brigham Young died in August 1877. After the death of Brigham Young, the First Presidency was not reorganized until 1880, when Young was succeeded by President [[John Taylor (1808-1887)|John Taylor]], who in the interim had served as [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].

===Polygamy and the United States &quot;Mormon question&quot;===
{{Main|Plural marriage}}

For several decades, polygamy was preached as [[God]]'s law. [[Brigham Young]], the Prophet of the church at that time, had quite a few wives, as did many other church leaders. This early practice of [[polygamy]] caused conflict between church members and the wider American society. In 1854 the Republican party referred in its platform to polygamy and [[slavery]] as the &quot;twin relics of barbarism.&quot; In 1862, the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] enacted the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], signed by [[Abraham Lincoln]], which made bigamy a felony in the territories punishable by $500 or five years in prison. The law also permitted the confiscation of church property&lt;ref name=supct&gt;Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. United States, 136 U.S. 1 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt; without compensation. This law was not enforced however, by the Lincoln administration or by Mormon-controlled territorial probate courts. Moreover, as Mormon polygamist marriages were performed in secret, it was difficult to prove when a polygamist marriage had taken place. In the meantime, Congress was preoccupied with the [[American Civil War]].

In 1874, after the war, Congress passed the [[Poland Act]], which transferred jurisdiction over Morrill Act cases to federal prosecutors and courts, which were not controlled by Mormons. In addition, the Morrill Act was upheld in 1878 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]''. After ''Reynolds'', Congress became even more aggressive against polygamy, and passed the [[Edmunds Act]] in 1882. The Edmunds Act prohibited not just bigamy, which remained a felony, but also bigamous cohabitation, which was prosecuted as a misdemeanor, and did not require proof an actual marriage ceremony had taken place. The Act also vacated the [[Utah Territory|Utah territorial]] government, created an independent committee to oversee elections to prevent Mormon influence, and disenfranchised any former or present polygamist. Further, the law allowed the government to deny civil rights to polygamists without a trial.

In 1887, Congress passed the [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]], which allowed prosecutors to force plural wives to testify against their husbands, abolished the right of women to vote, disincorporated the church, and confiscated the church's property.&lt;ref name=supct/&gt; By this time, many church leaders had gone into hiding to avoid prosecution, and half the Utah prison population was composed of polygamists.

Church leadership officially ended the practice in 1890, based on a revelation to [[Wilford Woodruff]] called the [[1890 Manifesto]].

==The modern era (after c. 1890)==
The church's modern era began soon after it renounced polygamy in 1890. Prior to the [[1890 Manifesto]], church leaders had been in hiding, many ecclesiastical matters had been neglected,&lt;!--

--&gt; In addition, most Mormon polygamists and every polygamous general authority continued to co-habit with their polygamous wives.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn at 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon leaders, including Woodruff, maintained that the Manifesto was a temporary expediency designed to enable [[Utah]] to obtain statehood, and that at some future date, the practice would soon resume.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, 1998, p. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[1890 Manifesto]] provided the church breathing room to obtain [[Utah]]'s statehood, which it received in 1896 after a campaign to convince the American public that Mormon leaders had abandoned polygamy and intended to stay out of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, 1998, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being admitted to the United States, Utah was initially unsuccessful in having its elected representatives and senators seated in the [[United States Congress]]. In 1898, [[Utah]] elected [[general authority]] [[B.H. Roberts]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a Democrat. Roberts, however, was denied a seat there because he was practicing polygamy. In 1903, the Utah legislature selected [[Reed Smoot (U. S. Senator)|Reed Smoot]], also an LDS general authority but also a monogamist, as its first senator. From 1904-07, the [[United States Senate]] conducted a [[Reed Smoot hearings|series of Congressional hearings]] on whether Smoot should be seated. Eventually, the Senate granted Smoot a seat and allowed him to vote. However, the hearings raised controversy as to whether polygamy had actually been abandoned as claimed in the [[1890 Manifesto]], and whether the LDS Church continued to exercise influence on Utah politics. In response to these hearings, [[President of the Church]] [[Joseph F. Smith]] issued a [[Second Manifesto]] denying that any post-Manifesto marriages had the church's sanction,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Later scholars, however, have determined that 90% of polygamous marriages between 1890 and 1904 were, in fact, conducted under church authority. See Quinn at 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and announcing that those entering such marriages in the future would be [[excommunication|excommunicated]].

The Second Manifesto did not annul existing [[plural marriage]]s within the church, and the church tolerated some degree of polygamy into at least the 1930s. However, eventually the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today seeks to actively distance itself from [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] groups still practicing polygamy.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1998 President Gordon B. Hinckley stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;
“If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.” &lt;br/&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=7c86605ff590c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 &quot;What Are People Asking About Us?&quot;] Ensign, November 1998, 70

===Mormon involvement in national politics===
====Mormons and the women's suffrage movement====
In 1870, the [[Utah Territory]] had become one of the first polities to grant women the right to vote—a right which the [[U.S. Congress]] revoked in 1887 as part of the [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]].

As a result, a number of LDS women became active and vocal proponents of women's rights. Of particular note was the LDS journalist and suffragist [[Emmeline B. Wells|Emmeline Blanch Wells]], editor of the ''[[Woman's Exponent]]'', a Utah feminist newspaper. Wells, who was both a [[feminism|feminist]] and a polygamist, wrote vocally in favor of a woman's role in the political process and public discourse. National suffrage leaders, however, were somewhat perplexed by the seeming paradox between Utah's progressive stand on women's rights, and the church's stand on polygamy.

In 1890, after the church officially renounced polygamy, U.S. suffrage leaders began to embrace Utah's feminism more directly, and in 1891, Utah hosted the Rocky Mountain Suffrage Conference in [[Salt Lake City]], attended by such national feminist leaders as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Anna Howard Shaw]]. The Utah Woman Suffrage Association, which had been formed in 1889 as a branch of the American Woman Suffrage Association (which in 1890 became the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]), was then successful in demanding that the constitution of the nascent state of [[Utah]] should enfranchise women. In 1896, [[Utah]] became the third state in the [[U.S.]] to grant women the right to vote.

====Mormons and the debate over temperance and prohibition====
The LDS church was actively involved in support of the [[temperance movement]] in the 19th century, and then the prohibition movement in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Thompson | first=Brent G. | title='Standing between Two Fires': Mormons and Prohibition, 1908–1917 | journal=Journal of Mormon History | pages=35–52 | year=1983 | volume=10 | url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/jmh,17670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormonism and the national debate over socialism and communism====
{{See also|Christian communism#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|l1=Christian communism: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Mormonism has had a mixed relationship with [[socialism]] in its various forms. In the earliest days of [[Mormonism]], [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] had established a form of [[Christian communism#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Christian communalism]], an idea made popular during the [[Second Great Awakening]], combined with a move toward [[theocracy]]. Mormons referred to this form of theocratic communalism as the [[United Order]], or the [[Law of Consecration]]. While short-lived during the life of Joseph Smith, the United Order was re-established for a time in several communities of [[Utah]] during the theocratic political leadership of [[Brigham Young]]. Some aspects of secular socialism also found place in the political views of Joseph Smith, who ran for President of the United States on a platform which included a nationalized bank that he believed would do away with much of the abuses of private banks. As secular political leader of Nauvoo, Joseph Smith also set aside collective farms which insured that the propertyless poor could maintain a living and provide for themselves and their families. Once in Utah, under the direction of Brigham Young, the Church leadership would also promote collective ownership of industry and issued a circular in 1876 which warned that &quot;The experience of mankind has shown that the people of communities and nations among whom wealth is the most equally distributed, enjoy the largest degree of liberty, are the least exposed to tyranny and oppression and suffer the least from luxurious habits which beget vice&quot;. The circular, signed and endorsed by the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency went on to warn that if &quot;measures not taken to prevent the continued enormous growth of riches among the class already rich, and the painful increase of destitution and want among the poor, the nation is likely to be overtaken by disaster; for, according to history, such a tendency among nations once powerful was the sure precursor of ruin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to religious socialism, many [[Mormons]] in Utah were receptive to the secular [[socialism|socialist]] movement that began in America during the 1890s. During the 1890s to the 1920s, the Utah Social Democratic Party, which became part of the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1901, elected about 100 socialists to state offices in Utah. An estimated 40% of Utah Socialists were Mormon. Many early socialists visited the Church's cooperative communities in Utah with great interest and were well received by the Church leadership. Prominent early socialists such as [[Albert Brisbane]], [[Victor Prosper Considerant]], [[Plotino Rhodakanaty]], [[Edward Bellamy]], and Ruth &amp; Reginald Wright Kauffman showed great interest in the successful cooperative communities of the Church in Utah. For example, while doing research for what would become a best selling socialist novel, [[Looking Backward]], [[Edward Bellamy]] toured the Church's cooperative communities in Utah and visited with [[Lorenzo Snow]] for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | last=Arrington
 | first=Leonard J.
 | title=Brigham Young: American Moses

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth &amp; Reginald Wright Kauffman also wrote a book, though this one non-fiction, after visiting the Church in Utah. Their book was titled ''[[The Latter Day Saints: A Study of the Mormons in the Light of Economic Conditions]]'', which discussed the Church from a Marxist perspective. [[Plotino Rhodakanaty]] was also drawn to Mormonism and became the first Elder of the Church in Mexico after being baptized when a group of missionaries which included [[Moses Thatcher]] came to Mexico. [[Moses Thatcher]] kept in touch with Plotino Rhodakanaty for years following and was himself perhaps the most prominent member of the Church to have openly identified himself as a socialist supporter.

[[Albert Brisbane]] and [[Victor Prosper Considerant]] also visited the Church in Utah during its early years, prompting [[Considerant]] to note that &quot;thanks to a certain dose of socialist solidarity, the Mormons have in a few years attained a state of unbelievable prosperity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributing the peculiar socialist attitudes of the early Mormons with their success in the desert of the western United States was common even among those who were not themselves socialist. For instance, in his book History of Utah, 1540-1886, [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]] points out that the Mormons &quot;while not communists, the elements of socialism enter strongly into all their relations, public and private, social, commercial, and industrial, as well as religious and political.  This tends to render them exclusive, independent of the gentiles and their government, and even in some respects antagonistic to them.  They have assisted each other until nine out of ten own their farms, while commerce and manufacturing are to large extent cooperative.  The rights of property are respected; but while a Mormon may sell his farm to a gentile, it would not be deemed good fellowship for him to do so.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While religious and secular socialism gained some acceptance among Mormons, the church was more circumspect about [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Communism]], because of its association with violent revolution. From the time of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], the church had taken a favorable view as to the [[American Revolution]] and the necessity at times to violently overthrow the government. Thus, in April 1917, after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] but prior to the seizure of power by the [[Bolsheviks]] in October, LDS [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles|apostle]] [[David O. McKay]] told an audience in general conference that &quot;It looks as if Russia will have a government 'by the people, of the people, and for the people.&quot; (April 7, 1917 Conference Report).

The church viewed the revolutionary nature of [[Communism]] as a threat to the [[United States Constitution]], which the church saw as divinely inspired to ensure the agency of man ( Mormonism believes God revealed to Joseph Smith in Chapter 101 of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] that &quot;the laws and constitution of the people...I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles&quot;). In 1936, the [[First Presidency]] issued a statement stating:

:[I]t would be necessary to destroy our government before Communism could be set up in the United States.

:Since Communism, established, would destroy our American Constitutional government, to support Communism is treasonable to our free institutions, and no patriotic American citizen may become either a Communist or supporter of Communism. . . .

:Communism being thus hostile to loyal American citizenship and incompatible with true church membership, of necessity no loyal American citizen and no faithful church member can be a Communist. (First Presidency, &quot;Warning to Church Members,&quot; July 3, 1936, ''Improvement Era'' 39, no. 8 (August 1936): 488).

In later years, such leaders as [[Ezra Taft Benson]] would take a stronger anti-Communist position publicly, his anti-Communism often being anti-leftist in general. However, Benson's views often brought embarrassment to the Church leadership, and when Benson was sent to Europe on a mission for the Church, many{{Who|date=November 2010}} believed this was a way of getting Benson out of the US where his right-wing views were a point of embarrassment for the church. While publicly claiming that this was not the reason for Benson's call to Europe, then President [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] wrote a letter to Congressman [[Ralph Harding]] stating that &quot;It would be better for him and for the Church and all concerned, if he would settle down to his present duties and let all political matters take their course. He is going to take a mission to Europe in the near future and by the time he returns I hope he will get all the political notions out of his system.” In another letter written in response to questions about how long Benson would be on his mission to Europe from U.S. Under-Secretary of State [[Averill Harriman]], First Counselor [[Hugh B. Brown]] responded “If I had my way, he’ll never come back!”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Benson would become the President of the Church and backed off of his political rhetoric. Toward the end of his presidency, the Church even began to discipline Church members who had taken Benson's earlier hardline right-wing speeches too much to heart, some of whom claimed that the Church had excommunicated them for adhering too closely to Benson's right-wing ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Institutional reforms===
====Developments in Church financing====
In the 1890s soon after the [[1890 Manifesto]], the LDS Church was in a dire financial condition. It was recovering from the U.S. crackdown on polygamy, and had difficulty reclaiming property that had been confiscated during polygamy raids. Meanwhile, there was a [[panic of 1893|national recession beginning in 1893]]. By the late 1890s, the church was about $2 million in debt, and near bankruptcy.&lt;!--

--&gt; In response, [[Lorenzo Snow]], then [[President of the Church]], conducted a campaign to raise the payment of [[tithe|tithing]], of which less than 20% of LDS had been paying during the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1994, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; After a visit to [[Saint George, Utah]], which had a much higher-than-average percentage of full 10% tithe-payers,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1994, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Snow felt that he had received a [[revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1994, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted him to promise adherents in various Utah settlements that if they paid their tithing, they would experience an outpouring of blessings, prosperity, the preparation for [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]], and protection of the LDS Church from its enemies; however, failure to pay tithing would result in the people being &quot;scattered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1994, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Snow's vigorous campaign, tithing payment increased dramatically from 18.4% in 1898 to an eventual peak of 59.3% in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1994, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, payment of tithing would become a requirement for temple worship within the faith.

*Constructing administration buildings
*[[Zions Securities]] Corporation (managing taxable church properties)
*Corporation of the President (managing non-taxable church properties)

*Changes in stipends for bishops and general authorities. (Bishops once received a 10% stipend from tithing funds, but are now purely volunteer. General authorities receive stipends, formerly received loans from church funds.)

====Church Educational System====
[[Church Educational System]]:
*As free public schools became available, the church closed or relinquished church-run &quot;stake academies&quot; and junior colleges in 1920s (except Rick's College and Brigham Young Academy).
*Building of seminaries on church property adjacent to public high schools (beginning 1912).
*Establishment of a General Board of Education
*Institutes of religion (beginning 1926 at University of Idaho)

====Church Welfare System====
Church welfare systems:
*Relief Society's Social Services department (1920s&amp;mdash;provided therapy, counseling, and adoption services)
*Church Security Program (1936)
*Welfare Program (1938)
*Welfare Services department (Social Services, employment and guidance programs, and health services)
*Military Relations Committee

====Changes to meeting schedule====
In earlier times, Latter-day Saint meetings took place on Sunday morning and evening, with several meetings during the weekday. This arrangement was acceptable for Utah Saints, who generally lived within walking distance of a church building. Elsewhere other than Utah, however, this meeting schedule was seen as a logistical challenge. In 1980, the Church introduced the &quot;Consolidated Meeting Schedule&quot;, in which the majority of church meetings were held on Sunday during a three-hour block.

While promoting convenience and making church practice compatible with non-Utahns, this new schedule has been criticized for eroding fellowshipping opportunities among North American Latter-day Saint youth. This erosion, in turn, has been blamed for decreasing LDS participation of young women to below that of young men, and for a downward trend in the percentage of LDS males who accept the call to serve a full time mission. ''See'' Quinn, ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power''.

====Changes to missionary service====
In 1982, the [[First Presidency]] announced that the length of service of male full-time [[missionaries]] would be reduced to 18 months. In 1984, a little more than 2 years later, it was announced that the length of service would be returned to its original length of 24 months ([http://www.dialoguejournal.com/excerpts/36-3a.asp]).

The change was publicized as a way to increase the ability for missionaries to serve. At the time, missionaries paid for all their expenses in their country of service. Recession during the Carter presidency pushed inflation higher and the exchange rate lower. This sudden increase in costs together with already high costs of living in Europe and other industrialized nations resulted in a steady decline in the number of missionaries able to pay for two full years of service. The shortening of the required service time from 24 to 18 months cut off this decline in numbers, leveling out in the period following the reinstatement. For those in foreign missions, this was barely enough time to learn a more difficult language and difficulty with language was reported.

Nevertheless, the shortened period of time also had an impact on numbers of conversions: they declined by 7% annually during the same period. Some also saw the shortening as a weakening of faithfulness among those who were eventually called as missionaries, less length meaning less commitment required in terms of faith. However, it has also been seen as a recognition by the leadership of changes within the [[Latter Day Saint movement|LDS]] cultural climate.

Record economic growth starting in the mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, paying for a mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations. Missionaries began paying into a church-wide general missionary fund instead of paying on their own. This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) is used by the church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go. This enabled those going to Bolivia, whose average cost of living is about $100 per month, to help pay for those going to Japan, whose cost tops out at around $900 per month.

====Changes to church hierarchy structure====
[[Priesthood Correlation Program]]:
*During the 1960s, the Church aggressively pursued its earlier Correlation Program that had begun in 1908, which streamlined and centralized the structure of the Church. The program also increased Church control over viewpoints taught in local church meetings.
*Priesthood editorial oversight of formerly priesthood-auxiliary-specific [[YMMIA]], [[YLMIA]], [[Relief Society]], [[Primary Association|Primary]], and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] magazines.
*Adoption of the [[Boy Scouts of America|Scouting]] program (1911)
*Priesthood Committee on Outlines established for publishing lesson materials for each priesthood quorum
*[[Melchizedek Priesthood]] handbook (1928)
*Priesthood-Auxiliary movement (1928–1937): re-emphasized the church hierarchy around Priesthood, and re-emphasized other church organizations as &quot;priesthood auxiliaries&quot; with reduced autonomy.

Other:
*Elimination of Presiding Patriarch office
*Emeritus status of general authorities who are too old or ill
*Reorganizing the quorums of seventy
*Dismantling ward and stake prayer circles (1978)

As the church began to collide and meld with cultures outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison some of the parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to [[Mormonism]]. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar [[Bruce R. McConkie]] drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the [[Gentiles]] within [[Christianity]], and encouraged members not to be so indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in [[Mormonism]]. Other peoples, he stated, &quot;have a different background than we have, which is of no moment to the Lord . . . . It is no different to have different social customs than it is to have different languages. . . . And the Lord knows all languages&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In 1987, [[Boyd K. Packer]], another Latter-day Saint [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]], stated, &quot;We can't move [into various countries] with a 1947 Utah Church! Could it be that we are not prepared to take the gospel because we are not prepared to take (and they are not prepared to receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;21 [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] 97 (Fall 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The church and blacks====
During and after the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures and people of color, which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial. The church came under intense fire for its stances on blacks and native Americans issues.

{{Main|Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The cause of some of the church's most damaging publicity had to do with the church's policy of discrimination toward blacks. Blacks were always officially welcome in the church, and [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] established an early precedent of ordained black males to the [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|Priesthood]]. Smith was also anti-slavery, going so far as to run on an anti-slavery platform as candidate for the presidency of the United States. At times, however, Smith had shown sympathy toward a belief common in his day that blacks were the cursed descendants of [[Cain]]. In 1849, church doctrine taught that though blacks could be baptized, they and others could not be ordained to the Priesthood or enter [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]]. Journal histories and public teachings of the time reflect that Young and others stated that God would some day reverse this policy of discrimination. &lt;!--May need to move the following to Blacks and the Church article:  --&gt;It is also important to note that while blacks as a whole were specifically withheld from priesthood blessings (although there were some exceptions to this policy in both the 1800s and 1900s), other races and genealogical lineages were also prohibited from holding the priesthood.
By the late 1960s, the Church had expanded into [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean]], and the nations of [[Africa]], and was suffering criticism for its policy of racial discrimination. In the case of Africa and the Caribbean, the church had not yet begun large scale missionary efforts in most areas. There were large groups in both Ghana and Nigeria who desired to join the church and many faithful members of African descent in Brazil. On June 9, 1978, under the administration of [[Spencer W. Kimball]], the church leadership finally received this divine sanction to change the long-standing policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]], OD-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are many black members of the church, and many predominantly black congregations. In the Salt Lake City area black members have organized branches of an official church auxiliary called the [[Genesis Group]]s.

====The church and Native Americans====
During the post-[[World War II]] period, the church also began to focus on expansion into a number of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, as well as Oceanic cultures, which many Mormons considered to be the same ethnicity. These peoples were called &quot;Lamanites&quot;, because they were all believed to descend from the [[Lamanite]] group in the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. In 1947, the church began the [[Indian Placement Program]], where Native American students (upon request by their parents) were voluntarily placed in white Latter-day Saint foster homes during the school year, where they would attend public schools and become assimilated into Mormon culture.

In 1955, the church began ordaining black [[Melanesia]]ns to the [[Priesthood (Latter-day Saint)|Priesthood]].

The church's policy toward [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] also came under fire during the 1970s. In particular, the church was criticized for its [[Indian Placement Program]], where Native American students were voluntarily placed in white Latter-day Saint foster homes during the school year. This program was criticized as [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]]. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. However, the commission rejected these accusations and found that the program was beneficial in many cases, and provided well-balanced American education for thousands, allowing the children to return to their cultures and customs. One issue was that the time away from family caused the assimilation of Native American students into American culture, rather than allowing the children to learn within, and preserve, their own culture. By the late 1980s, the program had been in decline, and in 1996, it was discontinued.

In 1981, the church published a new LDS edition of the [[Standard Works]] that changed a passage in ''The [[Book of Mormon]]'' that [[Lamanites]] (considered by many Latter-day Saints to be Native Americans) will &quot;become white and delightsome&quot; after accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ. Instead of continuing the original reference to skin color, the new edition replaced the word &quot;white&quot; with the word &quot;pure&quot;, emphasizing inward spirituality.

===Doctrinal reforms and influences===
[[Good Neighbor policy (LDS Church)]] and temple ordinance reforms.

&lt;!--Influence of Roberts, Talmage, Widtsoe, and Joseph Fielding Smith--&gt;
Beginning soon after the turn of the 20th Century, four influential Latter-day Saint scholars began to systematize, modernize, and codify Mormon doctrine: B.H. Roberts, [[James E. Talmage]], [[John A. Widtsoe]], and [[Joseph Fielding Smith]].

In 1921, the church called chemistry professor John A. Widtsoe as an apostle. Widtsoe's writings, particularly ''Rational theology'' and ''Joseph Smith as Scientist'', reflected the optimistic faith in science and technology that was pervasive at the time in American life. According to Widtsoe, all Mormon theology could be reconciled within a rational, positivist framework.

====Reaction to evolution====
{{Main|Mormonism and evolution}}
The issue of evolution has been a point of controversy for some members of the church. The first [[1909 Statement on the Origin of the Earth and Man|official statement on the issue of evolution]] was in 1909, which marked the centennial of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth and the 50th anniversary of his masterwork, ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. On that year, the [[First Presidency]] led by [[Joseph F. Smith]] as President, issued a statement reinforcing the predominant religious view of [[creationism]], and calling human evolution one of the &quot;theories of men&quot;, but falling short of declaring evolution untrue or evil. &quot;It is held by some&quot;, they said, &quot;that Adam was not the first man upon the earth, and that the original human was a development from lower orders of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men.&quot; Notably, the church did not opine on the evolution of animals other than humans, nor did it endorse a particular theory of creationism.

Soon after the 1909 statement, [[Joseph F. Smith]] professed in an editorial that &quot;the church itself has no philosophy about the ''modus operandi'' employed by the Lord in His creation of the world.&quot; ''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'', 46 (4), 208-209 (April 1911)).

Some also cite an additional editorial that enumerates various possibilities for creation including the idea that Adam and Eve: (1) &quot;evolved in natural processes to present perfection&quot;, (2) were &quot;transplanted [to earth] from another sphere&quot; (''see, e.g., [[Adam-God theory]]''), or (3) were &quot;born here . . . as other mortals have been.&quot; (''[[Improvement Era]]'' 13, 570 (April 1910)). Proponents of evolution attribute this 1910 editorial to Joseph F. Smith and have sometimes identified it under the title &quot;First Presidency Instructions to the Priesthood: &quot;Origin of Man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koffordbooks.com/evenson/Appendix%20TOC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have cast doubt on Joseph F. Smith's authorship of the editorial, which was published without attribution and seems to have contradicted contemporary views published elsewhere by Joseph F. Smith himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndbf.blogspot.com/2006/05/mormonism-and-evolution-authoritative.html No Death Before the Fall: Mormonism and Evolution: The Authoritative LDS Statements (review - part two, Appendix Document A)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], at blogspot.com{{Verify credibility|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also contend that there is little evidence that the editorial represents &quot;First Presidency Instructions&quot; as the title under which it is often cited indicates.

In 1925, as a result of publicity from the [[Scopes Trial|&quot;Scopes Monkey Trial&quot;]] concerning the right to teach evolution in [[Tennessee]] public schools, the [[First Presidency]] reiterated its 1909 stance, stating that &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, declares man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity. . . . Man is the child of God, formed in the divine image and endowed with divine attributes.&quot;

In the early 1930s there was an intense debate between liberal theologian and [[general authority]] B. H. Roberts and some members of the [[Council of the Twelve Apostles]] over attempts by B. H. Roberts to reconcile the fossil record with the scriptures by introducing a doctrine of pre-Adamic creation, and backing up this speculative doctrine using geology, biology, anthropology, and archeology (The Truth, The Way, The Life, pp.&amp;nbsp;238–240; 289-296). More conservative members of the Twelve Apostles, including Joseph Fielding Smith, rejected his speculation because it contradicted the idea that there was no death until after the fall of Adam. Scriptural references in the Book of Mormon such as 2 Nephi 2:22, Alma 12:23, and Doctrine and Covenants sec. 77:5-7 have been cited as teaching the doctrine that there was no death on the Earth before the Fall of Adam and Eve, and that the Earth's temporal existence consists of a total of seven thousand years (c.4,000 B.C.-c.2,000 A.D.). Some maintain that those scriptural references pertain to a spiritual death, although others disagree. It is clear, however, that the LDS church does not conform to the same young-Earth creationist creed as many other faiths. The church has made it quite clear that the six days of creation are not necessarily six 24-hour periods. Brigham Young definitely addressed the issue (Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1971], 100), and even the very anti-evolution Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught that a day, in the Creation accounts, “is a specified time period; it is an age, an eon, a division of eternity; it is the time between two identifiable events. And each day, of whatever length, has the duration needed for its purposes. . . .
“There is no revealed recitation specifying that each of the ‘six days’ involved in the Creation was of the same duration” (“Christ and the Creation,” Ensign, June 1982, 11).
Elder James E. Talmage published a book through the LDS church that explicitly stated that organisms lived and died on this earth before the earth was fit for human habitation ([http://eyring.hplx.net/Eyring/faq/evolution/Talmage1931.html]).
However, the official Church Educational System Student Manual teaches that there was no death before the Fall.
The debate between different LDS leaders in 1931 prompted the [[First Presidency]], then led by [[Heber J. Grant]] as President, to conclude:
:Upon the fundamental doctrines of the church we are all agreed. Our mission is to bear the message of the restored gospel to the world. Leave geology, biology, archaeology, and anthropology, no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind, to scientific research, while we magnify our calling in the realm of the church. . .
:Upon one thing we should all be able to agree, namely, that Presidents Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund were right when they said: &quot;Adam is the primal parent of our race&quot; [First Presidency Minutes, Apr. 7, 1931].

The debate over pre-Adamites has been interpreted by LDS proponents of evolution as a debate about organic evolution. This view, based on the belief that a dichotomy of thought on the subject of evolution existed between B. H. Roberts and Joseph Fielding Smith, has become common among pro-evolution members of the church. As a result, the ensuing 1931 statement has been interpreted by some as official permission for members to believe in organic evolution.[http://ndbf.net/eom.htm] However, there is no evidence that the debate included the topic of evolution, and historically there was no strong disagreement between Joseph Fielding Smith and B. H. Roberts concerning evolution; they both rejected it, although to different degrees. B. H. Roberts wrote that the &quot;hypothesis&quot; of organic evolution was &quot;destructive of the grand, central truth of all revelation,&quot; (The Gospel and Man's Relationship to Deity, 7th edition, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1928, pp.&amp;nbsp;265–267).

Later, [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] published his book ''Man: His Origin and Destiny'', which denounced evolution without qualification. Similar statements of denunciation were made by [[Bruce R. McConkie]], who as late as 1980 denounced evolution as one of &quot;the seven deadly heresies&quot; (BYU [[Fireside (Mormonism)|Fireside]], June 1, 1980), and stated: &quot;There are those who say that revealed religion and organic evolution can be harmonized. This is both false and devilish.&quot; Evolution was also denounced by the conservative [[Ezra Taft Benson]], who as an Apostle called on members to use the Book of Mormon to combat evolution and several times denounced evolution as a &quot;falsehood&quot; on a par with [[socialism]], [[rationalism]], and [[humanism]]. (Ezra Taft Benson, Conference Report, April 5, 1975).

A dichotomy of opinion exists among some church members today. Largely influenced by Smith, McConkie, and Benson, evolution is rejected by a large number of conservative church members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weaverresearch.org/evolution.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A minority accept evolution, supported in part by the debate between B. H. Roberts and Joseph Fielding Smith, in part by a large amount of scientific evidence, and in part by Joseph F. Smith's words that &quot;the church itself has no philosophy about the ''modus operandi'' employed by the Lord in His creation of the world.&quot; Meanwhile, [[Brigham Young University]], the largest private university owned and operated by the church, not only teaches evolution to its biology majors, but has also done significant research in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://bioagnews.byu.edu/newsrelease.aspx?ID=119&lt;/ref&gt; BYU-I, another church-run school, also teaches it; the following link is an article on how evolution and faith are reconciled at BYU-I.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.byui.edu/Perspective/v4n2pdf/v4n2_firestone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The church's political involvement in LGBT issues:
In 1992, the [[First Presidency]] was involved in efforts to defeat a proposal which would include &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as a protected category in Utah's hate crime law.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Beginning in the mid-1990s, the Church began to focus its attention on the issue of [[same-sex marriage]]s. In 1993, the Supreme Court of the State of [[Hawaii]] held that discrimination against same-sex couples in the granting of marriage licences violated the Hawaiian constitution. In response, the Church's [[First Presidency]] issued a statement on February 13, 1994 declaring its opposition to same-sex marriage to protect the sanctity of traditional roles of marriage. The statement and urged its members to not discriminate against gays and lesbians, but not condone same gender rights.

Supported by the efforts of the LDS Church and several other religious organizations, the Hawaiian legislature enacted a bill in 1994 outlawing same-sex marriages. Officially, the Church continues to oppose efforts in Hawaii to grant gay and lesbian families the right to legal equality, including adoption, child custody{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, and joint property rights.

As other states, including [[Vermont]] and [[Massachusetts]], began extending legal protections to same-sex couples, the Church continued to take an active role in preventing any legal equality for families other than the heterosexual married couples. In 2004, the Church officially endorsed an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] banning marriage except between a man and a woman. The Church also officially announced its opposition to political measures that &quot;confer legal status on any other sexual relationship&quot; than a &quot;man and a woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife.&quot; (&quot;First Presidency Statement on Same-Gender Marriage&quot;, October 19, 2004). Although the statement was directed specifically to gay marriage, the statement could also be read to encompass political opposition by the Church to recognizing [[civil union]]s, [[common-law marriage]]s, [[plural marriage]]s, or other family arrangements.

LGBT Mormon support groups:
Some Church members have formed a number of unofficial support organizations, including [[Evergreen International]], [[Affirmation: Gay &amp; Lesbian Mormons]], [[North Star (organization)|North Star]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northstarlds.org North Star&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Disciples2,&lt;ref name=&quot;disciples&quot;&gt;[http://www.disciples2.org Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wildflowers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wearewildflowers.com Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Family Fellowship]], GLYA (Gay LDS Young Adults),&lt;ref&gt;[http://glya.homestead.com Website Disabled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[LDS Reconciliation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldsreconciliation.org Gay Mormon at LDSReconciliation.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamofites]] and the Guardrail foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardrail.com/guardrail.htm The Guardrail Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Challenges to fundamental church doctrine====
{{See|Book of Abraham|Salamander Letter|Mark Hofmann|Reformed Egyptian}}
In 1967, a set of papyrus manuscripts were discovered in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] that appear to be the manuscripts from which [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] claimed to have translated the [[Book of Abraham]] in 1835. These manuscripts were presumed lost in the Chicago fire of 1871. Analyzed by Egyptologists, the manuscripts were identified by some as ''The [[Book of the Dead]]'', an ancient Egyptian funery text. Moreover, the scholars' translations of certain portions of the scrolls disagreed with Smith's translation. This discovery forced many Mormon apologists to moderate the earlier prevailing view that Smith's translations were literal one-to-one translations. As a result of this discovery, some Mormon apologists consider ''The Book of the Dead'' to be a starting-point that Smith used to reconstruct the original writings of Abraham through inspiration.

In the early 1980s, the apparent discovery of an early Mormon manuscript, which came to be known as the &quot;[[Salamander Letter]]&quot;, received much publicity. This letter, reportedly discovered by a scholar named [[Mark Hofmann]], alleged that the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' was given to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] by a being that changed itself into a [[salamander]], not by an [[angel]] as the official Church history recounted. &lt;!--Comment about Church reaction and apologetic explanations--&gt; The document was purchased by private collector Steven Christensen, but was still significantly publicized and even printed in the Church's official magazine, The Ensign. Some Mormon apologists including [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]] suggested that the letter used the idea of a salamander as a metaphor for an angel. The document, however, was revealed as a forgery in 1985, and Hofmann was arrested for two murders related to his forgeries.

Not all of Hofmann's findings have been deemed fraudulent. A document called the 'Anthon transcript' that allegedly contains [[reformed Egyptian]] characters from the Book of Mormon plates is still in dispute, although the characters have been highly circulated both by the Church and other individuals. Due to Hofmann's methods, the authenticity of many of the documents he sold to the Church and the Smithsonian will likely never be sorted out.

====Mormon dissidents and scholars====
In 1989, [[George P. Lee]], a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] member of the First [[Quorums of the Seventy|Quorum of the Seventy]] who had participated in the [[Indian Placement Program]] in his youth, was excommunicated. The church action occurred not long after he had submitted to the Church a 23-page letter critical of the program and the effect it had on Native American culture. In October 1994, Lee confessed to, and was convicted of, sexually molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1989. It is not known if church leaders had knowledge of this crime during the excommunication process.

In the late 1980s, the administration of [[Ezra Taft Benson]] formed what it called the [[Strengthening Church Members Committee]], to keep files on potential church dissidents and collect their published material for possible later use in church disciplinary proceedings. The existence of this committee was first publicized by an [[anti-Mormon]] ministry in 1991, when it was referred to in a memo dated July 19, 1990 leaked from the office of the church's Presiding Bishopric.

At the 1992 [[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone Symposium]], dissident Mormon scholar [[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] accused the Committee of being &quot;an internal espionage system,&quot; which prompted [[Brigham Young University|BYU]] professor and moderate Mormon scholar [[Eugene England]] to &quot;accuse that committee of undermining the Church,&quot; a charge for which he later publicly apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the Editor, ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]]'', March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The publicity concerning the statements of Anderson and England, however, prompted the church to officially acknowledge the existence of the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mormon Church keeps files on its dissenters,&quot; ''St. Petersburg Times'', Aug. 15, 1992, at 6e.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church explained that the Committee &quot;provides local church leadership with information designed to help them counsel with members who, however well-meaning, may hinder the progress of the church through public criticism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Secret Files,&quot; ''New York Times'', Aug. 22, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Presidency]] also issued a statement on August 22, 1992, explaining its position that the Committee had precedent and was justified based on a reference to [[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] (LDS) Sec. 123, written while [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] was imprisoned in [[Liberty, Missouri]], suggesting that a committee be formed to record and document acts of persecution against the church by the people of [[Missouri]].

Official concern about the work of dissident scholars within the church led to the excommunication or disfellowshipping of six such scholars, dubbed the [[September Six]], in September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Six intellectuals disciplined for apostasy.&quot; ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]],'' November 1993, 65-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changing doctrinal focus====
The church has always been against the creation, distribution and viewing of pornography. Gordon B. Hinckley had been known to say that pornography is as addictive as the worst drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Arave &quot;LDS urged to boost worthiness&quot; ''[[Deseret News]]'' May 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He often talked of what a shame it is to use such great resources (such as the internet) for such material.

===Latter-day Saint public relations===
By the 1960s and 1970s, as a consequence of its massive, international growth in the post-[[World War II]] era, the church was no longer primarily a Utah-based church, but a worldwide organization. The church, mirroring the world around it, felt the disunifying strains of alien cultures and diverse points of view that had brought an end to the idealistic modern age. At the same time, the [[postmodernity|postmodern]] world was increasingly skeptical of traditional religion and authority, and driven by mass-media and public image. These influences awoke within the church a new self-consciousness. The church could no longer rest quietly upon its fundamentals and history. It felt a need to sell its image to an increasingly jaded public, to jettison some of its Utah-based parochialism, to control and manage Mormon scholarship that might present an unfavorable image of the church, and to alter its organization to cope with its size and cultural diversity, while preserving centralized control of Latter-day Saint doctrine, practice, and culture.

Thus, the church underwent a number of important changes in organization, practices, and meeting schedule. In addition, the church became more media-savvy, and more self-conscious and protective of its public image. The church also became more involved in public discourse, using its new-found political and cultural influence and the media to affect its image, public morality, and Mormon scholarship, and to promote its missionary efforts. At the same time, the church struggled with how to deal with increasingly pluralistic voices within the church and within Mormonism. In general, this period has seen both an increase in cultural and racial diversity and extra-faith [[ecumenism]], and a decrease in intra-faith [[religious pluralism|pluralism]].

Until the church's rapid growth after World War II, it had been seen in the eyes of the general public as a backward, non- or vaguely-[[Christianity|Christian]] polygamist cult in Utah &amp;mdash; an image that interfered with proselyting efforts. As the church's size began to merit new visibility in the world, the church seized upon the opportunity to re-define its public image, and to establish itself in the public mind as a mainstream Christian faith. At the same time, the church became publicly involved in numerous ecumenical and welfare projects that continue to serve as the foundation of its ecumenism today.

In the 1960s the Church formed the Church Information Service with the goal of being ready to respond to media inquiries and generate positive media coverage. The organization kept a photo file to provide photos to the media for such events as Temple dedications. It also would work to get stories covering [[Family Home Evening]], the Church welfare plan and the Church's youth activities in various publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard O. Cowan]]. ''The Church in the 20th Century'' (Bookcraft: Salt Lake City, 1985) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the church's efforts to re-position its image as that of a mainstream religion, the church began to moderate its earlier anti-[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] rhetoric. In Elder [[Bruce R. McConkie]]'s 1958 edition of [[Mormon Doctrine (book)|''Mormon Doctrine'']], he had stated his unofficial opinion that the Catholic Church was part of &quot;the church of the devil&quot; and &quot;the great and abominable church&quot; because it was among organizations that misled people away from following God's laws. In his 1966 edition of the same book, the specific reference to the Catholic Church was removed.&lt;ref&gt;See generally: [[Armand L. Mauss]], ''The Angel and the Beehive: The Mormon Struggle with Assimilation'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1994); Gordon Sheperd &amp; Gary Sheperd, &quot;Mormonism in Secular Society: Changing Patterns in Official Ecclesiastical Rhetoric,&quot; ''Review of Religious Research'' 26 (Sept. 1984): 28-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first routinized system for teaching church principles to potential proselytes had been created in 1953 and named &quot;A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel&quot;. In 1961, this system was enhanced, expanded, and renamed &quot;A Uniform System for Teaching Investigators&quot;. This new system, in the form of a hypothetical dialogue with a fictional character named &quot;Mr. Brown&quot;, included intricate details for what to say in almost every situation. These routinized missionary discussions would be further refined in 1973 and 1986, and then de-emphasized in 2003.

In 1973, the church recast its missionary discussions, making them more family-friendly and focused on building on common Christian ideals. The new discussions, named &quot;A Uniform System for Teaching Families&quot;, de-emphasized the [[Great Apostasy]], which previously held a prominent position just after the story of the [[First Vision]]. When the discussions were revised in the early 1980s, the new discussions dealt with the apostasy less conspicuously, and in later discussions, rather than in the first discussion. The discussions also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.

According to Riess and Tickle, early Mormons rarely quoted from the Book of Mormon in their speeches and writings. It was not until the 1980s that it was cited regularly in speeches given by LDS Church leaders at the semiannual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conferences]]. In 1982, the LDS Church subtitled the Book of Mormon &quot;another testament of Jesus Christ.&quot; LDS leader [[Boyd K. Packer]] stated that the scripture now took its place &quot;beside the Old Testament and the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/18111/Since-1982-subtitle-has-defined-book-as-another-testament-of-Jesus-Christ.html Since 1982, subtitle has defined book as 'another testament of Jesus Christ']&quot;, 2 January 1988, ''[[LDS Church News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Riess and Tickle assert that the introduction of this subtitle was inteneded to emphasize the Christ-centered nature of the Book of Mormon.  They assert that the LDS &quot;rediscovery of the Book of Mormon in the late twentieth century is strongly connected to their renewed emphasis on the person and nature of Jesus Christ.&quot;&lt;ref name=RiessTickle&gt;{{Citation |title=The book of Mormon: selections annotated &amp; explained |first1=Jana |last1=Riess |first2=Phyllis |last2=Tickle |publisher=SkyLight Paths Publishing |year=2005 |pages=xiii-xiv |url=http://books.google.com/?id=zwUA8GC-HMkC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=Mormonism+disingenuous#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9781594730764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- no separate rationale for this article [[Image:Logo of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1995).gif|thumb|160px|1995 logo of the church, emphasizing the words &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;]] --&gt;
[[Image:Logo of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (pre-1995).png|thumb|140px|Pre-1995 church logo]]

In 1995, the church announced a new logo design that emphasized the words &quot;JESUS CHRIST&quot; in large capital letters, and de-emphasized the words &quot;The Church of&quot; and &quot;of Latter-day Saints&quot;. According to Bruce L. Olsen, director of public affairs for the church, &quot;The logo re-emphasizes the official name of the church and the central position of the Savior in its theology. It stresses our allegiance to the Lord, Jesus Christ.&quot;

On January 1, 2000, the [[First Presidency]] and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] released a proclamation entitled &quot;[http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,163-1-10-1,FF.html The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]&quot;. This document commemorated the birth of Jesus and set forth the church's official view regarding Christ.

In 2001, the church sent out a press release encouraging reporters to use the full name of the church at the beginning of news articles, with following references to the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ&quot;. The release discouraged the use of the term &quot;Mormon Church&quot;.

Cooperation with other churches:
*The church has opened its broadcasting facilities (Bonneville International) to other Christian groups, and has participated in the VISN Religious Interfaith Cable Television Network.
*The church has participated in numerous joint humanitarian efforts with other churches.
*The church has agreed not to baptize Holocaust victims by proxy

The church and the Information Age: This would include topics like how the church seeks to battle pornography, its use of the internet, its battle to control its public image, broadcasting the Nauvoo temple dedication, appearances on Larry King Live, and so on.

The church in the media:
*Official press releases [http://www.newsroom.lds.org]
*Explanations of basic beliefs found at [http://www.lds.org lds.org] and [http://www.mormon.org mormon.org]

'''Christian eschatology''' (from the Greek meaning &quot;last&quot; and &quot;study&quot;: ἔσχατος, last; and λογία, lit. discourse) is the study of the end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the [[Dispensation (period)|age]], or the end of the present world and beginning of the [[World to Come]], from a Christian perspective.

Christian eschatology is concerned with [[death]], an [[intermediate state]], [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], the [[resurrection of the dead]], a [[rapture]], a [[tribulation|great tribulation]], the [[Millennium]], [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]], the [[Last Judgment]], a new heaven and a [[The New Earth|new earth]], and the ultimate consummation of all of God's purposes. [[Eschatological]] passages are found in many places, especially [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Olivet discourse|Matthew 24]], [[The Sheep and the Goats|Matthew 25]], and the [[Book of Revelation]].

The [[Second Coming of Christ]] is the central event in Christian eschatology and the Book of Revelation is at the core of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four approaches. In the [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]] approach, Revelation is chiefly seen as referring to events which as yet have not come to pass, but which will come to pass at the end of the age, and the end of the world. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies. In the [[Preterism|Preterist]] approach, Revelation chiefly refers to the events of the 1st century AD, such as the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD]], and the desecration of the temple in the same year. In the [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]] approach passages in ''Revelation'' are identified with major historical people and events. In the [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]] (or Spiritualist or Symbolic) approach, the events of Revelation are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.

==Introduction==
Christian [[eschatology]] is concerned with the [[afterlife]], beginning with [[death]] and the [[Particular judgment]] that follows the death of the individual, and is followed by the destination of [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. (In Catholic theology, heaven is sometimes preceded by [[purgatory]].) Eschatology also concerns itself with events said to happen at the end of this age: the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[Rapture]], the [[Tribulation]], and following these things, the [[Millennialism|Millennium]], or thousand years of peace, which has been interpreted both literally and symbolically. Finally, eschatology concerns itself with the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]] and its associated events: the [[Last Judgment]]; the banishment of Death, [[Hades]], and [[Satan]] and his followers to the [[Lake of Fire]]; and the creation of a new heaven and [[The New Earth|new earth]]. [[Millennarianism|Millenarianists]], [[Millerism|Seventh Day Adventists]], [[Campbellite]]s, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and other recently founded [[Christian denominations]] have been influential in the modern development of these doctrines, though their roots are Biblical.

{{Eschatology}}
Eschatology is an ancient branch of study in Christian theology, with study of the &quot;last things&quot; and the [[Second Coming of Christ]] first touched on by [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (c. 35–107 AD), then given more consideration by the Christian apologist, [[St Justin Martyr|Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165){{citation needed|date=January 2011}}. Treatment of eschatology continued in the [[Western Christianity|West]] in the teachings of [[Tertullian]] (c. 160–225), and was given fuller reflection and speculation soon after by [[Origen]] (c. 185–254).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Roberts &amp; James Donaldson, eds. ''Ante-Nicene Fathers.'' (16 vol.) Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson, 1994. The writings of Ignatius and Justin Martyr can be found in Vol. 1; Tertullian, in Volumes 3–4; and Origen, in Volume 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was increasingly recognized as a formal division of theological study during the 20th century.

Eschatological passages, sometimes called &quot;[[apocalyptic]]&quot; writings, are found throughout the Bible, in both the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], although they are concentrated in the prophetic books. There are various short, but important, eschatological passages in the [[gospels]] and the [[epistles]]. There are also many extrabiblical examples of eschatological prophecy, as well as church traditions that have been added to the scriptures over the years.

{{Christian Eschatology}}
The second coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. Others believe that suffering will gradually be eliminated prior to his coming, and that the elimination of injustice is our part in preparing for that event. There are a variety of viewpoints concerning the order and significance of eschatological events.

==Different eschatological views==
{{See also|Christian eschatological views}}
There are many different schools of interpretation, generally relating to what place eschatology has in history, and where the thousand year kingdom is in relation to the second coming.

For what place eschatology has in history, the four most common views are:[[Image:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseFolio003rAngelApeardToJohn.jpg|right|thumb|The Angel Appears to John. The book of Revelation. 13th century manuscript. British Library, London.]]
* The ''[[Preterism|Preterist]]'' approach (from the Latin ''praeteritus'' meaning ''gone by'') seeks parallels between ''Revelation'' and the events of the 1st century AD, such as Herod's attempt to kill the infant Christ, the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of Judaism and the Roman Empire, the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, the desecration of the temple in the same year, and the growth of Christianity from a sect within Judaism to an independent religion.
* The ''[[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]]'' method takes a broader historical approach and seeks parallels between ''Revelation'' and the major people and events of history, especially those that directly affected Israel and the Church.
* The ''[[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]]'' method approaches ''Revelation'' as chiefly referring to events that have not come to pass, but that will take place at the end of this age and at the end of the world. The main focus is the return of Christ. This is the approach that most applies to eschatological studies.
* The ''[[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]]'' model, also known as ''Spiritualist'' or ''Symbolic'', approaches the images of ''Revelation'' as symbols that represent larger themes and concepts, rather than actual people and events. It sees in Revelation an allegorical representation of the ongoing struggle of the forces of light and darkness, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. An advantage of this approach for some is that it does not require belief in divine inspiration or the supernatural prediction of future events. But this fact also limits its application to eschatology, unless used in combination with the other approaches.

For what relation the thousand year kingdom has to Christ's second coming, the three most common views are:

*[[Premillennialism]]: [[Christ]]'s [[Second coming]] before a literal one thousand year period, known by some as a thousand-year sabbath, is preceded by a gradual deterioration of human society and behavior, and the expansion of evil through an endtime government or kingdom.
*[[Postmillennialism]]: Christ's Second coming is seen as occurring after the one-thousand years, which many in this school of thought believe is ushered in by the church.
*[[Amillennialism]]: Non-literal &quot;thousand years&quot; or long age between Christ's first and second comings; the millennial reign of Christ as pictured in the book of Revelation is viewed now as Christ reigning at the right hand of the Father.

===Signs of Christ's Return===
{{quote|
Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said, &quot;Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.&quot; |Acts 1:9-11}}

Dispensationalists believe:

# The coming of Christ will be instantaneous and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/82/LNG/en/7/The-Secret-Rapture/SC/R/Default.aspx The Secret Rapture] by Joe Crews&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.&quot; ~ [[Gospel of Matthew]] 24:27

# The coming of Christ will be audible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/9/LNG/en/7/Anything-But-Secret/SC/R/Default.aspx Anything But Secret]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.&quot; Matthew 24:31
# The resurrection of the righteous will occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audioverse.org/sermons/recordings/578/rev-14-11-to-15-1-and-16-15.html Eugene Prewitt - Audioverse]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.&quot; ~ 1 [[Thessalonians]] 4:16
# In one single event, the saved who are alive at Christ's coming will be caught up together with the resurrected to meet the Lord in the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapturetruth.org/ Secret Rapture Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.&quot; ~ 1 Thessalonians 4:17
# Human life will cease to exist on earth for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleuniverse.com/study-tools/bible-study-guides/english/study-guide-viewer.aspx?IID=2-8&amp;LNG=en&amp;TL=The-Ultimate-Deliverance The Ultimate Deliverance Study Guide] See Question # 7&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.&quot; ([[2 Peter]] 3:10)

The '''Chicago White Sox''' are a [[Major League Baseball]] team based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].The White Sox play in the [[American League]]'s [[American League Central|Central Division]].  Since {{by|1991}}, the White Sox have played in [[U.S. Cellular Field]], which was originally called New Comiskey Park and nicknamed The Cell by local fans. The White Sox are one of two major league clubs based in Chicago, the other being the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]]. The White Sox last won the [[World Series]] in [[2005 World Series|2005]] when they played the [[Houston Astros]] and swept them in four games.  

One of the American League's eight charter [[Major North American professional sports teams|franchises]], the Chicago team was established as a major league baseball club in {{by|1900}}. The club was originally called the Chicago White Stockings, after the nickname abandoned by the Cubs, and the name was soon shortened to Chicago White Sox, believed to have been because the paper would shorten it to Sox in the headlines. At this time, the team played their home games at [[South Side Park]]. In {{by|1910}}, the team moved into historic [[Comiskey Park]], which they would inhabit for more than eight decades.

The White Sox were a strong team during their first two decades, winning the [[1906 World Series]] with a defense-oriented team dubbed &quot;the Hitless Wonders&quot;, and the [[1917 World Series]] led by [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Eddie Collins]], and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]].  The [[1919 World Series]], however, was marred by the [[Black Sox Scandal]], in which several prominent members of the White Sox (including Cicotte and Jackson) were accused of conspiring with gamblers to [[Match fixing|purposefully lose games]].  Baseball's new commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] took decisive action, banning the tainted players from Major League Baseball for life.  Decades of mediocrity followed for the White Sox until the 1950s, when perennially competitive teams were blocked from the playoffs by the dynastic [[New York Yankees]], with the exception of the [[1959 World Series|1959 pennant winners]] led by [[Early Wynn]], [[Nellie Fox]], [[Luis Aparicio]], and manager [[Al Lopez]].  Another pennant winner did not come until their [[2005 World Series|championship season of 2005]], when the White Sox won their first World Series championship in 88 years, breaking their epochal [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|drought]] only a year after the [[Boston Red Sox]] had broken their slightly shorter but more celebrated &quot;curse.&quot;

The Chicago White Sox are most prominently [[List of baseball team nicknames|nicknamed]] &quot;the South Siders&quot;, based on their particular [[South Side (Chicago)|district within Chicago]].  Other nicknames include &quot;the Pale Hose&quot;, &quot;the ChiSox&quot;, a combination of &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Sox&quot; (as opposed to the [[Boston Red Sox|BoSox]]), mostly just used by the national media, &quot;the Go-Go Sox&quot;, a reference to 1959 AL champions, who got that nickname; &quot;the Good Guys&quot;, a reference to the team's one-time motto &quot;Good guys wear black&quot;, coined by [[Ken Harrelson|Ken &quot;Hawk&quot; Harrelson]]; and &quot;the Black Sox,&quot; referring specifically to the [[Black Sox Scandal|scandal-tainted 1919 team]]. Most fans and Chicago media refer to the team as simply &quot;the Sox&quot;. The [[Spanish language]] media sometimes refer to the team as ''Medias Blancas'' for &quot;White Socks.&quot;

==Franchise history==
{{For|records of every White Sox season|List of Chicago White Sox seasons}}

===1894&amp;ndash;1900: Western League===
The team began as the minor league [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]] Cornhuskers and played in the [[Western League (original)|Western League]]. The WL reorganized itself in November {{by|1893}}, with [[Ban Johnson]] as President. Johnson, a Cincinnati-based reporter, had been recommended by his friend [[Charles Comiskey]], former major league star with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]] in the 1880s, who was then managing the [[Cincinnati Reds]].  After the {{by|1894}} season, when Comiskey's contract with the Reds was up, he decided to take his chances at ownership. He bought the Sioux City team and transferred it to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], where it enjoyed some success over the next five seasons.

In {{by|1900}}, the Western League changed its name to the [[American League]]. It was still officially a [[minor league baseball|minor league]], subject to the governing National Agreement and an underling of the [[National League]]. The NL actually gave permission to the AL to put a team in [[Chicago]], provided he not use the city name in the team's branding. Comiskey moved his St. Paul club to the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] and renamed it the '''White Stockings''', grabbing a nickname that had once been used by the [[Chicago Cubs]]. The White Stockings won the 1900 American League pennant led by [[Player-coach|player-manager]] [[Dick Padden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spink|first=Alfred Henry|title=The National Game|publisher=SIU Press|year=2000|edition=2nd edition|isbn=0809323044|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract]]|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final WL/AL championship season as a minor league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/significant_dates.jsp White Sox Significant Dates | WhiteSox.com: History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, the AL declined to renew its membership in the National Agreement and declared itself a major league.

===1901&amp;ndash;14: Early years===
After acquiring a number of stars from the older league, including pitcher and manager [[Clark Griffith]], the White Stockings also captured the AL's first major-league pennant the next year, in {{by|1901}}. Headline editors at the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' sports department immediately began shortening the name to &quot;White Sox,&quot; and the team officially adopted the shorter name in {{by|1904}}. The name change to the White Sox was brought on after scorekeeper Christoph Hynes wrote White Sox at the top of a scorecard rather than White Stockings, this scorecard was then seen by the press. The White Sox would continue to be built on pitching and defense in the following years, led by pitching workhorse [[Ed Walsh]], who routinely pitched over 400 innings each season in his prime..

===1903&amp;ndash;16: The Hitless Wonders===
[[File:Ed Walsh portrait 1911.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ed Walsh]] was a dominant starter for the White Sox from 1904 to 1916 and holds the lowest career ERA in Major League history.]]
Walsh, [[Doc White]] and [[Nick Altrock]] paced the [[1906 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] to their {{by|1906}} pennant and faced the crosstown rival [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] in the [[1906 World Series]]. The Cubs had won a then-record 116 regular-season games and were an overwhelming favorite to defeat the White Sox, especially since the White Sox had the lowest team batting average in the American League that year. However, in a stunning upset, the White Sox took the Series, and intracity bragging rights, in six games. To this day, the 1906 White Sox are known as &quot;the Hitless Wonders.&quot;

The White Sox spent the next decade alternating between solid and mediocre seasons. During this time, however, they acquired a solid core of players such as catcher [[Ray Schalk]], shortstop / third baseman [[Buck Weaver]], and pitchers [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Red Faber]] and [[Reb Russell]].

In {{by|1915}}, [[Pants Rowland]] became the manager and the White Sox added outfielder [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]], second baseman [[Eddie Collins]] and outfielder [[Happy Felsch]] to the line-up. The [[1915 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] finished in 3rd place with a record of 93&amp;ndash;61. In {{by|1916}}, the [[1916 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] acquired pitcher [[Lefty Williams]] and finished 2nd at 89&amp;ndash;65.

===The 1917 World Champions===
{{Main|1917 Chicago White Sox season}}

In {{by|1917}}, the White Sox put the final pieces of the puzzle together with the addition of first baseman [[Chick Gandil]] and shortstop [[Swede Risberg]]. Weaver was moved over to third base.

The White Sox roared through the American League in 1917 with a record of 100-54—still a franchise record for wins and winning percentage—and won the pennant by 9 games over the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Their offense, led by Collins (.289, 91 runs), Felsch (.308, 102 RBI) and Jackson (.301, 91 runs), was 1st in runs scored. The White Sox pitching staff, led by [[Eddie Cicotte]] (28&amp;ndash;12 1.53 ERA), Williams (17&amp;ndash;8 2.97 ERA), [[Red Faber]] (16&amp;ndash;13 1.92 ERA) and [[Reb Russell]] (15&amp;ndash;5 1.95 ERA), ranked 1st with a 2.16 ERA.

The White Sox faced the 98&amp;ndash;56 [[1917 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in the [[1917 World Series|World Series]]. The White Sox won Game 1 of the Series in Chicago 2&amp;ndash;1 behind a complete game by Cicotte. Felsch hit a home run in the 4th inning that provided the winning margin. The White Sox beat the Giants in Game 2 by a score of 7&amp;ndash;2 behind another complete game effort by Faber to take a 2&amp;ndash;0 lead in the series.

Back in New York for Game 3, Cicotte again threw a complete game, but the White Sox could not muster a single run against Giants starter [[Rube Bensen]] and lost 2&amp;ndash;0. In Game 4 the White Sox were shut out again 5&amp;ndash;0 by [[Ferdie Schupp]]. Faber threw another complete game, but the Series was going back to Chicago even at 2&amp;ndash;2.

Reb Russell started Game 5 in Chicago, but only faced 3 batters before giving way to Cicotte. Going into the bottom of the 7th inning, Chicago was down 5&amp;ndash;2, but they rallied to score 3 in the 7th and 3 in the 8th to win 8&amp;ndash;5. Red Faber pitched the final 2 innings for the win. In Game 6 the White Sox took an early 3&amp;ndash;0 lead and on the strength of another complete game victory from Faber (his third of the Series) won 4&amp;ndash;2 and clinched the World Championship. Eddie Collins was the hitting hero, batting .409 over the 6 game series while Cicotte and Faber combined to pitch 50 out of a total 52 World Series innings to lead the staff.

===1918&amp;ndash;20: &quot;The Eight Men Out&quot;===
[[File:1919 blacksox.jpg|thumb|right|The 1919 Chicago White Sox]]
{{See also|Black Sox Scandal}}

After an off-year in the war-shortened season of {{by|1918}}, the club bounced back to win the pennant in 1919 and entered the [[1919 World Series|World Series]] heavily favored to defeat the [[1919 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in a best-of-9.

However, just before the Series, it became known that some big money was being bet on the Reds, fueling talk that the Series was [[match fixing|fixed]]. The White Sox lost to the Reds in eight games.

Rumors of a fix continued unabated through the {{by|1920|1920 season}} campaign, even as the White Sox roared through the season and appeared on their way to a third pennant in four years. The team's pitching was particularly strong that year; the [[1920 Chicago White Sox season|1920 White Sox]] pitching staff was the first in the majors to feature four 20-game winners. In September 1920, an investigation into a fixed Cubs game eventually turned in the direction of the 1919 Series. During the investigation, Cicotte and Jackson confessed. Comiskey, who himself had turned a blind eye to the rumors previously, was compelled to suspend the remaining seven players (Gandil, eventually perceived as the ringleader, the one &quot;connected&quot; to the gamblers, had retired after the 1919 season) before their last season series against the [[1919 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]]. The suspensions ground the team to a halt; they lost two out of three games to the Browns and finished second, two games behind the [[Cleveland Indians]]. However, the evidence of their involvement (signed confessions) disappeared from the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] courthouse, and lacking that tangible evidence, a criminal trial (whose scope was limited to the question of defrauding the public) ended in acquittals of all the players. Regardless, with the public's trust of the game of baseball at stake, newly installed [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] banned all the accused from baseball for life.

===1922&amp;ndash;50: The lean years===
From 1901 to 1920, the White Sox won five out of a possible 19 pennants. However, they were severely crippled by the loss of seven of their best players in their prime. With a depleted roster, the White Sox dropped into seventh place in {{by|1921}} and would not contend again until {{by|1936}}. During that stretch, only the {{by|1925}} and {{by|1926}} teams even managed to top .500. During this period, the White Sox featured stars such as third baseman [[Willie Kamm]], shortstop [[Luke Appling]], outfielder [[Leo Najo]] and pitcher [[Ted Lyons]]. However, an outstanding team was never developed around them, or a deep pitching staff. Ironically, the White Sox almost landed [[Babe Ruth]]; they offered to trade Jackson to the Red Sox for Ruth after owner [[Harry Frazee]] put his troublemaking star on the market. The White Sox offered Jackson and $60,000; however, the [[New York Yankees]] offered an all-cash deal of $100,000. Between the dumping of star players by the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] and the Red Sox, and the decimation of the White Sox, a &quot;power vacuum&quot; was created in the American League, into which the Yankees would soon move.

The White Sox finally became competitive again under popular manager [[Jimmy Dykes]], who led them from 1934 to 1946 &amp;ndash; still the longest managerial tenure in team history. However, the White Sox did not completely recover from their malaise until the team was rebuilt in the 1950s under managers [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]], [[Marty Marion]], and [[Al Lopez]].

===1950&amp;ndash;67: &quot;Go-Go Sox&quot; and the Bridesmaid Years===
Following Charles Comiskey's death in 1931, the team continued to be operated by his family &amp;ndash; first by his son Louis, then by Louis' widow Grace, and finally by their daughter Dorothy Rigney. Not until {{by|1959}} did the team pass out of the family (thanks in part to a feud between Dorothy and her brother Chuck) to a new ownership group, led by [[Bill Veeck]], who had previously run both the [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]]; it has been rumored that Veeck also tried to buy the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] during [[World War II]], with the stated intention of stocking the team with players from the [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]], but was rejected.

During the 1950s, the team had begun to restore its respectability with [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] utilizing an offensive philosophy emphasizing speed and a spectacular style of defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;''A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances''&quot;&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065155/index.htm ''A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances'', by Henry Hecht, Sports Illustrated, August 25, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial All-Star [[Minnie Miñoso]], a former Negro Leaguer who became the White Sox' first black player in {{by|1951}}, personified both aspects, leading the league in [[stolen base]]s while hitting over .300 and providing terrific play in left field. The additions of rookie shortstop [[Luis Aparicio]] in 1956 and manager [[Al Lopez]] in 1957 continued the strengthening of the team, joining longtime team standouts such as [[Nellie Fox]] at second base, pitchers [[Billy Pierce]] and [[Virgil Trucks]], and catcher [[Sherm Lollar]]. The White Sox would lead the American League in stolen bases every year from {{By|1951}} to {{By|1961}}.

In [[1959 World Series|1959]], the team won its first pennant in 40 years, thanks to the efforts of several eventual Hall of Famers &amp;ndash; Lopez, Aparicio, Fox (the league MVP), and pitcher [[Early Wynn]], who won the [[Cy Young Award]] at a time when only one award was presented for both leagues. The White Sox would also acquire slugger [[Ted Kluszewski]], a local area native, from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for the final pennant push. Kluszewski gave the team a much-needed slugger for the stretch run, and he hit nearly .300 for the White Sox in the final month. Lopez had also managed the Cleveland Indians to the World Series in [[1954 World Series|1954]], making him the only manager to interrupt the New York Yankees pennant run between 1949 and 1964 inclusive.

After the pennant-clinching victory, Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], a life-long White Sox fan, ordered his fire chief to set off the city's [[civil defense siren|air raid sirens]]. Many Chicagoans became fearful and confused since 1959 was the height of the [[Cold War]]; however, they relaxed somewhat upon realizing it was part of the White Sox' celebration. The [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] won Game 1 of the World Series 11&amp;ndash;0 on the strength of Kluszewski's two home runs, their last postseason home win until [[2005 American League Division Series|2005]]. The [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], however, won three of the next four games and captured their first World Series championship since moving to the west coast in 1958. 92,706 fans witnessed Game 5 of the World Series at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the most ever to attend a World Series game, or for that matter any non-exhibition major league baseball game. The White Sox won that game 1&amp;ndash;0 over the Dodgers' 23-year-old pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]], but the Dodgers clinched the series by beating the White Sox 9&amp;ndash;3 two days later at Comiskey Park.

Due to Veeck's arrival in 1959, [[Comiskey Park]] instantly became a ballpark filled with a series of promotional stunts which helped draw record crowds, the most obvious being the exploding [[fireworks]] Veeck installed in the scoreboard to celebrate home runs and victories.  And in 1960, they became the first team in the history of sports to wear last names on the back of their jerseys, a Veeck innovation.  Unlike Charles Comiskey, Veeck was considered a player-friendly owner, and players enjoyed playing for him.

Although the White Sox had winning records every season from 1951 through 1967, the Yankees dynasty of the era often left the White Sox frustrated in second place; they were league runner-up 5 times between 1957 and 1965. Health problems forced Veeck to sell the team to brothers Arthur and John Allyn in {{by|1961}}, and while the team continued to play well, many of the ballpark thrills seemed to be missing. The White Sox had several outstanding pitching staffs in the 1960s, with pitchers who had the best ERA in four different seasons -- [[Frank Baumann (baseball)|Frank Baumann]], 2.67 ({{by|1960}}), [[Gary Peters (baseball)|Gary Peters]], 2.33 ({{by|1963}}), and again with 1.98 ({{by|1966}}) and finally [[Joe Horlen]], 2.06 ({{by|1967}}).

The {{by|1964}} season was especially frustrating, as the team won 98 games, four more than 1959, including their last nine in a row &amp;ndash; yet finished one game behind the pennant-winning [[1964 New York Yankees season|Yankees]], who had a late-season eleven-game win streak that opened up just enough room to stave off the [[1964 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox's]] final charge. The [[1967 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] were also involved in one of the closest pennant races in history in 1967. After leading the American League for most of the season, on the final weekend, the White Sox, [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]], [[1967 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] and [[1967 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] all had a shot at the pennant. However, the Red Sox would assert themselves in the final weekend, beating the Twins to take the pennant by a single game. The White Sox finished in 4th at 89&amp;ndash;73, three games behind.

===1968&amp;ndash;75: Going somewhere?===
In {{by|1968}}, [[Bud Selig]], a former minority owner of the [[Atlanta Braves|Milwaukee Braves]] who had been unable to stop the relocation of his team three years earlier, contracted with the Allyn brothers to host nine home games (one against each of the other American League clubs) at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] as part of an attempt to attract an expansion franchise to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].

The experiment was staggeringly successful - those nine games drew 264,297 fans. In Chicago that season, the [[1968 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 58 home dates (72 games, 14 doubleheaders). In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly one-third of the total attendance at White Sox games.

In {{by|1969}}, the league expanded from 10 teams to 12, and the [[1969 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] schedule in Milwaukee was likewise expanded to include 11 home games (again, one against every opponent). Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year - over one-third of the fans who went to White Sox games did so at Milwaukee County Stadium. In the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago (70 games, 11 doubleheaders), the White Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per date.

Selig was denied an expansion franchise at the 1968 owners' meetings, and turned his efforts toward purchasing and relocating an existing club. His search began close to home, with the White Sox themselves. According to Selig, he had a handshake agreement with [[Arthur Allyn]] in early 1969 to purchase a majority stake in the White Sox and move them north to Milwaukee. The American League, however, blocked the sale, unwilling to give up its presence in a major city. Allyn instead sold his shares to his brother John, who agreed to stay in Chicago. Selig would go on to buy the [[Milwaukee Brewers|Seattle Pilots]] and move them to Milwaukee instead.

The [[1972 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] had a brief resurgence in {{by|1972}}, with slugger [[Dick Allen]] winning the MVP award; but injuries, especially to popular third baseman [[Bill Melton]], took their toll and the team finished 5½ games behind [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]], the eventual world champion.

Several lawsuits against Major League Baseball from Seattle over the move of the Pilots to Milwaukee, Wisconsin almost resulted in the White Sox being moved to the Emerald City in {{by|1975}}. An elaborate scheme for a franchise shuffle soon came to light. The White Sox were to be moved to Seattle, then the [[Oakland Athletics]] were to take the White Sox's place in Comiskey Park. Oakland owner [[Charlie Finley]] was from nearby [[La Porte, Indiana]]. His A's had not drawn well during their Championship years in [[Oakland, California]], and he wanted to bring them to Chicago. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, the shuffle collapsed when owner [[John Allyn]] sold the team to the physically rehabilitated Bill Veeck. In {{by|1977}}, the [[Seattle Mariners]] were created, thus restoring the major leagues' presence in the [[Pacific Northwest]].

===1976&amp;ndash;81: The Return of Veeck and the South Side Hitmen===
On December 10, {{by|1975}}, [[Bill Veeck]] regained ownership of the team, and he vowed to make the White Sox an exciting team again. Besides his customary promotions, Veeck introduced retro uniforms and shorts. The shorts were only worn once - during the first game of a doubleheader against the [[Kansas City Royals]] at Comiskey Park on August 8, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mopupduty.com/index.php/worst-uniforms-chicago-white-sox-shorts-1976/ Mopupduty.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The {{by|1976}} team was one of the worst White Sox teams ever, winning only 64 games (.398), drawing fewer than 915,000 fans.
 
Veeck's strategy to make the team competitive quickly, dubbed &quot;rent-a-player&quot; by sports writers, involved acquiring star players in the final year of their contracts. The theory was that the players would strive to put up huge numbers in hopes of getting a big contract at the end of the season, and carry the club with them. The first of these acquisitions was made prior to the 1977 season and the last prior to the 1978 season. While this approach had the virtue of not having been tried, it was unsustainable. The Sox had to give up several young prospects in exchange for veteran players who invariably signed with other clubs after their single season in Chicago. For instance, in acquiring Richie Zisk from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], the Sox gave up pitchers [[Rich &quot;Goose&quot; Gossage]] and [[Terry Forster]], both of whom went on to have lengthy and productive professional careers. Gossage was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2008. There was also a singular focus on power hitters in these acquisitions while pitching and defense were ignored. The Sox scored a lot of runs, but they also lost many high-scoring games during this period. Rent-a-player did enjoy a degree of success, however. In 1977 it quickly infused an excitement that had been missing for years. For that one season it transformed the Sox from a boring, losing club into a pennant contender.

The [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977 season]] was a memorable one for the South Siders, led by off-season acquisitions [[Oscar Gamble]] (.297 AVG, 31 HR, 83 RBI), [[Richie Zisk]] (.290 AVG, 30 HR, 101 RBI) and American League Comeback Player of the Year [[Eric Soderholm]] (.280 AVG, 25 HR, 67 RBI). The team, known by the press and fans as the &quot;South Side Hitmen&quot; hit a since-broken team record 192 home runs and were in first place in the [[American League]] West as late as August enroute to a third place finish (90-72). They also drew a team-record 1,657,135 fans to Comiskey (since broken as well). Manager [[Bob Lemon]] was named AL Manager of the Year by [[United Press International|UPI]] for his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitesoxinteractive.com/History&amp;Glory/1977.htm Whitesoxinteractive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the {{by|1977}} season Gamble and Zisk signed with other teams - Gamble with the [[San Diego Padres]] and Zisk with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Veeck's attempt to replace them with [[Bobby Bonds]] and [[Ron Blomberg]] fizzled as the {{by|1978}} team lost 90 games. Bonds appeared in only 26 games for the Sox before being dealt to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and Blomberg's major league career ended with the season's final game. Blomberg, who batted .293 over his career, hit only .231 with five home runs and 22 RBI in 61 games for the Sox in 1978 (he played only one game in 1977 for the [[New York Yankees]]). Two tough years followed: 87 losses in {{by|1979}} (including the infamous July 12 forfeit on [[Disco Demolition Night]]; see [[Steve Dahl]]) and 90 losses in {{by|1980}}.

During this period the Sox acquired several players who were once stars but were past their primes. One was [[Don Kessinger]], a shortstop who had his best years with the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. Kessinger served as a [[Player-coach|player-manager]] in 1979. Another was outfielder [[Ralph Garr]], who had his best seasons with the [[Atlanta Braves]]. A once-notable pitcher was [[Blue Moon Odom|John &quot;Blue Moon&quot; Odom]], a former [[Oakland Athletics]] star. On July 28, 1976 Odom combined with [[Francisco Barrios]] on a no-hitter against Oakland, which proved to be Odom's last major league victory. The Sox also brought in [[Clay Carroll]], a right-handed relief pitcher who was a key member of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] championship teams in the mid-1970s.

Since the Sox didn't have the revenue of the wealthier clubs, Veeck looked for any edge he could find. The club held open tryouts during spring training in 1978. They looked at pretty much anyone who showed up. Each player's name was sewn on his uniform, ostensibly to prove that the tryouts were legitimate and not just a stunt. This approach was the subject of an article in [[Sports Illustrated]]. The spring training tryout became a White Sox tradition that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/cws/ballpark/cws_ballpark_guide_dir.jsp#t MLB.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harold baines2001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harold Baines]], who hit 21 home runs with the White Sox, in 2001]]

Veeck began building a farm system that produced several noteworthy players including [[Harold Baines]] and [[Britt Burns]]. But Veeck could not compete in the free agent market or afford what he called &quot;the high price of mediocrity.&quot; By 1980, the White Sox were looking for new ownership. Veeck favored [[Ohio]] real estate tycoon [[Edward J. DeBartolo Sr.]], who tried to buy several teams and move them to [[New Orleans]]. DeBartolo pleaded to be allowed to buy the White Sox and he promised to keep the team in Chicago. Baseball commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] blocked the deal, because he thought DeBartolo would be bad for baseball.

Instead, Veeck sold the team to an ownership group headed by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and [[Eddie Einhorn]]. The new owners moved quickly to show that they were committed to winning by signing All-Star catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] from the Red Sox as well as power-hitting outfielder [[Greg Luzinski]] from the defending champion Phillies during the 1980&amp;ndash;81 offseason. They also retained the club's young, relatively unknown manager [[Tony La Russa]].

Perhaps to placate the fans, the owners launched a uniform design contest. The fans were given the opportunity to vote on the finalists. The winning design featured red, white, and blue with large bars.

In {{by|1983}}, the White Sox enjoyed their best success in a generation. After a mediocre first half, the White Sox decided that they needed speed at the top of the lineup. The Sox traded second baseman [[Tony Bernazard]] to the Mariners for [[Julio Cruz (baseball)|Julio Cruz]]. With Cruz's speed, they went 60&amp;ndash;25 to close out the season, clinching the AL West title, which earned Manager [[Tony La Russa]] his first Manager of the Year award.

[[Doug Rader]], then manager of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], derisively accused the team of &quot;winning ugly&quot; for their style of play, which reflected a tendency to win games through scrappy play rather than strong hitting or pitching. Rader also thought that if the White Sox played in the Eastern Division, they would finish 5th behind powerhouses such as Baltimore, New York, and Milwaukee. Chicago media and White Sox fans picked up on the phrase, and turned &quot;Winning Ugly&quot; into the team slogan. While they had a great run in the regular season, they were not able to carry that over into the postseason as they lost to a powerful [[1983 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] team 3 games to 1 in the [[1983 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]]. [[LaMarr Hoyt]] led the White Sox to a 2&amp;ndash;1 victory in Game 1, but the Orioles clinched the series with a 3-0 ten-inning victory in Game 4. White Sox pitcher Burns pitched a &quot;gutsy&quot; game, throwing 9⅓ shutout innings before a home run by [[Tito Landrum]] broke up the game and the hearts of the South Side faithful.

====1985&amp;ndash;89====
The club slid back into mediocrity for the rest of the 1980s, contending only in {{by|1985}}. Before the 1985 season began, the White Sox traded pitcher [[LaMarr Hoyt]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] in exchange for flashy shortstop [[Ozzie Guillén]]. Guillen would win the AL Rookie Of The Year award. In 1986, broadcaster-turned-general manager [[Ken Harrelson|Ken &quot;Hawk&quot; Harrelson]] fired La Russa after a poor start. The club wouldn't contend again until 1990, the final year in [[Comiskey Park|Old Comiskey Park]].

===1990s: &quot;Good Guys Wear Black&quot;===
====1990====
{{Main|1990 Chicago White Sox season}}
That season, most of their young talent blossomed. Closer [[Bobby Thigpen]] established a then record of 57 saves. In addition to that, first baseman [[Frank Thomas (AL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]], pitchers [[Alex Fernandez (baseball)|Alex Fernandez]] and [[Jack McDowell]], and third baseman [[Robin Ventura]] would make their presences felt on the South Side. The White Sox of {{by|1990}} won 94 games, but finished 9 games behind the powerful [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]].

On July 11, as part of the celebration of Comiskey Park, the White Sox played a Turn Back the Clock game against the [[1990 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]; the Brewers won 12&amp;ndash;9 in 13 innings after posting a 6-run rally in the 8th inning to tie the game. The White Sox wore their 1917 home uniforms. This was the first Turn Back the Clock game in the major leagues and started what has become a popular promotion. New Comiskey Park opened in 1991, and was completed at a cost of $167 million.

====1993====
{{Main|1993 Chicago White Sox season}}

The team reached the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in {{by|1993}}. The White Sox were led by Thomas, Ventura, multi-sport star [[Bo Jackson]], Cy Young Award winner McDowell and All-Star closer [[Roberto Hernández (baseball)|Roberto Hernández]] and won the last AL West before realignment with a 94&amp;ndash;68 record. However, the White Sox were a big disappointment in the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], losing to the defending World Champion [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] in six games. The Jays would go on to win the [[1993 World Series|World Series]] again in 1993.

====1994====
{{Main|1994 Chicago White Sox season}}

The White Sox led the new [[American League Central]] at the time of the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994 players' strike]].

===2000&amp;ndash;04===
====2000: The Kids Can Play====
{{Main|2000 Chicago White Sox season}}

Under Manager [[Jerry Manuel]], the White Sox fielded a talented but chronically under-achieving team. In {{by|2000}}, however, the White Sox had one of their best teams since the 1983 club. This team, whose slogan was &quot;The Kids Can Play,&quot; won 95 games en route to an AL Central division title. The team scored runs at a blistering pace, which enabled them to overcome the effects of a mediocre pitching staff, led by [[Mike Sirotka]] and [[James Baldwin (baseball)|James Baldwin]]. Frank Thomas nearly won his third MVP award with his offensive output; he was helped by good offensive years from [[Magglio Ordóñez]], [[Paul Konerko]], [[Carlos Lee]] and [[José Valentín]].

As in 1983 and 1993, the 2000 team could not carry its success over into the postseason, getting swept by the wild-card [[2000 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|Division Series]]. Despite new club records for hits (1,615), runs scored (978), RBI (926), home runs (216), and doubles (325), the White Sox hit only .185 in the ALDS and failed to score a run after the third inning in any of the three games.

====2003====
{{Main|2003 Chicago White Sox season}}

In [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]], Comiskey Park was re-named after cell phone company [[U.S. Cellular]] bought the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years. In 2003 The All Star game was held for the first time at their new park.

===2005: &quot;Win Or Die Trying&quot;===
[[File:Ozzie Guillén.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ozzie Guillén]]]]
{{Main|2005 Chicago White Sox season}}

The changes made an immediate impact on the team. In {{by|2005}}, the White Sox posted the best record in the major leagues for much of the year, before a late season slump saw the [[2005 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] overtake them (100 wins vs. 99 wins). Though a serious challenge for their dominance of the division was mounted late in the year by the [[2005 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] (the Tribe actually reduced what was once a 15 game lead for the White Sox down to 1½ games at one point only to lose the last 7 games), Chicago scored a 4&amp;ndash;2 victory over the [[2005 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] on September 29 to win their first AL Central Division title since 2000. Finishing at 99&amp;ndash;63 (.611) tied their 1983 record, and won the division by six games. The last time they had a higher percentage than that was 1920 , when they finished second in the league thanks to the late-season &quot;Black Sox&quot; suspensions. The combination of the league's best record with the American League victory in the All-Star Game gave the White Sox the home field advantage throughout the 2005 postseason (perhaps unnecessary as the White Sox won every post-season road game they played in 2005).

Among the other changes that occurred in 2005 (and still seen in 2006) was the creation of a new marketing campaign, referring to the team's new style of play. 2005 saw a much-reduced reliance on power hitting (even though the team still hit over 200 home runs on the season), and a move toward speed and defense. This culminated in what locally became known as &quot;Ozzieball&quot; or &quot;Grinderball&quot;. As part of the marketing campaign, the White Sox began inventing &quot;Grinder Rules&quot;, a list of fictitious &quot;rules&quot; created as a part of an advertising campaign, and a way of reminding fans about the changes to the team, and the success it was bringing. The first Grinder Rule became the team's motto for the 2005 season: &quot;Win or die trying!&quot;

The rules themselves are an &quot;incomplete&quot; list, as the numbers are somewhat random. They are collected from print, billboard, television, and radio advertisements, as well as advertising at [[U.S. Cellular Field]], where the White Sox play their home games.

====2005 ALDS====
In the [[2005 American League Division Series]] (ALDS), the White Sox took on the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], the 2005 AL [[Major League Baseball Wild Card|wild-card]] winners and the defending World Series champions. The White Sox defeated the Red Sox in a three-game sweep. They won the first two games (scoring a 14–2 victory in the first game &amp;ndash; their first postseason win at home since [[1959 World Series|1959]] &amp;ndash; and 5-4 in the second) of the series at home before claiming a 5&amp;ndash;3 victory at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]]. Scott Podsednik hit his first home run of the season in the first game of the series.

The ALDS also set the tone for what would be an unusually suspenseful post-season; while their first game was considered a blow-out, the remaining games saw the White Sox making the most of rare opportunities and hanging on to narrow leads. In the first inning of game 1, the White Sox put up 5 runs, and never looked back. A late inning three-run home run by [[Scott Podsednik]] - his first home run of the season, was the icing on the cake in the game 1 blowout. In Game 2, the White Sox were actually down 4&amp;ndash;2 when Red Sox second baseman [[Tony Graffanino]], formerly playing for the White Sox, let [[Juan Uribe]]'s potential inning-ending, double-play grounder go through his legs; one out later, [[Tadahito Iguchi]] hit a three-run homer to left that clinched the game for the White Sox. In Game 3, [[Orlando Hernández]] entered the game with the bases loaded and nobody out with the White Sox ahead by only one run in the bottom of the sixth inning. Based on their regular season performance, it was later calculated that the Red Sox's probability of winning at that point was .662, even though they were trailing by one run. Instead, the first two batters, [[Jason Varitek]] and [[Tony Graffanino]], both popped out, and [[Johnny Damon]] struck out swinging on a breaking ball. Hernandez went on to retire six of the next seven batters, and the White Sox's rookie reliever [[Bobby Jenks]] closed out the game.

====2005 ALCS====
The White Sox then moved on to face the [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in the [[2005 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The Angels won Game 1, 3&amp;ndash;2, The White Sox only post-season loss.

In Game 2 on October 12, the teams were involved in one of the most controversial endings in baseball playoff history. With the score tied 1-1 with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, A. J. Pierzynski apparently struck out to end the inning. At first Pierzynski headed back to the dugout but ran to first base upon realizing that umpire [[Doug Eddings]] had ruled that Angels catcher [[Josh Paul]] (a former White Sox player) did not field the ball cleanly, meaning he would have to either tag the batter or throw to the first baseman to record the out (see [[uncaught third strike]]). Despite vehement protests from various members of the Angels, including manager [[Mike Scioscia]], Pierzynski was awarded first base. Pinch-runner [[Pablo Ozuna]] replaced Pierzynski and stole second base. Third baseman [[Joe Crede]] then delivered a double on the third pitch to give the White Sox a 2&amp;ndash;1 win. Overshadowed by that play was the 1-run, 5-hit complete game pitched by [[Mark Buehrle]]. Buehrle's excellent effort allowed the White Sox to capture their first-ever home victory in ALCS history.

Buoyed by their win, the White Sox traveled to [[Anaheim, California]], where starters [[Jon Garland]], [[Freddy García]], and [[José Contreras]] (who had dropped Game 1 to the Angels in Chicago) pitched three more complete game victories consecutively over the Angels, giving the White Sox their first American League pennant since 1959. White Sox slugger [[Paul Konerko]] was named the ALCS MVP, on the strength of his two home runs, 7 RBI, and .286 average.

Especially in light of the evolution of the game, the White Sox four straight complete games was considered an unbelievable achievement. In fact, since José Contreras pitched 8⅓ innings in game 1, the White Sox bullpen saw a total of ⅔ of an inning pitched (by Neal Cotts) in the entire series. The last time four consecutive complete games had been pitched in a championship series was in the [[1956 World Series]] between the [[1956 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[1928 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], and the [[1928 World Series|1928 Yankees]] were the last team to win four consecutive complete games in a championship series. In fact, the last time any major league pitching staff had hurled four straight complete game victories was near the end of the [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983 regular season]], when the [[1983 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] accomplished the feat.

====2005 World Series====
The White Sox now advanced to the [[2005 World Series|World Series]], where they would take on the National League champion [[2005 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. The White Sox' appearance in the World Series was bittersweet for longtime franchise star [[Frank Thomas (AL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]]. One of the most popular and productive players in the franchise's long history, Thomas would finally be going to a World Series in his 16th major league season. However, due to injury, Thomas would be unable to participate except as an observer, and his contributions to the White Sox in 2005 were limited.

[[Image:WhiteSoxChampionsPlaza2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Champions Plaza, U.S. Cellular Field - Chicago, Illinois]]
[[File:Chicago3 SvG.jpg|right|thumb|Chicago skyline during the World Series supporting the White Sox]]
Game 1 saw Astros' ace [[Roger Clemens]] leave the game with a hamstring injury,leaving [[Jose Contreras]] to finish up the Astros and Chicago took advantage of its opponents' weakness, winning 5&amp;ndash;3. [[Joe Crede]] especially made an impressive showing with his stellar defensive plays at third base.

Game 2 of the Series, as in the ALCS, saw the White Sox again involved in a controversial play. With the White Sox down 4-2 in the seventh with two outs and two runners on base, the home plate umpire ruled that [[Jermaine Dye]] had been hit by a pitch, while the Astros argued (and TV replays confirmed) that the ball had actually hit the bat. Dye was given a free pass to first, and the next batter, Paul Konerko, launched a home run into left field to give Chicago a 6&amp;ndash;4 lead. Houston tied the game on a two-run single with two outs in the top of the ninth, but in the bottom of the ninth, [[Scott Podsednik]] hit a walk-off solo home run off [[Brad Lidge]] to give the White Sox a thrilling 7&amp;ndash;6 victory and a 2&amp;ndash;0 lead in the Series. Podsednik was the first player in major league history to hit a home run in the World Series after not having hit any during the regular season. (He did, however, have a home run in Game 1 of the ALDS against Boston, making the World Series home run his second of the playoffs.)

The World Series then shifted to Houston for Game 3, in which Astros' starter and NLCS MVP [[Roy Oswalt]] cruised with a 4&amp;ndash;0 lead until the wheels totally came off for him with a five-run fifth by the White Sox. The Astros managed to tie the game in the eighth, but repeatedly blew scoring opportunities in the next few innings. Finally, in the top of the 14th, former (and current) Astro [[Geoff Blum]] hit a tie-breaking home run; the White Sox took a commanding 3&amp;ndash;0 Series lead with a 7&amp;ndash;5 victory in the longest World Series game in history (in terms of time; tied for most innings). [[Ozzie Guillén]] sent [[Mark Buehrle]] in to get the last out in the bottom of the 14th to get the save after he had started Game 2, and later remarked that he was set to send [[Pablo Ozuna]] (a position player) in to pitch if the Astros somehow extended the game.

Game 4 was a pitcher's duel between [[Freddy García]] and [[Brandon Backe]]. The game was scoreless until [[Jermaine Dye]] singled to center off of Brad Lidge, driving in [[Willie Harris]] for what turned out to be the winning run. This was the second game of the series in which Lidge had given up the game winning run (Podesednik's home run in Game 2). Game 4 also saw a spectacular defensive play by [[Juan Uribe]], as the Chicago shortstop fell two rows into the stands in order to retire [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]] for the second out in the bottom of the ninth. Uribe also earned the assist in the final out of the Series on the next play, as he narrowly threw [[Orlando Palmeiro]] out at first to give the White Sox their first World Series crown since [[1917 World Series|1917]]. Dye was named the [[World Series MVP Award|World Series MVP]] in the four-game sweep.[[Image:Chicago White Sox World Series.jpg|thumb|The White Sox' [[World Series Trophy]] on display at U.S. Cellular Field during the 2006 season]]

Only the [[1927 New York Yankees season|1927 Yankees]] and the [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|1984 Detroit Tigers]] were able to achieve such a feat. Their 11&amp;ndash;1 postseason record was tied with [[1999 New York Yankees season|1999 Yankees]] as the best single post season mark. (Only [[1976 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]] had a better winning percentage by going 7&amp;ndash;0.) Also, their 8 game winning streak (the four wins over the Angels and the sweep against the Astros) is tied with the Boston Red Sox (who won 8 games in a row en route to their 2004 World Series championship) for the longest postseason winning streak in Major League History. The White Sox also became the only team to win all three post-season victories on the road. Amazingly, despite their 105 year history, this was only the franchise's third World Series championship, (following victories in 1917 and 1906). It also marked their first pennant since the advent of divisional play in 1969 (the White Sox won the inaugural American League pennant in 1901, but this was 2 years prior to the first modern World Series).

===2006&amp;ndash;present: Post-World Series===
====2006 season====
[[File:Jim Thome 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jim Thome]]]]
{{Main|2006 Chicago White Sox season}}

After leading the wild card race for much of the season, the White Sox faltered, losing 15 of 24 at the beginning of September to eliminate them from playoff contention, ending their chances of becoming the first repeat winner of the World Series since the New York Yankees in 1999 and 2000. They nonetheless finished with a 90&amp;ndash;72 record, the season's best record by a non-playoff team.

Despite missing the playoffs, the team enjoyed numerous successes during the year. Following the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] weekend, the White Sox won both crosstown [[interleague play|interleague]] series against the rival [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]], taking the first two games of each series at U.S. Cellular Field and [[Wrigley Field]]. The White Sox finished interleague play with a record of 14&amp;ndash;4, including a 7&amp;ndash;2 mark in National League parks.

This was the first year a White Sox manager had led the AL All-Star squad since 1994, when Gene Lamont led the team. In addition to manager Ozzie Guillén, the White Sox had six representatives at the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|77th All-Star Game]] at [[PNC Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the most among any club: starting pitcher [[Mark Buehrle]], closer [[Bobby Jenks]], catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]], first basemen [[Paul Konerko]] and [[Jim Thome]], and right fielder [[Jermaine Dye]]. [[José Contreras]] was originally selected to pitch in the All-Star Game, but was replaced by [[Francisco Liriano]]. Guillen removed Contreras from the roster after a 117-pitch performance in a 19-inning game against Boston on the last day before the All-Star Break. As a result of Contreras not pitching during the break, he would set an unusual modern-day mark in Major League Baseball by starting two consecutive games.

Pierzynski was the last White Sox to be named to the team after winning the year's [[All-Star Final Vote|Final Vote]], in which the fans select the 32nd and final player on both the AL and NL squads. Pierzynski is the second White Sox to be selected, following [[Scott Podsednik]]'s nomination in 2005. Dye competed in the 2006 CENTURY 21 [[Home Run Derby]]; he managed to hit 7 home runs in the first round, but [[David Ortiz]] and [[Ryan Howard]] both surpassed that total to knock Dye out of the competition. Dye was only the fourth White Sox to compete in the Derby, joining Carlton Fisk (1985), Konerko (2002), and Frank Thomas (1994, 1995).

The White Sox drew 2,957,414 fans for an average of 36,511, third in the AL. There were a total of 52 sellouts, breaking the previous team record of 18. The White Sox also drew 75 crowds in excess of 30,000, another franchise record. The White Sox had just one game with a crowd below 25,000: April 18 against the [[2006 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]]. On August 9 against the [[2006 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], the White Sox surpassed 2 million fans for the eighth time in franchise history and for the second consecutive year (1983, 1984, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 2005). Also, on August 30 versus the [[2006 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], the team surpassed 2.5 million fans for the first time since 1993, and for only the fourth time in franchise history: 1991, 1992, and 1993. It is their 25th consecutive one million-plus attendance season and 46th overall.

====2007 season====
{{Main|2007 Chicago White Sox season}}

During Spring Training, [[Toby Hall]] dislocated his shoulder while trying to make a diving play at first base. This presented a problem as Hall was the backup to [[A. J. Pierzynski]], and now would be out for an indeterminate amount of time. As a result of the injury, the White Sox were forced to bring up catching prospect [[Gustavo Molina]].

There was a competition for the fifth starter's role between newly acquired rookies [[Gavin Floyd]] and [[John Danks]]. Danks would ultimately win the role with a good spring showing.

At the conclusion of [[spring training]], the White Sox opened the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]] at home against the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. [[José Contreras]] would start the opener, marking the first time since 2001 that [[Mark Buehrle]] did not pitch the season opener. Contreras would be ineffective, giving up 8 runs (7 earned) on 7 hits over 1-plus innings in an eventual 12&amp;ndash;5 loss.

On April 15, White Sox pitching held the Cleveland Indians to two unearned runs and a hit, but the White Sox would lose 2&amp;ndash;1, raising concerns about the usually potent offense. [[Scott Podsednik]], the White Sox' best hitter with a .303 average, would be placed on the disabled list with an adductor pull, compounding the White Sox' offensive woes.

On April 18, Buehrle pitched a [[no-hitter]] against the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], 6&amp;ndash;0. Buehrle's only blemish was a walk to [[Sammy Sosa]] in the fifth, but Buehrle would promptly pick Sosa off during the next at-bat. Buehrle secured his spot in the MLB record books when he forced Rangers catcher [[Gerald Laird]] to ground out to third baseman [[Joe Crede]] at 9:14 P.M. CDT, sending the crowd of 25,390 at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] into a frenzy. He would face the minimum of 27 batters using 106 pitches (66 strikes), with the one walk to Sosa and eight strikeouts. This was the first no-hitter by a White Sox pitcher since [[Wilson Alvarez]] did it against the [[1991 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] on August 11, {{by|1991}}, the first no-hitter at home since [[Joel Horlen]]'s no-hitter on September 10, {{by|1967}}, and the first no-hitter in the [[American League]] since April 27, {{by|2002}}, when then-[[Boston Red Sox]] starter [[Derek Lowe]] no-hit the [[2002 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] 10&amp;ndash;0. [[Jermaine Dye]] hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and [[Jim Thome]] added two solo homers in the history-making night.

On July 6, the White Sox announced the signing of Mark Buehrle to a contract extension worth $56 million over four years. The move came after weeks of rumors of Buehrle possibly being traded.

Overall, the White Sox season was hampered by injuries and a team-wide hitting slump. However, the season was not a complete failure with Mark Buehrle's no hitter, Jim Thome's 500th home run, and closer [[Bobby Jenks]] 41 consecutive batters retired (tying Jim Barr's all-time record and breaking the American League record.) Jenks would later fall short of the all time record when Kansas City Royal's player [[Joey Gathright]] slapped a ground ball into left field just out of the reaches of third baseman [[Josh Fields (infielder)|Josh Fields]] and shortstop [[Juan Uribe]].

The White Sox finished the season fourth in their division with a 72&amp;ndash;90 record, behind the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], and [[2007 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].

====2008 Season: Central Champs Again and a &quot;Blackout Game&quot;====
{{Main|2008 Chicago White Sox season}}

On July 31, the day of the trade deadline, the White Sox traded relief pitcher [[Nick Masset]] and minor leaguer 2nd Baseman [[Danny Richar]] for [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.local12.com/content/breaking_news/story.aspx?content_id=b91cb11a-b7f2-4c06-a821-3a0ede26aa07 Local112.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, [[Jim Thome]], [[Paul Konerko]], [[Alexei Ramirez]], and [[Juan Uribe]] combined to hit four consecutive home runs, something that has only been done six other times in the history of [[Major League Baseball]].
On September 29, 2008, Ramirez hit his fourth grand slam of the season, setting a major-league single-season record for a rookie, off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Gary Glover in an 8&amp;ndash;2 White Sox victory to qualify the [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] for a [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] against the [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] for the AL Central title. This also broke the team record for most grand slams in a single season.

[[Image:2008 MLB AL Central Tiebreaker Celebration.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Chicago White Sox celebrate after winning a tiebreaker game against the Minnesota Twins on September 30th, 2008]]

On September 30, 2008, the White Sox won a tiebreaker 1&amp;ndash;0 against the Minnesota Twins for the American League playoff spot after a diving catch from [[Brian Anderson (outfielder)|Brian Anderson]]. A game saving throw to home plate from center-fielder Ken Griffey Jr. to catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]] on a flyout to keep [[Michael Cuddyer]] from scoring would keep the Twins scoreless through the top of the 5th inning. [[John Danks]] pitched on only three days rest and threw 103 pitches for 2 hits and no runs in eight innings.  [[Bobby Jenks]] would close the game with a perfect 9th. The only run of the game came from a [[Jim Thome]] home run, the 541st of his career.  This was the lowest scoring tiebreaker game in MLB history.  The White Sox are also the only team in MLB history to beat three different teams on three consecutive days: the [[2008 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], [[2008 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], and Minnesota Twins.  They lost to the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2008 American League Division Series|ALDS]], 3 games to 1.

{{Main|2009 Chicago White Sox season}}

During the 2009 offseason the White Sox declined a team option for [[Ken Griffey Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Griffey Jr.#2008 season|Ken Griffey Jr. - 2008 season]]&lt;/ref&gt; The White Sox also let [[Joe Crede]] become a free agent, who went on to sign with the [[Minnesota Twins]], and signed closer [[Bobby Jenks]] to a one-year contract, avoiding arbitration.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicago.whitesox.mlb.com&quot;&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/team/transactions.jsp?c_id=cws&amp;year=2009&amp;month=1 MLB.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Pitcher [[Bartolo Colon]] was signed as a [[free agent]] on January 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicago.whitesox.mlb.com&quot;/&gt; [[Javier Vazquez]] and [[Boone Logan]] were traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for prospects [[Tyler Flowers]], [[Brent Lillibridge]], Jon Gilmore and Santo Rodriguez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/index.jsp?c_id=cws MLB.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, [[Scott Podsednik]] returned to the White Sox on a Minor League deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transactions&quot;/&gt; He was called up to Chicago on May 1&lt;ref name=&quot;Transactions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/team/transactions.jsp?c_id=cws&amp;year=2009&amp;month=5#month=5&amp;year=2009&amp;team_id=145|title=Transactions|work=WhiteSox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved back into the leadoff spot in the lineup.

On May 21, the White Sox gave the San Diego Padres a trade proposition for [[Jake Peavy]]. According to the Padres, everything was agreed upon, but Peavy had a no-trade clause and denied this trade.

On May 30, the White Sox traded 2005 number one draft pick (fifteenth overall), pitcher [[Lance Broadway]], to the [[New York Mets]] in exchange for catcher [[Ramon Castro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Transactions&quot;/&gt;

On June 4, the White Sox called up 2008 number one draft pick (eighth overall), shortstop [[Gordon Beckham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Transactions&quot;/&gt; It took Beckham only 364 days to reach the Major Leagues, as he was drafted on June 5, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090604&amp;content_id=5136822&amp;vkey=news_cws&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cws MLB.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, the White Sox called up another number one draft pick (2007, 25th overall), left-handed pitcher [[Aaron Poreda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Transactions&quot;/&gt;

On July 23, White Sox pitcher [[Mark Buehrle]] threw a [[perfect game]] against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. It was his second career no-hitter, both with the White Sox, and the second perfect game in team history. After the game, Buehrle was in the middle of his press conference with the media when he received a phone call from [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] to congratulate him. It was the second time in two weeks that [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] and Buehrle had contact, with the first being at the 2009 All-Star game in St. Louis, MO.

On July 28 Mark Buehrle established a new major league baseball record, by retiring Minnesota Twin (And former teammate) [[Joe Crede]], Buehrle retired his 42nd consecutive batter, breaking the record held by teammate [[Bobby Jenks]], and [[Jim Barr]], Buehrle would retire three more batters. He holds the all time record now at 45.

On July 31, the White Sox traded 2007 number one draft pick (twenty fifth overall), pitcher [[Aaron Poreda]], [[Clayton Richard]], [[Adam Russell]] and [[Dexter Carter]] in exchange for [[Jake Peavy]].

On August 10, the White Sox claimed OF [[Alex Rios]] off waivers from the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]

On August 31, [[Jim Thome]] waived his no-trade clause, allowing the White Sox to trade him to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], and pick up center fielder Justin Fuller.  The White Sox also trade [[Jose Contreras]] to the [[Colorado Rockies]], in exchange for [[Brandon Hynick]], a 24 year-old right-handed starter.

On September 16, the White Sox released RHP [[Bartolo Colon]]

====2010 season====
{{Main|2010 Chicago White Sox season}}

During the offseason on November 6, the White Sox traded [[Josh Fields (infielder)|Josh Fields]] and [[Chris Getz]] to the [[Kansas City Royals]] for [[Mark Teahen]]. On November 6, the White Sox declined Jermaine Dye's 2010 Contract. On January 26, 2010, the White Sox had an opportunity to get [[Jim Thome]] back by signing a one-year deal with him, but passed, allowing him to then sign a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Thome had expressed interested in returning to Chicago, but White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen told Thome he wouldn't get enough at-bats to justify a return.

On the [[Opening Day]], the White Sox shutout the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] 6–0. On that day, [[Mark Buehrle]]  made an astounding play when he hurried and picked up a ball with his glove in foul territory and quickly underthrew backwards with his glove to [[Paul Konerko]], who caught the ball with his bare hand to force out [[Lou Marson]] in the fifth inning for the second out. [[Paul Konerko]] broke the franchise record for most home runs hit during the month of April with 11.

On May 11, the Sox opened the two-game series at the new [[Target Field]] and took the victory 5–2 over [[Minnesota Twins|Minnesota]], but the next day lost 3–2.

On June 13 against the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] at [[Wrigley Field]], [[Gavin Floyd]] pitched a no-hitter through 6.2 innings before allowing a double to [[Alfonso Soriano]] and then the next batter scored Soriano by [[Chad Tracy]]'s RBI single. The opposing pitcher [[Ted Lilly]] didn't allow a hit through 8+ innings before allowing a single to [[Juan Pierre]]. Later that inning, the bases were loaded, so it would have golden opportunities for Sox to score some runs, but failed. The Sox failed to sweep the Cubs as they lose 1–0 with one hit for Sox and three hits for Cubs. From June 12–20, they went eight straight games without hitting home runs, their longest since 1989, which they went nine straight homerless games. However, during their homerless streak, the Sox went 7–1, thanks to their starting pitching. During their span, the Sox have won six straight without hitting home runs for the first time since 1942. They have won eleven in a row for the first time since June 1961, which they have won twelve in a row.

On July 5–8, the Sox got their four-game sweep over the [[Los Angeles Angels]] for the first time since 1983. On July 11 against the [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Andruw Jones]]  hit his 400th career home run in third inning, 46th player in major league history to accomplish this feat. Also the Sox hit five home runs in the game, including four in third inning, tying their franchise history, including two back-to-backs. The Sox swept the Royals with a 15−5 victory and finished with a perfect homestand 7–0. From June 8 until the All-Star break, the Sox were 25–5, their best in MLB. On June 8, the Sox were 24–33 and 9½ games out of the first place. Just 40 days later, the Sox were 50–41 and were in first place by 1½ games over the [[Detroit Tigers]]. On July 18 against the [[Minnesota Twins]] at [[Target Field]], the Sox led 6–3 going into the bottom of the ninth inning. Then the Twins scored four runs without getting anybody out and suffering Sox their first walk-off loss of the season. On July 23, [[Mark Buehrle]] celebrated one-year anniversary of his perfect game by taking a complete game victory over the [[Oakland Athletics]] in Oakland. He allowed 1 earned run, 4 hits, 0 walk and 2 strikeouts. From July 26–29, the Sox swept the four-game series over the Seattle Mariners for the first time since 1994 and finished the season series versus the Mariners 9–1 and outscoring them 52–21.

On August 3, the Sox played a split doubleheader at [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]], which the Sox won 12–2 in afternoon game and lost 7–1 in night game. The afternoon game was a made-up game from May 17. The next day, [[Edwin Jackson]] made his White Sox debut against his former teammate, which he went 7.0 IP, 9 H, ER, BB, 6 K. Jackson got his first win with the White Sox since moving from [[Arizona Diamondbacks|Arizona]] against [[Armando Galarraga]], whose perfect game was lost by the blown call by an umpire on June 2. Jackson threw a no-hitter against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] in [[St. Pete|St. Petersburg, Florida]] on June 25. After that game, the Sox were 37–13 (.740) over their last 50 games since June 8, best record in MLB during that span. From August 10–12, the Sox lost the series against the Twins and fell to 2nd place in the [[AL Central]] one game back. Also the Sox lost the series at home for the first time since June 4–6 against the Indians, snapping their 7 straight home series wins. During the span of time between series losses at home, the Sox were 20–3 while the Sox swept four opponents. From August 17–19, the Sox played a big series against the rival Twins at Target Field when the Sox were three games behind the first place Twins prior to the first game. In the first game, the former White Sox teammate [[Jim Thome]] hit a walk-off two-run homer off of [[Matt Thornton]] in the tenth inning to down the White Sox 7–6. In the second game, the Twins beat the Sox again 7–6. And then in the third game, the Sox blew out the Twins 11–0 to avoid sweep. The Sox snapped their Twins 9-game home winning streak and they snapped their 5-game losing streak at [[Target Field]]. On August 29, The White Sox hosted [[Frank Thomas (baseball, born 1968)|Frank Thomas]] day at [[U.S. Cellular field]] against the [[New York Yankees]]. Frank Thomas's Jersey was retired that day. The White Sox Organization also printed his face on the legendary wall in Left-Center field with other number retirees [[Billy Pierce]] to his left and [[Carlton Fisk]] to his right.  Thomas's image also appears under the printed words 'The Catch,' commemorating [[DeWayne Wise|DeWayne Wise's]] catch to preserve [[Mark Buehrle's perfect game]] in 2009. On August 30, Chicago acquired [[Manny Ramírez]] off waivers from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

On September 3, the game in [[Boston Red Sox|Boston]] was postponed due to [[Hurricane Earl]]. On September 4, the White Sox swept the doubleheader at Red Sox with identical scores 3–1 with both saves from [[Bobby Jenks]]. It is the first time the White Sox swept the doubleheader in [[Boston]] since 1991. Then on September 5, the White Sox swept the Red Sox at [[Fenway Park]] for their first time since July 27–28, 1991 when the Sox came back with four runs in the top of the ninth inning to take a 7–5 lead, all with two outs. Also, [[Manny Ramírez]] faced his former team, against which he went 3–8 combined in this series. On September 12, [[Paul Konerko]] hit two two-run homers and five RBIs, recording his fourth career 30 homer/100 RBI season. From September 14–16, the Sox got swept by Twins at home, losing 9 of their last 11 home games against these Twins. With that sweep, the Sox fell to nine games back and Twins outscored the Sox 26–11. Then the next series against the Tigers at home, the Sox got swept again. The Sox got swept by Tigers at home for the first time since 2001. Then the Sox swept the Angels in [[Los Angeles Angels|Los Angeles]] for the first time since April 2006. In this series, the Sox outscored the Angels 12–6 and finished the season series against the Angels 7–2 and won seven in a row against them. They finished the season road record 43–38 (4th best in AL, 3rd best since 1999), better than last year's 36–45. In this season, the Sox swept five opponents on the road compared to two last season, four of them are the losing teams. On September 28 against the Boston Red Sox, [[Dayán Viciedo]] gave the White Sox their first walk-off hit since April 24, winning it 5–4, which came back from a 3–0 deficit. It is only the third walk-off win this season which trails the majors against seven walk-off losses, all since the All-Star break.

==U.S. Cellular Field==
{{Main|U.S. Cellular Field}}

In the late 1980s, the franchise threatened to relocate to [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]] (as did the [[San Francisco Giants]]), but frantic{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} lobbying on the part of the Illinois governor and state legislature resulted in approval (by one vote) of public funding for a new stadium. Although designed primarily as a baseball stadium (as opposed to a &quot;multipurpose&quot; stadium) New Comiskey Park (redubbed [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in 2003) was built in a 1960s style similar to [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Kauffman Stadium]]. It opened in {{by|1991}} to positive reviews; many praised its wide open concourses, excellent sight lines, and natural grass (unlike other stadiums of the era such as [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto). However, it was quickly overshadowed in the public imagination by the wave of &quot;nostalgia&quot; or &quot;retro&quot; ballparks, beginning with [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]. The park's inaugural season drew 2,934,154 fans - at the time, an all-time attendance record for any Chicago baseball team.

[[Image:Uscellular.jpg|thumb|350px|View from the upper deck of U.S. Cellular Field in 2006]]
Despite a number of innovations in its original construction - including a lower deck concourse that circumscribes the entire stadium, allowing a view of the game from any location - the park was often criticized for its sterile appearance and steep upper deck.

In recent years, money accrued from the sale of naming rights to [[U.S. Cellular]] has been allocated for renovations to make the park more aesthetically appealing and fan friendly. Notable renovations of early phases included: re-orientation of the bullpens parallel to the field of play (thus decreasing slightly the formerly symmetrical dimensions of the outfield); filling seats in up to and shortening the outfield wall; ballooning foul-line seat sections out toward the field of play; creating a new multi-tiered [[batter's eye]], allowing fans to see out through one-way screens from the center-field vantage point, and complete with concession stand and bar-style seating on its 'fan deck'; renovating all concourse areas with brick, historic murals, and new concession stand ornaments to establish a more friendly feel. The stadium's steel and concrete was repainted dark gray and black. The scoreboard Jumbotron was also replaced with a new [[Mitsubishi]] Diamondvision [[High-definition television|HDTV]] giant screen.

More recently, the top quarter of the upper deck was removed in {{by|2004}} and a black wrought metal roof was placed over it, covering all but the first eight rows of seats. This decreased seating capacity from 47,098 to 40,615. 2005 also saw the introduction of the Scout Seats, redesignating (and re-upholstering) 200 lower deck seats behind home plate as an exclusive area, with seat-side waitstaff and a complete restaurant located underneath the concourse. The most significant structural addition besides the new roof was {{by|2005}}'s FUNdamentals Deck, a multi-tiered structure on the left field concourse containing batting cages, a small [[Tee Ball]] field, speed pitch, and several other child-themed activities intended to entertain and educate young fans with the help of coaching staff from the Chicago Bulls/Sox Training Academy. This structure was used during the 2005 playoffs by [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] as a broadcasting platform.

Designed as a 7-phase plan, the renovations were completed before the {{by|2007}} season with the 7th and final phase. The most visible renovation in this final phase was replacing the original blue seats with green seats. The upper deck already had new green seats, put in before the beginning of the 2006 season. Beginning with the {{by|2007}} season a new luxury seating section was added in the former press box. This section has amenities similar to those of the Scout Seats section. After the 2007 season the ballpark continued renovation projects despite that the 7-phase plan was complete.

==History of White Sox uniforms==
:''See also: [[Major League Baseball#MLB uniforms]] (including image of baseball-cap logos of the 30 MLB franchises)''
Over the years the White Sox have become noted for many of their [[baseball uniform|uniform]] innovations and changes. In 1960, the White Sox became the first team in the major sports to put players' last names on [[jersey (clothing)#In sports|jerseys]].

[[Image:Im cws logo 1912.png|frame|1912-1917, 1919-1929, 1931, and 1936-1938 Chicago White Sox logo]]

In 1912, however, the White Sox debuted one of the most enduring and famous [[logo]]s in baseball—a large &quot;S&quot; in a Roman-style [[font]], with a small &quot;O&quot; inside the top loop of the &quot;S&quot; and a small &quot;X&quot; inside the bottom loop. This is the logo associated with the 1917 World Series championship team and the 1919 Black Sox. With a couple of brief interruptions, the dark-blue logo with the large &quot;S&quot; lasted through 1938 (but continued in a modified block style into the '40s). Through the 1940s, the White Sox team colors were primarily navy blue trimmed with red.

The White Sox logo in the '50s and '60s (actually beginning in the 1949 season) was the word &quot;SOX&quot; in an Old English font, diagonally arranged, with the &quot;S&quot; larger than the other two letters. From 1949 through 1963, the primary color was black (trimmed with red after 1951). The Old English &quot;SOX&quot; in black lettering is the logo associated with the Go-Go Sox era.

In 1964, the primary color went back to navy blue, and the road uniforms changed from gray to pale blue. In 1971, the team's primary color changed from royal blue to red, with the color of their [[pin stripes|pinstripes]] and [[baseball cap|caps]] changing to red. The 1971-1975 uniform included red [[baseball uniform#Stockings and pants|socks]].

[[Image:White Sox old logo.png‎|frame|Chicago White Sox logo from 1976 to 1987]]

In 1976 the team's uniforms changed again. The team's primary color changed back from red to navy. The team based their uniforms on a style worn in the early days of the franchise, with white jerseys worn at home, blue on the [[road (sports)|road]]. The team brought back white socks for the last time in team history. The socks featured a different stripe pattern every year. The team also had the option to wear blue or white pants with either jersey. Additionally the teams &quot;SOX&quot; logo was changed to a modern-looking &quot;SOX&quot; in a bold font, with 'CHICAGO' written across the jersey. Finally, the team's logo featured a [[silhouette]] of a batter over the words &quot;SOX&quot;.

The new uniforms also featured [[collar (clothing)|collars]] and were designed to be worn untucked — both unprecedented. Yet by far the most unusual wrinkle was the option to wear shorts, which the White Sox did for the first game of a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[Kansas City Royals]] in 1976. The [[Hollywood Stars]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] had tried the same concept at one time, and it was also poorly received. Apart from aesthetic issues, as a practical matter shorts are not conducive to sliding, due to the likelihood of significant abrasions.

Upon taking over the team in 1980 new owners [[Eddie Einhorn]] and [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] announced a contest where fans were invited to create new uniforms for the White Sox. The winning entry was submitted by a fan where the word &quot;SOX&quot; was written across the front of the jersey, in the same font as a cap, inside of a large blue stripe trimmed with red. The red and blue stripes were also on the sleeves, and the road jerseys were gray to the home whites. It was in those jerseys that the White Sox won 99 games and the AL West championship in 1983, the best record in the majors.

[[Image:White Sox Alt Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Alternate logo, introduced in 1990]]

After five years those uniforms were retired and replaced with a more basic uniform which had &quot;White Sox&quot; written across the front in script, with &quot;Chicago&quot; on the front of the road jersey. The cap logo was also changed to a cursive &quot;C&quot;, although the batter logo was retained for several years.

For a mid-season 1990 game at Comiskey Park the White Sox appeared one time in a uniform based on that of the 1917 White Sox.

The White Sox then switched their regular uniform style one more time. In September, for the final series at Old Comiskey Park, the old English &quot;SOX&quot; logo (a slightly simplified version of the 1949-63 logo) was restored, and the new uniform also had the black pinstripes restored. The team's primary color changed back to black—this time with silver trim. With minor modifications (i.e., occasionally wearing vests, black game jerseys) the White Sox have used this style ever since.

==Spring training history==
The White Sox have held spring training in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]] (1901–1902); Mobile (1903); Marlin Springs, Texas (1904); New Orleans, Louisiana (1905–1906); [[Mexico City]] (1907); Los Angeles (1908); San Francisco (1909–1910); [[Mineral Wells, Texas]] (1911, 1916–1919); [[Waco, Texas]] (1912, 1920); [[Paso Robles, California]] (1913–1915); [[Waxahachie, Texas]] (1921); [[Seguin, Texas]] (1922–1923); [[Winter Haven, Florida]]. (1924); [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] (1925–1928); [[Dallas, Texas]] (1929); [[San Antonio, Texas]] (1930–1932); [[Pasadena, California]] (1933–1942, 1946–1950); [[French Lick, Indiana]] (1943–1944); [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] (1945); [[Palm Springs, California]] (1951); [[El Centro, California]] (1952–1953); Tampa (1954–1959); and Sarasota (1960–1997). (1998–2007) the White Sox and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] shared [[Tucson Electric Park]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] for Spring Training in the [[Cactus League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springtrainingonline.com/teams/chicago_white_sox.htm Spring Training History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2007, the cities of [[Glendale, Arizona]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona]] broke ground on the Cactus League’s newest Spring Training facility. [[Camelback Ranch]], the $76 million two-team facility will be the new home of both the White Sox and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for their Spring Training programs. Aside from [[state-of-the-art]] baseball facilities at the 10,000-seat stadium the location includes residential, restaurant and retail development, a 4-star hotel and 18-hole [[golf course]]. Other amenities include {{convert|118000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of Major and minor league clubhouses for the two teams, four Major League practice fields and eight minor league practice fields, two practice infields and parking to accommodate 5,000 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glendaleaz.com/news/062607_baseball.cfm Let's Play Ball!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries and fan base==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
{{Original research|section|date=August 2008}}

===Crosstown Classic===
[[File:West Side Grounds 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Fielder Jones of the White Sox hits the ball against Cubs at West Side Grounds, 1905]]
{{Main|White Sox – Cubs rivalry}}
The [[Chicago Cubs]] are the [[White Sox – Cubs rivalry|crosstown rivals]] of the White Sox, a rivalry that some made fun of prior to the White Sox's 2005 title because both of them had extremely long championship droughts. The nature of the rivalry is unique; with the exception of the [[1906 World Series]], in which the White Sox upset the favored Cubs, the teams never met in an official game until {{by|1997}}, when interleague play was introduced. In the intervening time, the two teams sometimes met for exhibition games. An example of this volatile rivalry is the game played between the White Sox and the [[Chicago Cubs]] at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] on May 20, {{by|2006}}. White Sox catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]] was running home on a sacrifice fly by center fielder [[Brian Anderson (outfielder)|Brian Anderson]] and smashed into Cubs catcher [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]], who was blocking home plate. Pierzynski lost his helmet in the collision, and slapped the plate as he rose. Barrett stopped him and, after exchanging a few words, punched Pierzynski in the face, causing a melee to ensue. Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman [[John Mabry]] got involved in a separate confrontation, although it was later determined that Mabry was attempting to be a peacemaker. After ten minutes of conferring following the fight, the umpires ejected Pierzynski, Barrett, Anderson, and Mabry. As Pierzynski entered his dugout, he pumped his arms, causing the soldout crowd at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] to erupt in cheers. When play resumed, White Sox second baseman [[Tadahito Iguchi]] blasted a grand slam to put the White Sox up 5-0 on their way to a 7-0 win over their crosstown rivals. While there are other major league cities and metropolitan areas in which two teams co-exist, all of the others feature at least one team which began playing there in {{by|1961}} or later, whereas the White Sox and Cubs have been competing for their city's fans since 1901.

===Divisional===
The White Sox enjoy healthy divisional rivalries. The [[Detroit Tigers]] are led by former White Sox player [[Magglio Ordóñez]], and the cities of Chicago and Detroit share rivalries in other sports as well. {{see|Bulls–Pistons rivalry}}

The [[Minnesota Twins]] are high profile rivals as well, with fans of both teams showing up to US Cellular Field in healthy numbers. Chicago has another big rivalry with the [[Cleveland Indians]] who always enjoy a large away contingent at U.S. Cellular Field. The rivalry first started upon the creation of the AL Central in 1994. On July 15, 1994 an umpire confiscated [[Albert Belle]]'s bat, presuming that it was corked. They put it in the umpire's room at Comiskey Park. However, Indians pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] climbed through the ceiling from the visitor's clubhouse and stole the bat. The theft was discovered and Belle was suspended; Grimsley later owed up to the theft. Belle further inflamed matters by spurning the Indians and signing a large free agent contract with the White Sox in 1997.

===Historical===
A historical regional rival was the St. Louis Browns. Through the 1953 season, the two teams were located pretty close to each other (including the 1901 season when the Browns were the Milwaukee Brewers), and could have been seen as the American League equivalent of the [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry]], being that Chicago and St. Louis have for years been connected by the same highway ([[U.S. Route 66]] and now [[Interstate 55]]).

The current [[Milwaukee Brewers]] franchise was also a primary White Sox rival, due the to proximity of the two cities, and with the teams competing in the same division for the 1970 and 1971 seasons, and then again from 1994 to 1997. The rivalry died down however, when the Brewers moved to the [[National League]] in 1998.

==Mascots==
[[File:Southpaw.jpg|thumb|right|Southpaw]]
{{See also|List of Major League Baseball mascots|Mascot Hall of Fame}}
From 1981 until 1988, the White Sox employed a twosome, called [[Ribbie and Roobarb]], as their team [[mascot]]s. In the early 1990s the White Sox had a cartoon mascot named, 'Waldo The White Sox Wolf' that advertised the ‘Silver and Black Pack’, the team kid's club at the time. The team's current mascot is called [[Southpaw (mascot)|SouthPaw]].

The White Sox have retired nine numbers. [[Luis Aparicio]]'s #11 has been un-retired at his request for the 2010 season for 11 time [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] winner shortstop [[Omar Vizquel]] (because #13 is currently used by manager [[Ozzie Guillén]]; Vizquel, like Aparicio and Guillen, play(ed) shortstop and all share a common Venezuelan heritage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100208&amp;content_id=8036676&amp;vkey=pr_cws&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cws|title=White Sox Un-Retire Aparicio's Number, Vizquel to Wear No. 11 During 2010 Season|date=8 February 2010|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, [[Harold Baines]] had his #3 retired in 1989; it has since been 'unretired' 3 times in each of his subsequent returns, including his current capacity as 1st base coach.

==Radio and television==
As of 2006, the White Sox' [[flagship]] [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] was [[WSCR]], 670 AM, known to Chicago listeners as The Score (the station had also served as the White Sox flagship for most of the time between the 1970s and 1990s as [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ radio]]). Starting in 2009, [[Ed Farmer]] ([[play-by-play]]) and [[Darrin Jackson|Darrin &quot;DJ&quot; Jackson]] ([[color commentator]]) will be calling every White Sox game, with Jackson moving from TV to radio, and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] moving from radio to TV. Chris Rongey remains in the Chicago studios during broadcasts, where he hosts the pre- and post-game shows.

On November 3, 2010 the White Sox signed a new multi-year deal with WSCR. They also announced a new venture into [[HD Radio]]. Currently WSCR can be heard as a [[simulcast]] on Jack FM ([[WJMK]]) HD2. Because of this, White Sox games can also be heard on their HD2 signal. With this new arrangement, the White Sox will own and produce a new channel on the same station broadcasting on HD3. This will be used as an open forum for White Sox management, players, and fans to comment on the team. The content will be produced from WSCR's studio. One example program being given is that if a pitcher throws a [[perfect game]], he can willingly come on the radio and field question from listeners for a period of time. It is presumed that White Sox games will not be moved to this station rather it will remain on HD2 while HD3 will only be used in the talk format. The White Sox will regulate the programing of the station, but not the content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101103&amp;content_id=15973596&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb &quot;White Sox set to launch HD channel&quot;]. ''MLB.com''. Retrieved 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Television broadcasts are split three ways: WGN (both the [[WGN-TV|local feed]] and [[WGN America]]), [[WCIU-TV]] (a local [[independent station]]) and [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]]. The announcers are the same wherever the game is televised: [[Ken Harrelson|Ken &quot;The Hawk&quot; Harrelson]] on play-by-play and Steve Stone on color. Occasionally, well-known former White Sox players such as [[Jack McDowell|&quot;Black Jack&quot; McDowell]], [[Robin Ventura]] and [[Moose Skowron]] fill in as substitutes in the broadcast booth. Since 1990, [[Ken &quot;Hawk&quot; Harrelson]] has done play-by-play commentary for the White Sox TV broadcasts.

Games shown on WCIU are produced by WGN under the branding of ''SoxNet'' with all WGN logo elements removed, as the WCIU telecasts are distributed on a network of stations across the state of Illinois.

==DVD releases==
In May 2009, a DVD of Chicago White Sox Memories was released, via [[Shout! Factory]].  It includes a complete history of the team, as well as interviews with some of the greatest White Sox players.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[applied ethics]], '''casuistry''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|ʒ|uː|ɨ|s|t|r|i}}) is [[case-based reasoning]]. Casuistry is used in [[juridical]] and ethical discussions of [[law]] and [[ethics]], and often is a critique of [[principle]]- or [[rule base|rule-based]] reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-35 &quot;Casuistry&quot;, ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas,'' University of Virginia Library. On line.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;casuistry&quot; originates from the [[Latin]] ''casus'' (&quot;case&quot;).

Critics use the term pejoratively for the use of clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions (see [[sophistry]]). Casuistry is reasoning used to resolve moral problems by applying theoretical rules to particular instances.

==Examples==
While a principle-based approach might claim that [[lie|lying]] is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, depending upon the details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal [[testimony]] under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. ([[Thomas Sanchez]] and others thus theorized a [[doctrine of mental reservation]].) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.

Typically, casuistic reasoning begins with a clear-cut [[paradigm]]atic case. In legal reasoning, for example, this might be a [[precedent]] case, such as pre-meditated [[murder]]. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with pre-meditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplar pre-meditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that case ''like'' the paradigmatic case.

==Meanings==
Casuistry is a ''method'' of case reasoning especially useful in treating cases that involve moral dilemmas. It is also a branch of [[applied ethics]]. Casuistry is the basis of [[case law]] in [[common law]], and the standard form of reasoning applied in [[common law]].

==Casuist morality==
Casuistry takes a relentlessly practical approach to morality. Rather than using theories as starting points, casuistry begins with an examination of cases. By drawing parallels between [[paradigm]]s, so-called &quot;pure cases&quot;, and the case at hand, a casuist tries to determine a moral response appropriate to a particular case.

Casuistry has been described as &quot;theory modest&quot; (Arras, see below). One of the strengths of casuistry is that it does not begin with, nor does it overemphasize, theoretical issues. Casuistry does not require practitioners to agree about ethical theories or evaluations before making policy. Instead, they can agree that certain [[paradigm]]s should be treated in certain ways, and then agree on the similarities, the so-called warrants between a paradigm and the case at hand.

Since most people, and most cultures, substantially agree about most pure ethical situations, casuistry often creates ethical arguments that can persuade people of different ethnic, religious and philosophical beliefs to treat particular cases in the same ways. For this reason, casuistry is widely considered to be the basis for the [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and its derivatives.

Casuistry is prone to abuses wherever the analogies between cases [[False analogy|are false]].

==History==
Western casuistry dates from [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), yet the zenith of casuistry was from 1550 to 1650, when the [[Jesuit]] religious order extensively used casuistry, particularly in practicing the private [[Roman Catholic]] [[confession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Franklin |title=The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2001 |pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''casuistry'' quickly became pejorative with [[Blaise Pascal]]'s attack on the misuse of casuistry. In ''[[Provincial Letters]]'' (1656–7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Blaise |last=Pascal |title=The Provincial Letters of Blaise Pascal |others=M'Crie, Thomas (trans.) |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |year=1898 |origyear=1657 |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/ |series=eBooks@Adelaide}}&lt;/ref&gt; he scolded the Jesuits for using casuistic reasoning in confession to placate wealthy Church donors, while punishing poor penitents. Pascal charged that aristocratic penitents could confess their sins one day, re-commit the sin the next day, generously donate the following day, then return to re-confess their sins and only receive the lightest punishment; Pascal's criticisms darkened casuistry's reputation. Since the 17th century, casuistry has been widely considered a degenerate form of reasoning. Critics of casuistry focus on its specious argumentation as intentionally misleading.

It was not until publication of ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'' (1988), by Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]],&lt;ref&gt;Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'', Berkeley, U. California Press (1990, ISBN 0-520-06960-9).&lt;/ref&gt; that a revival of casuistry occurred. They argue that the abuse of casuistry is the problem, not casuistry itself (itself an example of casuistic reasoning). Properly used, casuistry is powerful reasoning. Jonsen and Toulmin offer casuistry in dissolving the contradictory tenets of [[moral absolutism|absolutism]] and [[relativism]]: &quot;the form of reasoning constitutive of classical casuistry is rhetorical reasoning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsen, 1991, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Utilitarianism]] and [[Pragmatism]] commonly are identified as philosophies employing the [[rhetoric]]al reasoning of casuistry.

==Casuistry in early modern times==
The casuistic method was popular among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinkers in the early modern period, and not only among the [[Jesuits]], as it is commonly thought. Famous casuistic authors include [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza]]'s ''Summula casuum conscientiae'' (1627), which had enjoyed a great success, [[Thomas Sanchez]], [[Vincenzo Filliucci]] (Jesuit and [[Apostolic Penitentiary|penitentiary]] at [[St Peter]]'s), [[Antonino Diana]], [[Paul Laymann]] (''Theologia Moralis'', 1625), [[John Azor]] (''Institutiones Morales'', 1600), [[Etienne Bauny]], [[Louis Cellot]], [[Valerius Reginaldus]], [[Hermann Busembaum]] (d. 1668), etc. One of the main theses of casuists was the necessity to adapt the rigorous morals of the [[Church Fathers|Early Fathers]] of [[Christianity]] to modern morals, which led in some extreme cases to justify what [[Innocent XI]] later called &quot;laxist moral&quot; (i.e. justification of [[usury]], [[homicide]], [[regicide]], [[lie|lying]] through &quot;[[Doctrine of mental reservation|mental reservation]]&quot;, [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality|adultery and loss of virginity before marriage]], etc.—all due cases registered by [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] in the ''[[Provincial Letters]]'').

The progress of casuistry was interrupted toward the middle of the 17th century by the controversy which arose concerning the [[Catholic probabilism|doctrine of probabilism]], which stipulated that one could choose to follow a &quot;probable opinion&quot;, that is, supported by a theologian or another, even if it contradicted a more probable opinion or a quotation from one of the [[Fathers of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', p. 74–6, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy divided Catholic theologians into two camps, Rigorists and Laxists.

Casuistry was much mistrusted by early [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant theologians]], because it justified many of the abuses that they sought to reform. It was famously attacked by the Catholic and [[Jansenist]] philosopher [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], during the [[formulary controversy]] against the Jesuits, in his [[Lettres provinciales|Provincial Letters]] as the use of [[rhetorics]] to justify moral laxity, which became identified by the public with [[Jesuitism]]; hence the everyday use of the term to mean complex and [[sophist]]ic reasoning to justify moral laxity.&lt;ref&gt;170 &quot;Casuistry..destroys, by distinctions and exceptions, all morality, and effaces the essential difference between right and wrong.&quot; Henry St.John, Viscount Bolingbroke, ''Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism 1736''(pub. 1749), quoted in Oxford English Dictionary, 1989 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 18th century, &quot;casuistry&quot; became a synonym for moral laxity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In 1679 [[Pope Innocent XI]] publicly condemned sixty-five of the more radical propositions (''stricti mentalis''), taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, [[Francisco Suarez|Suarez]] and other casuists as ''propositiones laxorum moralistarum'' and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D., The Oxford History of the Popes, Oxford University Press, 1986. ISBN 0192820850 (p. 287).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this papal condemnation, both Catholicism and Protestantism permit the use of ambiguous and equivocal statements in specific circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;J.-P. Cavaillé, ''[http://dossiersgrihl.revues.org/document281.html Ruser sans mentir, de la casuistique aux sciences sociales: le recours à l’équivocité, entre efficacité pragmatique et souci éthique]'', in [[Serge Latouche]], P.-J. Laurent, O. Servais &amp; M. Singleton, ''Les Raisons de la ruse. Une perspective anthropologique et psychanalytique'', Actes du colloque international «La raison rusée», Louvain la Neuve, mars 2001, Paris, La Découverte, 2004, pp. 93–118 {{Fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alphonsus Maria de Liguori]] (d. 1787), founder of the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer]], then brought some attention back to casuistry by publishing again Hermann Busembaum's ''Medulla Theologiae Moralis''; the last edition published in 1785 and receiving the approbation of the [[Holy See]] in 1803.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Busembaum's ''Medulla'' had been burnt in Toulouse in 1757 because of its justification of [[regicide]], deemed particularly scandalous after [[Robert-François Damiens|Damiens]]' assassination attempt against [[Louis XV]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Casuistry in modern times==
[[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]] dealt with casuistry in chapter 1.4 of his ''[[Principia Ethica]]''; he claimed that &quot;the defects of casuistry are not defects of principle; no objection can be taken to its aim and object. It has failed only because it is far too difficult a subject to be treated adequately in our present state of knowledge.&quot; He also asserted, &quot;Casuistry is the goal of ethical investigation. It cannot be safely attempted at the beginning of our studies, but only at the end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLpcgAQvr_gC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22the+defects+of+casuistry+are+not+defects+of+principle+no+objection+can+be+taken+to+its+aim+and+object+it+has+failed+only+because+it+is+far+too+difficult+a+subject+to%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=31d6_MoIZ3&amp;sig=pqA0H1IkL7FXgnnRo5Caq-_EWTA G.E. Moore, ''Principia Ethica,'' (1903); 2nd ed. Thomas Baldwin, Cambridge and New York, Cambridge U. Press (1993), p. 57. ISBN 0521448484]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, [[applied ethics]] has revived the ideas of casuistry in applying ethical reasoning to particular cases in [[law]], [[bioethics]] and [[business ethics]], so the reputation of casuistry is somewhat rehabilitated.

A good reference, analyzing the methodological structure of casuistic argument, is ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'' (1990), by Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]] (ISBN 0-520-06960-9).

Hundreds of '''Chinese input methods''' are available to enter Chinese into computers, but most keyboard-based methods rely on the [[pinyin]] readings or shapes of Chinese characters. Although a pinyin method is easier to learn, the latter is often preferred by professional typists due to its faster input speed. 

Besides keyboard-based methods, there are also handwriting methods which allow users to write characters on a designated &quot;pad&quot;; this may require extra equipment, but may also be accomplished by using a mobile phone with a touchscreen.  

==History==
[[Image:Large chinese keyboard.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early experimental Chinese keyboard with many keys was developed by researchers of [[National Chiao Tung University]] in Taiwan, but it never came to the mainstream.]]
The development of Chinese input methods dates back to the era of typewriter. One of the early attempts was an electro-mechanical [[Chinese typewriter]] '''Ming kwai''' ({{zh|c=明快 |p=míngkuài |w=ming-k'uai}}) which was invented by [[Lin Yutang]], a prominent Chinese writer.  It assigned thirty base shapes or strokes to different keys and adopted a new way of categorizing Chinese characters. However, the typewriter was not produced commercially and Lin found himself deeply in debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://203.68.20.65/science/content/1972/00110035/0018.htm 中文與計算機]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chinese publishing industry before the 1980s, publishers had to hire a team of workers, selecting a few thousand type pieces from an enormous Chinese character set. In governments, Chinese characters were entered using a long, complicated list of [[Chinese telegraph code]], which assigns different numbers to each character. During the early computer era, there were also several methods of looking up Chinese characters such as looking for its radicals or its Pinyin (or romanization), but these gave only ambiguous results.
[[Image:Keyboard layout Cangjie.png|thumb|200px|A typical [[keyboard layout]] for Cangjie method, which is based on [[keyboard layout#US|United States keyboard layout]]]]
The modern Chinese input method was invented in 1976 when [[Chu Bong-Foo]] published the [[Cangjie input method]], which assigns different &quot;roots&quot; to each key and allows a user to use a standard computer keyboard to enter Chinese characters. With this method, for example, the character 日 is assigned to the A key, and 月 is assigned to B. Typing them together will result in the character 明 (&quot;bright&quot;).

Despite its difficulty of learning, this method remains popular in Chinese communities that use [[Traditional Chinese character]]s, such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]; it is also the first method that allows users to enter more than a hundred Chinese characters per minute. 

The development of input methods flourished in 1980s. Modern keyboard input methods can be classified into two main categories, including keyboard-based and shape-based methods.

All methods have their strengths and weaknesses. For someone who is familiar with pinyin, the [[pinyin method]] can be learned rapidly; however, the maximum typing rate is limited. ''[[Wubi method|Wubi]]'' takes much effort to learn, but expert typists can enter text much faster with it than with phonetic methods.  

Due to these complexities, there is no &quot;standard&quot; method evolving. 
In mainland China, [[Wubi method|wubi]] (shape-based) and pinyin methods such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]] are the most popular; in [[Taiwan]], [[Boshiamy method|Boshiamy]], [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] and [[Bopomofo|zhuyin]] are predominant; and in [[Hong Kong]], [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] is the most popular method taught in schools. 

Other means of entering Chinese characters include [[handwriting recognition]], [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] and [[voice recognition]]. The first and last of these usually must be &quot;trained&quot; before use; that is, the user must first use the system in a special &quot;learning mode&quot; so that the system can get accustomed to the user's handwriting or speech patterns, and failure to do so will increase the recognition error rate. These, especially the latter two, are used less frequently than keyboard-based input methods and suffer from relatively high error rates, especially when used without proper &quot;training&quot;, though the error rates are an acceptable trade-off to many users.

== Categories ==
===Phonetic-based ===
{{See also|Pinyin input method}}
In phonetic-based methods, after pronunciations are entered, they will be converted into relevant Chinese characters. To deal with homophones commonly found in the Chinese language, the system will show a list of candidates for selection. Modern systems such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]] learn the user's preferences and &quot;predict&quot; the most wanted characters based on the context.  For example, after entering the sounds ''jicheng'', the software will show up 繼承 (to inherit), but when entering ''jichengche'',  計程車 (taxi) will be chosen. 

This method is complicated by the various Chinese dialects spoken across different Chinese communities. Phonetic methods are based on the standard [[pinyin]], [[Zhùyīn fúhào|Zhuyin]] and [[Jyutping]] in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong respectively. 

This method is easy to learn for Chinese speakers, but the process of picking correct Chinese characters may hinder the typing speed. While there is no scientific research to compare typing speeds, most users reported that they can enter around 50 characters per minute, while some can reach over 100 per minute. &lt;ref&gt;[http://bbs.sogou.com/284579/goYBXy1sJXqFBAAAA.html|users' Report on Pinyin Method], Sougou BBS&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Columbus''' is the [[capital (political)|capital]] and largest city in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]]. The broader metropolitan area encompasses several counties and is the third largest in Ohio behind [[Cincinnati]] and [[Cleveland]]. Columbus is the third largest city in the [[American Midwest]], and the 15th largest city in the [[United States of America]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Template.cfm?Section=Find_a_County&amp;Template=/cffiles/counties/county.cfm&amp;id=39049|title=Places in Franklin County, OH|work=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties|accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616120530/http://www.naco.org/Template.cfm?Section=Find_a_County&amp;Template=/cffiles/counties/county.cfm&amp;id=39049| archivedate = June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the city has expanded and annexed portions of adjoining [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware County]] and [[Fairfield County, Ohio|Fairfield County]]. Named for explorer [[Christopher Columbus]], the city was founded in 1812 at the [[confluence]] of the [[Scioto River|Scioto]] and [[Olentangy River|Olentangy]] rivers, and assumed the functions of state capital in 1816. The city has a diverse economy based on education, government, insurance, banking, fashion, defense, aviation, food, clothes, logistics, steel, energy, medical research, health care, hospitality, retail, and technology.
Modern Columbus has emerged as a technologically sophisticated city. It is home to the world's largest private research and development foundation, the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]; CAS, or [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], the world's largest clearinghouse of chemical information; [[NetJets]], the world's largest fractional ownership jet aircraft fleet; and The [[Ohio State University]], the nation's largest campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/02/04/leader_of_nations_biggest_campus_taking_on_tenure/ &quot;Leader of nation's biggest campus taking on tenure&quot;], Andrew Welsh-Huggins.

This explains why the Columbus metropolitan area has a relatively small population, and is smaller than both the [[Cleveland]] and [[Cincinnati]] metro areas. In 2008, Columbus was the [[List of United States cities by population|16th largest]] city in the United States, with 754,885 residents, but has only the [[List of United States metropolitan areas|32nd largest]] [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan area]], and the third most [[List of capitals in the United States|populous state capital]] in the U.S. 2008 estimates indicate that roughly 116,000 of the city's residents are foreign-born, accounting for 82% of the new residents between 2000-2006.&lt;ref name=CF /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fairus.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.fairus.org/site/PageNavigator/facts/local_data_oh_columbus &quot;Metro Area Factsheet: Columbus, Ohio MSA&quot;], Federation for Immigration Reform.

==History==
===Ohio Country===
[[File:Ohio Country en.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ohio Country between 1775-1794 depicting locations of battles and massacres surrounding the area which would eventually become the location of the city.]]
The region where modern-day Columbus is found was once called the [[Ohio Country]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=eIJtFPirzr8C&amp;dq &quot;The testing grounds of modern empire: the making of colonial racial order in the American Ohio country and the South African Eastern Cape, 1770s-1850s&quot;], Christoph Strobel. Peter Lang, 2008. ISBN 1-4331-0123-8, 9781433101236. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; under the control of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] through the Vice-royauté of [[New France]]. European traders flocked to the area, in the interests of the fur trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=6&amp;chapter=2 &quot;Chapter One: The Anglo-French Contest for the Ohio Country&quot;], Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. Retrieved 10 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was consistently caught between warring factions, including Native American and European interests. In the 1740s Pennsylvania traders had overrun the territory until the French forcibly evicted them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=jfxdH5pslt4C&amp;pg &quot;The ambiguous Iroquois empire: the Covenant Chain confederation of Indian tribes with English colonies from its beginnings to the Lancaster Treaty of 1744&quot;], Francis Jennings. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1990. ISBN 0-393-30302-0, 9780393303025. p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1750s [[George Washington]] was sent to the Ohio Country by the Ohio company to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark Europe's [[Seven Year's War]] with the [[French and Indian War]].

The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the country to the [[British Empire]] in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring.

===Virginia Military District===
Following the [[American Revolution]], the Ohio Country became part of the [[Virginia Military District]] under the control of the [[United States]]. Colonialists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty [[frontier]], they encountered people of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]] nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, resulting in years of bitter conflict. The decisive battle of [[Battle of Fallen Timbers|Fallen Timbers]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Greenville]], which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young [[surveying|surveyor]] from [[Virginia]] named Lucas Sullivant had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River. An admirer of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Sullivant chose to name his [[frontier]] village &quot;[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Although the location was desirable in its proximity to [[Navigability|navigable]] rivers, Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large [[flood]] wiped out the newly formed settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; He persevered, and the village was rebuilt.

===19th century===
[[File:Old Columbus City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Old City Hall, completed in 1872 and burned in 1921]]
After Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among Ohio's more prominent leaders resulted in the state [[capital (political)|capital]] moving from [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] to [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and back again. The state legislature finally decided that a new capital city, located in the center of the state, was a necessary compromise. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access by way of major transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio's capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware. Prior to the state legislature's decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was designed from the first as the state's capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio's political, economic, and social life. Named in honor of Christopher Columbus, the capital city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the &quot;High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto known as Wolf's Ridge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Burough of Columbus&quot; [''sic''] was officially established on February 10, 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Nine people were elected to fill the various positions of Mayor, Treasurer, and others. Although the recent [[War of 1812]] had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the success of the new town. Early conditions were abysmal with frequent bouts of fevers and an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Road]] reached Columbus from [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and facilitated a population boom.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of immigrants from Europe resulted in the establishment of two ethnic [[enclave]]s on the outskirts of the city. A significant [[Irish people|Irish]] population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the [[Germans]] took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as [[German Village|''Das Alte Südende'']] (The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries, [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]], and [[Capital University]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zuahxa&quot;&gt;Lentz, pp. 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

With a population of 3500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. The legislature carried out a [[Private bill|special act]] on that day, which granted legislative authority to the [[city council]] and judicial authority to the mayor. Elections were held in April of that year, with voters choosing one John Brooks as the first mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus annexed the separate city of [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] in 1837.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=HQ-DgBzxfx4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=columbus+annexed+franklinton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WVHus9r9MD&amp;sig=SiC2xZXv0Rnl-ZuhLI0D9Zw7NCI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JDgFTePXKISglAe2yMzlCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=columbus%20annexed%20franklinton&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850 the [[Columbus and Xenia Railroad]] became the first railroad to enter the city, followed by the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] in 1851. The two railroads built a joint [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]] on the east side of High Street just north of Naghten (then called North Public Lane). Rail traffic into Columbus increased&amp;mdash;by 1875 Columbus was served by eight railroads, and a new, more elaborate station was built.&lt;ref&gt;

On January 7, 1857, the [[Ohio Statehouse]] finally opened to the public after 18 years of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Columbus was a major base for the volunteer [[Union Army]] that housed 26,000 troops and held up to 9,000 [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[prisoners of war]] at [[Camp Chase]] located at what is now the Hilltop neighborhood of west Columbus. Over 2,000 Confederate soldiers remain buried at the site, making it one of the largest Confederate cemeteries in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; North of Columbus, along the Delaware Road, the [[Regular Army]] established [[Camp Thomas]], where the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th U.S. Infantry]] was organized and trained.

By virtue of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], the [[Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College]] (which became [[The Ohio State University]]) was founded in 1870 on the former estate of [[Victorian_Village#Neil_family|William and Hannah Neil]].&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Waterford Tower in front of Miranova Condominiums.jpg|thumb|left|Waterford Tower, shadowed by the [[Miranova Place|Miranova Condominiums]] in downtown Columbus]]
By the end of the 19th century, Columbus saw the rise of several major manufacturing businesses. The city became known as the &quot;Buggy Capital of the World&quot;, thanks to the presence of some two dozen [[Carriage|buggy]] factories, notably the Columbus Buggy Company, which was founded in 1875 by C.D. Firestone. The Columbus Consolidated Brewing Company also rose to prominence during this time, and it may have had achieved even greater success were it not for the influence of the [[Anti-Saloon League]], based in neighboring [[Westerville, Ohio|Westerville]].&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[steel|steel industry]], a forward-thinking man named [[Samuel P. Bush]] presided over the [[Buckeye Steel Castings]] Company. Columbus was also a popular location for the organization of labor. In 1886, [[Samuel Gompers]] founded the [[American Federation of Labor]] in Druid's Hall on S. Fourth Street, and in 1890 the [[United Mine Workers of America]] was founded at old City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, [[James Thurber]], who would go on to an illustrious literary career in [[Paris]] and [[New York City]], was born in the city. Today the Ohio State's theater department has a performance center named in his honor, and his youthful home near the Discovery District is on the list of [[National Register of Historic Places]].

[[File:AUT 0348.JPG|thumb|right|Street arches returned to the [[Short North]] in late 2002]]
&quot;The Columbus Experiment&quot; was an internationally recognized environmental project in 1908, which saw the construction of the first water plant in the world to apply filtration and softening, designed and invented by Hoover brothers, Clarence and Charles. Those working to construct the project included [[Flytown#O.27Shaughnessy_family|Jeremiah O'Shaughnessy]], name-bearer of the Columbus metropolitan area's [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy Dam]]. This invention helped drastically reduce [[typhus]] deaths. These designs are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utilities.columbus.gov/About_Us/WaterTreatmentProcess.htm &quot;General Water Treatment Process&quot;, Department of Public Utilities, City of Columbus (2007).] Retrieved 4-06-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus earned one of its nicknames, &quot;The Arch City&quot;, because of the dozens of wooden arches that spanned High Street at the turn of the 20th century. The arches illuminated the thoroughfare and eventually became the means by which electric power was provided to the new [[Tram|streetcars]]. The arches were torn down and replaced with cluster lights in 1914, but were reconstructed from metal in the [[Short North]] district in 2002 for their unique historical interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 1913, [[Great Dayton Flood|a catastrophic flood]] devastated the neighborhood of Franklinton, leaving over ninety people dead and thousands of West Side residents homeless. To prevent future flooding, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] recommended widening the Scioto River through downtown, constructing new bridges, and building a [[retaining wall]] along its banks. With the strength of the post-[[World War I|WWI]] economy, a construction boom occurred in the 1920s, resulting in a new [[Civic center|Civic Center]], the [[Ohio Theatre (Columbus)|Ohio Theatre]], the [[LeVeque Tower|American Insurance Union Citadel]], and, to the north, a massive new [[Ohio Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]] was founded in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] in 1920, its head offices moved to Columbus in 1921 and remained in the city until 1941. In 1922, the association's name was changed to the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =NFL History  | publisher =CBS Sportsline.com  | url =http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930

The effects of the [[Great Depression]] were somewhat less severe in Columbus, as the city's diversified economy helped it fare marginally better than its [[Rust Belt]] neighbors. [[World War II]] brought a tremendous number of new jobs to the city, and with it another population surge. This time, the majority of new arrivals were migrants from the &quot;extraordinarily depressed rural areas&quot; of [[Appalachia]], who would soon account for more than a third of Columbus' rising population.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp.116–118&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Town and Country Shopping Center opened in suburban [[Whitehall, Ohio|Whitehall]], and it is now regarded as one of the first modern [[shopping mall|shopping centers]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highway]] signaled the arrival of rapid suburb development in central Ohio. In order to protect the city's tax base from this [[suburbanization]], Columbus adopted a policy of linking sewer and water hookups to [[annexation]] to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, Columbus had grown to become Ohio's largest city in both land area and in population.

Efforts to revitalize [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown Columbus]] have had some success in recent decades{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, though like most major American cities, some architectural heritage was lost in the process. In the 1970s, landmarks such as [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]] and the Neil House Hotel were razed to construct [[high-rise]] offices and big retail space. The [[National City Bank Building (Columbus)|National City Bank building]] was constructed in 1977, as well as the [[One Nationwide Plaza|Nationwide Plazas]] and other towers that sprouted during this period. The construction of the [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]] has brought major conventions and trade shows to the city. The Scioto Mile is a showcase park that is being developed along the riverfront, an area which has already seen the development of [[Miranova Place|Miranova Corporate Center]] and [[The Condominiums at North Bank Park]]. Corporate interests have developed [[Capitol Square]], including the [[WCMH-TV|local NBC affiliate]] locating at the corner of Broad and High.

The [[2010 United States foreclosure crisis]] has forced the city to purchase numerous foreclosed, vacant properties &amp;mdash; either to renovate them or to demolish them &amp;mdash; at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. As of February 2011, there are an unprecedented 6,117 vacant properties in Columbus, according to city officials.&lt;ref name=foreclosures&gt;{{cite news |title=City spends millions renovating, demolishing eyesore properties |author=Mark Ferenchik |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/02/26/vacant_homes.html?sid=101 |newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, 14-year old [[Cromwell Dixon]] built the &quot;SkyCycle,&quot; a pedal-powered blimp, which he flew at Driving Park.&lt;ref name=PCI&gt;[http://www.port-columbus.com/about/75anniv.asp &quot;75 Years of Flight in Columbus&quot;], Port Columbus International Airport. Retrieved 13 july 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the world's first commercial cargo flight occurred when one of the Wright Brothers' exhibition pilots, Phillip Parmalee, flew two packages containing 88&amp;nbsp;kilograms of silk from Dayton to Columbus in a [[Wright Model B]], a distance of {{convert|70|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=fPLm9omt_YIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=first+commercial+flight,+columbus,+dayton&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aPo8TIWvN8H58Aahg5ylCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20commercial%20flight%2C%20columbus%2C%20dayton&amp;f=false &quot;History of Air Cargo and Airmail from the 18th Century&quot;], Camille Allaz. 2005. ISBN 0-9548896-0-6, 9780954889609.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 20 years later, Port Columbus Airport became the axis of a coordinated rail-to-air transcontinental system that moved passengers from the East Coast to the West, with TAT, which later became TWA, providing the commercial service, following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s promotion of Columbus to the nation for such a hub. Following the failure of a bond levy in 1927 to build the airport, Lindbergh personally campaigned in the city in 1928, and the next bond levy passed that year.&lt;ref name=PCI /&gt; On July 8, 1929 the airport opened for business with the inaugural TAT west-bound flight from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma. Among the 19 passengers on that flight was [[Amelia Earhart]],&lt;ref name=PCI /&gt; with [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]] attending the opening ceremonies.&lt;ref name=PCI /&gt;

In 1964, Ohio native [[Jerrie Mock|Geraldine Fredritz Mock]] became the first woman to fly around the world, leaving from Columbus and piloting the ''Spirit of Columbus''. Her flight lasted nearly a month, and set a record for speed for planes under 3858 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2731 Ohio History Central, Geraldine Fredritz Mock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Columbus, Ohio}}
[[File:ColumbusNightSkyline2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Scioto River]] flows through the heart of downtown]]
The confluence of the [[Scioto River|Scioto]] and [[Olentangy River|Olentangy]] rivers occurs just west of downtown Columbus. Several smaller tributaries course through the Columbus metro area, including [[Alum Creek]], [[Big Walnut Creek]], and [[Big Darby Creek|Darby Creek]]. Columbus is considered to have relatively flat [[topography]] thanks to a large [[glacier]] that covered most of Ohio during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin Ice Age]]. However, there are sizable differences in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin County being 1132&amp;nbsp;ft (345 m) above [[sea level]] near [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], and the low point being 670&amp;nbsp;ft (207 m) where the Scioto River leaves the county near [[Lockbourne, Ohio|Lockbourne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fracomap&quot;&gt;{{Cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous ravine areas near the rivers and creeks also help give some variety to the landscape. Tributaries to Alum Creek and the Olentangy River cut through shale, while tributaries to the Scioto River cut through limestone.

===Climate===
The region's climate is transitional between [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') and [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (Köppen ''Cfa''), characterized by hot, muggy summers and cold, dry winters. Winter snowfall is relatively light, since the city is not in the typical path of strong winter lows, such as the [[Nor'easters]] that strike cities farther east. It is also too far south and west for [[lake-effect snow]] from [[Lake Erie]] to have much effect.

The hottest temperature ever recorded in Columbus was {{convert|106|F|0}}, which occurred twice during the [[Dust Bowl]] [[drought]] of the 1930s—once on July 21, 1934, and again two years later, on July 14, 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Weather Service&quot;&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/iln/cmhrec.htm Records for Columbus.] [[National Weather Service]].

Columbus is subject to [[severe weather]] typical to the [[Midwestern United States]]. [[Tornado]]es are possible from spring through fall, a recent one of which occurred on October 11, 2006 and caused [[Fujita Scale|F2]] damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The city is administered by a mayor and a seven-member unicameral council elected in two classes every two years to four-year terms. The mayor appoints the director of safety and the director of public service. The people elect the [[auditor]], [[court clerk|municipal court clerk]], [[judge|municipal court judges]] and [[city attorney]]. A charter commission, elected in 1913, submitted, in May 1914, a new charter offering a modified Federal form, with a number of progressive features, such as nonpartisan ballot, [[preferential voting]], recall of [[official|elected officials]], the referendum, and a small council elected at large. The charter was adopted, effective January 1, 1916. The current mayor of Columbus is [[Michael B. Coleman]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Columbus}}
[[File:OPERS Building, Columbus, OH.jpg|thumb|left|140px|OPERS building, downtown]]
Columbus has a generally strong and diverse economy based on education, insurance, banking, fashion, defense, aviation, food, logistics, steel, energy, medical research, health care, hospitality, retail, and technology. Overall, it was ranked as one of the top 10 best big cities in the country in 2010, according to Relocate America, a real estate research firm.&lt;ref name=CBJ&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2010/04/19/daily28.html &quot;Ranking: Columbus among top 10 big cities&quot;], BizJournals.

[[File:State Teachers Retirement System Columbus.jpg|thumb|right|190px|SERS building, downtown]]
During the [[Late-2000s recession|recession beginning in late 2007]], Columbus' economy was not impacted as much as the rest of the country, due to decades of diversification work by long-time corporate residents, business leaders, and political leaders. The current administration of mayor [[Michael B. Coleman]] has continued this work, although the city faced financial turmoil and had to increase taxes, due in part to alleged fiscal mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisweeknews.com/live/content/politics/LIVE_results/2009races/11/columbus_council.html?sid=104 &quot;Recount Still Possible&quot;], This Week Community Papers, Retrieved 13 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/local/local_govtpolitics/article/the_final_push_for_issue_one/19305/ NBC 4, Columbus Budget Shortfall, Tax Increase] Retrieved 26 july 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As Columbus is the state capital, there is a large government presence in the city. Including city, county, state, and federal employers, [[USAJOBS|government jobs]] provide the largest single source of employment within Columbus.

In 2010, the city had four corporations named to the U.S. Fortune 500 list including [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]], [[American Electric Power]], [[Limited Brands]], and [[Big Lots]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune 500&quot;/&gt; with [[Cardinal Health]] located in [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]].&lt;ref name=GDP /&gt; Other major employers in the area include numerous schools (for example,, The Ohio State University) and hospitals, hi-tech research and development including the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], information/library companies such as [[OCLC]] and [[Chemical Abstracts]], financial institutions such as [[JP Morgan Chase]] and [[Huntington Bancshares]], as well as [[Owens Corning]] and [[Wendy's]]. Major foreign corporations operating or with divisions in the city include [[Germany]]-based [[Siemens]] and [[Boehringer Ingelheim|Roxane Laboratories]], [[Finland]]-based [[Vaisala]], [[Japan]]-based Techneglas(Techneglas closed operations in Columbus), Inc., Tomasco Mulciber Inc., and A Y Manufacturing, as well as [[Switzerland]]-based [[ABB Group]] and [[Mettler Toledo]].

==Transportation==
[[File:Columbus Skywalk 5.JPG|thumb|left|Columbus has numerous pedestrian skywalks linking together downtown buildings.]]

===Grid and address system===
The city's street plan originates downtown and extends into the old-growth neighborhoods, following a [[grid plan|grid pattern]] with the intersection of [[High Street]] (running north–south) and Broad Street (running east–west) at its center. North-South streets run 12 degrees west of due North, parallel to High Street; the Avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and so on.) run east–west.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Opha (1930). ''History of Franklin County Ohio''. Topeka-Indianapolis: Historical Publishing Company, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered Avenues begin with First Avenue, about {{convert|1.25|mi|abbr=on}} north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered Streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} (along the same street).&lt;ref name=&quot;fracomap&quot; /&gt; For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately {{convert|.5|mi|abbr=on}} west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north–south streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes ‘N’ and ‘S’ indicate whether that distance is to measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High.

[[File:Columbus Numbered Streets and Avenues.png|thumb|right|250px|Locations of numbered streets and avenues]]
This street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered Avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered Streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered Streets and Avenues. Furthermore, named Streets and Avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east–west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north–south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north–south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east–west, perpendicular to High Street.

The addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders.

Other major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road ([[Ohio State Route 161|SR-161]]), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road ([[Ohio State Highway 3|SR-3]]), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue and Livingston Avenue.

===Highways===
Columbus is bisected by two major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]], [[Interstate 70]] running east–west, and [[Interstate 71]] running north to roughly southwest. The two Interstates combine downtown for about {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} in an area locally known as &quot;The Split&quot;, which is a major [[traffic congestion]] point within Columbus, especially during [[rush hour]]. [[U.S. Highway 40]], aka [[National Road]], runs east–west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. It is also widely recognized as the nation's first highway. [[U.S. Highway 23]] runs roughly north–south, while [[U.S. Highway 33]] runs northwest-to-southeast. The [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] [[Beltway|Outerbelt]] encircles the vast majority of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), [[Ohio State Highway 315|State Route 315]] on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a 2-hour drive of Columbus.

===Bridges===
The Columbus riverfront hosts a few notable bridges which have been built in recent years. The [[Main Street Bridge (Columbus)|Main Street Bridge]] opened on July 30, 2010 and is the first bridge of its kind in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.downtowncolumbus.com/progress/main-street-bridge |title=Main Street Bridge: Steel Structure Makes Dramatic Visual Impact on Downtown Columbus Skyline |accessdate=2010-08-06 |work=Downtown Columbus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is located directly south of COSI on the Scioto river, featuring three lanes of one-way traffic and another separated lane for pedestrians and bikes. The Rich Street Bridge which is scheduled to open in August 2011 will be adjacent to the Main Street Bridge connecting Rich Street on the east side of the river with Town Street on the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubserv.ci.columbus.oh.us/transportation/Document_Library/PROJECTS/Rich_Street_Bridge.pdf |title=Rich Street Bridge Replacement |accessdate=2010-08-06 |work=City of Columbus}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lane Avenue Bridge]] opened on November 14, 2003 in the University District and spans the Olentangy river with three lanes of traffic each way.

===Airports===
[[File:PCI CIMG9956.jpg|175px|thumb|right|[[Port Columbus International Airport]]]]
The city's primary airport, [[Port Columbus International Airport]], is located on the east side of the city, with several smaller airports in the region as well. Port Columbus provides service to Canada and Mexico, as well as to most domestic destinations, including all the major hubs except [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] and [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]]. Port Columbus was a hub for [[Low-cost carrier|discount carrier]] [[Skybus Airlines]] and continues to be a home to [[NetJets]], the world's largest [[fractional ownership]] air carrier. According to a 2005 market survey, Port Columbus International Airport attracts about 50% of its passengers from outside of its {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} radius primary service region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.port-columbus.com/about/CRAA-EIA-full%20brochure.pdf|title=Regional Airports economic impact study, Wilbur Smith Associates, Inc., January 2005, Chap 1 pp2-4|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rickenbacker International Airport]], in southern Franklin County, is a major cargo facility and is utilized by the Ohio [[Air National Guard]]. [[Ohio State University Airport|OSU Don Scott Airport]] and [[Bolton Field]] are significant general-aviation facilities in the Columbus area.

===Rail===
Currently, Columbus lacks any type of passenger rail service.

Columbus used to have a major [[train station]] downtown called [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]], most notably as a stop along [[Amtrak]]'s [[National Limited]] train service until 1977. The station itself was razed in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061028014238/http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archivedate=2006-10-28|title=Columbus Union Station|date=2006-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greater Columbus [[Exhibition center|Convention Center]] now stands in its place. The station was also a stop along the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] and the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]]. Columbus is now the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|largest metropolitan area]] in the U.S. without passenger rail service, after Phoenix introduced a [[light rail|light-rail]] system in December 2008;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm|title=Metropolitan Areas Served by Amtrak|date=2006-11-23|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081227/ts_nm/us_transportation_phoenix|title=Phoenix debuts light-rail system|date=2008-12-27}}{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however studies are underway towards reintroducing passenger rail service to Columbus via the [[Ohio Hub]] project. Plans are in the works to open a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and to the proposed hub in Cleveland which offers rail service to the East Coast, including New York and Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/07/18/RAILPLAN.ART_ART_07-18-09_B1_01EGPQ5.html?sid=101#Scene_1 Columbus Dispatch, High Speed Rail] Retrieved 26 july 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus===
Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the [[Central Ohio Transit Authority]] (COTA).

===Bicycle===
Bicycling as transportation is steadily increasing in Columbus with its relatively flat terrain, intact urban neighborhoods, large student population, and off-road bike paths. The city has recently{{when|date=May 2011}} put forth the 2012 Bicentennial Bikeways Plan as well as a move toward a Complete Streets policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.altaprojects.net/columbus/ |title=Columbus (OH) Bikeways Plan |publisher=Altaprojects.net |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassroots efforts such as Bike To Work Week, Consider Biking, Yay Bikes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Michael Reed |url=http://www.yaybikes.com/transitional/ |title=Home &amp;#124; Yay Bikes! &amp;#124; Columbus, Oh |publisher=Yay Bikes! |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third Hand Bicycle Co-op, Franklinton Cycleworks, and ''Cranksters'', a local radio program focused on urban cycling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=WCRS LP Columbus Community Radio |url=http://wcrsfm.org/cranksters |title=Cranksters &amp;#124; WCRS LP Columbus Community Radio |publisher=Wcrsfm.org |date=2008-11-15 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; have contributed to cycling as transportation.

Columbus also hosts [[Utility cycling|urban cycling]] &quot;off-shots&quot; with messenger-style &quot;alleycat&quot; races as well as unorganized group rides, a monthly [[Critical Mass]] ride,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comacrew.homestead.com/criticalmass.html |title=Critical Mass Columbus |publisher=Comacrew.homestead.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cycle polo|bicycle polo]], art showings, movie nights, and a variety of [[bicycle-friendly]] businesses and events throughout the year. All this activity occurs despite Columbus's frequently inclement weather.

The recently{{when|date=May 2011}} opened [[Main Street Bridge (Columbus)|Main Street Bridge]] features a dedicated bike and pedestrian lane separated from traffic, as will the Rich Street Bridge when it opens in 2011.

Private institutions located in Columbus include the [[Columbus College of Art and Design]], [[Fortis College]], [[DeVry University]], [[Ohio Business College]], [[Ohio Institute of Health Careers]], [[Bradford School (Columbus)|Bradford School]] and [[Franklin University]], as well as the religious schools [[Bexley Hall|Bexley Hall Episcopal Seminary]], [[Mount Carmel College]] of Nursing, [[Ohio Dominican University]], [[Pontifical College Josephinum]], and [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]]. Three major suburban schools also have an influence on Columbus' educational landscape: Bexley's [[Capital University]], Westerville's [[Otterbein University]], and Delaware's [[Ohio Wesleyan University]].

===Primary and secondary schools===
[[File:Columbus Downtown High School.jpg|thumb|right|Columbus Downtown [[High School]]]]
[[Columbus City Schools]] (CCS), formerly Columbus [[Public school (government funded)|Public Schools]], is the largest district in Ohio, with 55,000 pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The suburbs operate their own districts as well, typically serving students in one or more townships, with districts sometimes crossing municipal boundaries. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Columbus]] also operates numerous [[parochial school|parochial elementary and high schools]]. The second largest school district in the area is [[South-Western City Schools, Franklin County, Ohio|South-Western City Schools]], which encompasses southwestern Franklin County. There are also several [[private school]]s in the area.

Some sources claim that the first [[kindergarten]] in the United States was established here by Louisa Frankenberg, a former student of [[Friedrich Fröbel]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zuahxa&quot;/&gt; Frankenberg immigrated to the city in 1838. In addition, [[Indianola Junior High School]] became the nation's first [[junior high]] in 1909, helping to bridge the difficult transition from
elementary to high school at a time when only 48% of students continued their education after the [[Ninth grade|9th grade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2691 Ohio History Central]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries===
The [[Columbus Metropolitan Library]] (CML) has been serving residents of central Ohio since 1873. With a collection of 3&amp;nbsp;million items, the system has 22 locations throughout the area. This library is one of the most-used library systems in the country and is consistently among the top-ranked large city libraries according to &quot;Hennen’s American Public Library Ratings.&quot; CML was rated the No. 1 library system in the nation in 1999, 2005, and 2008. It has been in the top four every year since 1999 when the rankings were first published in American Libraries magazine, often challenging up-state neighbor [[Cuyahoga County Public Library]] for the top spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Phillips

===Landmarks===
Columbus is home to several notable buildings, including the Greek Revival [[List of state capitols in the United States|State Capitol]], the [[Art Deco|art-deco]] Ohio Judicial Center and the [[Peter Eisenman]]-designed [[Wexner Center]] and [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]]. Other buildings of interest include the [[Rhodes State Office Tower]], [[LeVeque Tower]], and [[One Nationwide Plaza]].

The [[Ohio Statehouse]] construction began in 1839 on a 10&amp;nbsp;acre (40,000-m²) plot of land donated by four prominent Columbus landowners. This plot formed Capitol Square, which was not part of the original layout of the city. Built of Columbus [[limestone]] from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]], the Statehouse stands on foundations 18&amp;nbsp;feet (5&amp;nbsp;m) deep, laid by [[prison labor]] gangs rumored to have been composed largely of [[masonry|masons]] jailed for minor infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/pages/capitol_square/statehouse.cfm?submenu=statehouse|title=Ohio Statehouse Facts|date=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Statehouse features a central recessed [[porch]] with a [[colonnade]] of a forthright and primitive [[Doric order|Greek Doric mode]]. A broad and low central pediment supports the windowed [[astylar]] drum under an invisibly low [[dome|saucer dome]] that lights the interior [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. Unlike many U.S. state capitol buildings, the Ohio State Capitol owes little to the architecture of the [[United States Capitol|national Capitol]]. During the long course of the Statehouse's 22&amp;nbsp;years of construction, seven architects were employed. Relations between the legislature and the architects were not always cordial: Nathan B. Kelly, who introduced heating and an ingenious system of natural forced ventilation, was dismissed because the commissioners found his designs too lavish for the original intentions of the committee. The Statehouse was opened to the legislature and the public in 1857 and finally completed in 1861. It is located at the intersection of Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus.

Founded in 1975, The Jefferson Center for Learning and the Arts is a campus of [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]] and a center for research, publications, and seminars on nonprofit leadership and governance. Located at the eastern edge of downtown Columbus, The Jefferson Center has restored 11 turn-of-the-century homes, including the childhood residence of [[James Thurber]]. These locations are used for nonprofits in human services, education and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejeffersoncenter.org|title=The Jefferson Center|date=2006-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A to-scale replica of the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa Maria]] is found on the Scioto Riverfront. It was installed in 1992 to commemorate the 500-year anniversary of the [[Discoverer of the Americas|discovery of America]] by Columbus's [[Christopher Columbus|namesake]].

Within the [[Driving Park]] heritage district lies the original home of [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], the famous WWI [[fighter aircraft|fighter pilot]] ace. Reconstruction of the home is underway.

Established in 1848, [[Greenlawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio|Green Lawn Cemetery]] is one of the largest cemeteries in the Midwestern United States.

===Museums===
[[File:Columbus Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Columbus Museum of Art, downtown]]
The [[Columbus Museum of Art]] opened in 1931, and has a collection focusing on European and [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] up to early [[modernism]]. The [[Wexner Center for the Arts]], a [[contemporary art]] gallery and research facility, is located on the Campus of [[The Ohio State University]]. Also on campus is the Ohio State University Athletics Hall of Fame, located in the [[Value City Arena|Jerome Schottenstein Center]] (home of the OSU basketball and men's ice hockey teams), as well as the [[Jack Nicklaus]] museum next door.

Located in Franklin Park, the [[Franklin Park Conservatory]] is a [[botanical garden]] which opened in 1895, situated on {{convert|88|acres|0|abbr=on}} just east of Downtown.

[[COSI Columbus|COSI]], (Center of [[Science and Industry]]), is a large science museum. The present building, the former Central High School, was completed in November 1999, opposite downtown on the west bank of the Scioto River.

The [[Ohio Historical Society]] is headquartered in Columbus, with its flagship museum, the 250,000-square-foot (23,000-m²) Ohio Historical Center, located {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} north of downtown.

'''Cleveland''' ({{IPA-en|ˈkliːvlənd|pron}}) is a [[city]] in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] and is the [[county seat]] of [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]],{{GR|6}} the most populous county in the state. The municipality is located in northeastern Ohio on the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]], approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} west of the [[Pennsylvania]] border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the [[Cuyahoga River]], and became a [[manufacturing]] center owing to its location at the head of numerous [[canal]]s and [[Rail transport in the United States|railroad]] lines. With the decline of [[heavy industry|heavy manufacturing]], Cleveland's economy has diversified, becoming more [[tertiary sector of industry|service-based]], with growth in the financial, [[insurance]], [[practice of law|legal]], and [[Health care in the United States|healthcare]] sectors. Cleveland is also home to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rockhall.com/visit |publisher= Rock and Roll Hall of Fame | title= Visitor Information| accessdate= 2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], the city proper had a total population of 478,403, and was the 33rd [[List of United States cities by population|largest city]] in the United States, (now estimated as the 43rd largest due to declines in population)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/phc-t5/tab02.txt |title=Census 2000 PHC-T-5.

According to the 2010 Census, which was released on March 9, 2011, Cleveland's population declined 17%, down to 396,815 residents. This places Cleveland among the fastest-declining cities in the United States over the past decade. The state of Ohio is expected to lose two Congressional seats as a result of the 2010 Census and based upon the steep decline in Cleveland's population political observers believe both of those districts will be eliminated in northeast Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Helliker, Kevin. [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704629104576191021044682508.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Population of Cleveland Plunges 17%], Wall Street Journal, March 10, 2011, page A2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburbanization changed the city in the late 1960s and 1970s, when financial difficulties and a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River challenged the city. The city has worked to improve its [[infrastructure]], diversify its economy, and invest in the arts ever since, and now Cleveland is considered an exemplar for [[public-private partnership]]s, downtown revitalization, and [[urban renaissance]]. In studies conducted by ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2005 Cleveland was ranked as one of the most [[quality of life|livable]] cities in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://store.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=pr_story&amp;press_id=660001866&amp;ref=pr_list|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060428080311/http://store.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=pr_story&amp;press_id=660001866&amp;ref=pr_list|archivedate= 2006-04-28| title= Vancouver tops liveability ranking according to a new survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit| publisher = Economist | accessdate=2005-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city was ranked as the best city for business meetings in the continental U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Copestake, Jon.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cleveland}}
Cleveland obtained its name on July 22, 1796 when surveyors of the [[Connecticut Land Company]] laid out [[Connecticut]]'s [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] into townships and a capital city they named &quot;Cleaveland&quot; after their leader, General [[Moses Cleaveland]]. Cleaveland oversaw the plan for the modern downtown area, centered on the [[Public Square]], before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/timeline.html | title = Cleveland: A Bicentennial Timeline | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]]. This key link between the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] connected the city to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Erie Canal]] and later via the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]; and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Mississippi River]]. Growth continued with added railroad links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=OAEC | title = Ohio and Erie Canal | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Cleveland 1877.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bird's-eye view]] of Cleveland in 1877]]
In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring [[Ohio City (Cuyahoga County), Ohio|Ohio City]] over a bridge connecting the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CSB | title = Columbus Street Bridge | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio City remained an independent municipality until it was [[Municipal annexation in the United States|annexed]] by Cleveland in 1854.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot; /&gt;

===1870s-1960's: Industrial Prominence===
The city's situation on the lakefront helped it flourish as a center for heavy industry. As a halfway point for [[iron ore]] from [[Minnesota]] being shipped across the Great Lakes, as well as [[coal]] and being carried by rail from the south, Cleveland. [[Standard Oil]] was founded in Cleveland in 1870 by [[John D. Rockefeller]], although the headquarters moved to [[New York City]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/index.html | title = Rockefellers Timeline | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | date = 1999–2000 | publisher = PBS | quote = 1870 Rockefeller founds Standard Oil of Ohio with $1 million in capital, the largest corporation in the country. The new company controls 10% of U.S. petroleum refining. 1885 Standard Oil Standard Oil moves into new headquarters at 26 Broadway in New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland emerged in the early 20th Century as a leading American manufacturing center, home to numerous major [[steel]] producers, and [[auto industry|automobile manufacturers]], including those producing the increasingly popular [[gasoline]]-powered cars, such as those made by [[Peerless]], People's,&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan Motor Car Company|Jordan]], and [[Winton Motor Carriage Company|Winton]], the first car driven across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt; Other auto manufacturers located in Cleveland produced [[steam car|steam-powered]] cars , which included [[White Motor Company|White]] and [[Gaeth]], as well as the [[electric car]] company [[Baker Motor Vehicle|Baker]].

In commemoration of the [[centennial]] of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the [[Great Lakes Exposition]] debuted in June 1936 along the [[Lake Erie]] shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city hit hard by the [[Great Depression]], it drew 4 million visitors in its first season, and 7 million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=GLE | title = Great Lakes Exposition | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the [[Great Lakes Science Center]], the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Burke Lakefront Airport]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Porter, Philip |url = http://www.clevelandmemory.org/SpecColl/porter/Chapt06.html |title = Cleveland: Confused City on a Seesaw | chapter = Chapter 6 | pages = 106–107 | year = 1976 | location = Columbus, Ohio | publisher = Ohio State University Press | isbn= 0-8142-0264-0 | accessdate= 2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960's-1980's: Social and Economic Decline===
Like other major American cities during the era of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], Cleveland witnessed racial unrest, culminating in the [[Hough Riots]] from July 18, 1966 – July 23, 1966 and the [[Glenville Shootout]] from July 23, 1968 – July 25, 1968. The city's historical low point is widely considered to be its [[default (finance)|defaulting]] on federal loans when, under Mayor [[Dennis Kucinich]], on December 15, 1978 Cleveland became the first major American city to enter default since the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;/&gt; This, along with the notorious 1969 fire on the [[Cuyahoga River]] (caused by the ignition of industrial waste on the river's surface), and the city's struggling professional sports teams, drew much negative national press. By the beginning of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international [[free trade]] policies, [[inflation]] and the [[Savings and loan crisis|Savings and Loans Crisis]] contributed to [[Early 1980s recession|the recession]] that hit heavy-manufacturing cities like Cleveland particularly hard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/3_85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/05/the-jobless-rat.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several steel and auto production centers, which included the [[General Motors|GM]] [[Fisher Body]] plant in Collinwood, [[US Steel]] and [[Republic Steel]]. Cleveland emerged from the recession with the dubious distinction of being a prime example of the [[Rust Belt]] city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/07/business/republic-steel-to-close-mill.html | work=The New York Times | title=Republic Steel To Close Mill | date=1982-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2009/02/unemployment_hits_nearly_every.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=FBDOGMC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topography===
{{Wide image|Public Square 1912.jpg|400px|Panorama of [[Public Square]] in 1912|250px|right|alt=Panorama of [[Public Square]] in 1912}}

The shore of [[Lake Erie]] is {{convert|569|ft|m}} above [[above mean sea level|sea level]]; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly parallel to the lake.

===Climate===
Cleveland possesses a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), typical of much of the central United States, with very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east-west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the [[lake effect snow]] that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. All of these contribute to Cleveland being the second snowiest major city in the United States (behind [[Denver]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/snowiest-cities-in-america.html&lt;/ref&gt; The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} of snowfall in a season three times since 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cle/climate/cle/records/cletop10snow.html Cleveland Snowfalle (sic) Statistics.] [[National Weather Service]]. Retrieved on 2005-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; seasonal totals approaching or exceeding {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the '[[Snowbelt|Snow Belt]]' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt up the Lake Erie shore as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].

The all-time record high in Cleveland of {{convert|104|F|0}} was established on June 25, 1988, and the all-time record low of {{convert|-20|F|0}} was set on January 19, 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of {{convert|71.9|F|1}}, and January, with a mean temperature of {{convert|25.7|F|1}}, is the coldest. Normal yearly [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] based on the 30-year average from 1971 to 2000 is {{convert|38.7|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=cle NOWData - NOAA Online Weather Data.] National Weather Service.

The city's [[Drought (sport)|failure to win a trophy]] in any major professional sport since 1964 has earned it a reputation of being a [[sports-related curses|cursed sports]] city, which [[ESPN]] validated by proclaiming Cleveland as its &quot;most tortured sports city&quot; in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Darcy | first=Kieran | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=tortured/cleveland  | title=Mistakes by the Lake. | publisher=ESPN.com: | date=2004-07-13 | accessdate=2005-10-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041013110332/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=tortured/cleveland |archivedate = 2004-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, changes in the Cleveland sports landscape have led to further heartbreak and resentment among local fans, the most notable instances being [[Art Modell]]'s [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|relocation of the Browns]] to [[Baltimore]] after the 1995 season (that franchise became the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]], with the current Browns team starting play in 1999), and [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] native [[LeBron James]]' decision to leave the Cavaliers in 2010 for the [[Miami Heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Walker | first=James | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afcnorth/post/_/id/14793/take-your-pick-recap-lebron-vs-modell | title=Take your pick recap: LeBron vs. Modell | publisher=ESPN.com: | date=2010-07-13 | accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable Cleveland athlete is [[Jesse Owens]], who grew up in the city after moving from [[Alabama]] when he was nine. He participated in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], where he achieved international fame by winning four [[gold medal]]s: one each in the [[100 meters]], the [[200 meters]], the [[long jump]], and as part of the [[4 x 100 meter relay]] team.

===Past teams===
The city has been home to several additional professional sports franchises, including a [[women's basketball]] team and multiple [[soccer]] teams. Cleveland has also been home to several [[ice hockey]] franchises, beginning in 1937 with the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] member [[Cleveland Barons (1937-1973)|Cleveland Barons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/cleveland/barons.html|publisher=Sports E-cyclopedia | title = Cleveland Barons (1976–1978)|accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Barons, although having been the most successful team in AHL history at that point, moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where they subsequently folded after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CB3|publisher=Case Western Reserve University | title=Encyclopedia Of Cleveland History|accessdate=march 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salient cause of the Baron's move came from [[Nick Mileti]]'s short-lived [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] franchise, the [[Cleveland Crusaders]], which shared the old [[Cleveland Arena]] with the Barons in beginning in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CC12&lt;/ref&gt; The new league ultimately created a financial disparity that the Barons could not compete with.&lt;ref name=&quot;ech.case.edu&quot;&gt;http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CB3&lt;/ref&gt; Local philanthropist George Gund facilitated the relocation of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[California Golden Seals]] to Cleveland in [[1976–77 NHL season|1976]] and renamed them the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Barons]]. However, this latest incarnation was short lived, with the team merging with the [[Minnesota North Stars]] following the [[1977–78 NHL season|1977-78]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;ech.case.edu&quot;/&gt; In 1992 the [[Cleveland Lumberjacks]] of the (also now-defunct) [[IHL (1945-01)|IHL]] began play, lasting until 2001. Later in 2001, a [[Cleveland Barons (2001–2006)|third incarnation of the Barons]] was established, this time having returned to the AHL. The Barons moved to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] following the 2006 season.

In 1997 Cleveland was awarded one of the original eight franchises in the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], the [[Cleveland Rockers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/wnba/2004-01-06-dispersal-draft_x.htm | publisher = USA Today | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | title = Rockers divvied up in dispersal draft | date = January 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Rockers finished first in the WNBA [[Eastern Conference (WNBA)|Eastern Conference]] on two occasions, they never made an appearance in the [[WNBA Finals]]. The team folded in 2003 after the league was unable to find a new owner. Previous owner [[Gordon Gund]] had dropped the team from operation, citing financial losses and poor attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CR11 |title=Cleveland Rockers|date=28 September 2006 |work=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 1988, Cleveland was home to the [[Cleveland Force (1978–1988)|Cleveland Force]] of the [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992)|MISL]]. After the Force folded in 1988 they were replaced by the [[Cleveland Crunch]] of the [[National Professional Soccer League II|NPSL]] and [[Major Indoor Soccer League (2001–2008)|MISL]], who played from 1989 to 2005. The Crunch won three league championships in the 1990s and re-adopted the Force name in 2002 before ceasing operations in 2005. The [[Cleveland City Stars]] played in the [[United Soccer Leagues]] from 2006 to 2009, winning the [[USL Second Division]] championship in 2008.

===Mass transit===
[[File:Tcleverta.jpg|left|thumb|An [[RTA Rapid Transit|RTA]] train arrives at the [[Shaker Square (RTA Rapid Transit station)|Shaker Square station]] ]]
Cleveland has a [[bus]] and [[urban rail transit|rail]] [[public transport|mass transit]] system operated by the [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the [[RTA Rapid Transit]], but local residents refer to it as ''The Rapid''. It consists of two [[rapid transit|light rail]] lines, known as the [[Blue and Green Lines (Cleveland)|Green and Blue Lines]], and a [[Passenger rail terminology#Heavy rail|heavy rail]] line, the [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red Line]]. In 2008, RTA completed the [[HealthLine]], a [[bus rapid transit]] line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] from downtown through University Circle, ending at the [[Louis Stokes Station at Windermere]] in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtahealthline.com/healthline-where-goes.asp |title=RTA HealthLine: Where It Goes |publisher = [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] | accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[American Public Transportation Association]] named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.riderta.com/nu_newsroom_releases.asp?listingid=1096 | title=Greater Cleveland: Best Location for Public Transportation in the Nation |publisher = Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-city bus lines===
National [[intercity bus]] service is provided at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] station, located just behind the [[Playhouse Square]] theater district. [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] provides service to Cleveland and has a stop outside of [[Tower City Center]] in downtown Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amtrak rail service, Greyhound Bus and Megabus information |url=http://www.positivelycleveland.com/visiting/getting_there/bus_rail/ |publisher=[[Positively Cleveland]] |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakefront [[Trailways Transportation System|Trailways]] provides regional inter-city bus service to popular destinations from their terminal south of Cleveland in [[Brook Park, Ohio|Brook Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Major highways===
Three two-digit [[Interstate highway]]s serve Cleveland directly. [[Interstate 71]] begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Cincinnati]]. [[Interstate 77]] begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. [[Interstate 90]] connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east–west through the west side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as [[Dead Man's Curve]], then continues northeast, entering [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]] near the eastern split with [[Ohio State Route 2]]. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, [[Interstate 480 (Ohio)|Interstate 480]], which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and [[Interstate 490 (Ohio)|Interstate 490]], which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-490_oh.html Interstate 490 Cleveland.] Interstate-Guide.com.

Instead, please include any relevant information in the Greater Cleveland article. --&gt;

Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] carries [[Ohio State Route 2|State Route 2]] along its length, and at varying points also carries [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]], [[U.S. Route 20|US 20]] and I-90. The Jennings Freeway ([[Ohio State Route 176|State Route 176]]) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]] and [[Brooklyn Heights, Ohio|Brooklyn Heights]]. A third highway, the Berea Freeway ([[Ohio State Route 237|State Route 237]] in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and [[Brook Park, Ohio|Brook Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhlink.net/neighborhoodtour/riverside/ntour.htm Riverside Neighborhood Tour.] Neighborhood Link, [[Cleveland State University]].

==Crime==
{{See also|Cleveland Division of Police}}
Based on the [[Morgan Quitno]] Press 2008 national crime rankings, Cleveland ranked as the 7th most dangerous city in the nation among US cities with a population of 100,000 to 500,000 and the 11th most dangerous overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime2008/citycrime2008.htm |title=City Crime Rankings 2008 |publisher=[[CQ Press]] |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Violent crime from 2005 to 2006 was mostly unchanged nationwide, but increased more than 10% in Cleveland. The murder rate dropped 30% in Cleveland, but was still far above the national average. Property crime from 2005 to 2006 was virtually unchanged across the country and in Cleveland, with larceny-theft down by 7% but burglaries up almost 14%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimestats.ohio.gov/Crime in US 2006.doc Ohio Department of Public Safety: Office of Criminal Justice Services-Crime in the U.S. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2010, Cleveland had two neighborhoods appear on [[ABC News]]'s list of 'America's 25 Most Dangerous Neighborhoods': both in sections just blocks apart in the city's Central neighborhood on the East Side. Ranked 21st was in the vicinty of Quincy Avenue and E.40th Streets, while an area near E. 55th and Scovill Avenue ranked 2nd in the nation, just behind a section of the [[East Garfield Park, Chicago|East Garfield Park]] neighborhood in [[Chicago]], which ranked 1st.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/LifeStages/americas-dangerous-neighborhoods-areas-violent-crime/story?id=11803334&amp;page=2

===History===
A study in 1971&amp;ndash;72 found that although Cleveland's crime rate was significantly lower than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime.&lt;ref&gt;US Dept of Justice, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, 'Reporting Criminal Victimization in Cleveland (OH), 1971–1972 - A Report', National Institute of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[gang]] activity was on the rise, associated with [[crack cocaine]]. A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity by a combination of removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=165310 National Criminal Justice Reference Service] M. L. Walker; L. M. Schmidt; C. Ronald Huff, ed., &quot;Community Response to Gangs&quot;, 'Gangs in America', 2nd ed, pp. 263–269, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
The distribution of crime in Cleveland is highly [[wiktionary:heterogeneous|heterogeneous]]. Relatively few crimes take place in downtown Cleveland's business district, but the perception of crime in the downtown has been pointed to by the Greater Cleveland Growth Association&lt;ref&gt;now the [http://www.gcpartnership.com/ Greater Cleveland Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; as damaging to the city's economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=57399 National Criminal Justice Reference Service] R.J. Zion, &quot;Reducing Crime and Fear of Crime in Downtown Cleveland&quot;, ''Victimology'', Vol. 3, No. 3/4, Special Issue pp. 341–344, (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Neighborhoods of higher socioeconomic status in Cleveland and its suburbs have lower rates of violent crime than areas of lower status, and even controlling for this factor, areas with higher populations of [[African Americans]] have higher violent crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119058880/abstract John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc] &quot;Racial Differences in Exposure to Crime: The City and Suburbs of Cleveland in 1990&quot;, ''Criminology'', Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 251–276, (Mar. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the relationship between [[employment]] access and crime in Cleveland found a strong inverse relationship, with the highest crime rates in areas of the city that had the lowest access to jobs. Furthermore, this relationship was found to be strongest with respect to economic crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118904458/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc] Fahui Wang; W.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Church of England}}

===Early history===
According to tradition, Christianity arrived in Britain in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first]] or [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], during which time southern Britain became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as [[Tertullian]] and [[Origen]] in the first years of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]], although the first Christian communities probably were established some decades earlier. Three [[Romano-British]] bishops, including [[Restitutus]], are known to have been present at the [[Council of Arles]] in 314. Others attended the [[Council of Sardica]] in 347 and that of [[Council of Rimini|Ariminum]] in 360, and a number of references to the church in [[Roman Britain]] are found in the writings of [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th-century]] Christian fathers. Britain was the home of [[Pelagius]], who opposed [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s doctrine of [[original sin]].

===Anglo-Saxon Christianity===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}
The Church of England generally dates its formal history from the 597 [[Gregorian mission]]. The church emphasises its continuity and identity with the early universal [[Western church]] and notes the consolidation of its particular independent and national character in the post-[[English Reformation|Reformation]] events of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] England, confirmed by the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. While Christianity was long established as the religion of the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] at the time of the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]], Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|native paganism]]. Consequently, in 597, [[Pope Gregory I]] sent Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]] from Rome to evangelise the [[Angles]]; this event is known as the [[Gregorian mission]]. With the help of Christians already residing in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], Augustine established his church in [[Canterbury]], the capital of the Kingdom of Kent, and became the first in the series of [[Archbishops of Canterbury]] in 598. A later archbishop, the Greek [[Theodore of Tarsus]], also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England.

[[Image:Hereford Cathedral Interior May 2004.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] is one of the church's forty-three [[cathedral]]s, many with histories stretching back centuries.]]
The [[Synod of Whitby]] established the Roman date for Easter and the Roman style of monastic tonsure in Britain. This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman customs with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called Whitby Abbey. It was presided over by King Oswiu, who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling.

===Secession from Rome===
Following Whitby, the English church was under [[Papal supremacy|papal authority]] for nearly a thousand years, before separating from Rome in 1534 during the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. A theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the English church such as [[Lollardy]], but the [[English Reformation]] gained political support when Henry VIII wanted an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] so he could marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. Under pressure from Catherine's nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Pope [[Clement VII]] refused the annulment. Eventually, Henry, although theologically a doctrinal Catholic, took the position of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Head of the Church of England]] to ensure the annulment of his marriage. He was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10026153 HistoryMole: King Henry VIII (1491-1547)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and, during his reign, [[Protestant]] reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw the trial for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.

Under his son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (1549 and 1552). These were based on the older liturgy but influenced by Protestant principles. The confession of the reformed Church of England was set out in the [[Forty-two Articles]] (later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king. Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of the Pope, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England. During Mary's reign, many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith. These are known as the [[Marian martyrs]] and the persecution has led to her nickname of &quot;[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]&quot;.

[[Image:Rochester cathedral stained glass 2.jpg|left|thumb|Stained glass window in [[Rochester Cathedral]], [[Kent]].]]
Mary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half-sister Elizabeth to resolve the direction of the church. The settlement under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (from 1558), known as the [[Elizabethan settlement]], developed the ''via media'' (middle way) character of the Church of England, a church moderately Reformed in doctrine, as expressed in the [[Thirty-nine Articles]], but also emphasising continuity with the Catholic and Apostolic traditions of the [[Church Fathers]]. It was also an established church (constitutionally established by the state with the head of state as its supreme governor). The exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century.

===Stuart period===
{{see|Stuart period}}
For the next century, through the reigns of [[James I of England|James I]], who ordered the creation of what became known as the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=tC1kuaetNqoC&amp;dq=The+Diary+Of+Samuel+Ward,+A+Translator+Of+The+1611+King+James+Bible%E2%80%8E The Diary Of Samuel Ward: A Translator Of The 1611 King James Bible], edited by [[John Wilson Cowart]] and M.M. Knappen&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and culminating in the [[English Civil War]] and the Protectorate of [[Oliver Cromwell]], there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the [[Puritans]] (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching Protestant reforms, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By Continental standards, the level of violence over religion was not high, but the casualties included a king, Charles I, and an Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Laud]]. Under the Commonwealth and then the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660, the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed, and in their place, [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate. In addition, the 39 Articles were replaced with the Westminster Confession, and the Book of Common Prayer was replaced by the Directory of Public Worship. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism.

With the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organization, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with the Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and those Puritans and Protestants who dissented from the Anglican establishment, and Roman Catholics, too strong to be suppressed altogether, having to continue their existence outside the National Church rather than controlling it. Continuing official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century.

===19th century===
By the Fifth Article of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union with Ireland 1800]], the Church of England and [[Church of Ireland]] were united into &quot;one Protestant Episcopal Church, to be called, The United Church of England and Ireland&quot;. Although this union was declared &quot;an essential and fundamental Part of the Union&quot;, nevertheless the [[Irish Church Act 1869]] separated the Irish part of the Church again and disestablished it, the Act coming into effect on 1 January 1871.

==Doctrine and practice==
{{See also|Anglicanism|Anglican doctrine}}
[[Image:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the southwest. It houses the [[cathedra]] or throne of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. It is the [[mother church]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]] (east [[Kent]]) and the Church of England and also a focus for the [[Anglican Communion]].]]

Church of England doctrine can be summarised in its [[canon law]] as follows:

Canon A 5 Of the doctrine of the Church of England:
&quot;The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, The Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.&quot; [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/canons/church.pdf]

As the Church of England bases its teachings on the [[Holy Scriptures]], the ancient Catholic teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] and some of the doctrinal principles of the [[Protestant Reformation]] (as expressed in the [[39 Articles]] and other documents such as the [[Book of Homilies]]), Anglicanism can therefore be described as 'Reformed Catholic' in character rather than [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. In practice, however, it is more mixed, with Anglicans who emphasise the Catholic tradition and others the Reformed tradition. There is also a long history of more liberal or [[latitudinarian]] views. These three 'parties' in the Church of England are sometimes called [[high church]] (or [[Anglo-Catholic]]), [[low church]] (or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]]) and [[broad church]] (or Liberal). In terms of church government, unlike many of the Protestant denominations it has retained [[episcopal polity|episcopal]] ([[bishop]]) leadership.[[File:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600), one of the most influential figures in shaping Anglican theology and self-identity]]The teachings of [[Richard Hooker]], the 16th century divine, summarised the Anglican position well, affirming bishops as ancient, allowable and for the wellbeing of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker's ecclesiastical polity: http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/history/hooker/iss_history_hooker_carter-position.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In many people's eyes today{{fix|text=whose?}} the Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and &quot;open-mindedness&quot;. This range of belief and practice includes those of the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], who emphasise liturgy and [[sacrament]]s, to the far more preaching-centred and less ritual-based services of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] and gatherings of the [[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]]. But this &quot;broad church&quot; faces various contentious doctrinal and social questions.

===Women's ministry===
Women were appointed as deaconesses from 1861 but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy. Women have been lay readers for a long time. During the First World War some women were appointed as lay readers but known as &quot;Bishop's Messengers&quot;. However, after that no more lay readers were appointed until 1969.

Legislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986 and they were first ordained in 1987. The [[ordination of women]] as priests was passed by the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] in 1992 and began in 1994. In July 2005 the synod voted to &quot;set in train&quot; the process of allowing the consecration of women as [[bishop]]s. In February 2006 the synod voted overwhelmingly for the &quot;further exploration&quot; of possible arrangements for parishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a woman bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060210women.shtml Church votes overwhelmingly for compromise on women bishops - news from ekklesia | Ekklesia]&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2008 the church's governing body voted to approve the ordination of women as bishops and rejected moves for alternative episcopal oversight for those who do not accept women bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Church will ordain women bishops |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7494517.stm |work= |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date= 7 July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual ordinations of women to the episcopate will require further legislation which is anticipated to be considered before 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7889946.stm Synod struggles on women bishops]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worship and liturgy===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The Church of England's official book of liturgy as established in English Law is the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP), but there are many examples of local variations throughout the churches of the Anglican Communion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for a modern [[liturgical book]], ''[[Common Worship]]'', dating from 2000, which can be used as an alternative to the BCP. Like its predecessor, the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', it differs from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' in providing a range of alternative services, mostly in modern language, although it does include some BCP-based forms as well, for example Order Two for Holy Communion. (This is a revision of the BCP service, altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the ''[[Agnus Dei]]'' before communion.) The Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship.

See also:[http://anglicanhistory.org/liturgy/index.html Anglican liturgy resources] and, on the history of Anglo-Catholic liturgy, [http://anglicanhistory.org/alcuin/tract11.html English or Roman Use].

The use of hymns and music in the Church of England has changed dramatically over the centuries. Traditional [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral evensong]] is a staple of most [[cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The style of [[psalm]] chanting harks back to the Church of England's pre-reformation roots. During the 18th century, clergy such as [[Charles Wesley]] introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the [[charismatic movement]] significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes, primarily affecting those of [[evangelical]] persuasion. These churches now adopt a [[contemporary worship]] form of service, with minimal liturgical or ritual elements, and incorporating [[contemporary worship music]].

==Membership==
Membership in the Church of England is by baptism although, due to its status as the established church, in general anyone may be married, have their children baptised or their funeral in their local [[Church of England parish church|parish church]], regardless of whether they are baptised or regular church goers.&lt;ref&gt;See the pages linked from the [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/lifeevents/ Life Events] page on the Church of England website&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchgoing in the United Kingdom, including the Church of England, has been declining steadily since around 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler, ''Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain'' (University of Chicago Press, 2001), page 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1968 to 1999, Anglican church attendances almost halved, from 3.5 per cent of the population to just 1.9 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Gill, ''The Empty Church Revisited'', (Ashgate Publishing, 2003) page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; One study published in 2008 suggested that if current trends continue, Sunday attendances could fall to 350,000 in 2030 and just 87,800 in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Research, ''Religious Trends'' (2008), cited in Ruth Gledhill, &quot;Churchgoing on its knees as Christianity falls out of favour&quot;, ''The Times'', 8 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of England responded by stating that the figures on which this were based overlooked the level of midweek attendance and that 1.7&amp;nbsp;million people attend Church of England parish and cathedral services each month, and argued that this figure has remained stable since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Gledhill, &quot;Churchgoing on its knees as Christianity falls out of favour&quot;, ''The Times'', 8 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{see also|Anglican ministry}}
[[File:Dioceses of the CofE.png|Dioceses of the Church of England, showing the [[Province of Canterbury]] (yellow) and the [[Province of York]] (pink). The grey areas are [[Wales]] (on the left), and part of [[Scotland]] (top).|right|thumb]]

Article XIX (Of the Church) of the 39 Articles defines the church as follows:

{{quote|The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/doctrine/39a/iss_doctrine_39A_Arts19-22.asp&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the complexities of the structure, the Church of England at its heart views the local parish church as the basic unit.

The British monarch, at present [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], has the constitutional title of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. The canon law of the Church of England states, &quot;We acknowledge that the Queen’s most excellent Majesty, acting according to the laws of the realm, is the highest power under God in this kingdom, and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil.&quot; In practice this power is often exercised through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

In addition to England proper, the current jurisdiction of the Church of England extends to the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]] and a few parishes in [[Flintshire]], [[Monmouthshire]] and [[Radnorshire]] in [[Wales]] (the present [[Church in Wales]] was an integral part of the Church of England until 1920).&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L. (ed.) (1957) Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church; p. 1436&lt;/ref&gt; Expatriate congregations on the continent of Europe have become the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]].

The church is structured as follows (from the lowest level upwards):
[[File:TootBaldon StLawrence ParishChurch.JPG|thumb|right|Many English villages have small parish churches such as this in [[Toot Baldon]].]]

* [[Parish]], this is the most local level, often consisting of one church building and community, although nowadays many parishes are joining forces in a variety of ways for financial reasons. The parish will be looked after by a parish [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] who for various historical or legal reasons may also be called by one of the following offices: [[vicar]], [[rector]], [[priest in charge]], team rector, team vicar. The first, second, and fourth of these may also be known as the 'incumbent'. The running of the parish is the joint responsibility of the incumbent and the [[Parochial Church Council]] (PCC), which consists of the parish clergy and elected representatives from the congregation. The Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe is not formally divided into parishes.
* There are also a number of local churches which do not have a parish. In urban areas there are a number of [[proprietary chapel]]s (mostly built in the 19th century to cope with urbanisation and growth in population). Also in more recent years there are increasingly [[church plant]]s and [[Fresh expressions]] of church, whereby new congregations are planted in a variety of locations (such as schools or pubs) in order to spread the Gospel of Christ in fresh and non-traditional ways.
[[File:Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe.PNG|thumb|right|240px|A map showing the diocese of Gibraltar in Europe. The seven archdeaconries are colour-coded.]]
* [[Deanery]], ''e.g.'', Lewisham, or Runnymede. This is the area for which a [[Rural Dean|rural dean]] is responsible. It will consist of a number of parishes in a particular district. The rural dean will usually be the incumbent of one of the constituent parishes. The parishes each elect lay (that is non-ordained) representatives to the deanery [[synod]]. Deanery synod members each have a vote in the election of representatives to the diocesan synod.
* Archdeaconry, ''e.g.'', the seven in the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archdeacon]]. It will consist of a number of deaneries.
* [[Diocese]], ''e.g.'', [[Diocese of Durham]], [[Diocese of Guildford]], [[Diocese of St Albans]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of a diocesan [[bishop]], ''e.g.'', the Bishops of Durham, Guildford and St Albans, and will have a [[cathedral]]. There may also be one or more assisting bishops, usually called [[Suffragan Bishop|suffragan bishops]], within the diocese who assist the diocesan bishop in his ministry, ''e.g.'', in Guildford diocese, the Bishop of Dorking. In some very large dioceses a legal measure has been enacted to create &quot;episcopal areas&quot;, in which case the diocesan bishop will run one such area himself and will appoint an &quot;area bishop&quot; to run each of the other areas as mini-dioceses; in such cases, the diocesan bishop legally delegates many of his powers to the area bishops. Dioceses with episcopal areas include [[Diocese of London|London]], [[Diocese of Chelmsford|Chelmsford]], [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Diocese of Chichester|Chichester]], [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]], and [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]]. The bishops will work with an elected body of [[Laity|lay]] and [[ordained]] representatives, known as the [[Diocesan Synod|diocesan synod]], to run the diocese. A diocese is subdivided into a number of archdeaconries.
* [[Ecclesiastical province|Province]], ''i.e.'', York or Canterbury (these are the only two in the Church of England). This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archbishop]], ''i.e.'' the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. Decision making within the province is the responsibility of the [[General Synod]] (see also above). A province is subdivided into dioceses.
* [[Primacy]], ''i.e.'', Church of England. In addition to his specific authority in his own province, each archbishop is &quot;Primate of All England&quot; (Canterbury) or &quot;Primate of England&quot; (York) and has certain powers that extend over the whole country—for example his license to marry without the [[banns]] ([[marriage licence]]).
* [[Royal Peculiar]], a small number of churches are more closely associated with [[the Crown]], and a very few with the law and are outside the usual church hierarchy though conforming to the rite. These are outside episcopal jurisdiction.

All [[Vicar#Anglican|rectors and vicars]] are [[advowson|appointed by patrons]], who may be private individuals, corporate bodies such as cathedrals, colleges or trusts, or by the bishop or even appointed directly by the Crown. No clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty, and taking the Oath of Canonical Obedience &quot;in all things lawful and honest&quot; to the bishop. Usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the actual possession of the benefice property—church and parsonage. Curates are appointed by rectors and vicars, but if priests-in-charge then by the bishop after consultations with the patron. Cathedral clergy (normally a dean and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter) are appointed either by the Crown, the bishop, or by the dean and chapter themselves. Clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed (e.g. curates), or simply with permission.

===Primates===
[[Image:Rowan Williams - by Brian.jpg|thumb|right|125px|The Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Rowan Williams]].]]
The most senior bishop of the Church of England is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who is the archbishop of the southern province of England, the Province of Canterbury. He also has the status of [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of All England and [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]. He is also the focus of unity for the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] of independent national or regional churches. The Most Reverend and Right Honourable [[Rowan Williams]] has served as Archbishop of Canterbury since 2002.

The second most senior bishop is the [[Archbishop of York]], who is the archbishop of the northern province of England, the Province of York. For historical reasons (relating to the time of York's control by the [[Danelaw|Danes]]) he is referred to as the Primate of England. The Most Reverend and Right Honourable [[John Sentamu]] has served as the Archbishop of York since 2005. The Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester are ranked in the next three positions.

===Diocesan bishops===
The process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex and is handled by a body called the [[Appointment of Church of England Bishops|Crown Nominations Committee]] which submits names to the Prime Minister (acting on behalf of the Crown) for consideration.

===Representative bodies===
{{Main|General Synod of the Church of England}}
The Church of England has a legislative body, the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]]. Synod can create two types of legislation, [[List of Church of England Measures|measures]] and [[canon law|canons]]. Measures have to be approved but cannot be amended by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] before receiving the [[Royal Assent]] and becoming part of the law of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/measures/|title=Summary of Church Assembly and General Synod Measures|year=2007|month=November|work=Church of England website|publisher=Archbishops' council of the Church of England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canons require Royal Licence and Royal Assent, but form the law of the church, rather than the law of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/gensynod/|title=General Synod|work=Church of England website|publisher=Archbishops' council of the Church of England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another assembly is the [[Convocation of the English Clergy]] (older than the General Synod and its predecessor the Church Assembly). There are also [[Diocesan Synod|diocesan synods]] and [[Deanery#Anglican usage|deanery synods]].

===House of Lords===
{{Main|Lords Spiritual}}
Of the forty-four diocesan [[archbishop]]s and [[bishop]]s in the Church of England, only twenty-six are permitted to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. The Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishops of York|York]] automatically have seats, as do the Bishops of [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]. The remaining twenty-one seats are filled in order of seniority by [[consecration]]. It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords, at which point he becomes a [[Lords Spiritual|Lord Spiritual]]. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]] are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords as their dioceses lie outside the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm House of Lords: alphabetical list of Members]. Retrieved on 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial situation==
{{Main|Properties and finances of the Church of England}}
The Church of England, although an [[established church]], does not receive any direct government support. Donations comprise its largest source of income, though it also relies heavily on the income from its various historic endowments. {{As of|2005}}, the Church of England had estimated total outgoings of around £900&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/funding/ outgoings]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Circe Offering the  Cup to Odysseus.jpg|thumb|''Circe Offering the Cup to Odysseus'', by [[John William Waterhouse]].]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Circe''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|ɜr|s|iː}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Κίρκη''' ''Kírkē'' &quot;falcon&quot;) is a minor [[goddess]] of magic (or sometimes a [[nymph]], [[witch]], [[enchantress]] or sorceress), described in the Odyssey as 'The loveliest of all immortals,' living on the [[island]] of [[Aeaea]], famous for her part in the adventures of [[Odysseus]] in [[Homer]]'s ''Odyssey''.

By most accounts, Circe was the daughter of [[Helios]], the god of the sun, and [[Perse]], an [[Oceanid]], and the sister of [[Aeetes]], the keeper of the [[Golden Fleece]], [[Perses (brother of Aeetes)|Perses]], and [[Pasiphaë]], the Wife of [[King Minos]] and mother of the [[Minotaur]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.135&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.135]; Hesiod, ''Theogony'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+956&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 956]; Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D1 1.9.1]; Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica ''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts make her the daughter of [[Hecate]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimal; Smith&lt;/ref&gt; 

Circe [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals through the use of magical potions. She was known for her knowledge of drugs and herbs.  

That Circe also purified the [[Argonauts]] for the death of [[Apsyrtus]], as related in ''[[Argonautica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;They escaped neither the vast sea's hardships nor vexatious tempests till Kirké&lt;!--Kirké in original--&gt; should wash them clean of the pitiless murder of Apsyrtos&quot; ([[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica'', iv.586-88, in Peter Grean's translation).&lt;/ref&gt; may reflect early tradition.&lt;ref&gt;See the ancient concept of ''[[miasma]]'', a Peter Green's commentary on iv. 705-17, ''The Argonautika Apollonios Rhodios'', (1997, 2007) p 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ancient literature==
===Homer's Odyssey===
[[Image:Circe Gumery cour Carree Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Circe'', by [[Charles Gumery]]]]
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Circe is described as living in a mansion that stands in the middle of a clearing in a dense wood. Around the house prowled strangely docile [[panthera leo|lions]] and [[wolf|wolves]], the drugged victims of her magic;&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.212&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.212ff].&lt;/ref&gt; they were not dangerous, and fawned on all newcomers.  Circe worked at a huge [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer [[Weaving (mythology)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  She invited [[Odysseus]]' crew to a feast of familiar food, a pottage of cheese and meal, sweetened with honey and laced with wine, but also laced with one of her magical potions, and she turned them all into [[pig]]s with a wand after they gorged themselves on it. Only [[Eurylochus (mythology)|Eurylochus]], suspecting treachery from the outset, escaped to warn Odysseus and the others who had stayed behind at the ships. [[Odysseus]] set out to rescue his men, but was intercepted by his  great grandfather, [[Hermes]],&lt;ref&gt;Hermes is Odysseus' great grandfather from his mother side, [[Anticlea]] through [[Autolycos]]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been sent by Athena. Hermes told Odysseus to use the [[moly (herb)|holy herb moly]] to protect himself from Circe's potion and, having resisted it, to draw his sword and act as if he were to attack Circe.  From there, Circe would ask him to bed, but Hermes advised caution, for even there the goddess would be treacherous.  She would take his [[manhood]] unless he had her swear by the names of the gods that she would not.

Odysseus followed Hermes's advice, freeing his men.  Odysseus and his men remained on the island for one year feasting and drinking wine. According to [[Homer]], Circe suggested to [[Odysseus]] two alternative routes to return to Ithaca: toward the &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; where King Aeolus reigned or passing between the dangerous [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]], conventionally identified with the [[Strait of Messina]]. She also advised Odysseus to go to the Underworld and gave him directions.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D475 10.475&amp;mdash;541].&lt;/ref&gt;

This adventure, like the story of the Cyclops, is a fairy tale of wide dispersion. In 1869 G.K.C. Gerland&lt;ref&gt;Gerland, ''Alt Griechische Märchen in der Odyssee: Ein Beitrag zur vergleichenden Mythologie'', 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the story makes part of the collection of Somadeva, [[Kathāsaritsāgara]], a store of Indian tales, of which 1200 AD is the approximate date. Circe appears as a Yackshini, and is conquered when an adventurer seizes her flute whose magic music turns men into beasts. The Indian Circe had the habit of eating the animals into which she transformed men.&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher and [[Andrew Lang]], ''The Odyssey of Homer'', 1890 (Project Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hesiod's Theogony===
Towards the end of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (1011f)  we find that Circe bore of Odysseus three sons: [[Ardeas]] or Agrius (otherwise unknown), [[Latinus]], and [[Telegonus]] who ruled over the Tyrsenoi, that is the [[Etruscans]].

===Other  literature===
Later poets generally only speak of Telegonus as Odysseus' son by Circe. When grown to manhood, later poets reported, she sent him to find [[Odysseus]], who had long since returned to his home on [[Ithaca]], but on arrival Telegonus accidentally killed his father. He brought the body back to Aeaea and took Odysseus' widow [[Penelope]] and son [[Telemachus]] with him. Circe made them immortal and married Telemachus, while Telegonus made Penelope his wife.

According to [[Lycophron]]'s ''Alexandra'' (808) and [[John Tzetzes]]' [[scholia]] on the poem (795 - 808), Circe used magical herbs to bring Odysseus back to life after he had been killed by Telegonus. Odysseus then married Telemachus to Circe's daughter Cassiphone. Some time later, Telemachus had a quarrel with his mother-in-law and killed her; Cassiphone then killed Telemachus to avenge her mother's death. On hearing of this, Odysseus died of grief. 

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1.72.5) cites [[Xenagoras]] the historian as claiming that [[Odysseus]] and Circe had three sons: Romus, Anteias, and Ardeias who respectively founded three cities called by their names: [[Rome]], [[Antium]], and [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]].

In later tales Circe turned [[Picus]] into a [[woodpecker]] for refusing her love, and [[Scylla]] into a monstrous creature with six dogs' heads when [[Glaucus]] (another object of Circe's affection) declared his undying love for her. She had one daughter: Aega, who was born from the ocean in a shield of ice.

Circe is referred to in Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'':
&quot;Virtue is like an enemy avoided by all, as is a serpent, through misfortune of place, or through bad habit that impels them, on which account they have so transformed their nature, the dwellers in the miserable valley, that it seems that Circe had them in her pasture.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare makes a reference to Circe in ''[[The Comedy of Errors]].'' When the Duke is listening to seemingly contradictory tales that arose due to confusion between identical twins, he says:
&quot;Why what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''The Comedy of Errors'' [http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=comedyerrors&amp;Act=5&amp;Scene=1&amp;Scope=scene&amp;LineHighlight=1707#1707 V.1.1707&amp;ndash;9].&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Calderon de la Barca]] composed a mythological spectacle play based on Ulysses entrapment in Circe's island. [[Love, the Greatest Enchantment]] was performed at [[Philip IV]]'s palace of the [[Buen Retiro]] in 1635.

[[Susanna Roxman]] has a poem called &quot;Circe&quot; in her poetry collection ''[[Imagining Seals]]'' (Dionysia Press, Edinburgh 2006-7).

==In ancient art==
Although some scenes from the ''Odyssey'' remained favorites of the vase-painters, notably the visually dramatic episode of Polyphemus, the Circe episode was rarely depicted. In describing an unusual miniature fifth-century Greek bronze in the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;Walters Art Museum, acc. no. 54.1483.&lt;/ref&gt; that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig, Dorothy Kent Hill expressed the artist's dilemma: how could an artist depict a man bewitched into a pig other than as a man with a pig's head? &quot;An author can discuss the mind and the voice, but an artist cannot show them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, &quot;Odysseus' Companions on Circe's Isle&quot; ''The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' '''4''' (1941:119-122) p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] bronze mirror relief, a common barnyard pig is depicted at the feet of Circe: Odysseus and Elpenor approach her, swords drawn. The subject would be obscure, save that the names of the characters are inscribed in the bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Hill 1941:120&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Boeotia]]n vase-paintings show a caricature version of the episode, acted out by dwarf pygmies with negroid attributes, and an aged and lame Odysseus leaning on a staff; they are the mute survivors of some rustic comedy tradition that is impenetrable to us.

== Modern interpretations ==
[[Image:Snowdrop Galanthus elwesii.jpg|thumb|right|Snowdrop, perhaps the herb [[moly]]]]
Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to [[anticholinergic]] intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plaitakis A, Duvoisin RC |title=Homer's moly identified as ''Galanthus nivalis L.'': physiologic antidote to stramonium poisoning |journal=Clin Neuropharmacol |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=1983 |month=March |pmid=6342763 |doi=10.1097/00002826-198303000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include [[amnesia]], [[hallucinations]], and [[delusions]]. The description of &quot;moly&quot; fits the [[snowdrop]], a [[flower]] of the region that contains [[galantamine]], which is an [[anticholinesterase]] and can therefore counteract anticholinergics.

==Eponyms==
The phrase &quot;[[:wikt:Circean poison|Circean poison]]&quot; has been used to refer to intoxicating things, such as applause.&lt;ref&gt;1907 edition of The Nuttall Encyclopaedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Circe effect&quot;, coined by the enzymologist William P. Jencks, refers to a scenario where an [[enzyme]] lures its [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] towards it through electrostatic forces exhibited by the enzyme molecule before transforming it into [[Product (business)|product]].  Where this takes place, the catalytic velocity (rate of reaction) of the enzyme may be significantly faster than that of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=9780716767664 |author=Jeremy M. Berg, John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer. |year=2006 |publisher=Freeman |location=New York, NY |title=Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Pacific Railway''' (CPR), formerly also known as '''CP Rail''' {{reporting mark|CP}} between 1968 and 1996, is a historic [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Class I railroad|Class I railway]] founded in 1881 and now operated by [[Canadian Pacific Railway Limited]], which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001. Its rail network serves major cities in the [[United States]], such as [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City]]. Its headquarters is in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. It owns approximately {{convert|14000|mi|-2}} route miles of track all across Canada and into the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canadian Pacific Railway |url=http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:bxyqbjunyrYJ:www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/Media/News/General/2009/Day%2Bof%2BMourning.htm+Canadian+Pacific+14,000-mile&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |title=Canadian Pacific trains across North America pause for day of mourning |publisher=74.125.95.132 |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; stretching from [[Montreal]] to [[Vancouver]], as far north as [[Edmonton]].

The company acquired two American lines in 2009: the [[Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad]] and the [[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad]]. The trackage of the [[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad|ICE]] was at one time part of CP subsidiary [[Soo Line Railroad|Soo Line]] and predecessor line [[The Milwaukee Road]]. The combined [[Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad|DME]]/[[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad|ICE]] system spanned [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Iowa]], as well as two short stretches into two other states, which included a line to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and a line to [[Chicago, Illinois]], and regulatory approval to build a line into the [[Powder River Basin]] of [[Wyoming]].

The [[rail transport|railway]] was originally built between eastern Canada and [[British Columbia]] between 1881 and 1885, (connecting with [[Ottawa Valley]] and [[Georgian Bay]] area lines built earlier), fulfilling a promise extended to British Columbia when it entered [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1871. It was Canada's first [[transcontinental railroad|transcontinental railway]], but currently does not reach the Atlantic coast. Primarily a [[freight]] railway, the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long-distance [[passenger train|passenger]] [[transport]] in most regions of Canada, and was instrumental in the [[colonization|settlement]] and [[economic development|development]] of [[Western Canada]]. The CP became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada, a position it held as late as 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.uwo.ca/business/200TopCompanies.html| title=The Top 200: Canada's Largest Companies (c1973-74)| publisher=Western Libraries at The University of Western Ontario| year=2008| accessdate=April 8, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080223151834/http://www.lib.uwo.ca/business/200TopCompanies.html |archivedate = February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986, after being assumed by [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]] in 1978. A [[beaver]] was chosen as the railway's logo because it is one of the national symbols of Canada and represents the hardworking character of the company. The object of both praise and condemnation for over 120 years, the CPR remains an indisputable icon of [[Canadian nationalism]].

The Canadian Pacific Railway is a public company with over 15,000 employees and market capitalization of US $7 billion in 2008.&lt;ref name=zenobank&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zenobank.com/index.php?symbol=CA;CP&amp;page=quotesearch|title=Company Profile for Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CA;CP) |accessdate=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Creation of the Canadian Pacific Railway was a task originally undertaken for a combination of reasons by the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]]. [[British Columbia]] had insisted upon a transport link to the east as a condition for joining the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] of [[Canada]] (initially requesting a wagon road). The government however, proposed to build a railway linking the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[Canadian province|province]] to the eastern provinces within 10 years of July 20, 1871. Macdonald also saw it as essential to the creation of a unified Canadian nation that would stretch across the continent. Moreover, [[manufacturing]] interests in [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] desired access to sources of [[raw material]]s and [[market]]s in [[Western Canada|Canada's west]].
[[Image:JaMAC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Sir John A. Macdonald]].]]
The first obstacle to its construction was economic. The logical route went through the American [[Midwest]] and the city of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. In addition to this was the difficulty of building a railroad through the [[Canadian Rockies]], an entirely Canadian route would require crossing 1,600&amp;nbsp;km (1,000 miles) of rugged terrain of the barren [[Canadian Shield]] and [[muskeg]] of [[Northern Ontario]]. To ensure this routing, the government offered huge incentives including vast grants of land in Western Canada.

In 1872, Sir John A. Macdonald and other high-ranking politicians, bribed in the [[Pacific Scandal]], granted federal contracts to [[Hugh Allan]]'s &quot;Canada Pacific Railway Company&quot; (which was unrelated to the current company) and to the Inter-Ocean Railway Company. Because of this scandal, the Conservative party was removed from office in 1873. The new [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] prime minister, [[Alexander Mackenzie]], began construction of segments of the railway as a public enterprise under the supervision of the Department of Public Works. The [[Thunder Bay District, Ontario|Thunder Bay]] branch linking [[Lake Superior]] to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], was commenced in 1875. Progress was discouragingly slow because of the lack of public money. With Sir John A. Macdonald's return to power on October 16, 1878, a more aggressive construction policy was adopted. Macdonald confirmed that [[Port Moody, British Columbia|Port Moody]] would be the terminus of the transcontinental railway, and announced that the railway would follow the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] and [[Thompson River|Thompson]] rivers between Port Moody and [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]]. In 1879, the federal government floated bonds in London and called for tenders to construct the 206&amp;nbsp;km (128 mile) section of the railway from [[Yale, British Columbia]], to [[Savona's Ferry, British Columbia|Savona's Ferry]], on [[Kamloops Lake]]. The contract was awarded to [[Andrew Onderdonk]], whose men started work on May 15, 1880. After the completion of that section, Onderdonk received contracts to build between Yale and Port Moody, and between Savona's Ferry and [[Eagle Pass, British Columbia|Eagle Pass]].

On October 21, 1880, a new syndicate, unrelated to Hugh Allan's, signed a contract with the Macdonald government. They agreed to build the railway in exchange for [[Canadian dollar|$]]25 million (approximately $625 million in modern Canadian dollars) in credit from the Canadian government and a grant of 25 million acres (100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land. The government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed under government ownership. The government also defrayed surveying costs and exempted the railway from property taxes for 20 years. The Montreal-based syndicate officially comprised five men: [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]], [[James J. Hill]], [[Duncan McIntyre (businessman)|Duncan McIntyre]], [[Richard B. Angus]] and [[John Stewart Kennedy]]. [[Donald Alexander Smith|Donald A. Smith]] and [[Norman Kittson]] were unofficial silent partners with a significant financial interest. On February 15, 1881, legislation confirming the contract received [[royal assent]], and the [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific Railway Company]] was formally [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] the next day.

===Building the railway, 1881–1885===

The Canadian Pacific Railway began its westward expansion from [[Bonfield, Ontario]] (previously called Callander Station) where the first spike was driven into a sunken railway tie. Bonfield was inducted into Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 as the CPR First Spike location. That was the point where the [http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2005_2.html Canada Central Railway] extension ended. The CCR was owned by Duncan McIntyre who amalgamated it with the CPR and became one of the handful of officers of the newly formed CPR. The CCR started in Brockville and extended to Pembroke. It then followed a westward route along the Ottawa River passing through places like Cobden, Deux-Rivières, and eventually to Mattawa at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers. It then proceeded cross-country towards its final destination Bonfield (previously called Callander Station). Duncan McIntyre and his contractor James Worthington piloted the CPR expansion. Worthington continued on as the construction superintendent for the CPR past Bonfield. He remained with the CPR for about a year until he left the company. McIntyre was uncle to John Ferguson who staked out future North Bay after getting assurance from his uncle and Worthington that it would be the divisional and a location of some importance.

It was assumed that the railway would travel through the rich &quot;Fertile Belt&quot; of the [[North Saskatchewan River]] valley and cross the [[Rocky Mountains]] via the [[Yellowhead Pass]], a route suggested by [[Sir Sandford Fleming]] based on a decade of work. However, the CPR quickly discarded this plan in favour of a more southerly route across the arid [[Palliser's Triangle]] in [[Saskatchewan]] and via [[Kicking Horse Pass]] and down the [[Field Hill]] to the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]]. This route was more direct and closer to the American border, making it easier for the CPR to keep American railways from encroaching on the Canadian market. However, this route also had several disadvantages.

One consequence was that the CPR would need to find a route through the [[Selkirk Mountains]], as at the time it was not known whether a route even existed. The job of finding a pass was assigned to a [[surveying|surveyor]] named [[Major]] [[Albert Bowman Rogers]]. The CPR promised him a [[cheque]] for $5,000 and that the pass would be named in his honour. Rogers became obsessed with finding the pass that would immortalize his name. He discovered the pass in April 1881,&lt;ref&gt;Martin J, Edward. The Railway Stations of Western Canada. Canada: Studio E. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Art|title=Incredible Rogers Pass|publisher=Heritage|location=Surrey, BC|year=1980|edition=2|page=49|isbn=9780919214088}}&lt;/ref&gt; and true to its word, the CPR named the pass &quot;[[Rogers Pass]]&quot; and gave him the cheque. This however, he at first refused to cash, preferring to frame it, and saying he did not do it for the money. He later agreed to cash it with the promise of an engraved watch.

Another obstacle was that the proposed route crossed land was controlled by the [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nation]]. This difficulty was overcome when a [[missionary]] [[priest]], [[Albert Lacombe]], persuaded the Blackfoot chief [[Crowfoot]] that construction of the railway was inevitable. In return for his assent, Crowfoot was famously rewarded with a lifetime pass to ride the CPR. A more lasting consequence of the choice of route was that, unlike the one proposed by Fleming, the land surrounding the railway often proved too arid for successful [[agriculture]]. The CPR may have placed too much reliance on a report from [[natural history|naturalist]] [[John Macoun]], who had crossed the [[prairie]]s at a time of very high rainfall and had reported that the area was fertile.

The greatest disadvantage of the route was in Kicking Horse Pass. In the first 6&amp;nbsp;km (3.7 miles) west of the 1,625 metre (5,330&amp;nbsp;ft) high summit, the [[Kicking Horse River]] drops 350 metres (1,150&amp;nbsp;ft). The steep drop would force the cash-strapped CPR to build a 7&amp;nbsp;km (4.5 mile) long stretch of track with a very steep 4.5 percent gradient once it reached the pass in 1884. This was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era, and even modern railways rarely exceed a 2 percent gradient. However, this route was far more direct than one through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] and saved hours for both passengers and freight. This section of track was the CPR's [[Big Hill]]. Safety switches were installed at several points, the speed limit for descending trains was set at 10&amp;nbsp;km per hour (6&amp;nbsp;mph), and special [[locomotive]]s were ordered. Despite these measures, several serious runaways still occurred. CPR officials insisted that this was a temporary expediency, but this state of affairs would last for 25 years until the completion of the [[Big Hill#The Spiral Tunnels|Spiral Tunnels]] in the early 20th century.

[[Image:William Cornelius Van Horne.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Sir William Cornelius Van Horne.]]

In 1881 construction progressed at a pace too slow for the railway's officials, who in 1882 hired the renowned railway executive [[William Cornelius Van Horne]], to oversee construction with the inducement of a generous salary and the intriguing challenge of handling such a difficult railway project. Van Horne stated that he would have 800&amp;nbsp;km (500 miles) of main line built in 1882. [[Flood]]s delayed the start of the construction season, but over 672&amp;nbsp;km (417 miles) of main line, as well as various sidings and branch lines, were built that year. The Thunder Bay branch (west from [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]]) was completed in June 1882 by the Department of Railways and Canals and turned over to the company in May 1883, permitting all-Canadian lake and rail traffic from eastern Canada to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], for the first time in Canada's history. By the end of 1883, the railway had reached the Rocky Mountains, just eight km (5 miles) east of Kicking Horse Pass. The construction seasons of 1884 and 1885 would be spent in the mountains of British Columbia and on the north shore of [[Lake Superior]].

Many thousands of [[navvy|navvies]] worked on the railway. Many were European immigrants. In British Columbia, the CPR hired workers from [[China]], called [[coolies]]. A navvy received between $1 and $2.50 per day, but had to pay for his own food, clothing, transportation to the job site, mail and medical care. After 2-1/2 months of back-breaking labour, they could net as little as $16. Chinese coolies in British Columbia made only between 75 cents and $1.25 a day, paid in [[rice mat]]s, and not including expenses, leaving barely anything to send home. They did the most dangerous construction jobs, such as working with [[explosive material|explosives]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The families of the Chinese who were killed received no compensation, or even notification of loss of life. Many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in China, although Chinese labour contractors had promised that as part of their responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[''Beyond the Sterile Mountains: the Chinese in British Columbia'', Joseph Morton, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Many spent years in lonely, sad and often poor conditions. Yet the Chinese were hard working and played a key role in building the western stretch of the railway; even some boys as young as 12 years old served as tea-boys. In 2006 the Canadian government issued a formal apology to the Chinese population in Canada for their treatment both during and following the construction of the CPR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=2&amp;id=1220|22 June 2006, Prime Minister Harper's speech to the Canadian Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1883, railway construction was progressing rapidly, but the CPR was in danger of running out of funds. In response, on January 31, 1884, the government passed the Railway Relief Bill, providing a further $22.5 million in loans to the CPR. The bill received royal assent on March 6, 1884.

[[Image:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Donald Smith, later known as [[Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]], drives the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway, at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]], November 7, 1885. Completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] was a condition of BC's entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]

In March 1885, the [[North-West Rebellion]] broke out in the [[District of Saskatchewan]]. Van Horne, in [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]] at the time, suggested to the government that the CPR could transport troops to [[Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan|Qu'Appelle]], [[District of Assiniboia|Assiniboia]], in 10 days. Some sections of track were incomplete or had not been used before, but the trip to Winnipeg was made in nine days and the rebellion was quickly put down. Perhaps because the government was grateful for this service, they subsequently re-organized the CPR's debt and provided a further $5 million loan. This money was desperately needed by the CPR. On November 7, 1885, the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] was driven at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia]], making good on the original promise. Four days earlier, the last spike of the Lake Superior section was driven in just west of [[Jackfish, Ontario]]. While the railway was completed four years after the original 1881 deadline, it was completed more than five years ahead of the new date of 1891 that Macdonald gave in 1881.

The successful construction of such a massive project, although troubled by delays and scandal, was considered an impressive feat of engineering and political will for a country with such a small population, limited capital, and difficult terrain. It was by far the longest railway ever constructed at the time. It had taken 12,000 men, 5,000 horses and 300 dog-sled teams to build the railway.

Meanwhile, in Eastern Canada, the CPR had created a network of lines reaching from [[Quebec City]] to [[St. Thomas, Ontario]] by 1885, and had launched a fleet of Great Lakes ships to link its terminals. The CPR had effected purchases and long-term [[leasing|leases]] of several railways through an associated railway company, the [[Ontario and Quebec Railway]] (O&amp;Q). The O&amp;Q built a line between [[Perth, Ontario]], and [[Toronto]] (completed on May 5, 1884) to connect these acquisitions. The CPR obtained a 999-year lease on the O&amp;Q on January 4, 1884. Later, in 1895, it acquired a minority interest in the [[Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway]], giving it a link to New York and the northeast United States.

===1886–1900===
So many cost-cutting shortcuts were taken in constructing the railway that regular transcontinental service could not start for another seven months while work was done to improve the railway's condition (part of this was due to snow in the mountains and lack of snowsheds to keep the line open). However, had these shortcuts not been taken, it is conceivable that the CPR might have had to default financially, leaving the railway unfinished. The first transcontinental passenger train departed from Montreal's [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]], located at Berri Street and Notre Dame Street at 8 p.m. on June 28, 1886, and arrived at [[Port Moody]] at noon on July 4, 1886. This train consisted of two baggage cars, a mail car, one second-class coach, two immigrant sleepers, two first-class coaches, two sleeping cars and a diner (several dining cars were used throughout the journey, as they were removed from the train during the night, and another one was picked in the morning).

[[Image:Canadian Pacific First Train.jpg|thumb|300px|left|First Transcontinental Train arrives in Port Arthur on June 30, 1886]]

By that time, however, the CPR had decided to move its western terminus from [[Port Moody]] to [[Gastown]], which was renamed &quot;Vancouver&quot; later that year. The first official train destined for Vancouver arrived on May 23, 1887, although the line had already been in use for three months. The CPR quickly became profitable, and all loans from the Federal government were repaid years ahead of time.

In 1888, a branch line was opened between [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] where the CPR connected with the American railway system and its own [[steamship]]s. That same year, work was started on a line from [[London, Ontario]], to the American border at [[Windsor, Ontario]]. That line opened on June 12, 1890.

The CPR also leased the [[New Brunswick Railway]] in 1890 for 990 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1988/1988rcs2-654/1988rcs2-654.html ''Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Paul''], [1988] 2 S.C.R. 654 (December 15, 1988) . Retrieved October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and built the [[International Railway of Maine]], connecting Montreal with [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], in 1889. The connection with Saint John on the Atlantic coast made the CPR the first truly transcontinental railway company in Canada and permitted trans-Atlantic cargo and passenger services to continue year-round when [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] closed the port of Montreal during the winter months.

By 1896, competition with the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] for traffic in southern British Columbia forced the CPR to construct a second line across the province, south of the original line. Van Horne, now [[president]] of the CPR, asked for government aid, and the government agreed to provide around $3.6 million to construct a railway from [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]], through [[Crowsnest Pass]] to the south shore of [[Kootenay Lake]], in exchange for the CPR agreeing to reduce freight rates in perpetuity for key commodities shipped in Western Canada. The controversial Crowsnest Pass Agreement effectively locked the eastbound rate on [[cereal|grain]] products and westbound rates on certain &quot;settlers' effects&quot; at the 1897 level. Although temporarily suspended during [[World War I]], it was not until 1983 that the &quot;[[Crow Rate]]&quot; was permanently replaced by the Western Grain Transportation Act which allowed for the gradual increase of grain shipping prices. The Crowsnest Pass line opened on June 18, 1899, and followed a complicated route through the maze of valleys and passes in southern British Columbia, rejoining the original mainline at [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] after crossing the [[Cascade Mountains]] via [[Coquihalla Pass]].

The Southern Mainline, generally known as the [[Kettle Valley Railway]] in British Columbia, was built in response to the booming mining and smelting economy in southern British Columbia, and the tendency of the local geography to encourage and enable easier access from neighbouring US states than from Vancouver or the rest of Canada, which was viewed to be as much of a threat to national security as it was to the province's control of its own resources. The main cross-country passenger service was re-routed to this new southerly line, which connected numerous emergent small cities across the region. Independent railways and subsidiaries that were eventually merged into the CPR in connection with this route were the [[Shuswap and Okanagan Railway]], the [[Kaslo and Slocan Railway]], the [[Columbia and Kootenay Railway]], the [[Columbia and Western Railway]] and various others.

====The CPR and the settlement of Western Canada====
[[Image:Land Ticket.jpg|thumb|One of the CPR's land offerings.]]

Practically speaking, the CPR had built a railway that operated mostly in the wilderness. The usefulness of the Prairies was questionable in the minds of many. The thinking prevailed that the Prairies had great potential. Under the initial contract with the Canadian Government to build the railway, the CPR was granted 25 million acres (100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Proving already to be a very resourceful organization, Canadian Pacific began an intense campaign to bring immigrants to Canada.

Canadian Pacific agents operated in many overseas locations. Immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a CP ship, travel on a CP train, and land sold by the CP railway. Land was priced at $2.50 an acre and up. Immigrants paid very little for a seven-day journey to the West. They rode in Colonist cars that had sleeping facilities and a small kitchen at one end of the car. Children were not allowed off the train, lest they wander off and be left behind. The directors of the CPR knew that not only were they creating a nation, but also a long-term source of revenue for their company.

===1901–1928===
During the first decade of the 20th century, the CPR continued to build more lines. In 1908 the CPR opened a line connecting Toronto with [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]. Previously, westbound traffic originating in [[southern Ontario]] took a circuitous route through [[eastern Ontario]].

Several operational improvements were also made to the railway in [[Western Canada]]. In 1909 the CPR completed two significant [[engineering]] accomplishments. The most significant was the replacement of the Big Hill, which had become a major bottleneck in the CPR's main line, with the [[Big Hill|Spiral Tunnels]], reducing the grade to 2.2 percent from 4.5 percent. The Spiral Tunnels opened in August. On November 3, 1909, the [[Lethbridge Viaduct]] over the [[Oldman River]] valley at [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]], was opened. It is 1,624 metres (5,327&amp;nbsp;ft) long and, at its maximum, 96 metres (314&amp;nbsp;ft) high, making it the longest railway bridge in Canada. In 1916 the CPR replaced its line through [[Rogers Pass]], which was prone to [[avalanche]]s (the [[1910 Rogers Pass avalanche|most serious of which]] killed 62 men in 1910) with the [[Connaught Tunnel]], an eight km (5 mile) long tunnel under [[Mount Macdonald]] that was, at the time of its opening, the longest railway tunnel in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

The CPR acquired several smaller railways via long-term leases in 1912. On January 3, 1912, the CPR acquired the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]], a railway that ran in western [[Nova Scotia]]. This acquisition gave the CPR a connection to [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], a significant port on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The Dominion Atlantic was isolated from the rest of the CPR network and used the CNR to facilitate interchange; the DAR also operated ferry services across the [[Bay of Fundy]] for passengers and cargo (but not rail cars) from the port of [[Digby, Nova Scotia]], to the CPR at [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. DAR steamships also provided connections for passengers and cargo between [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]], [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]].

On July 1, 1912, the CPR acquired the [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]], a railway on [[Vancouver Island]] that connected to the CPR using a railcar ferry. The CPR also acquired the [[Quebec Central Railway]] on December 14, 1912.

During the late 19th century, the railway undertook an ambitious program of hotel construction, building the [[Château Frontenac]] in [[Quebec City]], the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] in Toronto, the [[Banff Springs Hotel]], and several other major Canadian landmarks. By then, the CPR had competition from three other transcontinental lines, all of them money-losers. In 1919, these lines were consolidated, along with the track of the old [[Intercolonial Railway]] and its spurs, into the government-owned [[Canadian National Railways]].

The CPR suffered its greatest loss of life when one of its steamships, the [[RMS Empress of Ireland|''Empress of Ireland'']], sank after a collision with the Norwegian collier ''[[SS Storstad]].'' On 29 May 1914, the ''Empress'' (operated by the CPR's [[CP Ships|Canadian Pacific Steamship Company]], went down in the [[St Lawrence River]] on 29 May 1914 with the loss of 1,024 lives, of which 840 were passengers.

When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, the CPR devoted resources to the war effort, and managed to stay profitable while its competitors struggled to remain solvent. After the war, the Federal government created [[Canadian National Railway]]s (CNR, later CN) out of several bankrupt railways that fell into government hands during and after the war. CNR would become the main competitor to the CPR in Canada.

===The Great Depression and World War II, 1929–1945===
[[Image:Kamloops on to Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Strikers from unemployment relief camps climbing on boxcars as part of the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]], 1935.]]
The [[Great Depression]], which lasted from 1929 until 1939, hit many companies heavily. While the CPR was affected, it was not affected to the extent of its rival CNR because it, unlike the CNR, was debt-free. The CPR scaled back on some of its passenger and freight services, and stopped issuing dividends to its shareholders after 1932.

Hard times led to the creation of new political parties such as the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit movement]] and the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]], as well as popular protest in the form of the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The On-to-Ottawa Trek|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/onottawa.html |publisher=The University of Calgary (The Applied History Research Group)|year=1997|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One highlight of the 1930s, both for the railway and for Canada, was the visit of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] to Canada in 1939, the first time that the reigning monarch had visited the country. The CPR and the CNR shared the honours of pulling the royal train across the country, with the CPR undertaking the westbound journey from Quebec City to Vancouver.

Later that year, [[World War II]] began. As it had done in [[World War I]], the CPR devoted much of its resources to the war effort. It retooled its [[Angus Shops]] in Montreal to produce [[Valentine tank]]s, and transported troops and resources across the country. As well, 22 of the CPR's ships went to war, 12 of which were sunk.

===1946–1978===
[[Image:CP-Rail-logo.png|thumb|170px|right|The logo used from 1971 to 1994 when it fell out of use. Often referred to as the '[[Pac-Man]]' logo named after the popular 80s video game of the same name.]]
After World War II, the transportation industry in [[Canada]] changed. Where railways had previously provided almost universal freight and passenger services, [[automobile|cars]], [[truck]]s, and [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplanes]] started to take traffic away from railways. This naturally helped the CPR's air and trucking operations, and the railway's freight operations continued to thrive hauling resource traffic and bulk commodities. However, passenger trains quickly became unprofitable.
During the 1950s, the railway introduced new innovations in passenger service, and in 1955 introduced ''[[The Canadian]],'' a new luxury transcontinental train. However, starting in the 1960s the company started to pull out of passenger services, ending services on many of its branch lines. It also discontinued its secondary transcontinental train ''[[The Dominion (passenger train)|The Dominion]]'' in 1966, and in 1970 unsuccessfully applied to discontinue ''The Canadian.'' For the next eight years, it continued to apply to discontinue the service, and service on ''The Canadian'' declined markedly. On October 29, 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to [[Via Rail]], a new federal [[Crown corporation]] that is responsible for managing all intercity passenger service formerly handled by both CP Rail and CN. Via eventually took almost all of its passenger trains, including ''The Canadian,'' off CP's lines.

In 1968, as part of a corporate re-organization, each of the CPR's major operations, including its rail operations, were organized as separate subsidiaries. The name of the railway was changed to CP Rail, and the parent company changed its name to [[Canadian Pacific Limited]] in 1971. Its express, telecommunications, hotel and real estate holdings were spun off, and ownership of all of the companies transferred to Canadian Pacific Investments. The company discarded its beaver logo, adopting the new [[Multimark]] logo that could be used for each of its operations.

===1979–present===
In 1984 CP Rail commenced construction of the [[Mount Macdonald Tunnel]] to augment the [[Connaught Tunnel]] under the [[Selkirk Mountains]]. The first revenue train passed through the tunnel in 1988. At 14.7&amp;nbsp;km (nine miles), it is the longest tunnel in the [[Americas]].

During the 1980s, the [[Soo Line Railroad]], in which CP Rail still owned a controlling interest, underwent several changes. It acquired the [[Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway]] in 1982. Then on February 21, 1985, the Soo Line obtained a controlling interest in the [[Milwaukee Road]], merging it into its system on January 1, 1986. Also in 1980 Canadian Pacific bought out the controlling interests of the [[Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway]] (TH&amp;B) from [[Conrail]] and molded it into the Canadian Pacific System, dissolving the TH&amp;B's name from the books in 1985. In 1987 most of CPR's trackage in the [[Great Lakes]] region, including much of the original Soo Line, were spun off into a new railway, the [[Wisconsin Central Ltd.|Wisconsin Central]], which was subsequently purchased by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]]. Influenced by the [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] of 1989 which liberalized [[trade]] between the two nations, the CPR's expansion continued during the early 1990s: CP Rail gained full control of the Soo Line in 1990, and bought the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] in 1991. These two acquisitions gave CP Rail routes to the major American cities of Chicago (via the Soo Line) and New York City (via the D&amp;H).

During the next few years CP Rail downsized its route, and several Canadian [[branch line]]s and even some secondary mainlines were either sold to [[short line railroad|short lines]] or abandoned. This rationalization, however, came at a price, as many grain elevators in the region known as [[Canada]]'s [[Breadbasket]] shut down due to not being able to distribute their thousands of bushels of grain through a large enough region. This included all of its lines east of Montreal, with the routes operating across Maine and New Brunswick to the port of Saint John (operating as the [[Canadian Atlantic Railway]]) being sold or abandoned, severing CPR's transcontinental status (in Canada); the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in the late 1950s, coupled with subsidized icebreaking services, made Saint John surplus to CPR's requirements. During the 1990s, both CP Rail and CN attempted unsuccessfully to buy out the eastern assets of the other, so as to permit further rationalization. As well, it closed divisional and regional offices, drastically reduced white collar staff, and consolidated its Canadian traffic control system in Calgary, Alberta.

[[Image:CP RAIL TBAY.JPG|thumb|left|200px|CP Rail [[SD90MAC]] locomotive in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario.]]

Finally, in 1996, reflecting the increased importance of western traffic to the railway, CP Rail moved its head office to Calgary from Montreal and changed its name back to Canadian Pacific Railway. A new [[subsidiary]] company, the [[St. Lawrence and Hudson Railway]], was created to operate its money-losing lines in eastern North America, covering [[Quebec]], Southern and [[Eastern Ontario]], trackage rights to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], as well as the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] in the [[U.S. Northeast]]. However, the new subsidiary, threatened with being sold off and free to innovate, quickly spun off losing track to short lines, instituted scheduled freight service, and produced an unexpected turn-around in profitability. After only four years, CPR revised its opinion and the StL&amp;H formally re-amalgamated with its parent on January 1, 2001.

In 2001, the CPR's parent company, [[Canadian Pacific Limited]], spun off its five subsidiaries, including the CPR, into independent companies. Canadian Pacific Railway formally (but, not legally) shortened its name to Canadian Pacific in early 2007, dropping the word &quot;railway&quot; in order to reflect more operational flexibility. Shortly after the name revision, Canadian Pacific announced that it had committed to becoming a major sponsor and logistics provider to the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, British Columbia.

On September 4, 2007, CPR announced it was acquiring the [[Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad]] from its present owners, London-based [[Electra Private Equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Goldfarb| first=Jeffrey| coauthors=Reuters| title=CP Rail to Buy DM&amp;E For At Least $1.5 Billion| work=nytimes.com| date=September 5, 2007| url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-canadianpacific-dme.html| accessdate=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction is an &quot;end-to-end&quot; consolidation,&lt;ref name = DME/&gt;&lt;ref name = FactSheet&gt;{{cite web| title=Investor Fact Sheet| publisher=CP Rail| date=September 4, 2007| url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/NR/rdonlyres/ec3c6wd6efofuuztmcmcij22zo3bqpmdmli4uhfrqtwzhfedixtot5s5tkxdgarkp7cjgbzujkci5xzrpxdhtmtdj5g/Investor+Fact+Sheet+09_04_07.pdf| accessdate=September 5, 2007|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926001206/http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/NR/rdonlyres/ec3c6wd6efofuuztmcmcij22zo3bqpmdmli4uhfrqtwzhfedixtot5s5tkxdgarkp7cjgbzujkci5xzrpxdhtmtdj5g/Investor+Fact+Sheet+09_04_07.pdf |archivedate = September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will give CPR access to U.S. shippers of agricultural products, ethanol, and coal. CPR has stated its intention to use this purchase to gain access to the rich coal fields of [[Wyoming]]'s [[Powder River Basin]].

==Freight trains==
[[Image:Carlb-brockville-cptrain.jpg|thumb|right|200px|CPR [[caboose]] on display at [[Brockville, Ontario]].]]
Over half of CP's freight traffic is in [[coal]], grain, and [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] freight, and the vast majority of its profits are made in western Canada. A major shift in trade from the Atlantic to the Pacific has caused serious drops in CPR's wheat shipments through [[Thunder Bay]]. It also ships automotive parts and assembled automobiles, [[sulphur]], [[fertilizer]]s, other [[chemical]]s, forest products, and other types of commodities. The busiest part of its railway network is along its main line between Calgary and Vancouver.

Since 1970, coal has become a major commodity hauled by CPR. Coal is shipped in [[unit train]]s from coal mines in the mountains, most notably [[Sparwood, British Columbia]] to terminals at [[Roberts Bank]] and [[North Vancouver, British Columbia|North Vancouver]], from where it is then shipped to [[Japan]]. The CPR hauls over 34 million tons of coal to the west coast each year, mainly for export to Japan.

Grain is hauled by the CPR from the prairies to ports at Thunder Bay (the former cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]), Quebec City and Vancouver, where it is then shipped overseas. The traditional winter export port was West Saint John, New Brunswick when ice closed the St. Lawrence River. Grain has always been a significant commodity hauled by the CPR; between 1905 and 1909, the CPR double-tracked its section of track between [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] (Which is today part of the city of [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]]) and [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] to facilitate grain shipments. For several decades this was the only long stretch of double-track mainline outside of urban areas on the CPR. Today, though the Thunder Bay-Winnipeg section is now single tracked, the CPR still has two long distance double track lines serving rural areas, including a 75-mile stretch between [[Kent, British Columbia]] and [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] which follows the [[Fraser River]] into the western part of the [[Canadian Rockies]], as well as the Canadian Pacific Winchester Sub, a 100-mile stretch of double track mainline which runs from [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]] through downtown [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]] which runs through many rural farming communities.

In 1952, the CPR became the first North American railway to introduce [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] or &quot;piggyback&quot; [[freight]] service, where truck trailers are carried on [[flat car]]s. Containers later replaced most piggyback service. In 1996, the CPR introduced a scheduled reservation-only short-haul intermodal service between Montreal and West Toronto called the ''Iron Highway''; it utilized unique equipment that was later replaced (1999) by conventional piggyback flatcars and renamed ''Expressway''. This service was extended to Detroit with plans to reach Chicago however CP was unable to locate a suitable terminal. Loss of the small Detroit terminal and low US traffic along with loss of the Chrysler Windsor traffic it was later cut back to Milton, west of Toronto.

==Passenger trains==
The train was the primary mode of long-distance transportation in Canada until the 1960s. Among the many types of people who rode CPR trains were new immigrants heading for the prairies, military troops (especially during the two world wars) and upper class tourists. It also custom-built many of its [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] at its [[CPR Angus Shops]] to be able to meet the demands of the upper class.
[[Image:Angus.JPG|thumb|200px|right|An Angus Shops building converted into an [[Société des alcools du Québec|SAQ]] liquor store.]]
The CPR also had a line of Great Lakes ships integrated into its transcontinental service. From 1885 until 1912, these ships linked Owen Sound on Georgian Bay to Fort William. Following a major fire in December 1911 that destroyed the grain elevator, operations were relocated to a new, larger port created by the CPR at Port McNicoll opening in May 1912. Five ships allowed daily service, and included the S.S. ''Assiniboia'', and S.S. ''Keewatin'' built in 1908 which remained in use until the end of service. Travellers went by train from Toronto to that Georgian Bay port, then travelled by ship to link with another train at the Lakehead. After [[World War II]], the trains and ships carried automobiles as well as passengers. This service featured what was to become the last [[boat train]] in North America. The ''Steam Boat'' was a fast, direct connecting train between Toronto and Port McNicoll. The passenger service was discontinued at the end of season in 1965 with one ship, the ''Keewatin'', carrying on in freight service for two more years. It later became a marine museum in the United States.

After World War II, passenger traffic declined as automobiles and aeroplanes became more common, but the CPR continued to innovate in an attempt to keep ridership up. Beginning November 9, 1953, the CPR introduced [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]s (RDCs) on many of its lines. Officially called &quot;Dayliners&quot; by the CPR, they were always referred to as ''Budd Cars'' by employees. Greatly reduced travel times and reduced costs resulted, which saved service on many lines for a number of years. The CPR would go on to acquire the second largest fleet of RDCs totaling 52 cars. Only the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] had more. This CPR fleet also included the rare model RDC-4 (which consisted of a mail section at one end and a baggage section at the other end with no formal passenger section). On April 24, 1955, the CPR introduced a new luxury transcontinental passenger train, ''The Canadian''. The train provided service between Vancouver and Toronto or Montreal (east of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]; the train was in two sections). The train, which operated on an expedited schedule, was pulled by [[diesel locomotives]], and used new, streamlined, stainless steel rolling stock.

Starting in the 1960s, however, the railway started to discontinue much of its passenger service, particularly on its branch lines. For example, passenger service ended on its line through southern [[British Columbia]] and [[Crowsnest Pass]] in January 1964, and on its [[Quebec Central]] in April 1967, and the transcontinental train ''The Dominion'' was dropped in January 1966. On October 29, 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to [[Via Rail]], a new federal Crown corporation that was now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on January 15, 1990. This ended service by &quot;The Canadian&quot; over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former &quot;Super Continental&quot; route via Canadian National without a change of name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the January 15, 1990, cuts, the surviving &quot;Canadian&quot; was (and is) only a three-times-weekly operation.

In addition to inter-city passenger services, the CPR also provided [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] services in Montreal. CP Rail introduced Canada's first [[Bilevel car|bi-level passenger cars]] here in 1970. On October 1, 1982, the [[Société de transport de Montréal|Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission]] (STCUM) assumed responsibility for the commuter services previously provided by CP Rail. It continues under the [[Agence métropolitaine de transport|Metropolitan Transportation Agency]] (AMT).
[[File:Westcoast.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The West Coast Express at Waterfront Station, Vancouver.]]
Canadian Pacific Railway currently operates three commuter services under contract. The [[West Coast Express]] comprises ten daily trains between downtown Vancouver and its eastern suburbs on behalf of [[TransLink (Vancouver)|TransLink]], a regional transit authority. [[GO Transit]] contracts CPR to operate six return trips between Milton and downtown Toronto in Ontario. In Montreal, 59 daily commuter trains run on CPR lines from [[Lucien-L'Allier (AMT)|Lucien-L'Allier Station]] to [[Delson-Candiac Line (AMT)|Candiac]], [[Dorion-Rigaud Line (AMT)|Rigaud]] and [[Blainville-Saint-Jerome Line (AMT)|Blainville–Saint-Jerome]] on behalf of the AMT.

The [[Rocky Mountaineer]] excursion train is also crewed (Engineer and Conductor) by CP employees where it operates on their right of way.

===Sleeping, Dining and Parlour Car Department===

[[Sleeping car]]s were operated by a separate department of the railway that included the dining and parlour cars and aptly named as the Sleeping, Dining and Parlour Car Department.

The CPR decided from the very beginning that it would operate its own sleeping cars, unlike railways in the United States that depended upon independent companies that specialized in providing cars and porters, including building the cars themselves. Pullman was long a famous name in this regard; its [[Pullman Company#Porters|Pullman porters]] were legendary. Other early companies included the [[Wagner Palace Car Company]]. Bigger-sized berths and more comfortable surroundings were built by order of the CPR's General Manager, [[William Van Horne]], who was a large man himself. Providing and operating their own cars allowed better control of the service provided as well as keeping all of the revenue received, although profit was never a direct result of providing food to passengers. Rather, it was the realization that those who could afford to travel great distances expected such facilities and their favourable opinion would bode well to attracting others to Canada and the CPR's trains.

This department also operated the news service which provided the news agents on passenger trains, who sold small refreshments and many other items such as playing cards to travellers, who might otherwise be unable to afford the higher priced [[dining car]] meals. The news service also operated lunch counters in medium-sized stations at key points (there were 19 of them east of Winnipeg) while the large terminal stations had dining rooms operated directly by the Dining Car Department (for example, the Alouette Room in Montreal's [[Windsor Station (Montreal)]] and the Pacific Room in the Vancouver station).

==Express==
W. C. Van Horne decided from the very beginning that the CPR would retain as much revenue from its various operations as it could. This translated into keeping express, telegraph, sleeping car and other lines of business for themselves, creating separate departments or companies as necessary. This was necessary as the fledgling railway would need all the income it could get, and in addition, he saw some of these ancillary operations such as express and telegraph as being quite profitable. Others such as sleeping and dining cars were kept in order to provide better control over the quality of service being provided to passengers. Hotels were likewise crucial to the CPR’s growth by attracting travellers.

'''Dominion Express Company''' was formed independently in 1873 before the CPR itself, although train service did not begin until the summer of 1882 at which time it operated over some {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track from Rat Portage (Kenora) Ontario west to Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was soon absorbed into the CPR and expanded everywhere the CPR went. It was renamed '''Canadian Express Company''' on September 1, 1926, and the headquarters moved from Winnipeg, to Toronto. It was operated as a separate company with the railway charging them to haul express cars on trains. At major terminals separate buildings usually next to stations were owned by CPE. At smaller locations where volume would not warrant a separate employee the local station agent would act for the Express Company receiving a commission for all sales made on their behalf.

Express was handled in separate cars, some with employees on board, on the headend of passenger trains to provide a fast scheduled service for which higher rates could be charged than for LCL ([[Less-than-carload|Less than Carload Lot]]), small shipments of freight which were subject to delay. Aside from all sorts of small shipments for all kinds of businesses such products as cream, butter, poultry, and eggs were handled along with fresh flowers, fish and other sea foods some handled in separate refrigerated cars. Horses and livestock along with birds and small animals including prize cattle for exhibition were carried often in special horse cars that had facilities for grooms to ride with their animals. Automobiles for individuals were also handled by express in closed boxcars. Gold and silver bullion as well as cash were carried in large amounts between the mint and banks. Small business money shipments and valuables such as jewellery were routinely handled in small packets. Money orders and travellers’ cheques were an important part of the express company’s business and were used worldwide in the years before credit cards.

'''Canadian Express Cartage Department''' was formed in March 1937 to handle pickup and delivery of most express shipments including less-than-carload freight. Their trucks were painted Killarney (dark) green while regular express company vehicles were painted bright red.

Express routes using highway trucks beginning in November 1945 in southern Ontario and Alberta co-ordinated rail and highway service expanded service to better serve smaller locations especially on branchlines. Trucking operations would go on to expand across Canada making it an important transportation provider for small shipments. Deregulation in the 1980s changed everything, and it was not long before all trucking services were ended even after many attempts to change with the times. CanPar was one such attempt.

==Telegraph==
The original charter of the CPR granted in 1881 provided for the right to create an [[electric telegraph]] and [[telephone]] service including charging for it. The telephone had barely been invented but telegraph was well established as a means of communicating quickly across great distances. Being allowed to sell this service meant the railway could offset the costs of constructing and maintaining a pole line along its tracks across vast distances for its own purposes which were largely for dispatching trains. It began doing so in 1882 as the separate Telegraph Department. It would go on to provide a link between the cables under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans when they were completed. Prior to the CPR line messages to the west could be sent only via the United States.

Paid for by the word, a telegram was an expensive way to send messages but, vital to businesses. An individual receiving a personal telegram was seen as being someone important except for those that transmitted sorrow in the form of death notices. Messengers on bicycles delivered telegrams and picked up a reply in cities. In smaller locations the local railway station agent would handle this on a commission basis. To speed things, at the local end messages would first be telephoned.

In 1931 it became the Communications Department in recognition of the expanding services provided which included telephones lines, [[News agency|news wire]], [[stock ticker machine|ticker quotations]] for the [[stock market]] and eventually [[Teleprinter|teletype machines]]. All were faster than [[mail]] and very important to [[business]] and the public alike for many decades before [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] and [[computer]]s came along.

It was the coming of these newer technologies especially cellular telephones that eventually resulted in the demise of these services even after formation in 1967 of [[CNCP Telecommunications|CN-CP Telecommunications]] in an effort to effect efficiencies through consolidation rather than competition. [[Deregulation]] in the 1980s brought about mergers and the sale of remaining services and facilities.

==Radio==
On January 17, 1930, the CPR applied for licenses to operate [[radio station]]s in 11 cities from coast to coast for the purpose of organizing its own [[radio network]] in order to compete with the [[CNR Radio]] service. The CNR had built a radio network with the aim of promoting itself as well as entertaining its passengers during their travels. The onset of the Great Depression hurt the CPR's financial plan for a rival project and in April they withdrew their applications for stations in all but Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg. CPR did not end up pursuing these applications but instead operated a [[phantom station]] in Toronto known as &quot;CPRY,&quot; with initials standing for &quot;Canadian Pacific Royal York&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advisor.d6cn.com/Travel/ttttqc/Presenting_A_Behind_The_Scenes_Look_At_The_Historic_Royal_York_Hotel_One_Of_Toronto_s_Crown_Jewels_part_I.html |title=Presenting: A Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Historic Royal York Hotel – One of Toronto's Crown Jewels (part I) |publisher=Advisor.d6cn.com |date=Thu, 30 August 2007 |first=Susanne |last=Pacher |accessdate=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which operated out of studios at CP's [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] and leased time on [[CFRB]] and [[CBLA|CKGW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_CNR8.html |title=The Radio Broadcast that Fulfilled the Promise |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A network of affiliates carried the CPR radio network's broadcasts in the first half of the 1930s, but the takeover of CNR's Radio service by the new [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] removed CPR's need to have a network for competitive reasons, and CPR's radio service was discontinued in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cade-aced.ca/display_publication.php?&amp;i_nImageId=54 ]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steamships==
{{main|Canadian Pacific Steamships}}
[[Steamboat|Steamships]] played an important part in the history of CP from the very earliest days. During construction of the line in British Columbia even before the private CPR took over from the government contractor, ships were used to bring supplies to the construction sites. Similarly, to reach the isolated area of Superior in northern Ontario ships were used to bring in supplies to the construction work. While this work was going on there was already regular passenger service to the West. Trains operated from Toronto to Owen Sound where CPR steamships connected to Fort William where trains once again operated to reach Winnipeg. Before the CPR was completed the only way to reach the West was through the United States via St. Paul and Winnipeg. This Great Lakes steam ship service continued as an alternative route for many years and was always operated by the railway. It would become the last operation in North America to feature a special connecting boat train.

In 1884, CPR began purchasing sailing ships as part of a [[railway]] supply service on the [[Great Lakes]]. Over time, CPR became a railroad company with widely organized water transportation auxiliaries including the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Upper Lake Service|Great Lakes service]], the trans-Pacific service, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Coast Service|Pacific coastal service]], the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service|British Columbia lake and river service]], the trans-Atlantic service, and the Ferry service. In the 20th century, the company evolved into a transcontinental railroad which operated two transoceanic services which connected Canada with Europe and with Asia. The range of CPR services were aspects of a integrated plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith186&quot;&gt;Smith, Joseph Russell. (1908). {{Google books|Ra4ZAAAAYAAJ|The Ocean Carrier: a History and Analysis of the Service and a Discussion of the Rates of Ocean Transportation,'' p. 186.|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SS PrincessMary Victoria 14Feb1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|The 30th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) embarking on the SS ''Princess Mary'' at Victoria, British Columbia en route to the war in Europe—February 14, 1915.]]
Once the railway was completed to British Columbia the CPR chartered and soon bought their own steamships. These sleek steamships were of the latest design and christened with the prefix Empress in a link to the Orient. Travel to and from the Orient and cargo, especially imported tea and silk were an important source of revenue aided by Royal Mail contracts. This was an important part of the All Red Route to link the British Empire. The other ocean part was the Atlantic service from England which began with acquisition of two existing lines, Beaver Line, owned by Elder Dempster and Allan Lines. These two segments became Canadian Pacific Ocean Services (later, Canadian Pacific Steamships) and operated separately from the various lake services operated in Canada. These trans-ocean routes made it possible to travel from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to [[Hong Kong]] using only the CPR's ships, trains and hotels. CP’s 'Empress' ships became world-famous for their luxury and speed. They had a practical role too in transporting immigrants from much of Europe to Canada especially to populate the vast prairies. They also played an important role in both world wars with many of them being lost to enemy action including the ''[[Empress of Britain]]''.

There were also a number of [[Train ferry|rail ferries]] operated over the years as well including, between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan from 1890 until 1915. This began with two paddle-wheelers capable of carrying 16 cars. Passenger cars were carried as well as freight. This service ended in 1915 when the CPR made an agreement with the Michigan Central to use their Detroit River tunnel opened in 1910.

Pennsylvania-Ontario Transportation Company was formed jointly with the PRR in 1906 to operate a ferry across lake Erie between Ashtabula, Ohio and Port Burwell, Ontario to carry freight cars, mostly of coal, much of it to be burned in CPR steam locomotives. Only one ferry boat was ever operated, the ''Ashtabula'', a large vessel which eventually sank in a harbour collision in Ashtabula on September 18, 1958, thus ending the service.

Canadian Pacific Car and Passenger Transfer Company was formed by other interest in 1888 linking the CPR in Prescott, Ontario, and the NYC in Ogdensburg, New York. Service on this route had actually begun very early, in 1854 along with service from Brockville. A bridge built in 1958 ended passenger service however, freight continued until Ogdensburg's dock was destroyed by fire September 25, 1970, thus ending all service. CPC&amp;PTC was never owned by the CPR.

[[Bay of Fundy]] [[ferry]] service was operated for passengers and freight for many years linking [[Digby, Nova Scotia]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].

Eventually, after 78 years, with the changing times the scheduled passenger services would all be ended as well as ocean cruises. Cargo would continue on both oceans with a change over to containers. CP was an intermodal pioneer especially on land with road and rail mixing to provide the best service.

[[CP Ships]] was the final operation, and in the end it too left CP ownership when it was spun off in 2001. [[CP Ships]] was merged with [[Hapag-Lloyd]] in 2005.

===BC Coast Steamships===

The [[Canadian Pacific Railway Coast Service]] ([[British Columbia Coast Steamships]] or BCCS) was established when the CPR acquired in 1901 [[Canadian Pacific Navigation Company]] (no relation) and its large fleet of ships that served 72 ports along the coast of British Columbia including on Vancouver Island. Service included the Vancouver-Victoria-Seattle ''Triangle Route'', Gulf Islands, Powell River, as well as Vancouver-Alaska service. BCCS operated a fleet of 14 passenger ships made up of a number of ''Princess'' ships, pocket versions of the famous ocean going ''Empress'' ships along with a freighter, three tugs and five rail car barges. Popular with tourists, the Princess ships were famous in their own right especially the ''Princess Marguerite'' (II) which became the last coastal liner operating from 1949 until 1985. The best known of the princess ships, however, is the ''[[Princess Sophia (steamer)|Princess Sophia]]'', which sank with no survivors in October 1918 after striking the [[Vanderbilt Reef]] in Alaska's [[Lynn Canal]], constituting the largest maritime disaster in the history of the Pacific Northwest.

These services continued for many years until changing conditions in the late 1950s brought about their decline and eventual demise at the end of season in 1974. The ''Princess Marguerite'' was acquired by the province’s British Columbia Steamship (1975) Ltd. and continued to operate for a number of years.

===BC Lake and River Service===
{{Main|Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia}}
The [[Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service]] ([[British Columbia Lake and River Service]]) developed slowly and in spurts of growth.

CP began a long history of service in the Kootenays region of southern British Columbia beginning with the purchase in 1897 of the Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company which operated a fleet of steamers and barges on the [[Arrow Lakes]] and was merged into the CPR as the [[CPR Lake and River Service]] which also served the [[Steamboats of the Arrow Lakes|Arrow Lakes and Columbia River]], [[Steamboats of Kootenay Lake and the Kootenai River|Kootenay Lake and Kootenai River]], [[Steamboats of Lake Okanagan|Lake Okanagan]] and Skaha Lake, [[Slocan Lake]], [[Trout Lake (British Columbia)|Trout Lake]], and [[Shuswap Lake]] and the [[Thompson River]]/[[Kamloops Lake]].

All of these lake operations had one thing in common, the need for shallow draft therefore sternwheelers were the choice of ship. Tugs and barges handled rail equipment including one operation that saw the entire train including the locomotive and caboose go along. These services gradually declined and ended in 1975 except for a freight barge on Slocan Lake. This was the one where the entire train went along since the barge was a link to an isolated section of track. The ''Iris G'' tug boat and a barge were operated under contract to CP Rail until the last train ran late in December 1988. The sternwheel steamship [[Moyie (sternwheeler)|''Moyie'']] on Kootenay Lake was the last CPR passenger boat in BC lake service, having operated from 1898 until 1957. It became a beached historical exhibit, as are also the [[Sicamous (sternwheeler)|''Sicamous'']] and [[SS Naramata (steamboat)|''Naramata'']] at [[Penticton]] on [[Lake Okanagan]].

==Hotels==
{{Main|Canadian Pacific Hotels}}
To promote tourism and passenger ridership the Canadian Pacific established a series of first class resort hotels. These hotels became landmarks famous in their own right. They include [[The Algonquin]] in [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick|St. Andrews]], [[Château Frontenac]] in [[Quebec City|Quebec]], [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York]] in Toronto, Minaki Lodge in Minaki Ontario, [[Hotel Vancouver]], [[The Empress (Hotel)|Empress Hotel]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]] in the Canadian Rockies. Several signature hotels were acquired from its competitor [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] during the 1980s. The hotels retain their Canadian Pacific heritage but are no longer operated by the railroad. In 1998 [[Canadian Pacific Hotels]] acquired [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Hotels]], an American company, becoming [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts]] Inc. and the combined corporation operated the historic Canadian properties as well as the Fairmont's U.S. properties until sold in 2006.

==Airline==
{{Main|Canadian Pacific Airlines}}
Canadian Pacific Airlines, also called CP Air, operated from 1942 to 1987 and was the main competitor of government owned [[Air Canada]]. Based at [[Vancouver International Airport]], it served Canadian and international routes until it was purchased by [[Pacific Western Airlines]] which merged PWA and CP Air to create [[Canadian Airlines]].

==Special trains==
===Silk trains===
Between the 1890s and the 1940s, the CPR transported raw [[silk]] cocoons from Vancouver, where they had been shipped from the [[Orient]], to silk mills in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. A silk train could carry several million dollars worth of silk, so they had their own armed guards. To avoid train robberies and so minimize insurance costs, they traveled quickly and stopped only to change locomotives and crews, which was often done in under five minutes. The silk trains had superior rights over all other trains; even passenger trains (including the Royal Train of 1939) would be put in sidings to make the silk trains' trip faster. At the end of [[World War II]], the invention of [[nylon]] made silk less valuable so the silk trains died out.

===Funeral trains===
[[Image:Johnamacdonaldfuneraltrain.jpg|thumb|Funeral train of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald.]]
[[Funeral train]]s would carry the remains of important people, such as prime ministers. As the train would pass, mourners would be at certain spots to show respect. Two of the CPR's funeral trains are particularly well-known. On June 10, 1891, the funeral train of [[Prime Minister]] [[Sir John A. Macdonald]] ran from Ottawa to [[Kingston, Ontario]]. The train consisted of five heavily draped passenger cars and was pulled by [[4-4-0]] No. 283. On September 14, 1915, the funeral train of former CPR president [[Sir William Cornelius Van Horne]] ran from Montreal to [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]], [[Illinois]], pulled by [[4-6-2]] No. 2213. ''The Canadian'' was used as funeral train for former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1979.

[[Image:Royaltrain-hopebc.jpg|thumb|125px|left|King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at [[Hope, British Columbia]].]]

===Royal trains===
{{See|Royal and viceroyal transport in Canada}}
The CPR ran a number of trains that transported members of the Royal family when they toured Canada. These trains transported royalty through Canada's scenery, forests, small towns and enabled people to see and greet them. Their trains were elegantly decorated; some had amenities such as a post office and barber shop. The CPR's most notable royal train was in 1939.

In 1939 the CPR and the CNR had the honour of giving [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] a rail tour of Canada, from [[Quebec City]] to [[Vancouver]]. This was the first visit to Canada by a reigning Monarch. The steam locomotives used to pull the train included CPR 2850, a Hudson ([[4-6-4]]) built by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] in 1938, CNR 6400, a U-4-a Northern ([[4-8-4]]) and CNR 6028 a U-1-b Mountain ([[4-8-2]]) type. They were specially painted royal blue with silver trim as was the entire train, the locomotives ran 5,189&amp;nbsp;km (3,224 miles) across Canada, through 25 changes of crew, without engine failure. The King, somewhat of a [[railbuff]], rode in the cab when possible. After the tour, King George gave the CPR permission to use the term &quot;[[Royal Hudson]]&quot; for the CPR locomotives and to display Royal Crowns on their running boards. This applied only to the semi-streamlined locomotives (2820–2864), not the &quot;standard&quot; Hudsons (2800–2819).

===School cars===
Between 1926 and the early 1960s the CPR ran a school car to reach people who lived in Northern Ontario, far from schools. A teacher would travel in a specially designed car to remote areas and would stay to teach in one area for two to three days, then leave for another area. Each car had a blackboard and a few sets of chairs and desks. They also contained miniature libraries. These school cars were useful in spreading education and literacy.

===''Silver Streak''===

Major filming for the 1976 movie ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', a fictional comedy tale of a train trip from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Chicago]], was done on the CPR, mainly in the [[Alberta]] area with station footage at  [[Union Station (Toronto)|Toronto's Union Station]]. The train set was so lightly disguised as the fictional &quot;AMRoad&quot; that the locomotives and cars still carried their original names and numbers, along with the easily-identifiable CP Rail red-striped paint scheme. Most of the cars are still in revenue service on Via Rail Canada; the lead locomotive is extant in Quebec, though she is unserviceable, but the second unit has been scrapped.

===Holiday Train===
[[Image:Train Noel Canadien Pacifique Montreal 2009.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Holiday Train in Montreal, November 2009]]
Starting in 1999, the CPR runs a Holiday Train along its main line during the months of November and December. The Holiday Train celebrates the Christmas season and collects donations for community [[food bank]]s. The Holiday Train also provides publicity for the CPR and a few of its customers. Each train has a box car stage for entertainers who are travelling along with the train. The train is a freight train, but also pulls vintage passenger cars which are used as lodging/transportation for the entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General+Public/Holiday+Train/Bios/default.htm |title=Entertainers |publisher=.cpr.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; People that come to see the train may even come on board and check out some of the holiday decorations and vintage passenger cars. Since its launch in 1999, the Holiday Train program has raised more than $2.3 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] and 506 tons of food for North American food banks. All donations collected in a community remain in that community for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General+Public/Holiday+Train/HT+Backgounder.htm |title=History of the Holiday Train |publisher=.cpr.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It collects donations of food and money (as well as makes its own donations) for the needy to help better their Christmas.
The Holiday Train is a Christmas-themed train. The trains are decorated; each car as well as the locomotive and caboose are covered in Christmas lights, and the trains pass through every major city and town on the CP system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General+Public/Holiday+Train/default.htm |title=Canadian Pacific Holiday Train |publisher=.cpr.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three trains, which cover the five main regions of the CP:

===Royal Canadian Pacific===
On June 7, 2000, the CPR inaugurated the [[Royal Canadian Pacific]], a luxury excursion service that operates between the months of June and September. It operates along a 1,050&amp;nbsp;km (650 mile) route from Calgary, through the [[Columbia Valley]] in [[British Columbia]], and returning back to Calgary via [[Crowsnest Pass]]. The trip takes six days and five nights. The train consists of up to eight luxury passenger cars built between 1916 and 1931 and is powered by first-generation diesel locomotives.

===Steam train===
[[Image:IMG 4350 CP 2816.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Canadian Pacific 2816]] ''Empress'' at [[Sturtevant, Wisconsin]], September 1, 2007]]
In 1998, the CPR repatriated one of its former passenger steam locomotives that had been on static display in the United States following its sale in January 1964, long after the close of the steam era. CPR Hudson [[Canadian Pacific 2816|2816]] was re-designated ''Empress 2816'' following a 30-month restoration that cost in excess of $1 million. It was subsequently returned to service to promote public relations. It has operated across much of the CPR system, including lines in the United States. It has been used for various charitable purposes, the most significant of which has been to raise awareness of the need to provide children with a nourishing breakfast to aid their learning in school. One hundred percent of the money raised goes to the nation-wide charity [[Breakfast For Learning]] — the CPR bears all of the expenses associated with the operation of the train.

===Spirit Train===
In 2008, Canadian Pacific partnered with the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]] to present a &quot;Spirit Train&quot; tour that featured Olympic-themed events at various stops. [[Colin James]] was a headline entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Canadian Pacific and Colin James bring Olympic spirit to Canadian communities&quot; [press release], ''Canada NewsWire'', 9 May 2008, 10:10 am.&lt;/ref&gt; Several stops were met by protesters who argued that the games are slated to take place on what they described as &quot;stolen indigenous land.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Mickleburgh, &quot;Protests are fine, but can the obnoxious profanity&quot;, ''Globe and Mail'', 26 September 2003, S3; Denis St. Pierre, &quot;Protest greets Spirit Train&quot;, ''Sudbury Star'', 13 October 2008, A9; Mark Klichling, &quot;Protests don't derail Olympic Spirit Train&quot;, ''North Bay Nugget'', 14 October 2008, A5; Stephanie Levitz, &quot;Winter Olympic supporters and opponents both claim success from Spirit Train&quot;, ''Canadian Press'', 19 October 2008, 10:45 am.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locomotives==
===Steam locomotives===
[[Image:Countess-1.gif|thumb|250px|[[Countess of Dufferin]]]]
In the CPR's early years, it made extensive use of ''American Standard'' [[4-4-0]] [[steam locomotive]]s and example of this is the [[Countess of Dufferin]]. Later, considerable use was also made of the [[4-6-0]] type for passenger and [[2-8-0]] type for freight.

Starting in the 20th century, the CPR bought and built hundreds of ''Ten-Wheeler'' type [[4-6-0]]s for passenger and freight service and similar quantities of [[2-8-0]]s and [[2-10-2]]s for freight. 2-10-2s were also used in passenger service on mountain routes. The CPR bought hundreds of [[4-6-2]] ''Pacifics'' between 1906 and 1948 with later versions being true dual purpose passenger and fast freight locomotives.

The CPR built hundreds of its own locomotives at its shops in Montreal, first at the ''New Shops'' as the DeLorimer shops were commonly referred to and at the massive [[CPR|Angus Shops]] that replaced them in 1904.

Some of the CPR's best-known locomotives were the [[4-6-4]] ''Hudsons''. First built in 1929 they began a new era of modern locomotives with capabilities that changed how transcontinental passenger trains ran, eliminating frequent changes en route. What once took 24 changes of engines in 1886, all of them 4-4-0s except for two of 2-8-0s in the mountains, for {{convert|2883|mi|km}} between Montreal and Vancouver became 8 changes. The 2800s (Twenty Eight Hundreds) as the Hudson type was known, ran from Toronto to Fort William a distance of 811 miles (1,306&amp;nbsp;km), while another lengthy engine district was from Winnipeg to Calgary 832 miles (1,338&amp;nbsp;km).

Especially notable were the semi-[[streamliner|streamlined]] H1 class ''[[Royal Hudson]]'', locomotives that were given their name because one of their class hauled the Royal Train carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on the 1939 Royal Tour across Canada without change or failure. That locomotive, No. 2850, is preserved in the Exporail exhibit hall of the [[Canadian Railway Museum]] in St. Constant (Delson) Quebec. One of the class, No. 2860, was restored by the [[British Columbia]] government and used in excursion service on the [[British Columbia Railway]] between 1974 and 1999.

In 1929, the CPR received its first [[2-10-4]] [[Selkirk locomotive]]s, the largest steam locomotives to run in Canada and the British Empire. Named after the Selkirk Mountains where they served, these locomotives were well suited for steep grades. They were regularly used in passenger and freight service. The CPR would own 37 of these locomotives, including number 8000, an experimental high pressure engine. The last steam locomotives that the CPR received, in 1949, were Selkirks, numbered 5930–5935.
[[Image:Canadian Pacific - Trans Canada passenger train.jpg|150px|thumb|CP passenger train heading east towards [[Calgary]] about 1973]]
Note: The last Selkirk built, number 5935, is preserved at the [[Canadian Railway Museum]]. (You can not climb inside but you can touch it). One other 2-10-4 Selkirk from this last order (5930-5935) has also been preserved; number 5931. It is displayed, within a chain-link fence, at the main entrance to Heritage Park in Calgary, Alberta. For most of its display life, it was intentionally painted with the incorrect number (5934) and was displayed on the west end of downtown Calgary next to the CPR mainline. It now bears its original and correct number (5931) after being repainted and renumbered for its current display location next to Heritage Park.

===Diesel locomotives===
In 1937, the CPR acquired its first [[diesel-electric locomotive]], a custom built one-of-a-kind switcher numbered 7000. This locomotive was not successful and was not repeated. Production model diesels were imported from [[American Locomotive Company]] (Alco) starting with five model [[ALCO S-2 and S-4|S-2]] yard switchers in 1943 and followed by further orders. In 1949, operations on lines in [[Vermont]] were dieselized with [[ALCO FA|Alco FA1]] road locomotives (8 A and 4 B units), 5 [[ALCO RS-2|Alco RS-2]] road switchers, 3 Alco S-2 switchers and 3 [[EMD E8]] passenger locomotives. In 1948 [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] began production of Alco designs.

In 1949, the CPR acquired 13 [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] designed locomotives from the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] for its isolated [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]], and [[Vancouver Island]] was quickly dieselized. Following that successful experiment, the CPR started to dieselise its main network. Dieselization was completed 11 years later, with its last steam locomotive running on November 6, 1960. The CPR's first-generation locomotives were mostly made by [[General Motors Diesel]] and [[Montreal Locomotive Works]], ([[American Locomotive Company]] designs), with some made by the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] to [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] and [[Fairbanks Morse]] designs.
CP was the first railway in North America to pioneer [[alternating current|AC]] traction diesel-electric locomotives, in 1984. In 1995 CP turned to General Electric [[GE Transportation Systems]] for the first production AC traction locomotives in Canada, and now has the highest percentage of AC locomotives in service of all North American Class I railways. As of early 2007, 578 of the CPR's 1,669 locomotives are AC.

'''Cognitive psychology''' is a subdiscipline of [[psychology]] exploring internal mental processes.
It is the study of how people perceive, remember, think, speak, and solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Psychology: Making Connections by Gregory Feist and Erika Rosenberg (Jan. 5, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive psychology is radically different from previous psychological approaches in two key ways.
*It accepts the use of the [[scientific method]], and generally rejects [[introspection]]&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, Dale H. ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th''. Pearson, Merrill Prentice Hall. 1991, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008. pp. 14, 28&lt;/ref&gt; as a valid method of investigation, unlike symbol-driven approaches such as [[Freudian psychology]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
*It explicitly acknowledges the existence of internal mental states (such as [[belief]], [[Preference|desire]], [[idea]], [[knowledge]] and [[motivation]]). In its early years, critics held that the empiricism of cognitive psychology combined with its acceptance of internal mental states was contradictory. However, the sibling field of [[cognitive neuroscience]] has provided evidence{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} of physiological brain states which directly correlate with mental states. In that sense, cognitive neuroscience has vindicated the central assumption of cognitive psychology.

The school of thought arising from this approach is known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].

==History==
[[Ulric Neisser]] coined the term &quot;cognitive psychology&quot; in his book ''Cognitive Psychology,'' published in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Neisser, U. (1967). Cognitive psychology. New York, NY: Meredith.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note however that there was an earlier publication of the same name: Thomas Vener Moore's ''Cognitive Psychology'', published in 1939. Neisser was not aware of that book when he chose his title (cf. Surprenant &amp; Neath (1997), Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review 4(3), 342-349.)&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Neisser provides a definition of cognitive psychology characterizing people as dynamic information-processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms. Also emphasizing that it is a &quot;point of view&quot; that postulates the mind as having a certain conceptual structure. Neisser's point of view endows the discipline with a scope beyond high-level concepts such as &quot;reasoning&quot; that other works often espouse as defining psychology. Neisser's definition of &quot;cognition&quot; illustrates this well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term &quot;cognition&quot; refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and hallucinations... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssi.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/39/1/115 abstract Social Science Information, Vol. 39, No. 1, 115-129 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. Dynamic psychology, which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cognitive psychology is one of the more recent additions to psychological research, having only developed as a separate area within the discipline since the late 1950s and early 1960s following the &quot;[[cognitive revolution]]&quot; initiated by [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomsky 1959&quot;&gt;Chomsky, N. A. (1959), A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior&lt;/ref&gt; of behaviorism and empiricism more generally. The origins of cognitive thinking such as [[computational theory of mind]] can be traced back as early as [[Descartes]] in the 17th century, and proceeding up to [[Alan Turing]] in the 1940s and '50s. The cognitive approach was brought to prominence by [[Donald Broadbent]]'s book ''Perception and Communication'' in 1958. Since that time, the dominant [[paradigm]] in the area has been the [[information processing]] model of cognition that Broadbent put forward. This is a way of thinking and reasoning about mental processes, envisioning them as software running on the computer that is the brain. Theories refer to forms of input, representation, computation or processing, and outputs. Applied to language as the primary mental knowledge representation system, cognitive psychology has exploited tree and network mental models. Its singular contribution to [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] and psychology in general is the notion of a [[semantic network]]. One of the first cognitive psychologists, [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] is well-known for dedicating his career to the development of [[WordNet]], a semantic network for the English language. Development began in 1985 and is now the foundation for many machine ontologies.

This way of conceiving mental processes has pervaded psychology more generally over the past few decades, and it is not uncommon to find cognitive theories within [[social psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[abnormal psychology]], and [[developmental psychology]]. In fact, the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] have fully integrated the developmental conception of changes in thought with age with [[cognitive model]]s of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., &amp; Spanoudis, G. (2010). The development of mental processing. Nesselroade, J. R. (2010). Methods in the study of life-span human development: Issues and answers. In W. F. Overton (Ed.), ''Biology, cognition and methods across the life-span. Volume 1 of the Handbook of life-span development'' (pp. 36-55), Editor-in-chief: R. M. Lerner. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of cognitive theories to [[comparative psychology]] has driven many recent studies in [[animal cognition]]. However, cognitive psychology dealing with the intervening constructs of the mental presentations is not able to specify: &quot;What are the non-material counterparts of material objects?&quot; For example, &quot;What is the counterpart of a chair in mental processes, and how do the non-material processes evolve in the mind that has no space?&quot; Further, what are the very specific qualities of the mental causalities, in particular, when the causalities are processes? The plain statement about information processing awakes some questions. What information is dealt with, its contents, and form? Are there transformations? What are the nature of process causalities? How do subjective states of a person transmute into shared states, and the other way around? Finally, yet importantly, how is it that we who work with cognitive research are able to conceptualize the mental counter concepts to construct theories that have real importance in real every day life? Consequently, there is a lack of specific process concepts that lead to new developments, and create grand theories about the mind and its abysses.

The information processing approach to cognitive functioning is currently being questioned by new approaches in psychology, such as [[dynamical systems]], and the [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] perspective.

Because of the use of computational metaphors and terminology, cognitive psychology was able to benefit greatly from the flourishing of research in [[artificial intelligence]] and other related areas in the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, it developed as one of the significant aspects of the inter-disciplinary subject of [[cognitive science]], which attempts to integrate a range of approaches in research on the mind and mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;R.

[[File:Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997 hires adj.jpg|thumb|[[Comet Hale–Bopp]], as seen on 29 March 1997 in [[Pazin]], [[Croatia]].]]

A '''comet''' is an icy, [[small Solar System body]] that, when close enough to the [[Sun]], displays a visible [[coma (cometary)|coma]] (a thin, fuzzy, temporary [[atmosphere]]) and sometimes also a [[comet tail|tail]]. These phenomena are both due to the effects of [[solar radiation]] and the [[solar wind]] upon the [[comet nucleus|nucleus of the comet]]. Comet nuclei are themselves loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles, ranging from a [[P/2007 R5|few hundred meters]] to tens of [[kilometer]]s across. Comets have been observed since ancient times and have historically been considered bad [[omen]]s.

Comets have a wide range of [[orbital period]]s, ranging from a few years to hundreds of thousands of years. Short-period comets originate in the [[Kuiper belt]], or its associated [[scattered disc]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidsson&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lie beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]]. Longer-period comets are thought to originate in the [[Oort Cloud]], a spherical cloud of icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Long-period comets plunge towards the Sun from the Oort Cloud because of [[gravitational perturbation]]s caused by either the massive outer planets of the Solar System ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]), or [[List of nearest stars|passing stars]]. Rare [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] comets pass once through the [[inner Solar System]] before being thrown out into [[interstellar space]] along [[Hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic trajectories]].

Comets are distinguished from [[asteroid]]s by the presence of a  [[coma (cometary)|coma]] or a [[comet tail|tail]]. However, [[extinct comets]] that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''comet'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''cometes'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek Language|Greek]] κομήτης (''komētēs''), meaning &quot;comet&quot;, but literally &quot;long-haired&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkomh%2Fths κομήτης], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from the word κόμη (''komē''), which means &quot;hair of the head&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dko%2Fmh κόμη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greeks|Greek]] scientist and philosopher [[Aristotle]] first used the derived form of ''κόμη'', ''κομήτης'', to describe what he saw as &quot;stars with hair.&quot; The [[astronomical symbol]] for comets is (&lt;big&gt;{{Unicode|☄}}&lt;/big&gt;), consisting of a small disc with three hairlike extensions.

{{Main|Comet nucleus}}
Comet nuclei are known to range from about 100 meters to more than 40 kilometres across. They are composed of [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[dust]], [[ice|water ice]], and frozen gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeoman&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their low mass, comet nuclei do not [[gravitational collapse|become spherical]] under their own [[gravity]], and thus have irregular shapes. Officially, according to NASA guidelines, a comet has to be at least 85% ice in order to be considered an actual comet.

They are often popularly described as &quot;dirty snowballs&quot;, though recent observations have revealed dry dusty or rocky surfaces, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath the [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Comets also contain a variety of [[organic compound]]s; in addition to the gases already mentioned, these may include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]] and [[ethane]], and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain [[hydrocarbons]] and [[amino acids]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is thought that complex organic compounds are the dark surface material. Solar heating drives off volatile compounds leaving behind heavy long-chain organics{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} that tend to be very dark, like [[tar]] or [[petroleum|crude oil]]. The very darkness of cometary surfaces enables them to absorb the heat necessary to drive their outgassing processes.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have not yet been independently confirmed. As a comet approaches the [[inner solar system]], [[solar radiation]] causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. The streams of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] and gas thus released form a huge, extremely tenuous atmosphere around the comet called the ''coma'', and the force exerted on the coma by the Sun's [[radiation pressure]] and [[solar wind]] cause an enormous ''tail'' to form, which points away from the sun.

Both the coma and tail are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner solar system, the dust reflecting sunlight directly and the gases glowing from [[ion]]isation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a [[telescope]], but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma temporarily greatly increases. This happened in 2007 to [[17P/Holmes|Comet Holmes]].&lt;ref name=atmosphere&gt;{{cite web |last=Jewitt |first=David |date=2007-11-09 |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/holmes.html |title=Comet Holmes Bigger Than The Sun |publisher=Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii |accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The streams of dust and gas each form their own distinct tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of dust is left behind in the comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} tail called the type II or dust tail.  At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun, as this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions a short tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails may be seen – the [[antitail]]. These were once thought to be somewhat mysterious, but are merely the end of the dust tail apparently projecting ahead of the comet due to our viewing angle.&lt;ref&gt;

While the solid nucleus of comets is generally less than {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} across, the coma may be larger than the Sun, and ion tails have been observed to extend one [[astronomical unit]] (150 million km) or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeoman&quot;/&gt; The observation of antitails contributed significantly to the discovery of [[solar wind]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ion tail is formed as a result of the [[photoelectric effect]]{{Dubious|date=April 2009}} of solar ultra-violet radiation acting on particles in the coma. Once the particles have been ionized, they attain a net positive electrical charge which in turn gives rise to an &quot;induced [[magnetosphere]]&quot; around the comet. The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles. As the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a [[bow shock]] is formed upstream of the comet, in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called &quot;pick-up ions&quot;) congregate and act to &quot;load&quot; the solar magnetic field with plasma, such that the field lines &quot;drape&quot; around the comet forming the ion tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp 864&quot;&gt;

=== Connection to meteor showers ===
As a result of outgassing, comets leave a trail of solid debris. If the comet's path crosses Earth's path, then at that point there are likely to be [[meteor shower]]s as Earth passes through the trail of debris. The [[Perseids|Perseid meteor shower]] occurs every year between August&amp;nbsp;9 and August&amp;nbsp;13, when Earth passes through the orbit of [[Comet Swift–Tuttle]].&lt;ref name=showers/&gt; [[Halley's comet]] is the source of the [[Orionids|Orionid shower]] in October.&lt;ref name=showers&gt;

== Orbital characteristics ==
[[File:Comet Kohoutek orbit p391.svg|thumb|300px|Orbits of the [[Comet Kohoutek|Kohoutek Comet]] (red) and the Earth (blue), illustrating the high [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of its orbit and its rapid motion when close to the [[Sun]].]]
[[File:Comets by aphelion.png|thumb|[[Histogram]] of the [[aphelia]] of the 2005 comets, showing the giant planet comet families. The [[abscissa]] is the [[natural logarithm]] of the aphelion expressed in [[Astronomical unit|AUs]].]]

Most comets have elongated [[elliptical orbit]]s that take them close to the Sun for a part of their orbit, and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder. Comets are often classified according to the length of their [[orbital period]]s: the longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.

* '''[[Short-period comet]]s''' are generally defined as having orbital periods of less than 200 years. They usually orbit more-or-less in the [[ecliptic]] plane in the same direction as the planets. Their orbits typically take them out to the region of the outer planets (Jupiter and beyond) at [[aphelion]]; for example, the aphelion of Halley's Comet is a little beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]]. At the shorter extreme, Encke's Comet has an orbit which never puts it farther away from the Sun than [[Jupiter]]. Short-period comets are further divided into the '''Jupiter family''' (periods less than 20 years) and '''Halley family''' (periods between 20 and 200 years).
* '''Long-period comets''' have highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbits and periods ranging from 200 years to thousands or even millions of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBP&quot;/&gt; An eccentricity greater than 1 when near perihelion does not necessarily mean that a comet will leave the solar system.&lt;ref name=Elenin2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceobs.org/en/2011/03/07/vliyanie-planet-gigantov-na-orbitu-komety-c2010-x1-elenin/ |title=Influence of giant planets on the orbit of comet C/2010 X1 |first=Leonid |last=Elenin |date=7 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Comet McNaught ([[C/2006 P1]]) had an heliocentric osculating eccentricity of 1.000019 near its perihelion passage [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] in January 2007, but is bound to the Sun with roughly a 92,600 year orbit since the eccentricity drops below 1 as it moves further from the Sun. The future orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the [[osculating orbit]] is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|center of mass of the solar system]]. By definition long-period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the solar system due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having &quot;periods&quot;. The orbits of long-period comets take them far beyond the outer planets at aphelia, and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic. Long-period comets such as [[Comet West]] and [[C/1999 F1]] can have barycentric apoapsis distances of nearly 70,000&amp;nbsp;AU with orbital periods estimated around 6 million years.
* '''Single-apparition comets''' are similar to long-period comets since they also have [[parabolic trajectory|parabolic]] or slightly [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] trajectories&lt;ref name=&quot;SBP&quot;&gt;

Based on their orbital characteristics, short-period comets are thought to originate from the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]] and the [[Kuiper belt]]/[[scattered disk]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidsson&quot; /&gt;—a disk of objects in the transneptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets is thought to be the far more distant spherical [[Oort cloud]] (after the Dutch astronomer [[Jan Hendrik Oort]] who hypothesised its existence).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are believed to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards towards the [[Sun]], to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.

Since their elliptical orbits frequently take them close to the giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets display a tendency for their [[Apsis|aphelia]] to coincide with a [[giant planet]]'s orbital radius, with the Jupiter family of comets being the largest, as the [[histogram]] shows. It is clear that comets coming in from the Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets as a result of a close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined, in addition to being the swiftest of the giant planets. These perturbations probably  sometimes deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods, with Halley's Comet being a possible example of this.

Early observations have revealed a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, but no more than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of kilometres per second). If such objects entered the solar system, they would have positive total energies, and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century,&lt;ref&gt;

== Fate of comets==
=== Departure/ejection from Solar System ===
If a comet is traveling fast enough, it may leave the Solar System; such is the case for [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the solar system (see [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Perturbation]]), such as [[Jupiter]].

=== Volatiles exhausted ===
{{Main|Extinct comet}}
Jupiter-family comets (JFC) and long-period comets (LPC) (see &quot;Orbital characteristics&quot;, above) appear to follow very different fading laws. The JFCs are active over a lifetime of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 revolutions while the LPCs disappear much faster.  Only 10% of the LPCs survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion, while only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages.&lt;ref name=&quot;dormant&quot;/&gt;  Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates away, and the comet becomes a small, dark, inert lump of rock or rubble that can resemble an [[asteroid]].&lt;ref&gt;

Collisions between comets and planets or moons were common in the early Solar System: some of the many craters on the Earth's [[Moon]], for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] broke up into pieces and collided with [[Jupiter]].

Many comets and asteroids collided into Earth in its early stages. Many scientists believe that comets bombarding the young Earth (about 4 billion years ago) brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, or at least a significant portion of it. Other researchers have cast doubt on this theory.&lt;ref&gt;

It is suspected that comet impacts have, over long timescales, also delivered significant quantities of water to the Earth's [[Moon]], some of which may have survived as [[lunar ice]].

Comet and [[meteoroid]] impacts are believed to be responsible for the existence of [[tektite]]s and [[australite]]s.

== Nomenclature ==
The names given to comets have followed several different conventions over the past two centuries. Before any systematic naming convention was adopted, comets were named in a variety of ways. Prior to the early 20th century, most comets were simply referred to by the year in which they appeared, sometimes with additional adjectives for particularly bright comets; thus, the &quot;[[C/1680 V1|Great Comet of 1680]]&quot; (Kirch's Comet), the &quot;[[C/1882 R1|Great September Comet of 1882]]&quot;, and the &quot;[[Great Daylight Comet of 1910|Daylight Comet of 1910]]&quot; (&quot;Great January Comet of 1910&quot;). [[File:Halley's Comet, 1910.JPG|thumb|175px|[[Halley's Comet]], named after the astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] for successfully calculating its orbit]] After [[Edmund Halley]] demonstrated that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759, that comet became known as [[Halley's Comet]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their apparition.

In the early 20th century, the convention of naming comets after their discoverers became common, and this remains so today. A comet is named after up to three independent discoverers. In recent years, many comets have been discovered by instruments operated by large teams of astronomers, and in this case, comets may be named for the instrument. For example, [[Comet IRAS–Araki–Alcock]] was discovered independently by the [[IRAS]] satellite and amateur astronomers [[Genichi Araki]] and [[George Alcock]]. In the past, when multiple comets were discovered by the same individual, group of individuals, or team, the comets' names were distinguished by adding a numeral to the discoverers' names (but only for periodic comets); thus Comets [[P/1990 V1|Shoemaker–Levy 1]] – [[D/1993 F2|9]]. Today, the large numbers of comets discovered by some instruments has caused this system to be impractical, and no attempt is made to ensure that each comet is given a unique name. Instead, the comets' systematic designations are used to avoid confusion.

Until 1994, comets were first given a [[provisional designation]] consisting of the year of their discovery followed by a lowercase letter indicating its order of discovery in that year (for example, [[C/1969 Y1|Comet 1969i (Bennett)]] was the 9th comet discovered in 1969). Once the comet had been observed through perihelion and its orbit had been established, the comet was given a permanent designation of the year of its [[perihelion]], followed by a [[Roman numeral]] indicating its order of perihelion passage in that year, so that Comet 1969i became [[C/1969 Y1|Comet 1970 II]] (it was the second comet to pass perihelion in 1970)&lt;ref name=&quot;arnett&quot;&gt;

Increasing numbers of comet discoveries made this procedure awkward, and in 1994 the [[International Astronomical Union]] approved a new naming system. Comets are now designated by the year of their discovery followed by a letter indicating the half-month of the discovery and a number indicating the order of discovery (a system similar to that already used for [[asteroid]]s), so that the fourth comet discovered in the second half of February 2006, for example, would be designated 2006&amp;nbsp;D4. Prefixes are also added to indicate the nature of the comet:

* P/ indicates a periodic comet (defined for these purposes as any comet with an orbital period of less than 200 years or confirmed observations at more than one perihelion passage);&lt;ref name=&quot;non-periodic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cometary Designation System |publisher=Minor Planet Center |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/lists/CometResolution.html |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C/ indicates a non-periodic comet (defined as any comet that is ''not'' periodic according to the preceding definition);
* X/ indicates a comet for which no reliable orbit could be calculated (generally, historical comets);
* D/ indicates a periodic comet which has disappeared, broken up or been lost;&lt;ref name=&quot;non-periodic&quot;/&gt;
* A/ indicates an object that was mistakenly identified as a comet, but is actually a [[minor planet]].

For example, [[Comet Hale–Bopp]]'s designation is C/1995 O1. After their second observed perihelion passage, periodic comets are also assigned a number indicating the order of their discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSBN&quot;&gt;

There are only five bodies in our Solar System that are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids: [[2060 Chiron]] ([[95P/Chiron]]), [[4015 Wilson–Harrington]] ([[107P/Wilson–Harrington]]), [[7968 Elst–Pizarro]] ([[133P/Elst–Pizarro]]), [[60558 Echeclus]] ([[174P/Echeclus]]), and [[118401 LINEAR]] ([[176P/LINEAR]]).

Before the invention of the telescope, comets seemed to appear out of nowhere in the sky and gradually vanish out of sight. They were usually considered bad [[omen]]s of deaths of kings or noble men, or coming catastrophes, or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;

Some authorities interpret references to &quot;falling stars&quot; in [[Gilgamesh]], the [[Book of Revelation]], and the [[Book of Enoch]] as references to comets, or possibly [[bolide]]s.

In the first book of his ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', [[Aristotle]] propounded the view of comets that would hold sway in Western thought for nearly two thousand years. He rejected the ideas of several earlier philosophers that comets were [[planet]]s, or at least a phenomenon related to the planets, on the grounds that while the planets confined their motion to the circle of the [[Zodiac]], comets could appear in any part of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he described comets as a phenomenon of the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], where hot, dry exhalations gathered and occasionally burst into flame. Aristotle held this mechanism responsible for not only comets, but also [[meteor]]s, the [[aurora borealis]], and even the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

A few later classical philosophers did dispute this view of comets. [[Seneca the Younger]], in his ''[[Natural Questions]]'', observed that comets moved regularly through the sky and were undisturbed by the wind, behavior more typical of celestial than atmospheric phenomena. While he conceded that the other planets do not appear outside the Zodiac, he saw no reason that a planet-like object could not move through any part of the sky, humanity's knowledge of celestial things being very limited.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Aristotelian viewpoint proved more influential, and it was not until the 16th century that it was demonstrated that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere.

In 1577, a bright comet was visible for several months. The Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] used measurements of the comet's position taken by himself and other, geographically separated, observers to determine that the comet had no measurable [[parallax]]. Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant from the earth than the moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESO part I&quot;&gt;

=== Orbital studies ===
[[File:Newton Comet1680.jpg|thumb|300px|The orbit of the comet of 1680, fit to a [[parabola]], as shown in [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'']]
Although comets had now been demonstrated to be in the heavens, the question of how they moved through the heavens would be debated for most of the next century. Even after [[Johannes Kepler]] had determined in 1609 that the planets moved about the sun in [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits, he was reluctant to believe that the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws that governed the motions of the planets]] should also influence the motion of other bodies—he believed that comets travel among the planets along straight lines. [[Galileo Galilei]], although a staunch [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanist]], rejected Tycho's parallax measurements and held to the Aristotelian notion of comets moving on straight lines through the upper atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The first suggestion that Kepler's laws of planetary motion should also apply to the comets was made by [[William Lower]] in 1610.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESO part I&quot;/&gt; In the following decades other astronomers, including Pierre Petit, [[Giovanni Borelli]], [[Adrien Auzout]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Johann Baptist Cysat]], and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] all argued for comets curving about the sun on elliptical or parabolic paths, while others, such as [[Christian Huygens]] and [[Johannes Hevelius]], supported comets' linear motion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The matter was resolved by the [[C/1680 V1|bright comet]] that was discovered by [[Gottfried Kirch]] on November 14, 1680. Astronomers throughout Europe tracked its position for several months. In 1681, the [[Saxony|Saxon]] pastor [[Georg Samuel Doerfel]] set forth his proofs that comets are heavenly bodies moving in [[parabola]]s of which the sun is the focus. Then [[Isaac Newton]], in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' of 1687, proved that an object moving under the influence of his [[inverse square law]] of [[gravity|universal gravitation]] must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the [[conic section]]s, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] applied Newton's method to twenty-three cometary apparitions that had occurred between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar [[orbital element]]s, and he was further able to account for the slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation by [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the comet returned as predicted, it became known as [[Halley's Comet]] (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). Its next appearance will be in 2061. See the book ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'' by Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]].

Among the comets with short enough periods to have been observed several times in the historical record, Halley's Comet is unique in that it is consistently  bright enough to be visible to the naked eye while passing through the inner Solar System. Since the confirmation of the periodicity of Halley's Comet, quite a few other periodic comets have been discovered through the use of the  [[telescope]]. The second comet found to have a periodic orbit was [[Encke's Comet]] (with the official designation of 2P/Encke). During the period 1819–21 the German mathematician and physicist [[Johann Franz Encke]] computed the orbits for a series of comets that had been observed in 1786, 1795, 1805, and 1818, and he concluded that they were same comet, and successfully predicted its return in 1822.&lt;ref name=&quot;KronkEncke&quot;/&gt; By 1900, seventeen comets had been observed through more than one passage through their perihelions, and then recognized as being periodic comets. As of April 2006, 175 comets have achieved this distinction, though several of these seem to have been destroyed or lost.

=== Studies of physical characteristics ===

[[Isaac Newton]] described comets as compact and durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbits, and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their [[Comet nucleus|nuclei]], ignited or heated by the sun. Newton suspected that comets were the origin of the life-supporting component of air. Newton also believed that the vapors given off by comets might replenish the planets' supplies of water (which was gradually being converted into soil by the growth and decay of plants), and the sun's supply of fuel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

{{cquote2|&lt;poem&gt;
From his huge vapouring train perhaps to shake
Reviving moisture on the numerous orbs,
Thro' which his long ellipsis winds; perhaps
To lend new fuel to declining suns,
To light up worlds, and feed th' ethereal fire.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]|&quot;The Seasons&quot; (1730; 1748)
}}

As early as the 18th century, some scientists had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]] hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, the German mathematician [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]], after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the [[jet force]]s of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and he argued that the non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;

However, another comet-related discovery overshadowed these ideas for nearly a century. Over the period 1864–1866 the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] computed the orbit of the [[Perseids|Perseid]] [[meteor]]s, and based on orbital similarities, correctly hypothesized that the Perseids were fragments of [[Comet Swift–Tuttle]]. The link between comets and meteor showers was dramatically underscored when in 1872, a major meteor shower occurred from the orbit of [[Comet Biela]], which had been observed to split into two pieces during its 1846 apparition, and was never seen again after 1852.&lt;ref name=&quot;KronkBiela&quot;/&gt; A &quot;gravel bank&quot; model of comet structure arose, according to which comets consist of loose piles of small rocky objects, coated with an icy layer.

By the middle of the twentieth century, this model suffered from a number of shortcomings: in particular, it failed to explain how a body that contained only a little ice could continue to put on a brilliant display of evaporating vapor after several perihelion passages. In 1950, [[Fred Lawrence Whipple]] proposed that rather than being rocky objects containing some ice, comets were icy objects containing some dust and rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whipple&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;dirty snowball&quot; model soon became accepted and appeared to be supported by the observations of an armada of [[spacecraft]] (including the [[European Space Agency]]'s ''[[Giotto mission|Giotto]]'' probe and the Soviet Union's ''[[Vega 1]]'' and ''[[Vega 2]]'') that flew through the coma of Halley's Comet in 1986, photographed the nucleus, and observed jets of evaporating material.

==== Recent findings ====
[[File:Comet borrelly.jpg|thumb|[[19P/Borrelly|Comet Borrelly]] exhibits jets, yet is hot and dry.]]
Debate continues about how much ice is in a comet. In 2001, NASA's ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' team, working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, obtained high-resolution images of the surface of [[19P/Borrelly|Comet Borrelly]]. They announced that comet Borrelly exhibits distinct jets, yet has a hot, dry surface. The assumption that comets contain water and other ices led Dr. Laurence Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey to say, &quot;The spectrum suggests that the surface is hot and dry. It is surprising that we saw no traces of water ice.&quot; However, he goes on to suggest that the ice is probably hidden below the crust as &quot;either the surface has been dried out by solar heating and maturation or perhaps the very dark soot-like material that covers Borrelly's surface masks any trace of surface ice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Claudia Alexander, a program scientist for Rosetta from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who has modeled comets for years, reported to ''space.com'' about her astonishment at the number of jets, their appearance on the dark side of the comet as well as on the light side, their ability to lift large chunks of rock from the surface of the comet and the fact that comet Wild 2 is not a loosely cemented rubble pile.&lt;ref&gt;

In April 2011, scientists from the [[University of Arizona]] discovered evidence for the presence of liquid water in a Comet Wild 2. They have found iron and [[copper sulfide]] minerals that must have formed in the presence of water. The discovery shatters the existing paradigm that comets never get warm enough to melt their icy bulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LeBlanc|first=Cecile|title=Evidence for liquid water on the surface of Comet Wild-2|url=http://earthsky.org/space/evidence-for-liquid-water-on-the-surface-of-comet-wild-2|accessdate=2011-04-07|date=2011-04-07|month=April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forthcoming space missions will add greater detail to our understanding of what comets are made of. The European [[Rosetta space probe|''Rosetta'']] probe is presently en route to [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko|Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko]]; in 2014 it will go into orbit around the comet and place a small lander on its surface.

[[File:Comet P1 McNaught02 - 23-01-07.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Comet [[C/2006 P1]] (McNaught)]]
While hundreds of tiny comets pass through the inner solar system every year, very few are noticed by the general public. About every decade or so, a comet will become bright enough to be noticed by a casual observer—such comets are often designated [[Great Comet]]s. In times past, bright comets often inspired panic and hysteria in the general population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of  [[Halley's Comet]] in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet's tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired a fear that [[cyanogen]] in the tail might poison millions,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the appearance of [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the [[Heaven's Gate (cult)|Heaven's Gate]] cult. To most people, however, a great comet is simply a beautiful spectacle.

Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun as seen from the Earth when at its brightest, it will have a chance of becoming a great comet. However, [[Comet Kohoutek]] in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular, but failed to do so. [[Comet West]], which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations (perhaps because scientists were much warier of glowing predictions after the Kohoutek fiasco), but became an extremely impressive comet.&lt;ref&gt;

The late 20th century saw a lengthy gap without the appearance of any great comets, followed by the arrival of two in quick succession—[[Comet Hyakutake]] in 1996, followed by Hale–Bopp, which reached maximum brightness in 1997 having been discovered two years earlier. The first great comet of the 21st century was [[C/2006 P1]] (McNaught), which became visible to naked eye observers in January 2007. It was the brightest in over 40 years.

=== Sungrazing comets ===
[[File:Great Comet of 1882.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Comet of 1882]], is a member of the [[Kreutz Sungrazers|Kreutz group]]]]
{{Main|Sungrazing comet}}

A Sungrazing comet is a comet that passes extremely close to the Sun at [[perihelion]], sometimes within a few thousand kilometres of the Sun's surface. While small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the [[Sun]], larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong [[tidal forces]] they experience often lead to their fragmentation.

About 90% of the sungrazers observed with [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] are members of the [[Kreutz Sungrazers|Kreutz group]], which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first passage through the [[inner solar system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;&gt;
