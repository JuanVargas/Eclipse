The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to [[96P/Machholz|Comet 96P/Machholz]], which is also the parent of two [[meteor shower|meteor streams]], the [[Quadrantids]] and the [[Arietids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohtsuka&quot;&gt;

=== Unusual comets ===
[[File:29P-orbit.gif|thumb|450px|The quasi-circular orbit of 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann compared to [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].]]

Of the thousands of known comets, some are very unusual. Encke's Comet orbits from outside the main asteroid belt to just inside the orbit of the planet  [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] while the Comet [[29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann]] currently travels in a nearly circular orbit entirely between the orbits of  Jupiter and [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;

Some comets have been observed to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets [[Comet West|West]] and [[Comet Ikeya–Seki|Ikeya–Seki]]. [[3D/Biela|Biela]]'s Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its  passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular [[meteor showers]] were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A lesser meteor shower, the [[Andromedids]], occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant cometary disruption was that of [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]], which was discovered in 1993. At the time of its discovery, the comet was in orbit around Jupiter, having been captured by the planet during a very close approach in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This close approach had already broken the comet into hundreds of pieces, and over a period of six days in July 1994, these pieces slammed into Jupiter's atmosphere—the first time astronomers had observed a collision between two objects in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the object likely to have been responsible for the [[Tunguska event]] in 1908 was a fragment of [[Comet Encke|Encke]]'s Comet.&lt;ref&gt;

== Observation ==
[[Image:Comet 2006 VZ13 linear orbital element example.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of a comet's path plotted by planetarium software (Sky Map Pro).]]
[[Image:Comets WISE.jpg|thumb|During its one-year mission, [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] discovered 20 new comets.]]

A new comet may be discovered photographically using a wide-field [[telescope]] or visually with [[binoculars]]. However, even without access to optical equipment, it is still possible for the amateur astronomer to discover a Sun-grazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soho&quot;&gt;
{{cite web
 |last=Farmer |first=S. E.
 |title=Getting Started – SOHO Comet Hunting Techniques/Instructions
 |url=http://www.cometary.net/searching_for_soho_comets.htm
 |publisher=[[Red Barn Observatory]]
 |date=9 August 2009 &lt;!-- 8 September 2009?--&gt;
 |accessdate=2007-07-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer [[Michał Kusiak]] on 26 December 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/2010_12_28/ ''SOHO's 2000th Comet Spotted By Student''], SOHO Hotshots, 28 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the numbers are expected to continue rising steadily for the foreseeable future.

Comets visible to the naked eye are fairly infrequent, but comets that put on fine displays in amateur class telescopes (50&amp;nbsp;mm to 100&amp;nbsp;cm) occur fairly often—as often as several times a year, occasionally with more than one in the sky at the same time. Commonly available astronomical software will plot the orbits of these known comets. They are fast compared to other objects in the sky, but their movement is usually subtle in the eyepiece of a telescope. However, from night to night, they can move several degrees, which is why observers find it useful to have a sky chart such as the one in the adjoining illustration.

The type of display presented by the comet depends on its composition and how close it comes to the sun. Because the volatility of a comet's material decreases as it gets further from the sun, the comet becomes increasingly difficult to observe as a function of not only distance, but the progressive shrinking and eventual disappearance of its tail and the reflective elements it carries. Comets are most interesting when their nucleus is bright and they display a long tail, which to be seen sometimes requires a large field of view best provided by smaller telescopes. Therefore, large amateur instruments (apertures of {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} or larger) that have fainter light grasp do not necessarily confer an advantage in terms of viewing comets. The opportunity to view spectacular comets with relatively small aperture instruments in the {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} range is more frequent than might be guessed from the relatively rare attention they get in the mainstream press.

== In popular culture ==
{{See also|Comets in fiction|Category:Impact events in fiction}}
The depiction of comets in [[popular culture]] is firmly rooted in the long Western tradition of seeing comets as harbingers of doom and as omens of world-altering change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot;&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Van Riper |first=A. B.

 |year=2002
 |isbn=0313318220
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halley's Comet alone has caused a slew of frightful or excited publications of all sorts at each of its reappearances. It was especially noted that the birth and death of some notable persons coincided with separate appearances of the comet, such as with writers [[Mark Twain]] (who correctly speculated that he'd &quot;go out with the comet&quot; in 1910)&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot; /&gt; and [[Eudora Welty]], to whose life [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] dedicated the song ''[[Halley Came to Jackson]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot; /&gt;

In [[science fiction]], the [[impact event|impact of comets]] has been depicted as a threat overcome by technology and heroism (''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'', 1998), or as a trigger of global apocalypse (''[[Lucifer's Hammer]]'', 1979) or of waves of zombies (''[[Night of the Comet]]'', 1984).&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot; /&gt; Near impacts have been depicted in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Off on a Comet]]'' and [[Tove Jansson]]'s ''[[Comet in Moominland]]'', while a large manned space expedition visits Halley's Comet in Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]''.

'''Compost''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|p|ɒ|s|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|p|oʊ|s|t}}) is organic matter that has been [[Biodegradation|decomposed]] and recycled as a fertilizer and soil amendment. Compost is a key ingredient in [[organic farming]]. At its most essential, the process of '''composting''' requires simply piling up waste outdoors and waiting a year or more. Modern, methodical composting is a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The decomposition process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture. Worms and fungi further break up the material. [[Aerobic bacteria]] manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, carbon dioxide and ammonium. The ammonium is further converted by bacteria into plant-nourishing [[nitrite]]s and [[nitrate]]s through the process of [[nitrification]].

Compost can be rich in nutrients. It is used in [[gardens]], [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], and [[agriculture]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a [[soil conditioner]], a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In ecosystems, compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]). Compost can also be used to generate [[biogas]] through [[anaerobic digestion]].

== History ==
[[File:Green compost bin.JPG|thumb|right|A modern compost bin constructed from plastic.]]
Composting as a recognized practice dates to at least the early Roman Empire since [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD 23-79). Traditionally, composting was to pile organic materials until the next planting season, at which time the materials would have decayed enough to be ready for use in the soil. The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease producing organisms, some weed, weed seeds and insects may not be adequately controlled.

Composting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for [[organic farming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trit.us/farming/history-organic-farming.html Heckman, J. 2006. A history of organic farming: transitions from Sir Albert Howard’s War in the Soil to USDA National Organic Program. Renew. Agric. Food Syst. 21:143–150.]&lt;/ref&gt; The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in Wels/Austria in the year 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Welser Anzeiger vom 05. Januar 1921, 67. Jahrgang, Nr. 2, S. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The early personages most cited for propounding composting within farming are for the German-speaking world [[Rudolf Steiner]], founder of a farming method called [[biodynamics]], and [[Annie Francé-Harrar]], who was appointed on behalf of the government in [[Mexico]] and supported the country 1950–1958 to set up a large humus organization in the fight against erosion and soil degradation. In the English-speaking world it was [[Sir Albert Howard]] who worked extensively in [[India]] on sustainable practices and [[Lady Eve Balfour]] who was a huge proponent of composting. Composting was imported to America by various followers of these early European movements in the form of persons such as  [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] (founder of Rodale Organic Gardening), E.E. Pfeiffer (who developed scientific practices in biodynamic farming), Paul Keene (founder of Walnut Acres in Pennsylvania), and Scott and Helen Nearing (who inspired the back-to-land movement of the 1960s). Coincidentally, some of these personages met briefly in India - all were quite influential in the U.S. from the 1960s into the 1980s.

There are many modern proponents of rapid composting which attempt to correct some of the perceived problems associated with traditional, slow composting. Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf The Rapid Compost Method by Robert Raabe, Professor of Plant Pathology, Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt; Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller,  more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling [[Carbon to nitrogen ratio|carbon to nitrogen (CN) ratio]] at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from early writings of Howard and Balfour,  suggesting that in fact modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods which take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many modern scientists who deal with carbon transformations are sceptical that there is a &quot;super-charged&quot; way to get nature to make compost rapidly.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} They also point to the fact that it is the structure of the natural molecules - such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[cellulose]] - that really dictate the rate at which microbial-mediated transformations are possible.

Some cities such as Seattle and [[San Francisco Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance|San Francisco]] require food and yard waste to be sorted for composting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Signs Mandatory Recycling &amp; Composting Laws |url=http://www.inhabitat.com/2009/06/24/san-francisco-mandates-recycling-composting/|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The case for mandatory composting |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2010/03/21/the_case_for_mandatory_composting/|accessdate=19 September 2010 | work=The Boston Globe|first=Aubin|last=Tyler|date=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|200px|thumb|Home compost barrel in the Escuela Barreales, Chile.]]
Composting organisms require four equally important things to work effectively:
* Carbon &amp;mdash; for energy; the microbial [[oxidation]] of carbon produces the heat {{citation needed |date=July 2010}}.
**High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.
* Nitrogen &amp;mdash; to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon.
**High nitrogen materials tend to be green (or colorful, such as fruits and vegetables) and wet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.extension.uiuc.edu/homecompost/materials.html Materials for composting - University of Illinois extension, retrieval date: 3/12/2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oxygen &amp;mdash; for oxidizing the carbon, the decomposition process.
* Water &amp;mdash; in the right amounts to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions.
[[Image:Compost pile.JPG|200px|thumb|Materials in a compost pile.]]
Certain ratios of these materials will provide beneficial bacteria with the nutrients to work at a rate that will heat up the pile. In that process much water will be released as [[evaporation|vapor]] (&quot;steam&quot;), and the oxygen will be quickly depleted, explaining the need to actively manage the pile. The hotter the pile gets, the more often added air and water is necessary; the air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures (135°-160° Fahrenheit) until the materials are broken down. At the same time, too much air or water also slows the process, as does too much carbon (or too little nitrogen).

The most efficient composting occurs with a carbon:nitrogen mix of about 30 to 1. Nearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely, with characteristics noted above (dry/wet, brown/green).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klickitatcounty.org/SolidWaste/fileshtml/organics/compostCalc.htm Klickitat County WA, USA Compost Mix Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15 to 1 and dry autumn leaves about 50 to 1 depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C:N range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point in time - in this respect, home composting is like horseshoes, perfect is great, but close still works. Observation of amounts, and consideration of different materials&lt;ref name=&quot;compost.css.cornell.edu&quot;&gt;[http://compost.css.cornell.edu/calc/lignin.html Effect of lignin content on bio-availability]&lt;/ref&gt; as a pile is built over time, can quickly achieve a workable technique for the individual situation.

===Urine===

People excrete far more of certain [[water-soluble]] plant nutrients ([[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]]) in [[urine]] than in [[feces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/iys/docs/san_lib_docs/ESR2web%5B1%5D.pdf Stockholm Environment Institute - EcoSanRes - Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production]&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[Fertilizer#Animal|urine can be used directly as fertilizer]] or it can be put onto compost. Adding a healthy person's [[urine]] to compost usually will increase temperatures and therefore increase its ability to destroy pathogens and unwanted seeds. Urine from a person with no obvious symptoms of infection is generally much more sanitary than fresh [[feces]]. Unlike feces, urine doesn't attract disease-spreading [[flies]] (such as [[house flies]] or [[blow flies]]), and it doesn't harbor the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs. Urine usually does not [[odor|stink]] for long, particularly when it is fresh, diluted, or put on [[sorbent]]s.

Urine is primarily composed of water and [[urea]]. Although metabolites of urea are nitrogen fertilizers, it is easy to over-fertilize with urine creating too much ammonia for plants to absorb, acidic conditions, or other [[phytotoxicity]].

===Manure and bedding===
On many farms, the basic composting ingredients are manure generated on the farm and bedding.  Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials.  Nontraditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions.  Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.  Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting.  Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, needs to be mixed with straw or similar raw materials.  Poultry manure also needs to be blended with carbonaceous materials - preferably those low in nitrogen, such as sawdust or straw.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Reource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micro-organisms===
With the proper mixture of water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, micro-organisms are allowed to break down organic matter to produce  compost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenmi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenmi.net/compost-made-simple/|title=Compost Made Simple [[Greenmi.net]]|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The composting process is dependant on micro-organisms to break down organic matter into compost.  There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/microorg.html|title=Composting - Compost Microorganisms|work=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bacteria]]- The most numerous of all the [[micro organisms]] found in compost.
* [[Actinomycetes]]- Necessary for breaking down paper products such as newspaper, [[bark]], etc.
* [[Fungi]]- [[Molds]] and [[yeast]] help break down materials that bacteria cannot, especially [[lignin]] in woody material.
* [[Protozoa]]- Help consume bacteria, fungi and micro organic particulates.
* [[Rotifers]]- Rotifers help control populations of bacteria and small protozoans.

The reason your compost will heat up is the thermophillic bacteria works best as high temperatures. This will, if the correct Carbon to Nitrogen ration is attained, heat up your compost pile.

In addition, [[earthworm]]s not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.

A lack of a healthy micro-organisms community is the main reason why composting processes are slow in [[landfills]] with environmental factors such as lack of oxygen, nutrients or water being the cause of the depleted biological community.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;/&gt;

==Common Items Suitable for Composting==
These common items can likely be added to compost with no negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantdex.com/index.php/planting-guides/49-water-and-soil-managment/142-composting|title=Composting|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cardboard or clean paper
* Dried-out egg shells
* Leaves, yard trimmings
* Fruits and vegetables 
* Coffee and tea

==Uses==
{{Main|Uses of compost}}
Compost is generally recommended as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying [[humus]] and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'', or a porous, absorbent material that holds moisture and soluble minerals, providing the support and [[nutrients]] in which plants can flourish, although it is rarely used alone, being primarily mixed with [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, [[bark]] chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]].

Generally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s which may inhibit germination,&lt;ref&gt;Morel, P. and Guillemain, G. 2004. Assessment of the possible [[phytotoxicity]] of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest. Acta Horticulture 644:417–423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Itävaara et al. Compost maturity - problems associated with testing. in Proceedings of Composting. Innsbruck Austria 18-21.10.2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18585031 Phytotoxicity and maturation]&lt;/ref&gt; and the possible tie up of nitrogen by incompletely decomposed [[lignin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compost.css.cornell.edu&quot;/&gt; It is very common to see blends of 20–30% compost used for transplanting [[seedlings]] at [[cotyledon]] stage or later.

=== Destroying pathogens, seeds, or unwanted plants ===
Composting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s. Unwanted living plants (or [[weed]]s) can be discouraged by [[Mulch#Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants|covering with mulch/compost]].

The &quot;[[biopesticide|microbial pesticides]]&quot; in compost may include [[thermophile]]s and [[mesophile]]s, however certain composting [[detritivores]] such as [[black soldier fly larvae]] and [[redworm]]s, also reduce many pathogens. Thermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include [[prion]]s). However, thermophilic composting requires a fair amount of material, around a cubic meter. Destruction of pathogens would only take place in the high temperature zone in the center and not in the outer fringes—it is therefor a questionable practice if the intent is to kill pathogens.

The [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] qualities of ([[thermophilic]]) composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens, such as with [[manure]]. Applications include [[humanure]] composting or the [[deep litter]] technique.

==Types==
===Bokashi composting===
[[Image:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started Bokashi bin. The aerated base is just visible through the food scraps and Bokashi bran.]]
Bokashi is a method of intensive [[composting]]. It can use an [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] inoculation to produce the compost. Once a [[starter culture]] is made, it can be used to extend the culture indefinitely, like [[yogurt]] culture. Since the popular introduction of [[effective microorganism]]s (EM), Bokashi is commonly made with only [[molasses]], water, EM, and [[wheat bran]].

In home composting applications, kitchen waste is placed into a container which can be sealed with an [[air tight]] lid. These scraps are then [[Inoculation|inoculated]] with a Bokashi [[Effective microorganism|EM]] mix. This usually takes the form of a carrier, such as [[rice hulls]], wheat bran or saw dust, that has been inoculated with composting micro-organisms. The EM are natural [[lactic acid]] bacteria, yeast, and [[phototroph]]ic bacteria that act as a microbe community within the kitchen scraps, fermenting and accelerating breakdown of the organic matter. The user would place alternating layers of food scraps and Bokashi mix until the container is full.  Liquid &quot;compost tea&quot; is drained once or twice a week and can be diluted 1:100 and added to plants as fertilizer, or poured directly down drains to help clean them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bokashi Composting Australia|url=http://www.bokashi.com.au/How-Bokashi-works.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the container is full, it is left to ferment for an additional 2 weeks in the container, and then buried under 6-8&amp;nbsp;inches of soil, in ground or in a non-reactive container.  After another two weeks buried under soil, the food scraps should be broken down into rich compost.

===Compost tea===
Compost tea is a liquid solution or suspension made by steeping compost in water. It is used as both a [[fertilizer]] and in attempts to prevent plant diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, W., Han, D. Y., Dick, W. A., Davis, K. R., and Hoitink, H. A. J. 1998. Compost and compost water extract-induced systemic acquired resistance in cucumber and ''Arabidopsis''. Phytopathology 88:450-455.&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid is applied as a spray to non-edible plant parts such as seedlings, or as a soil-drench (root dip), or as a surface spray to reduce incidence of harmful [[phytopathogenic]] fungi in the [[phyllosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Tränkner, A. 1992. Use of agricultural and municipal organic wastes to develop suppressiveness to plant pathogens. in: ''Biological Control of Plant Diseases''. E. C. Tjamos, G. C. Papavizas, and R. J. Cook, eds. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hügelkultur===
The practice of making raised beds filled with rotting wood.&lt;ref&gt;http://permaculture.org.au/2010/08/03/the-art-and-science-of-making-a-hugelkultur-bed-transforming-woody-debris-into-a-garden-resource/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in effect creating a [[Nurse log]] though covered with dirt.  The buried decomposing wood will give off heat, as all compost does, for several years.  This effect has been used by [[Sepp Holzer]] for one to allow fruit trees to survive at otherwise inhospitable temperatures and altitudes.

===&quot;Humanure&quot;{{anchor|Humanure}}===
{{For|the album|Humanure (album)}}

'''&quot;Humanure&quot;''' is a [[neologism]] designating human excrement (feces and urine) that is [[recycling|recycled]] via [[composting]] for [[agriculture|agricultural]] or other purposes. The term was popularized in a 1994 book by Joseph Jenkins &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephjenkins.com ''Joseph Jenkins'']&lt;/ref&gt; that advocates the use of this [[organic material|organic]] [[soil]] amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last= Jenkins|first=J.C. |year= 2005|publisher= Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|location=Grove City, PA |isbn= 978-0-9644258-3-5|pages=255 |url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com |accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanure is not traditional [[sewage]] that has been processed by [[Sewage treatment|waste-treatment]] facilities, which may include waste from [[industry|industrial]] and other sources; rather, it is the combination of [[feces]] and [[urine]] with paper and additional [[carbon]] material (such as [[sawdust]]). A humanure system, such as a [[composting toilet]] does not require water or electricity, and when properly managed does not smell.

By disposing of feces and urine through composting, the nutrients contained in them are returned to the soil. This aids in preventing [[soil degradation]]. Human fecal matter and urine have high percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, carbon, and calcium. It is equal to many [[fertilizers]] and [[manures]] purchased in garden stores. Humanure aids in the conservation of [[fresh water]] by avoiding the usage of potable water required by the typical flush [[toilet]]. It further prevents the pollution of ground water by controlling the fecal matter decomposition before entering the system. When properly managed, there should be no ground contamination from [[leachate]].

As a substitute for a flush water process, it reduces the energy consumption and hence [[greenhouse gas]] emissions associated with the transportation and processing of [[Water purification|water]] and [[Sewage treatment|waste water]].

Humanure may be deemed safe for humans to use on [[agriculture|crops]] if handled in accordance with local health regulations, and composted properly. This means that [[thermophilic]] decomposition of the humanure must heat it sufficiently to destroy harmful [[pathogen]]s, or enough time must have elapsed since fresh material was added that [[biology|biological]] activity has killed any pathogens. To be safe for crops, a curing stage is often needed to allow a second [[mesophile|mesophilic]] phase to reduce potential [[phytotoxin]]s.

Humanure is different from [[night soil]], which is raw human waste spread on crops. While aiding the return of nutrients in fecal matter to the soil, it can carry and spread a vast number of human pathogens. Humanure kills these pathogens both by the extreme heat of the composting and the extended amount of time (1 to 2 years) that it is allowed to decompose.

===Vermicompost===
[[Image:Worm.casts.jpg|thumb|left|Rotary screen harvested worm castings]]
Vermicompost is the product of [[composting]] utilizing various species of worms, usually [[Eisenia foetida|red wigglers]], [[Enchytraeus buchholzi|white worms]], and [[earthworm]]s to create a heterogeneous mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste (not to include meat, dairy, fats or oils), bedding materials, and vermicast. Vermicast, also known as [[worm cast]]ings, worm humus or worm manure, is the end-product of the breakdown of [[organic matter]] by [[species]] of [[earthworm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwoodsforestgardens.blogspot.com/2009/01/paper-on-invasive-european-worms.html |title=Paper on Invasive European Worms |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earthworm species (or '''composting worms''') most often used are Red Wigglers (''[[Eisenia foetida]]'' or ''[[Eisenia andrei]]''), though European nightcrawlers (''[[Eisenia hortensis]]'') could also be used. [[Eisenia foetida|Red wigglers]] are recommended by most vermiculture experts as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including ''[[dendrobaenas]]'', ''[[dendras]]'', and [[Belgian nightcrawlers]].

Containing water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Kelly and Erik Knutzen. ''The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City.'' Port Townsend: Process Self Reliance Series, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermicompost tea has been shown to cause a 173.5% increase in plant growth by mass over plants grown without castings. These results were seen with only 10% addition of castings to produce these results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wormsetc.com/worms-etc-blog/2010/04/worm-castings/ Web article on worm castings effects on plant growth]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative to landfilling==
As concern about [[landfill]] space increases, worldwide interest in [[recycling]] by means of [[composting]] is growing, since composting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormcon.com/mw_0107_history.html A Brief History of Solid Waste Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial scale composting in the form of [[in-vessel composting]], [[aerated static pile composting]], and [[anaerobic digestion]] takes place in most Western countries now, and in many areas is mandated by law. There are process and product guidelines in Europe that date to the early 1980s (Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland) and only more recently in the UK and the US.

=== Industrial systems ===
[[Image:Bomberos2.jpg|thumb|right|A large compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by thermophilic microorganisms.]]
Industrial composting systems are increasingly being installed as a waste management alternative to [[landfill]]s, along with other [[advanced waste processing systems]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[anaerobic digestion]] or [[in-vessel composting]], is called [[mechanical biological treatment]], increasingly used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobically]] in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]]. 

Large-scale composting systems are used by many urban centers around the world. Co-composting is a technique which combines solid waste with de-watered biosolids, although difficulties controlling inert and plastic contamination from [[municipal solid waste]] makes this approach less attractive. The world's largest MSW co-composter is the [[Edmonton Composting Facility]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], which turns 220,000 tonnes of residential solid waste and 22,500 dry tonnes of biosolids per year into 80,000 tonnes of compost. The facility is 38,690&amp;nbsp;meters&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (416,500&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), equivalent to 4½ [[Canadian football]] fields, and the operating structure is the largest stainless steel building in [[North America]], the size of 14 [[NHL]] rinks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/for_residents/garbage_recycling/edmonton-composting-facility.aspx Edmonton composting facility]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[State of Qatar]] awarded Keppel Seghers Singapore, a subsidiary of [[Keppel Corporation]] to begin construction on a 275,000 tonne/year Anaerobic Digestion and Composting Plant licensed by [[Kompogas]] Switzerland. This plant, with 15 independent anaerobic digestors will be the world's largest composting facility once fully operational in early 2011 and forms part of the [[Qatar Domestic Solid Waste Management Center]], the largest integrated [[waste management]] complex in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://keppelseghers.com.sg/ref_Qatar Keppel Seghers developing the first integrated waste management facility in the Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corundum''' is a [[crystal]]line form of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}) with traces of [[iron]], [[titanium]] and [[chromium]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; It is a [[rock (geology)|rock]]-forming [[mineral]]. It is one of the naturally clear [[transparent materials]], but can have different colors when impurities are present. [[Transparent alumina|Transparent]] specimens are used as [[Gemstone|gem]]s, called [[ruby]] if [[red]] and padparadscha if a pink-orange, while all other colors are called [[sapphire]]. 

The name &quot;corundum&quot; is derived from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word குருந்தம் &quot;kuruntam&quot; meaning &quot;ruby&quot;, itself derived from the [[Sanskrit]] &quot;kuruvinda&quot;.&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;

Because of corundum's hardness (pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]]), it can scratch almost every other [[mineral]]. It is commonly used as an [[abrasive]], on everything from [[sandpaper]] to large machines used in machining metals, plastics, and wood. Some [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] is a mix of corundum and other substances, and the mix is less [[abrasive]], with an average [[hardness]] near 8.0. 

In addition to its hardness, corundum is unusual for its [[density]] of 4.02 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is very high for a transparent mineral composed of the low [[atomic mass]] elements [[aluminium]] and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleries.com/minerals/oxides/corundum/corundum.htm Mineral Galleries]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and occurrence==
[[Image:Corindon azulEZ.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Corundum from [[Brazil]], size about 2x3&amp;nbsp;cm.]]
Corundum occurs as a mineral in mica [[schist]], [[gneiss]], and some [[marble]]s in [[Metamorphic]] [[terranes]]. It also occurs in low silica [[igneous]] [[syenite]] and [[nepheline syenite]] [[intrusive]]s. Other occurrences are as masses adjacent to [[ultramafic]] intrusives, associated with [[lamprophyre]] [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] and as large crystals in [[pegmatite]]s.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; Because of its hardness and resistance to weathering, it commonly occurs as a [[detrital]] mineral in stream and beach sands.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; The largest documented single crystal of corundum measured about 65×40×40&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corundum for abrasives is mined in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Russia]], and [[India]]. Historically it was mined from deposits associated with [[dunite]]s in [[North Carolina]], [[United States|USA]] and from a [[nepheline syenite]] in [[Craigmont, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] grade corundum is found on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Naxos (Crete)|Naxos]] and near [[Peekskill, New York]], USA. Abrasive corundum is synthetically manufactured from [[bauxite]].&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt;

==Synthetic corundum==
In 1837, Gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing [[alumina]] at a high temperature with a small amount of [[chromium]] as a pigment. In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphires by fusing [[Aluminum oxide|alumina]] in [[boric acid]]. In 1877 Frenic and Freil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing [[Barium fluoride|{{chem|BaF|2}}]] and {{chem|Al|2|O|3}} with a little chromium at temperatures above {{convert|2000|C|0|abbr=on}}. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Corundum.GIF|thumb|250 px|left|Crystal structure of corundum]]

The [[Verneuil process]] allows the production of flawless single-crystal [[sapphire]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and other corundum gems of much larger size than normally found in nature. It is also possible to grow gem-quality synthetic corundum by flux-growth and [[hydrothermal synthesis]]. Because of the simplicity of the methods involved in corundum synthesis, large quantities of these crystals have become available on the market causing a significant reduction of price in recent years. Apart from ornamental uses, synthetic corundum is also used to produce mechanical parts (tubes, rods, bearings, and other machined parts), scratch-resistant optics, scratch-resistant [[Watch#Overview|watch crystals]], instrument windows for satellites and spacecraft (because of its transparency from the UV to IR), and [[laser]] components.

'''Capoeira''' ({{IPA-pt|kapuˈejɾɐ}}) is a [[Brazil]]ian art form that combines elements of [[martial arts]], [[sports]], and [[music]]. It was created in [[Brazil]] mainly by descendants of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] with [[Brazilian indigenous people|Brazilian native influences]], probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power [[kick]]s and [[Leg_sweep#Leg_trip|quick leg sweeps]], with some ground and aerial acrobatics, knee strikes, take-downs, elbow strikes, punches and [[headbutt]]s.

The word ''capoeira'' comes from [[Tupi-guarani language|Tupi]], referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.

== History ==
Capoeira's history probably begins with the adoption of African slavery in [[Brazil]]. Since the 16th century, [[Portugal]] extensively adopted slavery to man their colonies, coming mainly from [[Africa#Territories_and_regions|West  and Central Africa]]. Brazil, with its vast territory, was the major destination of African slaves, receiving  [[Atlantic_slave_trade#New_World_destinations|38.5% of all slaves]] sent by ships across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Capoeira has a long and controversial history, since historical documentation in Brazil was very scarce in its colonial times. Evidences, studies and [[oral tradition]] leave little doubt about its Brazilian roots, but it is impossible to precisely identify the exact location and time it began to take form.

=== Origins ===

In the 16th century Portugal had one of the biggest colonial empires of the world, but it lacked people to actually colonize it. In the Brazilian colony the Portuguese, like many European colonists, opted to use [[slavery]] to supply this shortage of workers. Colonists tried to enslave [[Brazilian indigenous people|Brazilian natives]] in the beginning, but this quickly proved too difficult for many reasons, including the familiarity natives had with the land. The solution was importing slaves from Africa. &lt;ref name=&quot;inicio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.culturabrasil.pro.br/brasilcolonia.htm |title=O Brasil no quadro do Antigo Sistema Colonial (in Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first century the main economic activity in the colony was the production and processing of [[sugarcane]]. Portuguese colonists used to create large sugarcane farms called ''engenhos'', farms which extensively used enslaved workers. Slaves, living in inhumane and humiliating conditions, were forced to work hard and often suffered physical punishment for any small misbehaviour &lt;ref name=&quot;inicio&quot; /&gt;. Even though slaves outnumbered the Portuguese colonists, the lack of weapons, the colonial law, the disagreement between slaves coming from different African cultures and their complete lack of knowledge about the land and its surroundings would usually discourage the idea of a rebellion.

In this environment Capoeira began to develop. More than a fighting style, it was created as a hope of survival, a tool with which an escaped slave, completely unequipped, could survive in the hostile, unknown land and face the hunt of the ''capitães-do-mato'', colonial agents in charge of finding escapees, always armed and mounted.

=== Quilombos ===

[[File:Antônio Parreiras - Zumbi.jpg|thumb|left|Antônio Parreiras picturing a ''quilombola'']]
Soon several groups of African slaves would gather and establish [[Quilombo]]s, primitive settlements in far and hard to reach places. After its humble start, some ''quilombos'' would develop, attracting more runaway slaves, Brazilian natives and even Europeans escaping the law or [[Catholicism|catholic]] extremism. Sometimes a ''quilombo'' would become a real independent multi-ethnic state.&lt;ref name=&quot;mocambos&quot;&gt;GOMES, Flávio – ''Mocambos de Palmares; histórias e fontes (séculos XVI-XIX)'' (2010), Editora 7 Letras, ISBN 978-85-7577-641-4 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyday life in a ''quilombo'' would offer freedom and the opportunity to rescue traditional cultures lost due to colonial oppression.&lt;ref name=&quot;mocambos&quot; /&gt; In this kind of multi-ethnic community, constantly threatened by Portuguese colonial troops, Capoeira evolved from a survival tool to a martial art focused on war.

The biggest of the ''quilombos'', the [[Palmares (quilombo)|Quilombo dos Palmares]], consisted of many villages mostly of African slaves though they also consisted of other ethnicities and lasted for more than a century, resisting, often outnumbered, many colonial attacks. This ''quilombo'' resisted at least 24 small attacks and 18 great colonial invasions. Portuguese soldiers sometimes stated it took more than one [[dragoon]] to capture a ''quilombo'' warrior, since they would defend themselves with a ''strangely moving fighting technique''. The governor from that province declared &quot;it is harder to defeat a ''quilombo'' than the [[Netherlands|dutch]] invaders&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mocambos&quot; /&gt;

=== Urbanization ===

Things in the colony began to change when the prince and future king [[John VI of Portugal|Dom João VI]], along with the whole Portuguese court, escaped to Brazil in [[1808]] due to Portugal being [[Peninsular War|invaded]] by Napoleonic troops. The colony, a mere source of natural resources, would finally begin to develop as a nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;gomes&quot;&gt;GOMES, Laurentino – ''1808; Como uma rainha louca, um príncipe medroso e uma corte corrupta enganaram Napoleão e mudaram a História de Portugal e do Brasil'' (2007), Editora Planeta, ISBN 978-85-7665-320-2 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese monopoly effectively came to an end when Brazilian ports opened for trade with foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historiadobrasil.net/documentos/abertura_dos_portos.htm|title=Abertura dos portos brasileiros (in Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities would grow in importance and Brazilian people could finally get the permission to manufacture common products once imported from Portugal, like glass.&lt;ref name=&quot;gomes&quot; /&gt;

Registries of ''Capoeira'' practices existed since the 18th century in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]], but the huge increase of urban slaves and ''social life'' in Brazilian cities gave ''Capoeira'' a greater notoriety and diffusion capacity. In ''Rio'' the use of Capoeira was getting so problematic that the colonial government established severe physical punishments to its practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://historia.abril.com.br/comportamento/gangues-rio-capoeira-era-reprimida-brasil-435027.shtml|title=Gangues do Rio: Capoeira era reprimida no Brasil (in Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Matthias Röhrig Assunção provided ample data from police records, dating back to the 1800s, demonstrating that Capoeira was an ''important reason'' to detain slaves and ''free coloured individuals''. &quot;From 288 slaves that entered the Calabouço jail during the years 1857 and 1858, 80 (31%) were arrested for Capoeira, and only 28 (10.7%) for running away.  Out of 4,303 arrests in Rio police jail in 1862, 404 detainees -- nearly 10% -- had been arrested for Capoeira.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;ASSUNÇÃO, Matthias Röhrig - ''Capoeira: A History of an Afro-Brazilian Martial Art'' (2005), Routledge, ISBN 0-7146-8086-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The end of slavery and prohibition ===

[[File:Lei Áurea.jpg|thumb|right|Original ''Lei Áurea'' document]]
At the end of the XIX [[century]], slavery in the [[Brazilian Empire]] was already doomed for many reasons, among them the ever increasing number of slave's escapes and the frequent raids by ''quilombo'' militias on properties which still adopted slavery. The Empire tried to soften the problems with laws that would restrict slavery, but Brazil would inevitably recognize its end on May 13, 1888, with a law called ''Lei Áurea'', sanctioned by imperial parliament and signed by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|princess Isabel]].

Free, black people would soon find themselves abandoned. A vast majority had nowhere to live, no job and were despised by Brazilian society, which usually saw them as lazy workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/sobre/historia/abolicao|title=A abolição (in Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cardoso&quot;&gt;CARDOSO, Fernando Henrique – ''Capitalismo e Escravidão no Brasil Meridional'' (1962), Editora Civilização Brasileira, ISBN 8520006353 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; The increase of European and Asian workers of that time would diminish job opportunities even more and many black people would become marginalized. With them, naturally, the Capoeira.&lt;ref name=&quot;cardoso&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;favela&quot;&gt;CAMPOS, Andrelino – ''Do Quilombo à Favela: A Produção do &quot;Espaço Criminalizado&quot; no Rio de Janeiro'', Editora Bertrand Brasil, ISBN 8528611590 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inevitable that Capoeira practitioners would start using their abilities in unconventional ways. Many began to use Capoeira as body guards, mercenaries, hitmen, henchmen. Groups of Capoeira practitioners, known as ''maltas'', used to terrorize Rio de Janeiro. In little time, in 1890, the recently proclaimed Brazilian Republic decreed the prohibition of Capoeira in the whole country,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/C%C3%B3digo_penal_brasileiro_-_proibi%C3%A7%C3%A3o_da_capoeira_-_1890|title=Código penal brasileiro - proibição da Capoeira – 1890 (in Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; as things were pretty chaotic in the Brazilian capital and many police reports would demonstrate that Capoeira was an undesired advantage in a fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;favela&quot; /&gt;

After the prohibition, any citizen caught practicing Capoeira, in a fight or for any other reason, would be arrested, tortured and often mutilated by the police. The art of Capoeira, after brief freedom, was once again condemned and repressed. Cultural practices, like the ''roda de Capoeira'', were conducted in far or hidden places and often practitioners would leave someone as sentry, to warn if the police was approaching the area.

=== Luta Regional Baiana ===

In 1932, a time when Capoeira repression wasn't as strong as before, [[Manuel dos Reis Machado|Mestre Bimba]], a strong fighter both in legal and illegal fights, founded in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] the first ever Capoeira school. ''Bimba'', analyzing the way many ''capoeiristas'' were using their abilities only to impress tourists, believed that Capoeira was losing its efficiency as a martial art. Thus ''Bimba'', helped by his student José Cisnando Lima, intent on returning Capoiera to a method similar how it was used by the Quilombos, Mestre Bimba was intent on making it more combat-focused, and added some moves from traditional fighting styles, like [[Batuque (game)|Batuque]] and to a very limited extent wrestling. ''Bimba'' also developed the first Capoeira systematical training method. As the word Capoeira was still forbidden by Brazilian law, ''Bimba'' called his new style '''Luta Regional Baiana''' (meaning ''regional fight from Bahia'').&lt;ref name=&quot;bimba&quot;&gt;SODRE, Muniz – ''Mestre Bimba: Corpo de Mandiga'' (2002), Livraria da Travessa, ISBN 8586218138 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1937]] ''Bimba'' founded the school ''Centro de Cultura Física e Luta Regional'', with official permission of Salvador’s Secretary of Education (''Secretaria da Educação, Saúde e Assistência de Salvador). His work is very well accepted in ''Salvador'' and ''Bimba'' gets the opportunity to teach Capoeira to the ''elite'' of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;bimba&quot; /&gt; Finally in [[1940]] Capoeira leaves the Brazilian law code and definitely leaves illegality.

Soon the notoriety of Bimba's Capoeira proved to be a problem to traditional ''capoeiristas'', who were gradually losing visibility and were still distrusted by society. This imbalance began to change with the founding of ''Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola'' (CECA), in [[1941]], by [[Vicente Ferreira Pastinha]]. Located in the neighbourhood of ''Pelourinho'', in Salvador, this school attracted many traditional ''capoeiristas'' who would prefer to keep Capoeira as original as possible. CECA's notoriety immortalized the name ''Capoeira Angola'' as definition of the traditional Capoeira style. The term wasn't new, as during the 19th century Capoeira was in some places referred as ''brincar de angola'' (meaning play Angola) and many other masters which did not use Pastinha's techniques adopted it.&lt;ref name=&quot;noronha&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portalcapoeira.com/Publicacoes-e-Artigos/o-abc-da-capoeira-angola-os-manuscritos-de-mestre-noronha|title=Os Manuscritos do Mestre Noronha (in Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capoeira today ===

Capoeira nowadays is not only a martial art or a small aspect of Brazilian society, but an active exporter of [[Brazilian culture]] all over the world. Since the 1970s masters of the art form began to emigrate and teach capoeira in the United States and other countries. Present in many countries in every continent, every year Capoeira attracts to Brazil thousands of foreign students and, often, foreign ''capoeiristas'' work hard to learn the official Brazilian language, Portuguese, in an effort to better understand and become part of the art. Renowned Capoeira Masters are often invited to teach abroad or even establish their own schools. Capoeira presentations, normally theatrical, acrobatic and with little martiality, are common sights in the whole world.

The ''martial art'' aspect is still present and, like old times, is still subtle and disguised, leading many non-practitioners to ignore its presence. Trickery is ever present and expert ''capoeiristas'' seldom take their sights off their opponents in a Capoeira ''game''. An attack can be disguised even as a friendly gesture. Such trickery amongst a collection of others are all a form of [[malicia]] which is used by both Capoiera Regional and Angola. 

Symbol of the afro-Brazilian culture, symbol of the ethnic amalgam that characterizes Brazil, symbol of resistance to the oppression, Capoeira definitely changed its image and became a source of pride to Brazilian people. It is officially considered [[Intangible culture|intangible cultural heritage]] of Brazil.

== Martial Art ==

Capoeira is a fast and versatile martial art which is historically focused on fighting outnumbered or in technological disadvantage.
{{See also|List of capoeira techniques}}

[[File:Ginga de dos.gif|thumb|200px|direita|Simple animation depicting part of the ''ginga'']]
The [[Ginga (capoeira)|''ginga'']] (literally: rocking back and forth; to swing) is the fundamental movement in capoeira, important both for attack and defense purposes. It has two main objectives. One is to keep the ''capoeirista'' in a state of constant motion, preventing him from being a still and easy target. The other, using also fakes and feints, is to mislead, fool, trick the opponent, letting him open for an attack or a counter-attack.

The '''attacks''' in the Capoeira should be done when opportunity arises and must be decisive, like a direct kick in the face or a vital body part, or a strong takedown. Most Capoeira attacks are made with the legs, like direct or swirling kicks, rasteiras (leg sweeps), [[List_of_capoeira_techniques#Tesoura|tesouras]] or knee strikes. The head strike is a very important counter-attack move. Elbow strikes, punches and other forms of takedowns complete the main list.

The '''defense''' is based on the principle of non-resistance, meaning avoid an attack using evasive moves instead of blocking it. Avoids are called ''esquivas'', which depend on the direction of the attack and intention of the defender, and can be done standing or with a hand leaning on the floor. A block should only be made when the ''esquiva'' is not possible. This fighting strategy allows quick and unpredictable counter attacks, the ability to focus on more than one adversary and to face empty-handed an armed adversary.

[[Image:Auangole.gif|thumb|left|130px|A Capoeira movement (Aú Fechado) (click for animation).]]
A series of rolls and acrobatics (like the [[Cartwheel (Capoeira)|Cartwheels]] called [[aú]]) allows the capoeirista to quickly overcome a takedown or a lost of balance, and to position themselves around the aggressor in order to lay up for an attack. It is this combination of attacks and defense which gives Capoeira its perceived 'fluidity' and choreography-like style.

== Capoeira Game ==

[[Image:Capoeira Dance.jpg|thumb|Capoeiristas outside]]
Playing Capoeira is both a game and a method of practicing the application of Capoeira movements in dangerous situations. It can be played anywhere, but it's usually done in a ''roda''. During the game most Capoeira moves are used, but ''capoeiristas'' usually avoid using punches or elbow strikes.

The game usually does not focus on knocking down the opponent or destroying him, rather it emphasizes skill. ''Capoeiristas'' often prefer to rely on a takedown like a ''rasteira'', then allowing the opponent to recover and get back into the game. It is also very common to slow down a kick inches before hitting the target, so a ''capoeirista'' can enforce his superiority without the need of injuring the opponent. If an opponent clearly cannot dodge an attack, there is no reason to complete it. However, between two high-skilled ''capoeiristas'', the game can get much more aggressive and dangerous, even thought ''capoeiristas'' tend to avoid showing this kind of game in presentations or to the general public.

=== Roda ===

[[Image:Roda de capoeira1.jpg|thumb|Capoeiristas in a ''rhoda'' ([[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]])]]

The ''Roda'' (pronounced HO-dah) is a circle formed by ''capoeiristas'' and ''capoeira'' musical instruments, where every participant sings the typical songs and claps their hands following the music. Two ''capoeiristas'' enter the ''roda'' and play the game according to the style required by the musical instruments rhythm. The game finishes when one of the musicians holding a [[berimbau]] determine it, when one of the ''capoeiristas'' decide to leave or call the end of the game or when another capoeirista interrupts the game to start playing, either with one of the current players or with another ''capoeirista''.

In a ''roda'' every cultural aspect of Capoeira is present, not only the martial side. Aerial acrobatics are common in a presentation ''roda'', while not seen as often in a more serious one.

==== Batizado ====

The ''batizado'' (baptism) is  a ceremonial ''roda'' where new students will get recognized as ''capoeiristas'' and earn their first graduation. Also more experienced students may go up in rank, depending on their skills and capoeira culture.

Students enter the ''roda'' against a high-ranked ''capoeirista'' (a teacher or master) and normally the game ends with the student being taken down. However, the more experienced capoeirista can judge the takedown unnecessary. Following this 'baptism' the new cord is given.

===== Apelido =====

Traditionally, the batizado is the moment when the new practitioner gets or formalizes his or her '''apelido''' (literally ''nickname''). This tradition was created back when Capoeira practice was considered a crime. To avoid having problems with the law, ''capoeiristas'' would present themselves in the capoeira community only by their nicknames. So if a ''capoeirista'' was captured by the police, he would be unable to identify his fellow ''capoeiristas'', even when tortured.

''Apelidos'' can come from many different things. A physical characteristic (like being tall or big), an habit (like smiling or drinking too much), place of birth, a particular skill, an animal, trivial things, anything.

Nowadays, even though apelidos are not necessary anymore, the tradition is still very alive not only in Capoeira but in many aspects of Brazilian culture.

=== Chamada ===

''Chamada'' means 'call' and can happen at any time during a ''roda'' where the rhythm ''angola'' is being played. It happens when one player, usually the more advanced one, calls his opponent to a dance-like ritual. The opponent then approaches the caller and meets him to walk side by side. After it both resume normal play.

While it may seem like a break time or a dance, the ''chamada'' is actually both a trap and a test, as the caller is just expecting to see if his opponent will let his guard down so that he can perform a takedown or a strike. It is a critical situation, because both players are vulnerable due to the close proximity and potential for a surprise attack. It's also a tool for experienced practitioners and masters of the art to test a student's awareness and demonstrate when the student left himself open to attack.

The use of the ''chamada'' can result in a highly developed sense of awareness and helps practitioners learn the subtleties of anticipating another person's hidden intentions. The ''chamada'' can be very simple, consisting solely of the basic elements, or the ritual can be quite elaborate including a competitive dialogue of trickery, or even theatric embellishments.

=== Volta ao mundo ===

'''Volta ao mundo''' means ''around the world''.

The ''volta ao mundo'' takes place after an exchange of movements has reached a conclusion, or after there has been a disruption in the harmony of the game. In either of these situations, one player will begin walking around the perimeter of the circle, and the other player will join the ''volta ao mundo'' before returning to the normal game.

=== Malandragem ===
Malandragem is a word that comes from malandro, which means a person who possesses cunning as well as [[malicia]], which translates to malice. This, however, is misleading as the meaning of [[malicia]] in Capoeira is the capacity to understand someone's intentions. In Brazil men who were marginalized from main stream society and possessed street smarts were called malandros.

In the Capoeira, ''malandragem'' is the ability to quickly understand an opponent's aggressive intentions, and during a fight or a game, fool, trick and deceive him.

== Music ==
{{Main|Capoeira music}}

Music is integral to Capoeira. It sets the tempo and style of game that is to be played within the ''roda''. The music is composed of [[Musical instruments|instruments]] and [[song]]. Rhythm, controlled by a ''berimbau'', differ from very slow to very fast, depending on the style of the ''roda''.

=== Instruments ===
[[Image:Capoeira-three-berimbau-one-pandeiro.jpg|thumb|A capoeira bateria showing three [[berimbau]]s and a [[pandeiro]].]]

Capoeira instruments are disposed in a row called [[bateria]]. It is traditionally formed by three [[berimbau]]s, two [[pandeiro]]s, one [[atabaque]], one [[agogô]] and one [[Reco-reco|ganzuá]], but this format may vary depending on the Capoeira group's traditions or the ''roda'' style.

The ''berimbau'' is the leading instrument, determining the tempo and style of the music and game played. Two low pitch ''berimbaus'' (called ''berra-boi'' and ''médio'') form the base and a high pitch ''berimbau'' (called ''viola'') makes variations and improvisations. The other instruments may only follow the ''berimbaus'' or may be free to vary and improvise a little, depending upon the Capoeira group's musical style.

Capoeiristas change their playing style significantly, following the [[capoeira toques|toque]] of the ''berimbau'', which sets the game's speed, style and aggressiveness. So it is truly the music that drives a Capoeira game.

=== Songs ===
Many of the songs are sung in a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] format while others are in the form of a narrative. Capoeiristas sing about a wide variety of subjects. Some songs are about history or stories of famous capoeiristas. Other songs attempt to inspire players to play better. Some songs are about what is going on within the roda. Sometimes the songs are about life or love lost. Others have lighthearted and playful lyrics. 

There are four basic kinds of songs in capoeira, the '''Ladaínha''', '''Chula''', '''Corrido''' and '''Quadra'''. The '''Ladaínha''' is a narrative solo sung only at the beginning of a roda, often by a ''mestre'' (master) or most respected capoeirista present. The solo is followed by a ''louvação'', a call and response pattern that usually thanks God and one's ''mestre'', among other things. Each call is usually repeated word-for-word by the responders. The '''Chula''' is a song where the singer part is much bigger than the chorus response, usually eight singer verses for one chorus response, but the proportion may vary. The '''Corrido''' is a song where the singer part and the chorus response are equal, normally two verses by two responses. Finally, the '''Quadra''' is a song where the same verse is repeated four times, either three singer verses followed by one chorus response, or one verse and one response.

Capoeira songs can talk about virtually anything, being it about a historical fact, a famous ''capoeirista'', trivial life facts, hidden messages for players, anything. Improvisation is very important also, while singing a song the main singer can change the music's lyrics, telling something that's happening in or outside the ''Roda''.

== Styles of Capoeira ==

Determining ''styles'' in capoeira is a very tough task, since there was never a unity in the original capoeira, or a teaching method before the decade of 1920. However, a division between two styles and a sub-style is widely accepted.

=== Capoeira Angola ===

{{Main|Capoeira Angola}}
Capoeira Angola refers to every capoeira that keeps the traditions held before the creation of the Regional style. In simple words, it's the original Capoeira.

Existing in many parts of Brazil since colonial times, most notably in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]], it's impossible to tell where and when Capoeira Angola began taking its present form. The name &quot;Angola&quot; starts as early as the beginning of slavery in Brazil, when Africans, taken to Luanda to be shipped to Brazil, were called &quot;black people from Angola&quot; regardless of their nationality. In some places of Brazil people would call capoeira as ''playing Angola'' and, according to ''Mestre Noronha'', the ''Centro de Capoeira Angola Conceição da Praia'', created in Bahia, already used the name ''capoeira Angola'' illegally in the beginning of the 1920 decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;noronha&quot; /&gt;

The name ''Angola'' was finally immortalized by [[Pastinha|Mestre Pastinha]] at February 23, 1941, when he opened the '''Centro Esportivo de capoeira Angola''' (CECA). ''Pastinha'' was known as a great defender of the traditional Capoeira, much respected by recognized Capoeira masters. Soon many other masters would adopt the name ''Angola''.

''Capoeira Angola'' is the closest style to the way slaves used to fight or play Capoeira. Characterizes by being strategic, with sneaking movements executed standing or near the floor depending on the situation to face, it values the traditions of ''malícia'', ''malandragem'' and unpredictability of the original Capoeira.

Typical music instrument formation in a ''roda'' of ''Capoeira Angola'' is three berimbaus, two pandeiros, an atabaque, an agogô e a ganzuá.

=== Capoeira regional ===
''Regional'' is the more common form of Capoeira, and it is often what Brazilians refer to when they speak of Capoeira.

''Capoeira Regional'' began to take form in the 1920 decade, when [[Mestre Bimba]] met his future student, [[José Cisnando Lima]]. Both believed that Capoeira was losing its martial side and concluded there was a need to restructure it. ''Bimba'' created his ''sequências de ensino'' (teaching combinations) and created the first Capoeira's teaching method. Advised by ''Cisnando'', ''Bimba'' decided to call his style ''Luta Regional Baiana'', as Capoeira was still illegal at that time.

The base of ''Capoeira Regional'' is the original Capoeira without many of the aspects that were useless in a real fight, with less subterfuge and more objectivity. Training was mainly focused on attack and counter-attack, giving high importance to precision and discipline. ''Bimba'' also added a few moves from other martial-arts, notably the ''batuque'', old street fight practiced by his father. Use of jumps or aerial acrobacies was kept to a minimum, since one of its foundations was always keeping at least one hand or foot firmly attached to the ground. ''Mestre Bimba'' often said, &quot;'The floor is a friend to the capoeirista'&quot;.

''Capoeira Regional'' also introducted the first ranking method in Capoeira. ''Regional'' had three levels: ''calouro'' (freshman), ''formado'' (graduated) and ''formado especializado'' (specialist). Ranking was determined by a scarf tied on the capoeirista's waist.

The traditions of ''roda'' and Capoeira game were kept, being used to put into use what was learned during training. Musical instruments disposition, however, was changed, being made by a single berimbau and two pandeiros. 

The ''Luta Regional Baiana'' soon became popular, finally changing Capoeira's bad image. ''Mestre Bimba'' made a lot of presentations of his new style, but the most well known was the one made at 1953 to Brazilian president [[Getúlio Vargas]], where the president would say: &quot;Capoeira is the only truly national sport.&quot;

=== Capoeira Contemporânea ===
''Contemporânea'' is a term for groups that train multiple styles of capoeira simultaneously. Very often students of Capoeira Contemporânea train elements of Regional and Angola as well as newer movements that would not fall under either of those styles. This sub-style is seen by some as the natural evolution of Capoeira, by others as adulteration or even misinterpretation of Capoeira.

Nowadays the label Contemporânea applies to any Capoeira group who don't follow ''Regional'' or ''Angola'' styles, even the ones who mix Capoeira with other martial-arts.

== Ranks ==

Because of its origin, Capoeira never had unity or a general agreement.
Ranking or graduating system follows the same path, as there never existed a ranking system accepted by most of the masters. That means graduation style changes a lot depending of the group's traditions. ''Mestre Bimba'' was the first to establish a graduation system in 1930. He used silk scalfs to separate his students, based on their skill and experience. New students had no graduation.

Nowadays the most common system is using ''cordas'' (strings) tied around the waist (also called ''cordéis'' or ''cordões'') using different colors. Some masters use different systems, or even no system at all.

There are many entities (Leagues, Federations e Confederations) which try to unify the graduation system. The most usual is the system of the ''Confederação Brasileira de Capoeira'' (Brazilian Capoeira Confederation), which adopts strings using the colors of the [[Brazilian flag]].

Even though it's widely used, with many small variations, many big and influential groups still use different systems. Even the ''Confederação Brasileira de Capoeira'' is not widely accepted as the Capoeira's representative.

=== Confederação Brasileira de Capoeira's ranking system ===

Basic adult graduation (since 14 years old)
:: Beginner: no string
:: Baptized: green
:: Graduated: yellow
:: Graduated: blue
:: Intermediate: green and yellow
:: Advanced: green and blue
:: Trainee: yellow and blue

Advanced adult graduation - Teacher of Capoeira
:: Formed: green, yellow and blue
:: Monitor: green and white
:: Teacher: yellow and white
:: Contra-mestre: blue and white
:: Mestre: white

Children's graduation (until 14 years old) - the same as the basic graduation, but adding the grey color. After completing it, if the child is still under 14, he'll earn the green adult graduation.

Initial ''cordas'' can be earned in less than a year. Advanced ''cordas'', notably the ones for ''contra-mestre'' and ''mestre'', take several years and a deep understanding of Capoeira techniques and culture to be earned.

== Related activities ==

Even thought those activities are strongly associated to the Capoeira, they have different meanings and origins.

=== Samba de roda ===
{{Main|Samba}}

Performed by many capoeira groups, [[samba de roda]] is a traditional Afro-Brazilian dance &amp; musical form that has been associated with capoeira for many years. The orchestra is composed by [[pandeiro]] (tambourine), atabaque (drum), berimbau-viola (berimbau with the smallest cabaça and the highest pitch), [[chocalho]] (rattle – a percussion instrument), accompanied by singing and clapping. ''Samba de roda'' is considered one of the primitive forms of modern Samba.

=== Maculelê ===
{{Main|Maculelê (dance)}}
Originally the ''Maculelê'' was an [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] armed fighting style, using two sticks or a machete. Nowadays it's a folkloric dance practiced with heavy afro-Brazilian percussion.

Maculelê's past is even more obscured than Capoeira's, so many people believe it either has native Brazilian's or African's origins.

=== Puxada de rede ===
{{Main|Puxada de rede}}
''Puxada de Rede'' is a Brazilian [[Brazilian mythology|folkloric]] theatrical play, seen in many capoeira performances. It is based on a traditional Brazilian legend involving the loss of a fisherman in a sea-faring accident

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''carbon sink''' is a natural or artificial [[reservoir]] that accumulates and stores some [[carbon]]-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period. The process by which carbon sinks remove carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere is known as [[carbon sequestration]]. Public awareness of the significance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sinks has grown since passage of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which promotes their use as a form of [[carbon offset]].

The main natural sinks are:
* Absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] by the [[ocean]]s via [[solubility pump|physicochemical]] and [[biological pump|biological]] processes
* [[Photosynthesis]] by terrestrial plants

Natural sinks are typically much larger than artificial sinks. The main artificial sinks are:
* [[Landfill]]s
* [[Carbon capture and storage]] proposals

Carbon sources include: 
* Fossil fuels
* Farmland; there are proposals for improvements in farming practices to reverse this.

==Kyoto Protocol==
Because growing vegetation absorbs [[carbon dioxide]], the [[Kyoto Protocol]] allows [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I countries]] with large areas of growing forests to issue [[Removal Units]] to recognise the sequestration of carbon. The additional units make it easier for them to achieve their target emission levels.

Some countries seek to trade emission rights in carbon emission markets, purchasing the unused carbon emission allowances of other countries. If overall limits on greenhouse gas emission are put into place, [[cap and trade]] market mechanisms are purported to find cost-effective ways to reduce emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-RPT-Renewables.pdf | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070604191032/http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-RPT-Renewables.pdf | archivedate=2007-06-04 | title=Electricity, Renewables, and Climate Change: Searching for a Cost-Effective Policy | author=Karen Palmer and Dallas Burtraw | publisher=[[Resources for the Future]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is as yet no [[carbon audit regime]] for all such markets globally, and none is specified in the Kyoto Protocol.  National carbon emissions are self-declared.

In the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], only [[afforestation]] and [[reforestation]] are eligible to produce [[certified emission reduction]]s (CERs) in the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008–2012). Forest conservation activities or activities avoiding [[deforestation]], which would result in emission reduction through the conservation of existing carbon stocks, are not eligible at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Manguiat, M.

Z., Verheyen, R., Mackensen, J. &amp; Scholz, G. |title=Legal aspects in the implementation of CDM forestry projects |journal=IUCN Environmental Policy and Law Papers |id=Number 59 |year=2005 |doi= |url=http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/EPLP-059.pdf |format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, agricultural carbon sequestration is not possible yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosenbaum, K.

==Storage in terrestrial and marine environments==
===Soils===
[[Soils]] represent a short to long-term carbon storage medium, and contain more carbon than all terrestrial vegetation and the atmosphere combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Soil Science |volume=166 |issue=11 |pages=858–71 |last=Swift |first=Roger S. |title=Sequestration of Carbon by soil |month=November |year=2001 |url=http://www.soilsci.com/pt/re/soilsci/abstract.00010694-200111000-00010.htm |doi=10.1097/00010694-200111000-00010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Batjes |first=Niels H. |journal=European Journal of Soil Science |volume=47 |pages=151–63 |title=Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world  |year=1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01386.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant litter]] and other [[biomass]] accumulates as [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] in soils, and is degraded by [[chemical weathering]] and biological [[biodegradation|degradation]].  More recalcitrant [[organic material|organic]] [[Biopolymer|carbon polymers]] such as [[cellulose]], [[hemi-cellulose]], [[lignin]], aliphatic compounds, waxes and [[terpenoids]] are collectively retained as [[humus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klaus Lorenza, Rattan Lala,  Caroline M. Prestonb, Klaas G.J. Nieropc |title=Strengthening the soil organic carbon pool by increasing contributions from recalcitrant aliphatic bio(macro)molecules |journal=Geoderma |volume=142 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–10 |date=15 November 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2007.07.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic matter tends to accumulate in litter and soils of colder regions such as the [[boreal forest]]s of [[North America]] and the [[Taiga]] of [[Russia]]. [[Leaf litter]] and [[humus]] are rapidly oxidized and poorly retained in [[sub-tropical]] and [[tropical]] [[climate]] conditions due to high temperatures and extensive leaching by rainfall. Areas where [[shifting cultivation]] or [[slash and burn]] agriculture are practiced are generally only fertile for 2–3 years before they are abandoned.  These tropical jungles are similar to coral reefs in that they are highly efficient at conserving and circulating necessary nutrients, which explains their lushness in a nutrient desert.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  Much [[soil carbon|organic carbon]] retained in many agricultural areas worldwide has been severely depleted due to intensive [[Farming#Environmental_impact|farming practices]].

[[Grasslands]] contribute to [[soil organic matter]], stored mainly in their extensive fibrous root mats. Due in part to the climactic conditions of these regions (e.g. cooler temperatures and semi-arid to arid conditions), these soils can accumulate significant quantities of organic matter. This can vary based on rainfall, the length of the winter season, and the frequency of naturally occurring lightning-induced [[Wildfire|grass-fires]].  While these fires release carbon dioxide, they improve the quality of the grasslands overall, in turn increasing the amount of carbon retained in the retained humic material.  They also deposit carbon directly to the soil in the form of [[Biochar|char]] that does not significantly degrade back to carbon dioxide.

Forest fires release absorbed carbon back into the atmosphere, as does deforestation due to rapidly increased oxidation of soil organic matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Organic matter in [[peat]] bogs undergoes slow [[anaerobic decomposition]] below the surface.  This process is slow enough that in many cases the bog grows rapidly and [[Carbon fixation|fixes]] more carbon from the atmosphere than is released.  Over time, the peat grows deeper.  Peat bogs inter approximately one-quarter of the carbon stored in land plants and soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last=Chester  |first=Bronwyn |title=The case of the missing sink  |publisher=[[McGill University|McGill]] Reporter  |date=20 April 2000 |url=http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/15/roulet/ |accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under some conditions, forests and peat bogs may become sources of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as when a forest is flooded by the construction of a hydroelectric dam. Unless the forests and peat are harvested before flooding, the rotting vegetation is a source of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[methane]] comparable in magnitude to the amount of carbon released by a fossil-fuel powered plant of equivalent power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 | title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed | publisher=[[New Scientist]] | date=24 February 2005 | accessdate=2008-07-08 | author=Duncan Graham-Rowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regenerative agriculture ===
{{See also|Biosequestration}}

Current agricultural practices lead to carbon loss from soils. It has been suggested that improved farming practices could return the soils to being a carbon sink. Present worldwide practises of overgrazing are substantially reducing many grasslands performance as carbon sinks.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Overgrazing Overgrazing]. Encyclopedia of Earth. Sidney Draggan, topic ed.; Cutler J. Cleveland, ed., National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; The Rodale Institute says that [[Regenerative agriculture]], if practiced on the planet’s 3.5 billion tillable acres, could sequester up to 40% of current CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/files/Rodale_Research_Paper.pdf report] recently released by [http://www.hero-farmers.org/ Rodale Institute] and based on nearly 30 years of research in its side-by-side studies of organic and conventional agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lappé |first=Anna |title=Timothy LaSalle of Rodale on the surprising climate benefits of organic farming |date=9 May 2008 |work=Grist |url=http://www.grist.org/feature/2008/05/09/index.html?source=rss}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that agricultural carbon sequestration has the potential to mitigate global warming. When using biologically based [[regenerative practices]], this dramatic benefit can be accomplished with no decrease in yields or farmer profits. Organically managed soils can convert carbon dioxide from a greenhouse gas into a food-producing asset.

In 2006, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion were estimated at nearly 6.5 billion tons{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}. If a 2,000 (lb/ac)/year sequestration rate was achieved on all {{convert|434000000|acre|km2}} of cropland in the United States, nearly 1.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be sequestered per year, mitigating close to one quarter of the country's total fossil fuel emissions.

===Oceans===
[[Image:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|350px|Air-sea exchange of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
[[Oceans]] are at present CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sinks, and represent the largest active carbon sink on Earth, absorbing more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the air.&lt;ref name=EarthInst&gt;[http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2586 ''Earth Institute News''], Columbia University, Nov. 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On longer timescales they may be both sources and sinks - during [[ice age]]s {{CO2}} levels decrease to ~180 ppmv, and much of this is believed to be stored in the oceans. As ice ages end, {{CO2}} is released from the oceans and {{CO2}} levels during previous interglacials have been around ~280 ppmv. This role as a sink for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is driven by two processes, the [[solubility pump]] and the [[biological pump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |last=Raven |first=J. A. |coauthors=P. G. Falkowski |title=Oceanic sinks for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Plant Cell &amp; Environment |volume=22 |pages=741–55 |year=1999  |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former is primarily a function of differential CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solubility in [[seawater]] and the [[thermohaline circulation]], while the latter is the sum of a series of biological processes that transport carbon (in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry of carbon|inorganic]] forms) from the surface [[photic zone|euphotic zone]] to the ocean's interior.  A small fraction of the organic carbon transported by the biological pump to the [[seabed|seafloor]] is buried in [[anoxic sea water|anoxic]] conditions under sediments and ultimately forms [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]].

At the present time, approximately one third&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Takahashi |first=T. |coauthors=S. C. Sutherland, C. Sweeney, A. Poisson, N. Metzl, B. Tilbrook, N. Bates, R. Wanninkhof, R. A. Feely, C. Sabine, J. Olafsson and Y. C. Nojiri |title=Global sea-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux based on climatological surface ocean ''p''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and seasonal biological and temperature effects |journal=Deep Sea Research II |volume=49 |pages=1601–22 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(02)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[anthropogenic|human generated]] emissions are estimated to be entering the ocean. The solubility pump is the primary mechanism driving this, with the biological pump playing a negligible role. This stems from the limitation of the biological pump by ambient light and nutrients required by the [[phytoplankton]] that ultimately drive it. [[Total inorganic carbon]] is not believed to limit [[primary production]] in the oceans, so its increasing availability in the ocean does not directly affect production (the situation on land is different, since enhanced atmospheric levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; essentially &quot;fertilize&quot; land plant growth).  However, [[ocean acidification]] by invading anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may affect the biological pump by negatively impacting [[calcium carbonate|calcifying]] organisms such as [[coccolithophore]]s, [[foraminiferans]] and [[pteropod]]s. [[Climate change]] may also affect the biological pump in the future by warming and [[stratification (water)|stratifying]] the surface ocean, thus reducing the supply of limiting nutrients to surface waters.

In January 2009, the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] announced a joint study to determine whether the ocean off the [[California]] coast was serving as a carbon source or a carbon sink.  Principal instrumentation for the study will be self-contained CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors placed on [[buoy]]s in the ocean.  They will measure the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the ocean and the atmosphere just above the water surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Battelle announces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Monitor |journal=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] |pages=66 |date=19 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Science Daily reported that the Southern Indian Ocean is becoming less effective at absorbing carbon dioxide due to changes to the regions climate which include higher wind speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CNRS (Délégation Paris Michel-Ange) |title=Ocean Less Effective At Absorbing Carbon Dioxide Emitted By Human Activity |date=2009, February 23 |work=ScienceDaily |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com /releases/2009/02/090216092937.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enhancing natural sequestration==
===Forests===
{{See also|Biosequestration}}
Forests are carbon stores, and they are carbon dioxide sinks when they are increasing in density or area. In [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canada's boreal forests]] as much as 80% of the total carbon is stored in the soils as dead organic matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfs.nrcan.gc.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Does harvesting in Canada's forests contribute to climate change? |date=May 2007 |work=Canadian Forest Service Science-Policy Notes |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/news/473}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 40-year study of African, Asian, and South American [[tropical forest]]s by the University of Leeds, shows tropical forests absorb about 18% of all carbon dioxide added by fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=University of Leeds |title=One-fifth Of Fossil-fuel Emissions Absorbed By Threatened Forests |date=2009, February 19 |work=ScienceDaily |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com /releases/2009/02/090218135031.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical [[reforestation]] can mitigate global warming until all available land has been reforested with mature forests.  However, the global cooling effect of carbon sequestration by forests is partially counterbalanced in that reforestation can decrease the reflection of sunlight ([[albedo]]). Mid-to-high latitude forests have a much lower [[albedo]] during [[snow]] seasons than flat ground, thus contributing to warming.  Modeling that compares the effects of albedo differences between forests and grasslands suggests that expanding the land area of forests in temperate zones offers only a temporary cooling benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6184577.stm | title=Care needed with carbon offsets | author=Jonathan Amos | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=2008-07-08 | date=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2005/NR-05-12-04.html | title=Models show growing more forests in temperate regions could contribute to global warming | date=5 December 2005

In the United States in 2004 (the most recent year for which EPA statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html | title=U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] | accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available), forests sequestered 10.6% (637 teragrams&lt;ref name=epa1&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads06/06LULUCF.pdf | title=Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] | accessdate=2008-07-08|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080523085328/http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads06/06LULUCF.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the carbon dioxide released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas; 5657 teragrams&lt;ref name=epa2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads06/06ES.pdf | title=Executive Summary | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] | accessdate=2008-07-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Urban trees sequestered another 1.5% (88 [[teragram]]s&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;).  To further reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 7%, as stipulated by the [[Kyoto Protocol]], would require the planting of &quot;an area the size of [[Texas]] [8% of the area of Brazil] every 30 years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Schlesinger, dean of the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carbon offset]] programs are planting millions of fast-growing trees per year to reforest tropical lands, for as little as $0.10 per tree; over their typical 40-year lifetime, one million of these trees will fix 0.9 teragrams of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.treesftf.org/about/cooling.htm | title=About Us: Global Cooling Center | publisher=Trees for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, reducing timber harvesting would have very little impact on carbon dioxide emissions because of the combination of harvest and stored carbon in manufactured wood products along with the regrowth of the harvested forests. Additionally, the amount of carbon released from harvesting is small compared to the amount of carbon lost each year to forest fires and other natural disturbances.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfs.nrcan.gc.ca&quot;/&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] concluded that &quot;a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber fibre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter9.pdf | publisher=International Panel on Climate Change | title=Fourth Assessment Report (AR4): Mitigation of Climate Change (Working Group III) | pages=549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable management practices keep forests growing at a higher rate over a potentially longer period of time, thus providing net sequestration benefits in addition to those of unmanaged forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruddell |first=Steven |coauthors=et al. |year=2007 |month=September |title=The Role for Sustainably Managed Forests in Climate Change Mitigation |journal=Journal of Forestry |volume=105 |issue=6|pages=314–319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy of forests varies throughout the world, influenced by tree species, site conditions and natural disturbance patterns.  In some forests carbon may be stored for centuries, while in other forests carbon is released with frequent stand replacing fires. Forests that are harvested prior to stand replacing events allow for the retention  of carbon in manufactured forest products such as lumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= J. Chatellier  |title=The Role of Forest Products in the Global Carbon Cycle: From In-Use to End-of-Life | publisher=Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies | month=January | year=2010 | url=http://gisf.research.yale.edu/forest_carbon_report/Chapter_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only a portion of the carbon removed from logged forests ends up as durable goods and buildings.  The remainder ends up as sawmill by-products such as pulp, paper and pallets, which often end with incineration (resulting in carbon release into the atmosphere) at the end of their lifecycle. For instance, of the 1,692 teragrams of carbon harvested from forests in Oregon and Washington (U.S) from 1900 to 1992, only 23% is in long-term storage in forest products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u51867621j8307m7/ | title=Harmon, Harmon, Ferrell and Brooks.

===Oceans===
{{See also|Iron fertilization|Ocean nourishment}}
One way to increase the carbon sequestration efficiency of the oceans is to add micrometre-sized iron particles in the form of either [[hematite]] (iron oxide) or [[melanterite]] (iron sulfate) to certain regions of the ocean. This has the effect of stimulating growth of [[plankton]].  Iron is an important nutrient for [[phytoplankton]], usually made available via upwelling along the [[continental shelves]], inflows from rivers and streams, as well as deposition of dust suspended in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Natural sources of ocean iron have been declining in recent decades, contributing to an overall decline in ocean productivity (NASA, 2003).  Yet in the presence of iron nutrients plankton populations quickly grow, or 'bloom', expanding the base of [[biomass]] productivity throughout the region and removing significant quantities of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere via [[photosynthesis]].  A test in 2002 in the [[Southern Ocean]] around [[Antarctica]] suggests that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atoms are sunk for each iron atom added to the water.  More recent work in Germany (2005) suggests that any biomass carbon in the oceans, whether exported to depth or recycled in the [[euphotic zone]], represents long-term storage of carbon.  This means that application of iron nutrients in select parts of the oceans, at appropriate scales, could have the combined effect of restoring ocean productivity while at the same time mitigating the effects of human caused emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

Because the effect of periodic small scale phytoplankton blooms on ocean ecosystems is unclear, more studies would be helpful.  Phytoplankton have a complex effect on cloud formation via the release of substances such as [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) that are converted to sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, providing [[cloud condensation nuclei]], or CCN. But the effect of small scale plankton blooms on overall DMS production is unknown.

Other nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates, and silica as well as iron may cause ocean fertilization.  There has been some speculation that using pulses of fertilization (around 20 days in length) may be more effective at getting carbon to ocean floor than sustained fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/carbon_seq/p25.pdf | title=Sequestration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ocean fertilization | author=Michael Markels, Jr and Richard T.

There is some controversy over seeding the oceans with iron however, due to the potential for increased toxic phytoplankton growth (e.g. &quot;[[red tide]]&quot;), declining water quality due to overgrowth, and increasing anoxia in areas harming other sea-life such as zooplankton, fish, coral, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenseaventure.com/Questions_Concerns.html | title=Questions and Concerns | publisher=GreenSea Venture | accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T8F-4DH2JCT-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=12%2F30%2F2004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=013c171e38287b45b13181a8fb73aa03 | title=Effects of selenium, iron and cobalt addition to growth and yessotoxin production of the toxic marine dinoflagellate Protoceratium reticulatum in culture  |doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2004.08.014| journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | author=Simon M.

=== Soils ===
Since the 1850s, a large proportion of the world's grasslands have been tilled and converted to croplands, allowing the rapid oxidation of large quantities of soil organic carbon.  However, in the United States in 2004 (the most recent year for which EPA statistics are available), agricultural soils including pasture land sequestered 0.8% (46 teragrams&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;) as much carbon as was released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (5988 teragrams&lt;ref name=epa2 /&gt;).  The annual amount of this sequestration has been gradually increasing since 1998.&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;

Methods that significantly enhance carbon sequestration in soil include [[no-till farming]], residue mulching, [[cover crop]]ping, and [[crop rotation]], all of which are more widely used in [[organic farming]] than in conventional farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/organic.farm.vs.other.ssl.html | title=Organic farming produces same corn and soybean yields as conventional farms, but consumes less energy and no pesticides, study finds | author=Susan S.

[[Terra preta]], an [[anthropogenic]], high-carbon soil, is also being investigated as a sequestration mechanism.
By [[pyrolysis|pyrolysing]] biomass, about half of its carbon can be reduced to [[charcoal]], which can persist in the soil for centuries, and makes a useful soil amendment, especially in tropical soils (''[[biochar]]'' or ''agrichar'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/biochar/Biochar_home.htm | title=Biochar: the new frontier | author=Johannes Lehmann | accessdate=2008-07-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080618231424/http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/biochar/Biochar_home.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Savanna ===
[[Controlled burn]]s on far north Australian [[savanna]]s can result in an overall carbon sink. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring &quot;strategic fire management across 28,000 km² of Western Arnhem Land&quot;. Deliberately starting controlled burns early in the dry season results in a mosaic of burnt and unburnt country which reduces the area of burning compared with stronger, late dry season fires. In the early dry season there are higher moisture levels, cooler temperatures, and lighter wind than later in the dry season; fires tend to go out overnight. Early controlled burns also results in a smaller proportion of the grass and tree biomass being burnt.&lt;ref name='savanna.ntu.edu.au/arnhem_fire_proj'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://savanna.ntu.edu.au/information/arnhem_fire_project.html |title=West Arnhem Land Fire Abatement Project |accessdate=2008-07-08 |work=Savanna Information |publisher=Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission reductions of 256,000 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been made as of 2007.&lt;ref name='savanna.ntu.edu.au/Eureka_arnhem_fire_proj'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://savanna.ntu.edu.au/news/topical_savannas109.html |title=Eureka Win for West Arnhem Land Fire Project |accessdate=2008-07-08 |work=Savanna Information |publisher=Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial sequestration==

For carbon to be sequestered artificially (i.e. not using the natural processes of the carbon cycle) it must first be captured, ''or'' it must be significantly delayed or prevented from being re-released into the atmosphere (by combustion, decay, etc.) from an existing carbon-rich material, by being incorporated into an enduring usage (such as in construction). Thereafter it can be passively stored ''or'' remain productively utilized over time in a variety of ways.

For example, upon harvesting, wood (as a carbon-rich material) can be immediately burned or otherwise serve as a fuel, returning its carbon to the atmosphere, ''or'' it can be incorporated into construction or a range of other durable products, thus sequestering its carbon over years or even centuries. One ton of dry wood is equivalent to 1.8 tons of carbon dioxide.

Indeed, a very carefully designed and durable, energy-efficient and energy-capturing building has the potential to sequester (in its carbon-rich construction materials), as much as or more carbon than was released by the acquisition and incorporation of all its materials and than will be released by building-function &quot;energy-imports&quot; during the structure's (potentially multi-century) existence.  Such a structure might be termed &quot;carbon neutral&quot; or even &quot;carbon negative&quot;. Building construction and operation (electricity usage, heating, etc.) are estimated to contribute nearly ''half'' of the annual human-caused carbon additions to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=Climate Change, Global Warming, and the Built Environment - Architecture 2030 |url=http://www.architecture2030.org |accessdate=2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural-gas]] purification plants often already have to remove carbon dioxide, either to avoid [[dry ice]] clogging gas tankers or to prevent carbon-dioxide concentrations exceeding the 3% maximum permitted on the natural-gas distribution grid.

Beyond this, one of the most likely early applications of carbon capture is the capture of carbon dioxide from [[flue gas]]es at [[power station]]s (in the case of coal, this is known as &quot;[[clean coal]]&quot;). A typical new 1000 MW [[coal-fired power station]] produces around 6 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Adding carbon capture to existing plants can add significantly to the costs of energy production; scrubbing costs aside, a 1000 MW coal plant will require the storage of about 50 million [[barrel]]s of carbon dioxide a year. However, scrubbing is relatively affordable when added to new plants based on [[coal gasification]] technology, where it is estimated to raise energy costs for households in the United States using only coal-fired electricity sources from 10 cents per kW·h to 12 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Can We Bury Global Warming? | author=Robert H. Socolow | journal=[[Scientific American]] | month=July | year=2005 | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon capture===
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}
Currently, capture of carbon dioxide is performed on a large scale by absorption of carbon dioxide onto various [[Amine gas treating|amine-based solvents]]. Other techniques are currently being investigated, such as [[pressure swing adsorption]], [[temperature swing adsorption]], [[Gas separation|gas separation membranes]], and [[Distillation#Industrial_distillation|cryogenics]]. Recent pilot studies include [[Flue gas|flue capture]] and conversion to [[baking soda]] and use of [[algae]] for conversion to [[Algae#Energy_source|fuel]] or [[Algae#Fertilizer|feed]]&lt;sup&gt;(''reference needed'')&lt;/sup&gt;.

In coal-fired power stations, the main alternatives to retrofitting amine-based absorbers to existing power stations are two new technologies: [[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle|coal gasification combined-cycle]] and [[oxy-fuel combustion]]. Gasification first produces a &quot;[[syngas]]&quot; primarily of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which is burned, with carbon dioxide filtered from the flue gas. Oxy-fuel combustion burns the coal in [[oxygen]] instead of [[Air#Composition|air]], producing only carbon dioxide and [[water vapour]], which are relatively easily separated. Some of the combustion products must be returned to the combustion chamber, either before or after separation, otherwise the temperatures would be too high for the turbine.

Another long-term option is carbon capture directly from the air using [[hydroxides]]. The air would literally be scrubbed of its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content.  This idea offers an alternative to non-[[Fossil fuel|carbon-based fuels]] for the transportation sector.

Examples of carbon sequestration at coal plants include converting carbon from smokestacks into baking soda,&lt;ref&gt;utility company [http://www.luminant.com/ Luminant]'s pilot version at its [http://www.luminant.com/plants/big_brown.aspx Big Brown Steam Electric Station] in [[Fairfield, Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyonic.com/theCompany.php Skyonic] plans to circumvent storage problems of [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|liquid {{CO2}}]] by storing baking soda in mines, landfills, or simply to be sold as industrial or food-grade [[baking soda]].&lt;/ref&gt; and algae-based carbon capture, circumventing storage by converting algae into fuel or feed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenfuelonline.com/index.html GreenFuel Technologies Corp.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceans===
Another proposed form of carbon sequestration in the ocean is direct injection.  In this method, carbon dioxide is pumped directly into the water at depth, and expected to form &quot;lakes&quot; of liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the bottom. Experiments carried out in moderate to deep waters (350–3600 m) indicate that the liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts to form solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[clathrate hydrate]]s, which gradually dissolve in the surrounding waters.

This method, too, has potentially dangerous environmental consequences.  The carbon dioxide does react with the water to form [[carbonic acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; however, most (as much as 99%) remains as dissolved molecular CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The equilibrium would no doubt be quite different under the high pressure conditions in the deep ocean. In addition, if deep-sea bacterial [[methanogens]] that reduce carbon dioxide were to encounter the carbon dioxide sinks, levels of [[methane]] gas may increase, leading to the generation of an even worse greenhouse gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0428/p01s04-wogi.html Potent greenhouse-gas methane has been rising | csmonitor.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The resulting environmental effects on [[benthic]] life forms of the [[bathypelagic]], [[abyssopelagic]] and [[hadopelagic]] zones are unknown. Even though life appears to be rather sparse in the deep ocean basins, energy and chemical effects in these deep basins could have far-reaching implications. Much more work is needed here to define the extent of the potential problems.

Carbon storage in or under oceans may not be compatible with the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2005-07-04a.7044.h | title=Carbon Sequestration | author=Norman Baker and Ben Bradshaw | accessdate=2008-07-08 | date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional method of long-term ocean-based sequestration is to gather [[crop residue]] such as corn stalks or excess hay into large weighted bales of biomass and deposit it in the [[alluvial fan]] areas of the deep [[ocean basin]].  Dropping these residues in alluvial fans would cause the residues to be quickly buried in silt on the sea floor, sequestering the biomass for very long time spans.  Alluvial fans exist in all of the world's oceans and seas where river deltas fall off the edge of the [[continental shelf]] such as the [[Mississippi Delta|Mississippi alluvial fan]] in the [[gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Nile Delta|Nile alluvial fan]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. A downside, however, would be an increase in aerobic bacteria growth due to the introduction of biomass, leading to more competition for oxygen resources in the deep sea, similar to the [[oxygen minimum zone]].

=== Geological sequestration ===
The  method of  ''geo-sequestration'' or ''geological storage'' involves injecting carbon dioxide directly into underground geological formations.  Declining [[oil field]]s, saline [[aquifer]]s, and unminable [[coal seam]]s have been suggested as storage sites.  Caverns and old mines that are commonly used to store natural gas are not considered, because of a lack of storage safety.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been injected into declining oil fields for more than 40 years, to increase oil recovery.  This option is attractive because the storage costs are offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered. Typically, 10-15% additional recovery of the original oil in place is possible. Further benefits are the existing infrastructure and the geophysical and geological information about the oil field that is available from the oil exploration. Another benefit of injecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into Oil fields is that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is soluble in oil.  Dissolving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in oil lowers the viscosity of the oil and reduces its interfacial tension which increases the oils mobility. All oil fields have a geological barrier preventing upward migration of oil. As most oil and gas has been in place for millions to tens of millions of years, depleted oil and gas reservoirs can contain carbon dioxide for millennia. Identified possible problems are the many 'leak' opportunities provided by old oil wells, the need for high injection pressures and acidification which can damage the geological barrier. Other disadvantages of old oil fields are their limited geographic distribution and depths, which require high injection pressures for sequestration.  Below a depth of about 1000 m, carbon dioxide is injected as a supercritical fluid, a material with the density of a liquid, but the viscosity and diffusivity of a gas.
Unminable coal seams can be used to store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbs to the coal surface, ensuring safe long-term storage.  In the process it releases methane that was previously adsorbed to the coal surface and that may be recovered.  Again the sale of the methane can be used to offset the cost of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage. Release or burning of methane would of course at least partially offset the obtained sequestration result – except when the gas is allowed to escape into the atmosphere in significant quantities: methane has a higher [[global warming potential]] than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Saline aquifers contain highly mineralized brines and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans except in a few cases where they have been used for the storage of chemical waste.  Their advantages include a large potential storage volume and relatively common occurrence reducing the distance over which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has to be transported. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them compared to oil fields. Another disadvantage of saline aquifers is that as the salinity of the water increases, less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be dissolved into aqueous solution. To keep the cost of storage acceptable the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the structure of a given aquifer. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost. Leakage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline-aquifer storage.  However, current research shows that several ''trapping mechanisms'' immobilize the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; underground, reducing the risk of leakage [references are missing].

A major research project examining the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide is currently being performed at an oil field at [[Weyburn, Saskatchewan|Weyburn]] in south-eastern [[Saskatchewan]]. In the [[North Sea]], Norway's [[Statoil]] natural-gas platform [[Sleipner]] strips carbon dioxide out of the natural gas with amine solvents and disposes of this carbon dioxide by geological sequestration. Sleipner reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by approximately one million tonnes a year. The cost of geological sequestration is minor relative to the overall running costs. As of April 2005, [[BP]] is considering a trial of large-scale sequestration of carbon dioxide stripped from power plant emissions in the [[Miller oilfield]] as its reserves are depleted.

In October 2007, the [[Bureau of Economic Geology]] at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] received a 10-year, $38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored, long-term project in the United States studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for underground storage.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bureau of Economic Geology Receives $38 Million for First Large-Scale U.S. Test Storing Carbon Dioxide Underground&quot; [http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The project is a research program of the [http://www.sseb.org/currentprograms/cpa_cmi.htm Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SECARB)], funded by the [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] of the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]]. The SECARB partnership will demonstrate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection rate and storage capacity in the [[Tuscaloosa-Woodbine]] geologic system that stretches from Texas to Florida. Beginning in fall 2007, the project will inject CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the rate of one million tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=February 2009}} per year, for up to 1.5 years, into brine up to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} below the land surface near the [[Cranfield oil field]] about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. Experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Mineral sequestration ===
Mineral sequestration aims to trap carbon in the form of solid [[carbonate]] salts. This process occurs slowly in nature and is responsible for the deposition and accumulation of [[limestone]] (calcium carbonate) over geologic time. [[Carbonic acid]] in groundwater slowly reacts with complex [[silicates]] to dissolve [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[alkalis]] and [[silica]] and leave a residue of [[clay minerals]]. The dissolved calcium and magnesium react with [[bicarbonate]] to precipitate calcium and magnesium carbonates, a process that organisms use to make shells. When the organisms die, their shells are deposited as sediment and eventually turn into limestone. Limestones have accumulated over billions of years of geologic time and contain much of Earth's carbon. Ongoing research aims to speed up similar reactions involving alkali carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon-capture Technology To Help UK Tackle Global Warming |date=July 27, 2007 |work=ScienceDaily |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070727091001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed reaction is that of the olivine-rich rock [[dunite]], or its hydrated equivalent [[serpentinite]] with carbon dioxide to form the carbonate mineral [[magnesite]], plus silica and iron oxide ([[magnetite]]).

Serpentinite sequestration is favored because of the non-toxic and stable nature of magnesium carbonate. The ideal reactions involve the magnesium endmember components of the [[olivine]] (reaction 1) or [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] (reaction 2), the latter derived from earlier olivine by hydration and silicification (reaction 3). The presence of [[iron]] in the olivine or serpentine reduces the efficiency of sequestration, since the iron components of these minerals break down to iron oxide and silica (reaction 4).

==== Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks ====
{{Main|Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks}}
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks is a [[metal-organic framework]] carbon dioxide sink which could be used to keep industrial emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] out of the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/02/15/tech-carbon-capture.html CBC News] article ''New materials can selectively capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, scientists say'' published February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends in sink performance==

According to a report in ''Nature'' magazine, (November, 2009) the first year-by-year accounting of this mechanism during the industrial era, and the first time scientists have actually measured it, suggests &quot;the oceans are struggling to keep up with rising emissions—a finding with potentially wide implications for future climate.&quot; With total world emissions from fossil fuels growing rapidly, the proportion of fossil-fuel emissions absorbed by the oceans since 2000 may have declined by as much as 10%, indicating that over time the ocean will become &quot;a less efficient sink of manmade carbon.&quot; Samar Khatiwala, an oceanographer at [[Columbia University]] concludes that the studies suggest &quot;we cannot count on these sinks operating in the future as they have in the past, and keep on subsidizing our ever-growing appetite for [[fossil fuels]].&quot;&lt;ref name=EarthInst/&gt; However, a recent paper by [[Wolfgang Knorr]] indicates that the fraction of {{CO2}} absorbed by carbon sinks has not changed since 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knorr, W. |title=Is the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increasing? |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=36 |issue=21 |pages=L21710 |year=2009 |doi=10.1029/2009GL040613 |laysummary=[http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2009/6649.html Controversial new climate change results] |laydate=9 November 2009 |bibcode=2009GeoRL..3621710K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Charles Tupper, 1st Baronet''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]] (July 2, 1821 – October 30, 1915) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[father of Confederation]]: as the [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] from 1864 to 1867, he led [[Nova Scotia]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. He later went on to serve as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|sixth]] [[Prime Minister of Canada]], sworn in to office on May 1, 1896, seven days after parliament had been dissolved.  He would go on to lose the June 23 election, resigning on July 8, 1896.  His 69-day term as prime minister is currently the shortest in Canadian history.  At age 74, in May 1896, he was also the oldest person to serve as Prime Minister of Canada.

Born in [[Amherst, Nova Scotia]] in 1821, Tupper was trained as a [[physician]] and practiced medicine periodically throughout his political career (and served as the first president of the [[Canadian Medical Association]]). He entered Nova Scotian politics in 1855 as a protege of [[James William Johnston]]. During Johnston's tenure as premier of Nova Scotia in 1857–59 and 1863–64, Tupper served as [[Provincial Secretary|provincial secretary]]. Tupper replaced Johnston as premier in 1864.  As premier, Tupper established [[public education]] in Nova Scotia.  He also worked to expand Nova Scotia's railway network in order to promote industry.  

By 1860, Tupper supported a union of all the colonies of [[British North America]].  Believing that immediate union of all the colonies was impossible, in 1864, he proposed a [[Maritime Union]].  However, representatives of the [[Province of Canada]] asked to be allowed to attend the meeting in [[Charlottetown]] scheduled to discuss Maritime Union in order to present a proposal for a wider union, and the [[Charlottetown Conference]] thus became the first of the three conferences that secured [[Canadian Confederation]].  Tupper also represented Nova Scotia at the other two conferences, the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] (1864) and the [[London Conference of 1866]].  In Nova Scotia, Tupper organized a [[Confederation Party]] to combat the activities of the [[Anti-Confederation Party]] organized by [[Joseph Howe]] and successfully led Nova Scotia into Confederation.  

Following the passage of the [[British North America Act]] in 1867, Tupper resigned as premier of Nova Scotia and began a career in federal politics.  He held multiple [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]] positions under Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]], including [[President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] (1870–72), [[Minister of Inland Revenue (Canada)|Minister of Inland Revenue]] (1872–73), [[Minister of Customs]] (1873–74), [[Minister of Public Works (Canada)|Minister of Public Works]] (1878–79), and [[Minister of Railways and Canals (Canada)|Minister of Railways and Canals]] (1879–84).  Initially groomed as Macdonald's successor, Tupper had a falling out with Macdonald, and by the early 1880s, he asked Macdonald to appoint him as [[Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]].  Tupper took up his post in [[London]] in 1883, and would remain High Commissioner until 1895, although in 1887–88, he served as [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] without relinquishing the High Commissionership.  

In 1895, the government of [[Mackenzie Bowell|Sir Mackenzie Bowell]] floundered over the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]; as a result, several leading members of the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party of Canada]] demanded the return of Tupper to serve as prime minister.  Tupper accepted this invitation and returned to Canada, becoming prime minister in May 1896.  [[Canadian federal election, 1896|An election was called]], just before he was sworn in as prime minister, which his party subsequently lost to [[Wilfrid Laurier]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]. Tupper served as [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] from July 1896 until 1900, at which point he returned to London, where he lived until his death in 1915.

==Early life, 1821–1855==
Tupper was born in [[Amherst, Nova Scotia]] to Charles Tupper, Sr. and Miriam Lowe Lockhart Buckner.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;TUPPER, Sir CHARLES,&quot; in the ''[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]]'', available online at [http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7747 http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7747].&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was the co-[[pastor]] of the local [[Baptist church]]. Beginning in 1837, at age 16, Tupper attended the Horton Academy in [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia]], where he learned [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], and some [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;Phillip Buckner. &quot;TUPPER, Sir CHARLES,&quot; in the ''[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]]'', available online at [http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7747 http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7747].&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1839, he spent some time in [[New Brunswick]] working as a teacher, before moving to [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]] to spend 1839–40 studying [[medicine]] with Dr. Ebenezer Fitch Harding.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; Borrowing money, he then moved to [[Scotland]] to study at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]: he received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1843.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; During his time in [[Edinburgh]], Tupper's commitment to his Baptist faith faltered, and he drank [[Scotch whisky]] for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; 

Returning to Nova Scotia, in 1846, he broke off an engagement that he had contracted with the daughter of a wealthy Halifax merchant when he was 17 years old and instead married [[Frances Tupper|Frances Morse]] (1826–1912), the granddaughter of Col. Joseph Morse, one of the founders of [[Amherst, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The Tuppers had three sons (Orin Stewart, [[Charles Hibbert Tupper|Charles Hibbert]], and [[William Johnston Tupper|William Johnston]]) and three daughters (Emma, Elizabeth Stewart (Lilly), and Sophy Almon).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; The Tupper children were raised in Frances' [[Anglican]] denomination and John and Frances regularly worshipped in an Anglican church, though on the campaign trail, Tupper often found time to visit Baptist meetinghouses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

Tupper set himself up as a physician in Amherst, Nova Scotia and opened a [[Pharmacy|drugstore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Early years in Nova Scotia politics, 1855–1864==
The leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Conservative Party of Nova Scotia]], [[James William Johnston]], a fellow Baptist and family friend of the Tuppers, encouraged Charles Tupper to enter politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As such, in 1855, Tupper ran against the prominent [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Liberal]] politician [[Joseph Howe]] for the [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia|Cumberland County]] seat in the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Joseph Howe would be a frequent political opponent of Tupper  the years to come.

Although Tupper won his seat, the 1855 election was an overall disaster for the Nova Scotia Conservatives, with the Liberals, led by [[William Young (politician)|William Young]], winning a large majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Young consequently became [[Premier of Nova Scotia]].

At a [[caucus]] meeting in January 1856, Tupper recommended a new direction for the Conservative party: they should begin actively courting Nova Scotia's [[Roman Catholic]] minority and should eagerly embrace [[railroad]] construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Having just led his party into a disastrous election campaign, Johnston decided to basically cede control of the party to Tupper, though Johnston remained the party's leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In the course of 1856, Tupper led Conservative attacks on the government, leading to Joseph Howe dubbing Tupper &quot;the wicked wasp of Cumberland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In early 1857, Tupper succeeded in convincing a number of Roman Catholic Liberal members to [[cross the floor]] to join the Conservatives, reducing Young's government to the status of a [[minority government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As a result, Young was forced to resign in February 1857, and the Conservatives formed a government with Johnston as premier.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper became the [[provincial secretary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In Tupper's first speech to the House of Assembly as provincial secretary, he set forth an ambitious plan of railroad construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Thus, Tupper had embarked on the major theme of his political life: that Nova Scotians (and later Canadians) should downplay their ethnic and religious differences, and instead focus on developing the land's [[natural resources]].  He argued that with Nova Scotia's &quot;inexhaustible mines&quot;, it could become &quot;a vast manufacturing mart&quot; for the east coast of North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He quickly persuaded Johnston to end the General Mining Association's monopoly over Nova Scotia minerals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In June 1857, Tupper initiated discussions with [[New Brunswick]] and the [[Province of Canada]] about an intercolonial railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He traveled to [[London]] in 1858 to attempt to secure [[British Empire|imperial]] backing for this project.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  During these discussions, Tupper found that the Canadians were more interested in discussing federal union, while the British (with [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|the earl of Derby]] in his second term as [[prime minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]) were too absorbed in their own immediate interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As such, nothing came of the 1858 discussions for an intercolonial railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

An election was held in May 1859, with sectarian conflict playing a large role, with the Catholics largely supporting the Conservatives and the [[Protestants]] now shifting towards the Liberals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper barely managed to retain his seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The Conservatives were barely re-elected and lost a [[confidence vote]] later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Johnston asked the [[Governor of Nova Scotia]], [[George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby|Lord Mulgrave]], for a [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolution]], but Mulgrave refused and invited William Young to form a government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper was outraged and petitioned the British government, asking them to recall Mulgrave.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

For the next three years, Tupper was ferocious in his denunciations of the Liberal government, first Young, and then Joseph Howe, who took over from Young later in 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This came to a head in 1863 when the Liberals introduced legislation to restrict the Nova Scotia [[Suffrage|franchise]], a move which Johnston and Tupper successfully blocked.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

Tupper continued practicing medicine throughout this period.  He established a successful medical practice in Halifax, rising to become the city medical officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In 1863, he was elected president of the Medical Society of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In the June 1863 election, the Conservatives campaigned on a platform of railroad construction and expanded access to public education.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The Conservatives won a huge majority, with 44 of the House of Assembly's 55 seats.  Johnston resumed his duties as premier and Tupper again became provincial secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As a further sign of the Conservatives' commitment to non-sectarianism, in 1863, after a 20-year hiatus, [[Dalhousie College]] was re-opened as a non-denominational institution of higher learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In May 1864, Johnston retired from politics, accepting an appointment as a [[judge]], and Tupper was chosen as his successor as premier of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Premier of Nova Scotia, 1864–1867==
[[Image:CharlesTupper.jpg|thumb|left|Hon. Charles Tupper.]]

Tupper introduced ambitious education legislation in 1864 creating a system of state-subsidized [[common schools]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The next year, he introduced a bill providing for compulsory local taxation to fund these schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Although these public schools were non-denominational (whch resulted in Protestants sharply criticizing Tupper), they did include a program of Christian education.  However, many Protestants, particularly fellow Baptists, felt that Tupper had sold them out.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In an attempt to regain their trust, he appointed Baptist educator [[Theodore Harding Rand]] as Nova Scotia's first [[superintendent of education]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This in turn aroused concern among Catholics, led by Archbishop [[Thomas-Louis Connolly]], who demanded state-funded [[Catholic schools]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper reached a compromise with Archbishop Connolly whereby Catholic-run schools could receive public funding, so long as they provided their religious instruction after hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Making good on his promise for expanded railroad construction, in 1864, Tupper appointed [[Sandford Fleming]] as the chief engineer of the [[Nova Scotia Railway]] in order to expand the [[Pictou]] line.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He would later (Jan. 1866) award Fleming the contract to complete the line after local contractors proved too slow.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Though this decision was controversial, it did result in the line from [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] to Pictou being successfully completed by May 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  A second line, from [[Annapolis Royal]] to [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]] initially faltered, but was eventually completed by 1869.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

===Tupper's role in securing Canadian Confederation===
In the run-up to the 1859 Nova Scotia election, Tupper had been unwilling to commit to the idea of a union with the other [[British North American]] colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  By 1860, however, he had reconsidered his position.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper outlined his changed position in a lecture delivered at [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] entitled &quot;The Political Condition of British North America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The title of the lecture was an homage to  [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]]'s 1838 ''[[Report on the Affairs of British North America]]'' and served as an assessment of the condition of British North America in the two decades following Lord Durham's famous report.  Although Tupper was interested in the potential economic consequences of a union with the other colonies, the bulk of his lecture addressed the place of British North America within the wider [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Having been convinced by his 1858 trip to London that British politicians were unwilling to pay attention to a small colony like Nova Scotia, Tupper argued that Nova Scotia and the other [[Maritimes|Maritime]] colonies &quot;could never hope to occupy a position of influence or importance except in connection with their larger sister Canada.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As such, Tupper proposed to create a &quot;British America&quot;, which &quot;stretching from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific]], would in a few years exhibit to the world a great and powerful organization, with British Institutions, British sympathies, and British feelings, bound indissolubly to [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the throne of England]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

====Charlottetown Conference, September 1864====
[[Image:CharlottetownConference1864.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tupper and other delegates of the [[Charlottetown Conference]] on the steps of [[Government House (Prince Edward Island)|Government House]], September 1864.]]

With the commencement of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, Tupper worried that a victorious [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] would turn northward and conquer the British North American provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This caused him to redouble his commitment to union, which he now saw as essential to protecting the British colonies against American aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Since he thought that full union among the British North American colonies would be unachievable for many years, on March 28, 1864, Tupper instead proposed a [[Maritime Union]] which would unite the Maritime provinces in advance of a projected future union with the Province of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  A conference to discuss the proposed union of Nova Scotia, [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] was scheduled to be held in [[Charlottetown]] in September 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper was pleasantly surprised when the [[Premier of the Province of Canada]], [[John A. Macdonald]], asked to be allowed to attend the [[Charlottetown Conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The Conference, which was co-chaired by Tupper and [[New Brunswick Premier]] [[Samuel Leonard Tilley]], welcomed the Canadian delegation and asked them to join the conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The conference proved to be a smashing success, and resulted in an agreement-in-principle to form a union of the four colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

====Quebec Conference, October 1864====
The [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] was held on October 10, as a follow-up to the Charlottetown Conference, with [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] only attending to observe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper headed the Nova Scotia delegation to the Quebec Conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He supported a legislative union of the colonies (which would mean that there would be only one legislature for the united colonies).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, the [[French Canadian]] delegates to the conference, notably [[George-Étienne Cartier]] and [[Hector-Louis Langevin]], strongly opposed the idea of a legislative union.  As such, Tupper threw his weight behind Macdonald's proposal for a [[Federalism|federal]] union, which would see each colony retain its own legislature, with a central legislature in charge of common interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper argued in favour of a strong central government as a second best to a pure legislative union.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, Tupper felt that the local legislatures should retain the ability to levy duties on their natural resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Concerned that a united legislature would be dominated by the Province of Canada, Tupper pushed for regional representation in the upper house of the confederated colonies (a goal which would be achieved in the makeup of the [[Senate of Canada]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

On the topic of which level of government would control [[customs]] in the union, Tupper ultimately agreed to accept the formula by which the federal government controlled customs in exchange for an annual subsidy of 80 cents a year for each Nova Scotian.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This deal was ultimately not good for Nova Scotia, which had historically received most of its government revenue from customs, and as a result, Nova Scotia entered Confederation with a [[deficit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:YoungTupper2.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Tupper in 1865.]]

====Aftermath of the Quebec Conference====
Although Tupper had given up much at the Quebec Conference, he thought that he would be able to convince Nova Scotians that the deal he negotiated was in sum good for Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He was therefore surprised when the deal he had negotiated at Quebec was roundly criticized by Nova Scotians: the Opposition Leader [[Adams George Archibald]] was the only member of the Liberal caucus to support Confederation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Former premier Joseph Howe now organized an [[Anti-Confederation Party]] and anti-Confederation sentiments were so strong that Tupper decided to postpone a vote of the legislature on the question of Confederation for a full year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper now organized supporters of Confederation into a [[Confederation Party]] to push for the union.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Finally, in April 1866, Tupper secured a motion of the Nova Scotia legislature in favour of union by promising that he would renegotiate the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] at the upcoming conference in London Conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

====London Conference, 1866====
Joseph Howe had begun a pamphlet campaign in the UK to attempt to turn British public opinion against the proposed union.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As such, when Tupper arrived in the UK, he immediately initiated a campaign of pamphlets and letters to the editor designed to refute Howe's assertions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Although Tupper did attempt to renegotiate the 72 Resolutions as he had promised, he was ineffective in securing any major changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The only major change agreed to at the London Conference was one that arguably did not benefit Nova Scotia - responsibility for the [[fisheries]], which was going to be a joint federal-provincial responsibility under the Quebec agreement, became solely a federal concern.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

====The final push for Confederation====
Following the passage of the [[British North America Act]] in the wake of the London Conference, Tupper returned to Nova Scotia to undertake preparations for the union.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The union came into effect on July 1, 1867, and on July 4, Tupper turned over responsibility for the government of Nova Scotia to [[Hiram Blanchard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In honour of the role he played in securing Confederation, Tupper was made a [[Companion in The Most Honourable Order of the Bath]] in 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As such, he was now entitled to use the postnomial letters &quot;CB&quot;.

==Career in the Parliament of Canada, 1867–1884==
===Fighting the Anti-Confederates, 1867–1869===
The [[Canadian federal election, 1867|first elections]] for the new [[Canadian House of Commons]] were held in August–September 1867.  Tupper ran as a member for the new federal riding of [[Cumberland (electoral district)|Cumberland]] and won his seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, Tupper was the only pro-Confederation candidate to win a seat from Nova Scotia in the [[1st Canadian Parliament]], with Joseph Howe and the Anti-Confederates winning every other seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

[[Image:CharlesTupper1870.jpg|thumb|right|Tupper in April 1870.]]
As an ally of Sir John A. Macdonald and the [[Liberal-Conservative Party]], it was widely believed that Tupper would have a place in the first [[Cabinet of Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, when Macdonald ran into difficulties in organizing this cabinet, Tupper stepped aside in favour of [[Edward Kenny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Instead, Tupper set up a medical practice in [[Ottawa]] and was elected as the first president of the new [[Canadian Medical Association]], a position he held until 1870.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In November 1867, in provincial elections in Nova Scotia, the pro-Confederation Hiram Blanchard was defeated by the leader of the Anti-Confederation Party, [[William Annand]].  Given the unpopularity of Confederation within Nova Scotia, Joseph Howe traveled to London in 1868 to attempt to persuade the British government (headed by the earl of Derby, and then after February 1868 by [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) to allow Nova Scotia to secede from Confederation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper followed Howe to London where he successfully lobbied British politicians against allowing Nova Scotia to secede.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Following his victory in London, Tupper proposed a reconciliation with Howe: in exchange for Howe's agreeing to stop fighting against the union, Tupper and Howe would be allies in the fight to protect Nova Scotia's interests within Confederation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Howe agreed to Tupper's proposal and in January 1869 entered the Canadian cabinet as [[President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Red River Rebellion]] in 1869, Tupper was distressed to find that his daughter Emma's husband was being held hostage by [[Louis Riel]] and the rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; He rushed to the northwest to rescue his son-in-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:TupperWorking1871.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Tupper in November 1871.]]

===President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, 1870–1872===
When Howe's health declined the next year, Tupper finally entered the [[1st Canadian Ministry]] by becoming Privy Council president in June 1870.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

The next year was dominated by a dispute with the [[U.S.]] regarding American access to the Atlantic [[fisheries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper thought that the British should restrict American access to these fisheries so that they could negotiate from a position of strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  When Prime Minister Macdonald traveled to represent Canada's interests at the negotiations leading up to the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)]], Tupper served as Macdonald's liaison with the federal cabinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

===Minister of Inland Revenue, 1872–1873===
On July 2, 1872, Tupper's service as Privy Council president ended and he became [[Minister of Inland Revenue (Canada)|Minister of Inland Revenue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper led the Nova Scotia campaign for the Liberal-Conservative party during the [[Canadian federal election, 1872|Canadian federal election of 1872]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  His efforts paid off when Nova Scotia returned not a single Anti-Confederate [[Member of Parliament]] to the [[2nd Canadian Parliament]], and 20 of Nova Scotia's 21 MPs were Liberal-Conservatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  (The Liberal-Conservative Party changed its name to the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] in 1873.)

===Minister of Customs, 1873–1874===
[[Image:CharlesTupper1873.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Tupper in August 1873.]]

In February 1873, Tupper was shifted from Inland Revenue to become [[Minister of Customs]], and in this position he was successful in having [[Imperial unit|British weights and measures]] adopted as the uniform standard for the united colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

He would not hold this post for long, however, as Macdonald's government was rocked by the [[Pacific Scandal]] throughout 1873.  In November 1873, the 1st Canadian Ministry was forced to resign and was replaced by the [[2nd Canadian Ministry]] headed by [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Alexander Mackenzie]].

===Years in Opposition, 1874–1878===
Tupper had not been involved in the Pacific Scandal, but he nevertheless continued to support Macdonald and his Conservative colleagues both before and after the [[Canadian federal election, 1874|1874 election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The 1874 election was disastrous for the Conservatives, and in Nova Scotia, Tupper was one of only two Conservative MPs returned to the [[3rd Canadian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

Though Macdonald stayed on as Conservative leader, Tupper now assumed a more prominent role in the Conservative Party and was widely seen as Macdonald's heir apparent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He led Conservative attacks on the Mackenzie government throughout the 3rd Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The Mackenzie government attempted to negotiate a new [[free trade agreement]] with the United States to replace the [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty]] which the U.S. had abrogated in 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  When Mackenzie proved unable to achieve reciprocity, Tupper began shifting towards [[protectionism]] and became a proponent of the [[National Policy]] which became a part of the Conservative [[Party platform|platform]] in 1876.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The sincerity of Tupper's conversion to the protectionist cause was doubted at the time, however: according to one apocryphal story, when Tupper came to the 1876 debate on [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Finance Minister]] [[Richard John Cartwright]]'s budget, he was prepared to advocate [[free trade]] if Cartwright had announced that the Liberals had shifted their position and were now supporting protectionism.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper was also deeply critical of Mackenzie's approach to railways, arguing that the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], which would link [[British Columbia]] (which entered Confederation in 1871) with the rest of Canada, should be a stronger government priority than it was for Mackenzie.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This position also became an integral part of the Conservative platform.

As on previous occasions when he was not in cabinet, Tupper was active in practicing medicine during the 1874–78 stint in Opposition, though he was dedicating less and less of his time to medicine during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper was a councillor of the [[Oxford Military College]] in [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]] and [[Oxford]] [[Oxfordshire]] from 1876–1896.

===Minister of Public Works, 1878–1879===
During the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 election]] Tupper again led the Conservative campaign in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The Conservatives under Macdonald won a resounding majority in the election, in the process capturing 16 of Nova Scotia's 21 seats in the [[4th Canadian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

With the formation of the [[3rd Canadian Ministry]] in October 1878, Tupper became [[Minister of Public Works (Canada)|Minister of Public Works]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  His top priority was completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which he saw as &quot;an Imperial Highway across the Continent of America entirely on British soil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This marked a shift in Tupper's position: although he had long argued that completion of the railway should be a major government priority, while Tupper was in Opposition, he argued that the railway should be privately constructed; he now argued that the railway ought to be completed as a [[public work]], partly because he believed that the private sector could not complete the railroad given the [[recession]] which gripped the country throughout the 1870s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

===Minister of Railways and Canals, 1879–1884===
In May 1879, Macdonald decided that completion of the railway was such a priority that he created a new ministry to focus just on railways and canals, and Tupper became Canada's first [[Minister of Railways and Canals (Canada)|Minister of Railways and Canals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

Tupper's motto as Minister of Railways and Canals was &quot;Develop our resources.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He stated &quot;I have always supposed that the great object, in every country, and especially in a new country, was to draw as [many] [[capitalists]] into it as possible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper traveled to London in summer 1879 to attempt to persuade the British government (then headed by [[Benjamin Disraeli|the earl of Beaconsfield]] in his second term as prime minister) to [[guarantee]] a [[Government bond|bond]] sale to be used to construct the railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He was not successful, though he did manage to purchase 50,000 tons of steel rails at a bargain price.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper's old friend Sandford Fleming oversaw the railway construction, but his inability to keep costs down led to political controversy, and Tupper was forced to remove Fleming as Chief Engineer in May 1880.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

1879 also saw Tupper made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]], and thus entitled to use the postnominal letters &quot;KCMG&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Tupper1881.jpg|thumb|left|Tupper in September 1881.]]
In 1880, [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]] approached Tupper on behalf of a [[syndicate]] and asked to be allowed to take over construction of the railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Convinced that Stephen's syndicate was up to the task, Tupper convinced the cabinet to back the plan at a meeting in June 1880 and, together with Macdonald, negotiated a contract with the syndicate in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The syndicate successfully created the [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific Railway Company]] in February 1881 and assumed construction of the railway shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In the next years, Tupper would be a vocal supporter of the CPR during its competition with the [[Grand Trunk Railway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In December 1883, he worked out a rescue plan for the CPR after it faced financial difficulties and persuaded his party and Parliament to accept the plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In addition to his support for completion of the CPR, Tupper also actively managed the existing railways in the colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Shortly after becoming minister in 1879, he forced the [[Intercolonial Railway]] to lower its freight rates, which had been a major grievance of Maritime business interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He then forced the Grand Trunk Railway to sell its [[Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec|Rivière-du-Loup]] line to the Intercolonial Railway to complete a link between Halifax and the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Furthermore, he refused to give the CPR [[running rights]] over the Intercolonial Railway, though he did convince the CPR to build the Short Line from Halifax to Saint John.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In terms of canals, Tupper's time as Minister of Railways and Canals is notable for large expenditures on widening the [[Welland Canal]] and deepening the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

====Deterioration of relationship with Macdonald and appointment as High Commissioner====
A rift developed between Tupper and Macdonald in 1879 over Sandford Fleming, whom Tupper supported but whom Macdonald wanted removed as Chief Engineer of the CPR.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This rift was partially healed and Tupper and Macdonald managed to work together during the negotiations with George Stephen's syndicate in 1880, but the men were no longer close, and Tupper no longer seemed to be Macdonald's heir apparent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  By early 1881, Tupper had determined that he should leave the cabinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In March 1881, he asked Macdonald to appoint him as Canada's [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] in London.  Macdonald initially refused, and [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]] retained the High Commissioner's post.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

During the [[Canadian federal election, 1882|1882 election]], Tupper campaigned only in Nova Scotia (he normally campaigned throughout the country): he was again successful, with the Conservatives winning 14 of Nova Scotia's 21 seats in the [[5th Canadian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The 1882 election was personally significant for Tupper because it saw his son, [[Charles Hibbert Tupper]], elected as MP for [[Pictou (electoral district)|Pictou]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, 1883–1895==
===Early years as High Commissioner, 1883–1887===
[[Image:TupperUniform.jpg|thumb|Sir Charles Tupper in [[court dress]], ca 1883.]]

Tupper remained committed to leaving Ottawa, however, and in May 1883, he moved to London to become unpaid High Commissioner, though he did not surrender his ministerial position at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Soon, however, he was facing criticism that the two posts were incompatible, and in May 1884, he resigned from cabinet and the House of Commons and became full-time paid High Commissioner.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

During his time as High Commissioner, Tupper sought to vigorously defend Canada's rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Thus, although he was not a full [[plenipotentiary]], he represented Canada at a [[Paris]] conference in 1883, where he openly disagreed with the British delegation; and in 1884 was allowed to conduct negotiations for a Canadian commercial treaty with [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper was concerned with promoting [[immigration to Canada]] and made several tours of various countries in [[Europe]] to encourage immigrants to move to Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; A report in 1883  acknowledges the work of Sir Charles Tupper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As directing emigration from the United Kingdom and also the Continent, his work has been greatly valuable; and especially in reference to the arrangements made by him on the Continent and in Ireland.  The High Commissioner for Canada, Sir Charles Tupper, has been aided during the past year by the same Emigration Agents of the Department in the United Kingdom as in 1882, namely, Mr. John Dyke, Liverpool; Mr. Thomas Grahame, Glasgow; Mr. Charles Foy, Belfast; Mr. Thomas Connolly, Dublin, and Mr. J.W. Down, Bristol. On the [[European Continent]], Dr. Otto Hahn, of Reutlingen, has continued to act as Agent in Germany.
&lt;ref&gt;http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~marj/genealogy/reports/report1883.html Immigrants to Canada 1883&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1883, Tupper convinced [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s government to exempt Canadian [[cattle]] from the general British ban on importing American cattle by demonstrating that Canadian cattle was free of disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

His other duties as High Commissioner included: putting Canadian exporters in contact with British importers; negotiating loans for the Canadian government and the CPR; helping to organize the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] of 1886; arranging for a subsidy for the mail ship from [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] to the [[Orient]]; and lobbying on behalf of a British-Pacific cable along the lines of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] and for a faster transatlantic [[steam ship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper was also present at the founding meeting of the [[Imperial Federation League]] in July 1884, where he argued against a resolution which said that the only options open to the British Empire were [[Imperial Federation]] or disintegration.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper believed that a form of limited federation was possible and desirable.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

===Interlude as Minister of Finance, 1887–1888===
1884 saw the election of Liberal [[William Stevens Fielding]] as Premier of Nova Scotia after Fielding campaigned on a platform of leading Nova Scotia out of Confederation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As such, throughout 1886, Macdonald begged Tupper to return to Canada to fight the Anti-Confederates.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In January 1887, Tupper returned to Canada to rejoin the 3rd Canadian Ministry as [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance of Canada]], all the while retaining his post as High Commissioner.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

During the [[Canadian federal election, 1887|1887 federal election]], Tupper again presented the pro-Confederation argument to the people of Nova Scotia, and again the Conservatives won 14 of Nova Scotia's 21 seats in the [[6th Canadian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

During his year as finance minister, Tupper retained the government's commitment to protectionism, even extending it to the [[iron and steel industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  By this point, Tupper was convinced that Canada was ready to move on to its second stage of [[Industrialisation|industrial development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In part, he held out the prospect of the development of a great iron industry as an inducement to keep Nova Scotia from seceding.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper's unique position of being both Minister of Finance and High Commissioner to London served him well in an emerging crisis in [[American-Canadian relations]]: in 1885, the U.S. abrogated the fisheries clause of the Treaty of Washington (1871), and the Canadian government retaliated against American fishermen with a narrow reading of the [[Treaty of 1818]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Acting as High Commissioner, Tupper pressured the British government (then led by [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]) to stand firm in defending Canada's rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The result was the appointment of a Joint Commission in 1887, with Tupper serving as one of the three British commissioners to negotiate with the Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Salisbury selected [[Joseph Chamberlain]] as one of the British commissioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  [[John Sparrow David Thompson|John Thompson]] served as the British delegation's legal counsel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  During the negotiations, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thomas F. Bayard]] complained that &quot;Mr. Chamberlain has yielded the control of the negotiations over to Sir Charles Tupper, who subjects the questions to the demands of Canadian politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The result of the negotiations was a treaty (the Treaty of Washington of 1888) that made such concessions to Canada that it was ultimately rejected by the [[American Senate]] in February 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, although the treaty was rejected, the Commission had managed to temporarily resolve the dispute.

Following the conclusion of these negotiations, Tupper decided to return to London to become High-Commissioner full-time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Macdonald attempted to persuade Tupper to stay in Ottawa: during the political crisis surrounding the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion]], Macdonald had pledged to nominate Sir Hector-Louis Langevin as his successor; Macdonald now told Tupper that he would break this promise and nominate Tupper as his successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper was not convinced, however, and resigned as Minister of Finance on May 23, 1888, and moved back to London.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

===Later years as High Commissioner, 1888–1895===
[[Image:TupperStatutte.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Statuette of Tupper by W.C. Archibald, 1889.]]
For Tupper's work on the Joint Commission, Joseph Chamberlain arranged for Tupper to become a [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom|baronet of the United Kingdom]], and the [[Tupper Baronetcy]] was created on September 13, 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In 1889, tensions were high between the U.S. and Canada when the U.S. banned Canadians from engaging in the [[seal hunt]] in the [[Bering Sea]] as part of the ongoing [[Bering Sea Dispute]] between the U.S. and Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to represent Canadian interests during the negotiations and was something of an embarrassment to the British diplomats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

When, in 1890, the provincial secretary of Newfoundland, [[Robert Bond]], negotiated a fisheries treaty with the U.S. that Tupper felt was not in Canada's interest, Tupper successfully persuaded the British government (then under Lord Salisbury's second term) to reject the treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

As noted above, Tupper remained an active politician during his time as High Commissioner, which was controversial because diplomats are traditionally expected to be nonpartisan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  (Tupper's successor as High Commissioner, [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] would succeed in turning the High Commissioner's office into a nonpartisan office.)  As such, Tupper returned to Canada to campaign on behalf of the Conservatives' National Policy during the [[Canadian federal election, 1891|1891 election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

[[Image:Tupperfamily.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Sir Charles Tupper with his son [[Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper]] and his grandson, March 1891.]]
Tupper continued to be active in the Imperial Federation League, though after 1887, the League was split over the issue of regular colonial contribution to imperial defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As a result, the League was ultimately dissolved in 1893, for which some people blamed Tupper.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

With respect to the British Empire, Tupper advocated a system of mutual preferential trading.  In a series of articles in ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|Nineteenth Century]]'' in 1891 and 1892, Tupper denounced the position that Canada should unilaterally reduce its tariff on British goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Rather, he argued that any such tariff reduction should only come as part of a wider trade agreement in which tariffs on Canadian goods would also be reduced at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Sir John A. Macdonald's death in 1891 opened the possibility of Tupper replacing him as [[prime minister of Canada]], but Tupper enjoyed life in London and decided against returning to Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He recommended that his son support [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Thompson]]'s prime ministerial bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Tupper becomes prime minister, 1895–1896==
Sir John Thompson died suddenly in office in December 1894.  Many observers expected the [[Governor General of Canada]], [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]], to invite Tupper to return to Canada to become prime minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, Lord Aberdeen disliked Tupper and instead invited [[Sir Mackenzie Bowell]] to replace Thompson as prime minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  
[[Image:TupperCartoon.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Sir Charles Tupper et le parlement&quot;: [[political cartoon]] from February 1896.]]

The greatest challenge facing Bowell as prime minister was the [[Manitoba Schools Question]].  The Conservative Party was bitterly divided as to how to handle the Manitoba Schools Question, and as a result, on January 4, 1896, seven cabinet ministers resigned, demanding the return of Tupper.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  As a result, Bowell and Aberdeen were forced to invite Tupper to join the [[6th Canadian Ministry]] and on January 15 Tupper became [[Secretary of State for Canada]], with the understanding that he would become prime minister following the dissolution of the [[7th Canadian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

Returning to Canada, Tupper was elected to the 7th Canadian Parliament as member for [[Cape Breton (electoral district)|Cape Breton]] during a [[by-election]] held on February 4, 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  At this point,  Tupper was the ''de facto'' prime minister, though legally Bowell was still prime minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper's position on the Manitoba Schools Act was that French Catholics in Manitoba had been promised the right to separate state-funded French-language Catholic schools in the [[Manitoba Act]] of 1870.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Thus, even though he personally opposed French-language Catholic schools in Manitoba, he believed that the government should stand by its promise and therefore oppose [[Dalton McCarthy]]'s [[Manitoba Schools Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He maintained this position even after the Manitoba Schools Act was upheld by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

In 1895, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had also ruled that the Canadian federal government could pass remedial legislation to overrule the Manitoba Schools Act (''see'' [[Disallowance and reservation]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Thus, in February 1896, Tupper introduced this remedial legislation in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  The bill was [[filibustered]] by a combination of extreme Protestants led by McCarthy and Liberals led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This filibuster resulted in Tupper abandoning the bill and asking for a dissolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Prime Minister of Canada, May–July 1896==
[[Image:Sir charles tupper.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Tupper, January 1896.]]

Parliament was dissolved on April 24, 1896, and the [[7th Canadian Ministry]] with Tupper as prime minister was sworn in on May 1&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; making him, with [[John Turner]] and [[Kim Campbell]], the only Prime Ministers to never sit in Parliament as Prime Minister. Tupper remains the oldest person ever to become Canadian prime minister, at 74.

Throughout the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|1896 election]] campaign, Tupper argued that the real issue of the election was the future of Canadian industry, and insisted that Conservatives needed to unite to defeat the [[Patrons of Industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, the Conservatives were so bitterly divided over the Manitoba Schools Question that wherever he spoke, he was faced with a barrage of criticism, most notably at a two-hour address he gave at [[Massey Hall]] in [[Toronto]], which was constantly interrupted by the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Wilfrid Laurier, on the other hand, modified the traditional Liberal stance on free trade and embraced aspects of the National Policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  

In the end, the Conservatives won the most votes in the 1896 election (48.2% of the votes, in comparison to 41.4% for the Liberals).  However, they captured only about half of the seats in [[English Canada]], while Laurier's Liberals won a landslide victory in [[Quebec]], where Tupper's reputation as an ardent [[imperialist]] was a major handicap.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper's inability to persuade [[Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau]] to return to active politics as his [[Quebec lieutenant]] was the nail in the coffin for the Conservatives' campaign in Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Although Laurier had clearly won the election on June 24, Tupper initially refused to cede power, insisting that Laurier would be unable to form a government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  However, when Tupper attempted to make appointments as prime minister, Lord Aberdeen stepped in, dismissing Tupper and inviting Laurier to form a government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper maintained that Lord Aberdeen's actions were [[unconstitutional]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper's 68 days is the shortest term of all prime ministers.  His administration never faced a Parliament.

==Leader of the Opposition, 1896–1900==
[[Image:CharlesandLadyTupper.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Charles and [[Frances Tupper|Lady Tupper]], October 1896.]]

As Leader of the Opposition during the [[8th Canadian Parliament]], Tupper attempted to regain the loyalty of those Conservatives who had deserted the party over the [[Manitoba Schools Question]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He played up loyalty to the British Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  Tupper strongly supported Canadian participation in the [[Second Boer War]], which broke out in 1899, and criticized Laurier for not doing enough to support Britain in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

The [[Canadian federal election, 1900|1900 election]] saw the Conservatives pick up 17 Ontario seats in the [[9th Canadian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  This was a small consolation, however, as Laurier and the Liberals won a definitive majority and had a clear mandate for a second term.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  What was worse for Tupper, for the first time ever, was the fact he had failed to carry his own seat, losing the Cape Breton seat to Liberal [[Alexander Johnston (Canadian politician)|Alexander Johnston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  In November 1900, two weeks after the election, Tupper stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Opposition - the caucus chose as his successor fellow Nova Scotian [[Robert Laird Borden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Later years, 1901–1915==
Following his defeat in the 1900 election, Tupper and his wife settled with their daughter Emma in [[Bexleyheath]] in southeast London.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He continued to make frequent trips to Canada to visit his sons [[Charles Hibbert Tupper]] and [[William Johnston Tupper]], both of whom were Canadian politicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:TupperCrownLife.jpg|thumb|right|Tupper at a meeting of the directors of the [[Crown Life Insurance Company]] in Toronto, ca 1900.]]
On November 9, 1907, Tupper became a member of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|British Privy Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He was also promoted to the rank of [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]], which made him entitled to use the postnominal letters &quot;GCMG&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper remained interested in imperial politics, and particularly with promoting Canada's place within the British Empire.  He sat on the executive committee of the [[British Empire League]] and advocated closer economic ties between Canada and Britain, while continuing to oppose Imperial Federation and requests for Canada to make a direct contribution to imperial defense costs (though he supported Borden's decision to voluntarily make an emergency contribution of [[dreadnoughts]] to the [[Royal Navy]] in 1912).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

In his retirement, Tupper wrote his [[memoirs]], entitled ''Recollections of Sixty Years in Canada'', which were published in 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;  He also gave a series of interviews to journalist W. A. Harkin which formed the basis of a second book published in 1914, entitled ''Political Reminiscences of the Right Honourable Sir Charles Tupper''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

Tupper's wife, [[Frances Tupper|Lady Tupper]] died in May 1912.  His eldest son Orin died in April 1915 .
On October 30, 1915, in Bexleyheath, Tupper died of heart failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; He was the last of the original [[Fathers of Confederation]] to die, and had lived the longest life of any Canadian prime minister, at 94 years, four months. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; His body was returned to Canada on board the [[HMS Blenheim (1890)|HMS ''Blenheim'']] (the same vessel that had carried the body of Tupper's colleague, [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Thompson]] to Halifax when Thompson died in England in 1894) and he was buried in [[St. John's Cemetery, Halifax]] in Halifax following a [[state funeral]] with a mile-long procession.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;

==Legacy==
Tupper will be most remembered as a [[Father of Confederation]], and his long career as a federal cabinet minister, rather than his brief time as Prime Minister. As the [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] from 1864 to 1867, he led [[Nova Scotia]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] and persuaded [[Joseph Howe]] to join the new federal government, bringing an end to the anti-Confederation movement in Nova Scotia.

In their 1999 study of the Canadian Prime Ministers through [[Jean Chrétien]], [[J.L. Granatstein]] and [[Norman Hillmer]] included the results of a survey of Canadian historians ranking the Prime Ministers.  Tupper ranked #16 out of the 20 up to that time, due to his extremely short tenure in which he was unable to accomplish anything of significance. Historians noted that despite Tupper's elderly age, he showed a determination and spirit during his brief time as Prime Minister that almost beat Laurier in the 1896 election&lt;ref&gt;Granatstein and Hillman, Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Terrasses de la Chaudiere.JPG|thumb|[[Les Terrasses de la Chaudière]] houses the headquarters of the agency]]
The '''Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission''' ('''CRTC''', in [[French language|French]] ''Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des télécommunications canadiennes'') is a public organisation with mandate as a regulatory agency for broadcasting and telecommunications. It was created in 1976 when it took over responsibility for regulating telecommunication carriers. Prior to 1976, it was known as the Canadian Radio and Television Commission, which was established in 1968 by the [[Parliament of Canada]] to replace the [[Board of Broadcast Governors]]. Its headquarters is located in the Central Building (Édifice central) of [[Les Terrasses de la Chaudière]] in [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/contact.htm Contact Us].&quot; Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Retrieved on February 4, 2011. &quot;At the Central Office Les Terrasses de la Chaudière Central Building 1 Promenade du Portage Gatineau, Quebec J8X 4B1.&quot; [http://www.crtc.gc.ca/fra/contact.htm Address in French]: &quot;À l'administration centrale Les Terrasses de la Chaudière Édifice central 1, promenade du Portage Gatineau (Québec) J8X 4B1.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CRTC was originally known as the Canadian Radio-Television Commission. In 1976, jurisdiction over telecommunications services, most of which were then delivered by monopoly common carriers (for example,, telephone companies), was transferred to it from the [[Canadian Transport Commission]] although the abbreviation CRTC remained the same. On the telecom side, the CRTC originally regulated only privately held common carriers, such as B.C. Tel (now part of Telus), in which a U.S. company (GTE) had a substantial stake; Bell Canada, which served [[Ontario]], most of [[Quebec]], and part of the [[Northwest Territories]]; and operations in Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories, Yukon and northern B.C. Other telephone companies, many of which were publicly owned, were regulated by provincial authorities until court rulings during the 1990s affirmed federal jurisdiction over the sector, which also included some fifty small independent incumbents, most of them in Ontario and Quebec.

==Jurisdiction==
The CRTC regulates all [[Canada|Canadian]] broadcasting and telecommunications activities and enforces rules it creates to carry out the policies assigned to it; the best-known of these is probably the [[Canadian content]] rules. The CRTC reports to the [[Parliament of Canada]] through the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage]], which is responsible for the Broadcasting Act, and has an informal relationship with [[Industry Canada]], which is responsible for the Telecommunications Act. Provisions in these two acts, along with less-formal instructions issued by the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] known as [[Order-in-Council|orders-in-council]], represent the bulk of the CRTC's jurisdiction.

In many cases, such as the cabinet-directed prohibition on foreign ownership for broadcasters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/LEGAL/NONCANAD.HTM Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians)]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the legislated principle of the predominance of Canadian content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/B-9.01/bo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3//en#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3 |title=Broadcasting Act at 3.(1)(f) |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; these acts and orders often leave the CRTC less room to change policy than critics sometimes suggest, and the result is that the commission is often the lightning rod for policy criticism that could arguably be better directed at the government itself.

Complaints against broadcasters, such as concerns around offensive programming, are dealt with by the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]], an independent broadcast industry association, rather than by the CRTC, although CBSC decisions can be appealed to the CRTC if necessary. However, the CRTC is also sometimes erroneously criticized for CBSC decisions — for example, the CRTC was erroneously criticized for the CBSC's decisions pertaining to the airing of [[Howard Stern]]'s terrestrial radio show in Canada in the late 1990s, as well as the CBSC's controversial ruling on the [[Dire Straits]] song &quot;[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/crtc-asks-for-review-of-controversial-money-for-nothing-decision/article1878524/ &quot;CRTC asks for review of controversial ‘Money for Nothing’ decision&quot;]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission is not fully equivalent to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]], which has additional powers over technical matters, in broadcasting and other aspects of communications, in that country. In Canada, the [[Industry Canada|Department of Industry]] is responsible for allocating frequencies and call signs, managing the broadcast spectrum, and regulating other technical issues such as interference with electronics equipment.

===Regulation of broadcast distributors===
The CRTC has in the past regulated the prices [[cable television]] broadcast distributors are allowed to charge. In most major markets, however, prices are no longer regulated due to increased competition for broadcast distribution from [[satellite television]].

The CRTC also regulates which channels broadcast distributors must or may offer. Per the Broadcasting Act&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/8815.html Department of Justice, Laws of Canada] (at §3.(1)(t)(i))&lt;/ref&gt; the commission also gives priority to Canadian signals—many non-Canadian channels which compete with Canadian channels are thus not approved for distribution in Canada. The CRTC argues that allowing free trade in television stations would overwhelm the smaller Canadian market, preventing it from upholding its responsibility to foster a national conversation. Some people, however, consider this tantamount to [[censorship]].

The CRTC's [[simultaneous substitution]] rules require that when a Canadian network licences a television show from a [[United States|US]] network and shows it in the same time slot, upon request by the Canadian broadcaster, Canadian broadcast distributors must replace the show on the US channel with the broadcast of the Canadian channel, along with any overlays and commercials. If ''[[Seinfeld]]'' is on [[Citytv]] and on [[NBC]], for instance, the cable, satellite, or other broadcast distributor must send the Citytv feed on NBC's channel, even where the NBC version is somehow different, particularly commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/Eng/INFO_SHT/Bdt10.htm |title=Signal substitution – same program, different commercials CRTC |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These rules are not intended to apply in case of differing ''episodes'' of the same series; this difference may not always be communicated to distributors, although this is rather rare.)

The goal of this policy is to create a market in which Canadian networks can realize revenue through advertising sales in spite of their inability to match the rates that the much larger American networks can afford to pay for syndicated programming. This policy is also why Canadian viewers do not see American advertisements during the [[Super Bowl]], even when tuning into one of the many American networks carried on Canadian televisions.

===Regulation of the internet===
In a major May 1999 decision on &quot;New Media&quot;, the CRTC held that under the Broadcasting Act the CRTC had jurisdiction over certain content communicated over the internet including audio and video, but excluding content that is primarily alphanumeric such as emails and most webpages. It also issued an exemption order committing to a policy of non-interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1999/PB99-197.htm |title=Public Notice CRTC 1999-197 |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRTC does not regulate rates, quality of service issues, or business practices for Internet service providers. However, the CRTC does continually monitor the sector and associated trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/t1003.htm |title=Internet |publisher=CRTC |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of telephone service===
The commission currently has some jurisdiction over the provision of local landline [[telephone]] service in Canada. This is largely limited to the major incumbent carriers, such as [[Bell Canada]] and [[Telus]], for traditional landline service (but not [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP)). It has begun the gradual deregulation of such services where, in the commission's opinion, a sufficient level of competition exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/NEWS/RELEASES/2006/r060406.htm CRTC.gc.ca CRTC sets criteria for the deregulation of local telephone service]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRTC is sometimes blamed for the current state of the [[mobile phone]] industry in Canada, in which there are only three national mobile network operators – [[Bell Mobility]], [[Telus Mobility]], and [[Rogers Wireless]] – as well as a handful of [[MVNO]]s operating on these networks. In fact, the commission has very little to do with the regulation of mobile phone service, outside of &quot;undue preference&quot; issues (for example,, a carrier offering a superior rate or service to some subscribers and not others without a good reason). It does not regulate service rates, service quality, or other business practices, and commission approval is not necessary for wireless provider sales or mergers as in the broadcasting industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/INFO_SHT/t1021.htm |title=Cellular (wireless) telephone services |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it does not deal with the availability of spectrum for mobile phone service, which is part of the [[Industry Canada]] mandate, nor the maintenance of competition, which is largely the responsibility of [[The Competition Bureau]].

===Transfers of ownership/foreign ownership===
Any transfer of more than 30% of the ownership of a broadcasting licence (including cable/satellite distribution licences) requires advance approval of the commission. One condition normally taken into account in such a decision is the level of foreign ownership; federal regulations require that Canadian citizens ultimately own a majority of a broadcast license. Usually this takes the form of a public process, where interested parties can express their concerns and sometimes including a public hearing, followed by a commission decision.

While landline and mobile telephone providers must also be majority-owned by Canadians under the federal [[Telecommunications Act]], the CRTC is not responsible for enforcement of this provision. In fact, the commission does not require licences at all for telephone companies, and CRTC approval is therefore not generally required for the sale of a telephone company, unless said company also owns a broadcast licence.

==Controversial decisions==
{{Weasel|date=August 2009}}

Since 1987, the CRTC has been involved in several controversial decisions:

* '''[[Milestone Radio]]''': In two separate rounds of license hearings in the 1990s, the CRTC rejected applications by Milestone Radio to launch a radio station in [[Toronto]] which would have been Canada's first [[urban music]] station; in both cases, the CRTC instead granted licenses to stations that duplicated formats already offered by other stations in the Toronto market. The CRTC finally granted a license to Milestone in 2000, after a cabinet order-in-council directed the commission to license two new radio stations that reflected the cultural diversity of the Toronto market, and [[CFXJ-FM]] launched in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* '''[[CHOI-FM]]''': The CRTC announced it would not renew the licence of the popular [[CHOI-FM]] radio station in [[Quebec City]], after having previously sanctioned the station for failing to uphold its promise of performance and then, during the years following, receiving about 50 complaints about offensive behaviour by radio jockeys which similarly contravened CRTC rules on broadcast hate speech. Many thousands of the station's fans marched in the streets and on [[Parliament Hill]] against the decision, and the parent company of CHOI, Genex Corp., appealed the CRTC decision unsuccessfully to the Federal Court of Canada. The station was later sold to [[RNC Media]], but instead of renewing its license the CRTC issued RNC a license to launch a ''new'' radio station on the same frequency.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* '''[[CBC Newsworld]]''': The CRTC licensed the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] on November 30, 1987 to provide a national [[all-news]] television network. Its competitor applicant, [[Alberta]]-based [[Allarcom]], appealed this decision to the [[Canadian House of Commons]]. It was overturned and there were questions of whether federal politicians should meddle in CRTC decisions. Because of this the network launch was delayed from September 1, 1988 to July 31, 1989.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* '''[[RAI International]]''': In Summer 2004, this [[Italy|Italian]] government controlled channel was denied permission to broadcast independently in Canada on the grounds that it had acted and was likely to act contrary to established Canadian policies. RAI International's latest politically appointed President (an avowed right wing nationalist and former spokesperson for Giorgio Almirante, the leader of the post-fascist party of Italy) had unilaterally terminated a 20-year-old agreement and stripped all of its 1,500 to 2,000 annual hours of programming from TLN [[Telelatino]], a Canadian-run channel which had devoted 95% of its prime time schedule to RAI programs for 20 years since TLN was founded. All Italian-Canadians were denied RAI programming by RAI International's removal of its programming from the Canadian marketplace, a move intended to create a public outcry and a threat that Canadians would resort to using [[satellite television|satellite]] viewing cards obtained via the US in order to watch RAI, even though these cards were either [[grey market]] or [[black market]], according to different analyses (see below). Following unprecedented foreign led and domestic political interference with the CRTC's quasi-judicial independent regulatory process, within 6 months of its original decision, an abrupt CRTC &quot;review&quot; of its policy on third-language foreign services determined to drop virtually all restrictions and adopt a new &quot;open entry&quot; approach to foreign controlled &quot;third language&quot; (non-English, non-French) channels.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* '''[[Al Jazeera]]''': Was approved by the CRTC in 2004 as an optional cable and satellite offering, but on the condition that any carrier distributing it must edit out any instances of illegal hate speech. Cable companies declared that these restrictions would make it too expensive to carry Al Jazeera. Although no cable company released data as to what such a monitoring service would cost, the end-result was that no cable company elected to carry the station, either, leaving many Arabic-speaking Canadians using [[free-to-air]] satellite dishes to watch the station. The [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] has expressed its opinion over possible [[anti-Semitic]] incitement on this station and that the restrictions on Al Jazeera are appropriate, while the Canadian [[B'nai Brith]] is opposed to any approval of Al Jazeera in Canada. The CRTC ruling applied to Al Jazeera and not to its English-speaking sister network [[Al Jazeera English]], which was launched two years after the ruling.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* '''[[Fox News]]''': Until 2004, the CRTC's apparent reluctance to grant a digital licence to Fox News under the same policy which made it difficult for RAI to enter the country - same-genre competition from foreign services - had angered many [[Canadian conservatism|conservative]] Canadians, who believed the network was deliberately being kept out due to its perceived [[conservative bias]], particularly given the long-standing availability of services such as [[CNN]] and [[BBC World]] in Canada. On November 18, 2004, however, the CRTC approved an application by cable companies to offer Fox News on the [[digital cable]] tier. Fox commenced broadcasting in Canada shortly thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* '''[[Satellite radio]]''': In June 2005, the CRTC outraged some Canadian cultural nationalists (such as the [[Friends of Canadian Broadcasting]]) and [[labour union]]s by licencing two companies, [[Canadian Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Canada]] to offer satellite radio services in Canada. The two companies are in partnership with [[United States|American]] firms [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] respectively, and in accordance with the CRTC decision will only need to offer ten percent Canadian content. The CRTC contends that this low level of Canadian content, particularly when compared to the 35 % rule on local radio stations, was necessary because unlicenced U.S. receivers were already flooding into the country, so that enforcing a ban on these receivers would be nearly impossible (see below). This explanation did not satisfy cultural nationalists, who demanded that the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] overturn the decision and mandate a minimum of 35 % Canadian content. Supporters of the decision argue that satellite radio can only be feasibly set up as a continental system, and trying to impose 35 % Canadian content across North America is quite unrealistic. They also argue that satellite radio will boost Canadian culture by giving vital exposure to independent artists, instead of concentrating just on the country's stars, and point to the CRTC's successful extraction of promises to program 10 % Canadian content on satellite services already operational in the United States as important concessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/cpress/20050627/ca_pr_on_en/satellite_radio_3 Satellite radio - Yahoo News] June 27, 2005 (Broken Link)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite popular perception that the CRTC banned [[Sirius Canada]] from broadcasting [[Howard Stern]]'s program, this is not the case. Sirius Canada in fact initially ''chose'' not to air Stern based on the ''possibility'' of a future issue with the CRTC, although the company reversed its decision and began offering Howard Stern in 2006.

* '''2008 Ottawa radio licences''': On November 21, 2008, federal Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]] issued a statement calling on the CRTC to review its approval of two new radio stations, Frank Torres' [[CIDG-FM]] and [[Astral Media]]'s [[CJOT-FM]], which it had licensed in August 2008 to serve the [[Ottawa]]-[[Gatineau]] radio market. Moore asked the commission to assess whether the [[francophone]] population of the Ottawa-Gatineau area was sufficiently well-served by existing French radio services, and to consider licensing one or more of the French language applications, which included a [[Christian music]] station, a [[community radio]] station and a [[campus radio]] station for the [[Université du Québec en Outaouais]], in addition to or instead of the approved stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gc.ca/web/view/en/index.jsp?articleid=424669 &quot;The Government of Canada Refers Decisions on Radio in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region Back to CRTC&quot;], November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The review ultimately identified a viable frequency for a third station, and [[CJFO-FM]] launched in 2010.

* '''[[Bell Canada]] usage-based billing:''' On October 28, 2010, the CRTC handed down its final decision on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell will be able to charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/globe-on-technology/crtc-ruling-handcuffs-competitive-market-teksavvy/article1778211/ &quot;CRTC ruling handcuffs competitive market: Teksavvy&quot;], October 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a [[Twitter|tweet]] by Industry Minister [[Tony Clement]], unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tektok.ca/2011/02/crtc-decision-to-be-overruled-tony-clement-via-twitter/ |title=CRTC Decision to be overruled: Tony Clement via Twitter &amp;#124; Tek Tok Canada |publisher=Tektok.ca |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception of non-Canadian services==
While an exact number has not been determined, thousands of Canadians have purchased and used what they contend to be [[grey market]] radio and television services, licensed in the [[United States]] but not in Canada. Users of these unlicensed services contend that they are not directly breaking any laws by simply using the equipment. The equipment is usually purchased from an [[United States|American]] supplier (although some merchants have attempted to set up shop in Canada) and the services are billed to an American postal address. The advent of [[online billing]] and the easy availability of [[credit card]] services has made it relatively easy for almost anyone to maintain an account in good standing, regardless of where they actually live.

Sec. 9(1)(c) of the Radiocommunication Act creates a prohibition against all decoding of encrypted programming signals, followed by an exception where authorization is received from the person holding the lawful right in Canada to transmit and authorize decoding of the signal. This means receiving the encrypted programming of DishNetwork or DirecTV, even with a grey market subscription, may be construed as unlawful (this remains an unresolved Constitutional issue).

Notwithstanding, possession of DishNetwork or DirecTV equipment is not unlawful as provided by The Radiocommuncation Act Section 4(1)(b), which states:

&quot;No person shall, except under and in accordance with a radio authorization, install, operate or possess radio apparatus, other than (b)a radio apparatus that is capable only of the reception of broadcasting and that is not a distribution undertaking. (radio apparatus&quot; means a device or combination of devices intended for, or capable of being used for, radiocommunication).&quot;

Satellite radio poses a more complicated problem for the CRTC. While an unlicensed satellite dish can often be identified easily, satellite radio receivers are much more compact and can rarely be easily identified, at least not without flagrantly violating provisions against unreasonable [[search and seizure]] in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Some observers argued that this influenced the CRTC's June 2005 decision to ease Canadian content restrictions on satellite radio (see above).

==Structure==
The CRTC is run by up to 13 full-time (including the chairman, the vice-chairman of broadcasting, and the vice-chairman of telecommunications) and six part-time commissioners appointed by the Cabinet for renewable terms of up to five years. Only full-time commissioners can participate in the decision-making process for telecommunications and all commissioners are involved in broadcasting decisions. The current chairman is [[Konrad von Finckenstein]], former head of Canada's Competition Bureau.

'''Coal''' is a [[combustion|combustible]] black or brownish-black [[sedimentary rock]] normally occurring in [[stratum|rock strata]] in ''layers or veins'' called '''coal beds&lt;!-- redirected term title--&gt;''' or '''coal seams'''. The harder forms, such as [[anthracite|anthracite coal]], can be regarded as [[metamorphic rock]] because of later exposure to elevated temperature and [[pressure]]. Coal is composed primarily of [[carbon]] along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly  [[hydrogen]], with smaller quantities of [[sulfur]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== Formation ==
Coal begins as layers of plant matter accumulate at the bottom of a body of water. For the process to continue the plant matter must be protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidization]], usually by mud or acidic water.  This trapped atmospheric carbon in the ground in immense [[peat]] [[bog]]s that eventually were covered over and deeply buried by sediments under which they [[metamorphosed]] into coal. Over time, the chemical and [[Physical property|physical properties]] of the plant remains were changed by geological action to create a solid material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The wide shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous]] [[Era (geology)|period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.  The exception is the [[Coal gap]] in the Lower Triassic, where coal is incredibly rare: presumably a result of the mass extinction which prefaced this era.  Coal is even known from Precambrian strata, which predate land plants: this coal is presumed to have originated from algal residues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1957&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1130/0016-7606(1957)68[1293:ACFPUH]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mancuso1981&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.2113/gsecongeo.76.4.951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal, a [[fossil fuel]], is the largest source of energy for the [[Electricity generation|generation of electricity]] worldwide, as well as one of the largest worldwide [[anthropogenic]] sources of [[carbon dioxide]] releases. Gross [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] from coal usage are slightly more than those from [[petroleum]] and about double the amount from [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;The EIA reports the following emissions in million [[Tonne|metric tons]] of carbon dioxide:
*Nat gas: 5,840
*Petroleum: 10,995
*Coal: 11,357
For 2005 as the official energy statistics of the US Government.[http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/carbon.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is extracted from the ground by [[coal mining|mining]], either underground by [[shaft mining]] through the seams or in [[open pit mining|open pits]].

As geological processes apply [[pressure]] to dead [[biotic material]] over time, under suitable conditions it is transformed successively into
* [[Peat]], considered to be a [[precursor]] of coal, has industrial importance as a fuel in some regions, for example, Ireland and Finland. In its dehydrated form, peat is a highly effective absorbent for fuel and oil spills on land and water
* [[Lignite]], also referred to as brown coal, is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation. [[jet (lignite)|Jet]] is a compact form of lignite that is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]
* [[Sub-bituminous coal]], whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal are used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation. Additionally, it is an important source of light [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s for the [[chemical synthesis]] industry.
* [[Bituminous coal]], dense sedimentary rock, black but sometimes dark brown, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material, used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation, with substantial quantities also used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]]
* ''Steam coal'' is a grade between bituminous coal and anthracite, once widely used as a fuel for [[steam locomotive]]s. In this specialized use it is sometimes known as ''sea-coal'' in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[Funk and Wagnalls]], quoted in {{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=sea-coal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small steam coal (''dry small steam nuts'' or DSSN) was used as a fuel for domestic [[water heating]]
* [[Anthracite]], the highest rank; a harder, glossy, black coal used primarily for residential and commercial [[space heating]]. It may be divided further into metamorphically altered bituminous coal and ''petrified oil'', as from the deposits in Pennsylvania
* [[Graphite]], technically the highest rank, but difficult to ignite and is not so commonly used as fuel: it is mostly used in pencils and, when powdered, as a [[lubricant]].

The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles. However, the exact classification varies between countries. According to the German classification, coal is classified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Lindner; Chemie für Ingenieure; Lindner Verlag Karlsruhe, S. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the English-language sub-bituminous to bituminous coal, while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite, but more inclusive (the U.S. anthracite has &lt; 6% volatiles).

[[Cannel coal]] (sometimes called &quot;candle coal&quot;), is a variety of fine-grained, high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content. It consists primarily of &quot;[[exinite]]&quot; macerals, now termed &quot;liptinite&quot;.

===Hilt's Law===

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
'''Hilt's Law''' is a geological term that states the deeper the coal, the deeper its rank (grade). The law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical, but metamorphism may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth.

[[Image:Tiangong Kaiwu Coal Mining.gif|thumb|right|150px|Chinese coal [[miner]]s in an illustration of the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia, published in 1637]]
The earliest reference to the use of coal as fuel is from the geological treatise ''On stones'' (Lap. 16) by the [[Greeks|Greek]] scientist [[Theophrastus]] (c. 371–287 BC):

{{quote| Among the materials that are dug because they are useful, those known as coals are made of earth, and, once set on fire, they burn like [[charcoal]].

===Coal as fuel===
{{See|Electricity generation|Clean coal technology|Coal electricity|Global warming}}
Coal is primarily used as a solid [[fuel]] to produce electricity and heat through combustion. World coal consumption was about 6,743,786,000 [[short ton]]s in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/table14.xls World coal consupmption 1980-2006] October 2008 [[EIA]] statistics&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to increase 48% to 9.98 billion short tons by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;EIA, World Energy Projections Plus (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal power in China|China]] produced 2.38 billion tons in 2006. [[India]] produced about 447.3 million tons in 2006. [[Coal power in China|68.7%]] of China's electricity comes from coal. The USA consumes about 14% of the world total, using 90% of it for generation of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/special/feature.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When coal is used for [[electricity generation]], it is usually pulverized and then combusted (burned) in a [[furnace]] with a [[boiler]]. The furnace heat converts boiler water to [[steam]], which is then used to spin [[turbine]]s which turn [[electrical generator|generator]]s and create electricity. The [[thermodynamic efficiency]] of this process has been improved over time. Simple cycle steam turbines have topped out with some of the most advanced reaching about 35% thermodynamic efficiency for the entire process. Increasing the combustion temperature can boost this efficiency even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fossil Power Generation | publisher = Siemens AG | url = http://w1.siemens.com/responsibility/en/environment/portfolio/fossil_power_generation.htm | accessdate = 2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old coal power plants, especially &quot;grandfathered&quot; plants, are significantly less efficient and produce higher levels of [[waste heat]]. At least 40% of the world's electricity comes from coal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcoal.org/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=188&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 approximately 49% of the United States' electricity came from coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other efficient ways to use coal are [[cogeneration|combined heat and power cogeneration]] and [[magnetohydrodynamic generator|an MHD topping cycle]].

More than 40% of the world electricity production uses coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mason |last=Inman |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/09/100908-energy-peak-coal/ |title=Mining the Truth on Coal Supplies |newspaper=National Geographic News |date= 2010-09-08 |accessdate= 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total known deposits recoverable by current technologies, including highly polluting, low energy content types of coal (i.e., lignite, bituminous), is sufficient for many years. However, consumption is increasing and [[peak coal|maximal production could be reached]] within decades (see [[Coal#World coal reserves|World Coal Reserves]], below).

A more energy-efficient way of using coal for electricity production would be via [[solid-oxide fuel cell]]s or [[molten-carbonate fuel cell]]s (or any oxygen ion transport based [[fuel cell]]s that do not discriminate between fuels, as long as they consume oxygen), which would be able to get 60%–85% combined efficiency (direct electricity + waste heat steam turbine).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Currently these fuel cell technologies can only process gaseous fuels, and they are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning, issues which would first have to be worked out before large-scale commercial success is possible with coal. As far as gaseous fuels go, one idea is [[Coal dust|pulverized coal]] in a gas carrier, such as nitrogen. Another option is [[coal gas]]ification with water, which may lower fuel cell voltage by introducing oxygen to the fuel side of the electrolyte, but may also greatly simplify [[carbon sequestration]]. However, this technology has been criticised as being inefficient, slow, risky and costly, while doing nothing about total emissions from mining, processing and combustion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risingtide.org.au/cleancoal Clean coal facts and figures page by Rising Tide Newcastle]&lt;/ref&gt; Another efficient and clean way of coal combustion in a form of [[coal-water slurry fuel]] (CWS) was well-developed in Russia (since [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]] time). [[Coal-water slurry fuel|CWS]] significantly reduces emissions saving the heating value of coal.

===Coking and use of coke===
{{Main|Coke (fuel)}}
[[File:Coke Ovens Abercwmboi.jpg|right|thumb|Coke oven at a [[smokeless fuel]] plant in [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom]]]]
Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000 °C (1,832 °F) so that the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together. Metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a [[reducing agent]] in smelting [[iron]] ore in a [[blast furnace]]. The product is [[cast iron]] and is too rich in dissolved carbon, and so must be treated further to make [[steel]].

The coke must be strong enough to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel by the conventional route. However, the alternative route to is [[direct reduced iron]], where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable by-products that include [[coal tar]], [[ammonia]], light oils, and &quot;coal gas&quot;.

[[Petroleum coke]] is the solid residue obtained in [[oil refining]], which resembles coke but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications.

===Ethanol production===
The reaction of coal and natural gas was used by a German manufacturer for Buna [[rubber]]: Chemische Werke Huls, at [[Marl, Germany]], and AVCO Corp in the US. Consequently several references had described both Huls Arc Process and AVCO rotating arc reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Acetylene, 5th Ed., Vch Pub, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Kirk and Othmer, 4th Ed., Acetylene, Wiley-Interscience, 2004 ISBN 978-0-471-48522-3&lt;/ref&gt; Both reactors are of cylindrical shape and have a rotating [[electric arc]]. The [[cathode]] is at the cylinder axis, while the [[anode]] is on the circumference. As [[Methane|methane gas]] provided the highest yield, then it is forced with coal powder into a [[vortex]] passing through the electric arc for few milliseconds.

Huls Arc Process&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Weissermel et al, Industrial Organic Chemistry, Science, 2003, ISBN 3-527-30578-5&lt;/ref&gt; produced a mixture of [[acetylene]] and ethylene gases. The reaction conditions can be varied to determine the needed product. Increasing the Specific Energy Requirement (SER) favors acetylene production, and lower SER is for ethylene:

Enthalpy Change for Ethylene:&lt;ref&gt;Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 6th Ed., Robert Perry and Don Green, McGraw Hill, Section 3, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; = 127.34 kJ/mol, while for acetylene: = 301.4 kJ/mol. As a consequence, recent production processes are using conventional heating instead of electric arc.

Hydration of ethylene gas producing ethanol is the most important process for ethanol production. Vapor phase process is the preferred one&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Kirk and Othmer, Ethanol, 4th Ed., Wiley-Interscience, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in which ethylene and steam pass over a [[catalyst]]. One of the most accepted catalysts is [[diatomite]] impregnated with [[phosphoric acid]].

===Gasification===
{{Main|Coal gasification|Underground coal gasification}}
Coal gasification can be used to produce [[syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. This syngas can then be converted into transportation fuels like gasoline and diesel through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]. This technology is currently used by the [[Sasol]] chemical company of [[South Africa]] to make gasoline from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for [[Hydrogen#Applications|various purposes]] such as powering a [[hydrogen economy]], making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.

During gasification, the coal is mixed with oxygen and steam ([[water vapor]]) while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules [[oxidize]] the coal into carbon monoxide (CO) while also releasing hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. This process has been conducted in both [[underground coal gasification|underground coal mines]] and in [[town gas#Gas for industrial use|coal refineries]].

: (Coal) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO

If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the [[water gas shift reaction]] where more hydrogen is liberated.

: CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

High prices of oil and natural gas are leading to increased interest in &quot;BTU Conversion&quot; technologies such as [[gasification]], methanation and liquefaction. The [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]] was a U.S. government-funded corporation established in 1980 to create a market for alternatives to imported fossil fuels (such as coal gasification). The corporation was discontinued in 1985.

In the past, coal was converted to make coal gas, which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking. At present, the safer natural gas is used instead.

===Liquefaction===
{{Main|Coal liquefaction}}

Coal can also be converted into [[synthetic fuel|liquid fuels]] such as [[gasoline]] or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] by several different processes. In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] or [[carbonization|carbonized]]. Hydrogenation processes are the [[Bergius process]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haul: [[Friedrich Bergius]] (1884-1949), p. 62 in 'Chemie in unserer Zeit', VCH-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 19. Jahrgang, April 1985, Weinheim, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes and the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process.&lt;ref name=handbook2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of low-temperature [[carbonization]], coal is coked at temperatures between 360 °C (680 °F) and 750 °C (1,380 °F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. Alternatively, coal can be converted into a gas first, and then into a liquid, by using the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.&lt;ref&gt;Höök, M., Aleklett, K., 2009. A review on coal to liquid fuels and its coal consumption, International Journal of Energy Research, article in press [http://www.tsl.uu.se/uhdsg/Publications/CTL_Article.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions in the conversion process. If coal liquefaction is done without employing either [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies or biomass blending, the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from [[crude oil]]. If CCS technologies are employed, reductions of 5-12% can be achieved in CTL plants and up to a 75% reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass (30% biomass by weight) in CBTL plants.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For most future [[synthetic fuel]] projects, [[Carbon dioxide sequestration]] is proposed to avoid releasing it into the atmosphere. Sequestration will, however, add to the cost of production.

Coal liquefaction features intense research work, particularly in China, Germany, South Africa and the USA. Every year, the World CTL Award rewards an individual who has contributed substantially in the understanding and development of Coal and Biomass Conversion. In 2011, the World CTL Award was granted to Rudi Heydenrich, executive manager of Sasol Technology.

=== Refined coal ===
{{Main|Refined coal}}
Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several pre-combustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of pre-combustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, pre-combustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to post-combustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.

===Industrial processes===
{{anchor|Industrial processes}}
Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as ''sea coal'', is a constituent of [[foundry sand]]. While the molten metal is in the [[Molding (process)|mould]] the coal burns slowly, releasing [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] at pressure and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in ''mould wash'', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rao|first=P. N.|title=Manufacturing technology: foundry, forming and welding|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|year=2007|edition=2|page=107|chapter=Moulding materials|isbn=9780074631805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the &quot;bod&quot;) used for the bottom of a [[cupola furnace]]. When heated the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Edward|title=Cupola Furnace - A Practical Treatise on the Construction and Management of Foundry Cupolas|publisher=Baird|location=Philadelphia, PA|year=1899|page=95|chapter=Cupola management|oclc=2884198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural usage==
Coal is the [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|official state mineral]] of [[Kentucky]] (even though coal is not a mineral) and the [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|official state rock]] of [[Utah]]. Both [[U.S. state]]s have a historic link to coal mining.

Some cultures uphold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from [[Santa Claus]] for Christmas in their [[Christmas stocking|stocking]]s instead of presents.

It is also customary and lucky in Scotland and the North of England to give coal as a gift on New Year's Day. It happens as part of [[First-Foot]]ing and represents warmth for the year to come.

==Coal as a traded commodity==
In North America, Central [[Appalachian]] coal [[futures contract]]s are currently traded on the [[NYMEX|New York Mercantile Exchange]] (trading symbol ''QL''). The trading unit is {{convert|1550|ST|t}} per contract, and is quoted in U.S. dollars and cents per ton. Since coal is the principal fuel for generating electricity in the United States, coal futures contracts provide coal producers and the [[Electrical power industry|electric power industry]] an important tool for [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] and [[risk management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NYMEX.com: Coal | url=http://www.nymex.com/coa_fut_descri.aspx | accessdate=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the NYMEX contract, the [[IntercontinentalExchange|IntercontinentalExchange (ICE)]] has European (Rotterdam) and South African (Richards Bay) coal futures available for trading.

== Economic aspects ==
Coal liquefaction is one of the [[Backstop resources|backstop]] technologies that could potentially limit escalation of [[oil prices]] and [[mitigation|mitigate]] the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under [[peak oil]]. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Diesel Fuel News: Ultra-clean fuels from coal liquefaction: China about to launch big projects - Brief Article | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYH/is_15_6/ai_89924477 |accessdate=9 September 2005 | work=Diesel Fuel News | first=Jack | last=Peckham | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to [[oil sand]] projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.

In China, due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Si Tingting and Li Jing | title=Coal-to-liquids project rescheduled to launch in early 2009 | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-12/12/content_7300666.htm |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |newspaper=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably because China prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing during the first half of 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sasol, Shenhua Group May Complete Coal-to-Fuel Plant by 2013 | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.MSdPvb0Ep8|accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China is by far the largest producer of coal in the world.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Energy Information Administration. 2008. ''World Coal Production, Most Recent Estimates 1980-2007'' (October 2008). http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/coalproduction.html [accessed 11-2-08].&lt;/ref&gt; It has now become the world's largest energy consumer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703720504575376712353150310.html?mod=djemalertNEWS|title=China Becomes World's Biggest Energy Consumer|date=July 19, 2010|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2010-07-19 | first1=Spencer | last1=Swartz | first2=Shai | last2=Oster}}&lt;/ref&gt; but relies on coal to supply about 70% of its energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoworld.com/home/articles2.cfm?tid=450|title=China’s Coal|last=Feller|first=Gordon|publisher=ECOworld|accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1595235,00.html Where The Coal Is Stained With Blood]&quot;. ''TIME''. March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Among commercially mature technologies, advantages for indirect coal liquefaction over direct coal liquefaction are reported by Williams and Larson (2003).

==Energy density==
{{Main|Energy value of coal}}
The [[energy density]] of coal, i.e. its [[heating value]], is roughly 24 [[joules|megajoules]] per [[kilogram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Juliya | title = Energy Density of Coal | work = The Physics Factbook | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml|year=2003|accessdate =25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy density of coal can also be expressed in [[Watt-hour|kilowatt-hours]], the units that electricity is most commonly sold in, per units of mass to estimate how much coal is required to power electrical appliances. One kilowatt-hour is 3.6&amp;nbsp;MJ, so the energy density of coal is 6.67&amp;nbsp;kW·h/kg. The typical thermodynamic efficiency of coal power plants is about 30%, so of the 6.67&amp;nbsp;kW·h of energy per kilogram of coal, 30% of that—2.0&amp;nbsp;kW·h/kg—can successfully be turned into electricity; the rest is waste heat. So coal power plants obtain approximately 2.0&amp;nbsp;kW·h per kilogram of burned coal.

As an example, running one 100-watt lightbulb for one year requires 876&amp;nbsp;kW·h (100 W × 24 h/day × 365 day/year = 876000 W·h = 876&amp;nbsp;kW·h). Converting this power usage into physical coal consumption:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{876 \ \mathrm{kW \cdot h}}{2.0 \ \mathrm{kW} \cdot \mathrm{h/kg}} = 438 \ \mathrm{kg \ of \ coal} = 966 \ \mathrm{pounds \ of \ coal}&lt;/math&gt;

It takes 325&amp;nbsp;kg (714&amp;nbsp;lb) of coal to power a 100&amp;nbsp;W lightbulb for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = How much coal is required to run a 100-watt light bulb 24 hours a day for a year?
 | work = Howstuffworks
 | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question481.htm
 | accessdate =25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One should also take into account [[Power line#Losses|transmission and distribution losses]] caused by resistance and heating in the [[Electric power transmission|power lines]], which is in the order of 5–10%, depending on distance from the power station and other factors.

== Carbon intensity ==
Commercial coal has a carbon content of at least 70%. Coal with a heating value of 6.67 kWh per kilogram as quoted above has a carbon content of roughly 80%, which is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{0.8 \ \mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{12} \cdot \mathrm{kg/kmol}} = \frac{2}{30} \ \mathrm{kmol}&lt;/math&gt; , where 1 [[mole (unit)|mol]] equals to N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (''Avogadro Number'') atoms.

Carbon combines with oxygen in the atmosphere during combustion, producing carbon dioxide, with an atomic weight of (12 + 16 × 2 = 44&amp;nbsp;kg/kmol). The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released to air for each kilogram of incinerated coal is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{30} \ \mathrm{kmol} \cdot \frac{44 \ \mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{kmol}} = \frac{88}{30} \ \mathrm{kg} \approx 2.93 \ \mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be used to calculate an [[emission factor]] for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the use of coal power. Since the useful energy output of coal is about 30% of the 6.67 kWh/kg(coal), the burning of 1&amp;nbsp;kg of coal produces about 2 kWh of electrical energy. Since 1&amp;nbsp;kg coal emits 2.93&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the direct CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal power are 1.47&amp;nbsp;kg/kWh, or about 0.407&amp;nbsp;kg/MJ.

The U.S. Energy Information Agency's 1999 report on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for energy generation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/co2_report/co2report.html CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Carbon Dioxide Emissions from the Generation of Electric Power in the United States, DOE, EPA, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; quotes a lower emission factor of 0.963&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh for coal power. The same source gives a factor for oil power in the U.S. of 0.881&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh, while natural gas has 0.569&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh. Estimates for specific emission from [[nuclear power]], hydro, and [[Wind power|wind energy]] vary, but are about 100 times lower.

==Underground fires==
{{Main|Coal seam fire}}
There are hundreds of coal fires burning around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sino German Coal fire project | url=http://www.coalfire.caf.dlr.de/projectareas/world_wide_distribution_en.html | accessdate=9 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface [[wildfire]]s. Coal seams can be set on fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] or contact with a [[mine fire]] or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition, the coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Committee on Resources-Index | url=http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm | accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050825231038/http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 25 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf | url=http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf | accessdate=9 September 2005|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal fires in China burn 109 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This contradicts the ratio of 1:1.83 given earlier,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} but it amounts to 2-3% of the annual worldwide production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from [[fossil fuels]], or as much as emitted from all of the cars and light trucks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EHP 110-5, 2002: Forum | url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html | accessdate=9 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Overview about ITC's activities in China | url=http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html | accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050616004903/http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 16 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] (a [[borough]] located in the [[Coal Region]] of the [[United States]]), an exposed vein of coal ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned [[anthracite coal|anthracite]] [[Surface mining|strip mine]] pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The [[Australia]]n [[Burning Mountain]] was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash comes from a coal fire which may have been burning for over 5,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Burning Mountain Nature Reserve | url=http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/ParkContent/N0503?Opendocument&amp;ParkKey=N0503&amp;Type=xo | accessdate=9 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Kuh i Malik in [[Yagnob Valley]], [[Tajikistan]], coal deposits have been burning for thousands of years, creating vast underground labyrinths full of unique minerals, some of them very beautiful. Local people once used this method to mine [[ammoniac]]. This place has been well-known since the time of [[Herodotus]], but European geographers misinterpreted the Ancient Greek descriptions as the evidence of active [[Volcano|volcanism]] in [[Turkestan]] (up to the 19th century, when the Russian army invaded the area).

The reddish siltstone rock that caps many ridges and buttes in the [[Powder River Basin]] ([[Wyoming]]), and in western [[North Dakota]] is called '''porcelanite''', which also may resemble the coal burning waste &quot;clinker&quot; or volcanic &quot;[[scoria]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=North Dakota's Clinker | url=http://www.state.nd.us/ndgs/ndnotes/ndn13_h.htm | accessdate=9 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinker is rock that has been fused by the natural burning of coal. In the Powder River Basin approximately 27 to 54 billion tons of coal burned within the past three million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BLM-Environmental Education- The High Plains | url=http://www.blm.gov/education/high_plains/article.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050312133748/http://www.blm.gov/education/high_plains/article.html |archivedate = 12 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild coal fires in the area were reported by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] as well as explorers and settlers in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/Coal/CR01-1.pdf | url=http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/Coal/CR01-1.pdf | accessdate=9 September 2005|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050912063721/http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/Coal/CR01-1.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production trends==
[[File:2005coal.png|thumb|right|Coal output in 2005]]
[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|A coal mine in Wyoming, United States. The United States has the world's largest coal reserves.]]
In 2006, China was the top producer of coal with 38% share followed by the USA and India, according to the [[British Geological Survey]].

===World coal reserves===

The 930 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the Energy Information Administration are equal to about 4,116 BBOE (billion [[barrel of oil equivalent|barrels of oil equivalent]]).&lt;!-- (930,000*0.907186*4.879) --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7.075 billion short tons, or 133.179 quadrillion BTU's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EIA International Energy Statistics : Coal : Consumption | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&amp;pid=1&amp;aid=2 |accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an average of 18.8 million BTU per short ton. In terms of heat content, this is about {{convert|57000000|oilbbl}} of oil equivalent per day.&lt;!-- 133179 trillion BTUs = 20820 MBoe, /365--&gt; By comparison in 2007, natural gas provided {{convert|51000000|oilbbl}} of oil equivalent per day, while oil provided 85,800,000 [[barrels per day]].

[[BP]], in its 2007 report, estimated at 2006 end that there were 909,064 million tons of ''proven'' coal reserves worldwide, or 147 years [[reserves-to-production ratio]]. This figure only includes reserves classified as &quot;proven&quot;; exploration drilling programs by mining companies, particularly in under-explored areas, are continually providing new reserves. In many cases, companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as &quot;proven&quot;. However, some nations haven't updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals. Collective projections generally predict that global [[peak coal]] production may occur sometime around 2025 at 30 percent above current production in the best case scenario, depending on future coal production rates.&lt;ref&gt;''Coal: Resources and Future Production'', 47 page report by Energy Watch group, March 28, 2007 (revised July 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Us coal regions 1996.png|thumb|300px|right|Continental United States coal regions]]
Of the three fossil fuels, coal has the most widely distributed reserves; coal is mined in over 100 countries, and on all continents except Antarctica. The largest reserves are found in the USA, Russia, China, India and Australia. Note the table below.

'''Traditional Chinese medicine''' ('''中醫''', {{zh|p=zhōng yī}}) (TCM), is a label that covers a broad range of [[traditional medicine]] practices spread throughout Asia, including various forms of [[Chinese herbal medicine|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[massage therapy]], and dietary therapy.&lt;ref name=TCMNCCAM&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, [http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  The common thread among these diverse practices is a system for balancing the various functions of the body, based in [[Daoist]] principles of [[yinyang]] and other [[Metaphysics (beyond natural law)|metaphysical belief systems]], that originated during the [[Warring States Period]] in regions that are now part of [[China]].  These practices are a common part of medical care throughout East Asia, accounting for roughly 75% of worldwide use,&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditional Chinese Healing Herbs 2007&quot;&gt;Facial Rejuvenation With Traditional Chinese Healing Herbs, Ping Zhang, Acupuncture Today, October, 2007, Vol. 08, Issue 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheid , 2002&quot;&gt;(Scheid , 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; but are considered [[alternative medicine]] in the western world.&lt;ref name=TCMNCCAM/&gt;

TCM practices use different physiological and disease models than modern medicine, and make a number of assumptions that are inconsistent with or untestable under the principles of scientific methods, which complicates research on the efficacy of TCM medicinals and practices.  TCM usually conceives of internal organs not as isolated anatomical structures, but as systems that are responsible for certain bodily functions (such as digestion or the regulation of blood).  Taking a holisitic approach, TCM commonly views these organ systems as interrelated in systematic ways, and uses various techniques to stimulate or support weakened systems or to soothe or dampen over-active systems.  TCM involves an often subjective diagnosis of the general state of various organ systems followed by ongoing efforts to reestablish a healthy balance between the systems.

A broad range of 'over-the-counter' medicinals loosely related to TCM are available.  Many of these - such as yinqiao, a commonly used medicinal for colds and flus - are innocuous, but some may contain dangerous chemicals added as ingredients or byproducts of production, and certain sexual potency medicinals are complicit in the near extinction of animals such as the rhinoceros and siberian tiger.&lt;br /&gt;

== Overview ==
Traditional medicine plays a role in Chinese lifestyle that is substantially different than the role of medicines in the west, in that it is integrated into basic conceptions of health and wellness and overlaps with folk remedies. It is estimated that 40% of healthcare in China (75% of worldwide practice) is based in such practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditional Chinese Healing Herbs 2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheid , 2002&quot;&gt;(Scheid , 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hesketh1997/&gt;

Traditional medical practices have ancient roots: Stone needles ostensibly used for acupuncture have been dated back to the [[stone age]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiu, M 1993 p. 2&quot;&gt;Chiu, M (1993). Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion. Elsevier Health Sciences. p. 2. ISBN 0443042233&lt;/ref&gt; and hieroglyphs and pictographs documenting acupuncture and moxibustion have been found dating back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600-1100 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson, T 2004 pp. 90&quot;&gt;Robson, T (2004). An Introduction to Complementary Medicine. Allen &amp; Unwin. pp. 90. ISBN 1741140544&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have not determined when primitive practices became integrated into a complete theoretical system, however TCM is intertwined with the principles of [[Hundred Schools of Thought#School of Yin-yang|Yinyangism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;see [[Huangdi Neijing|''Huang neijing Suwen'']], chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., the combination of [[Wu xing|Wǔ Xíng]] theory with [[yin and yang|Yin-yang]] theory) formulated by [[Zou Yan|Zōu Yǎn]] (340 - 260 BC),&lt;ref name=&quot;Zou Yan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting TCM itself was formalized sometime after that.  Clearly defined medical texts were being written as early as the 2nd century BC, though these texts were often attributed to mythological figures from more than two millennia earlier.

Traditional Chinese medicine covers a number of different kinds of practices, most of which focus on balancing the distribution or movement of the body's [[qi]] - a putative energy that has no direct correlate in western medicine - according to [[Daoist]] [[philosophical]] and [[religious]] conceptions of [[yinyang]].  In general, traditional Chinese medical theory holds that there is a finite amount of qi available in the body, sometimes distinguishing between natal (inborn) qi and developed (gained) qi, which must be allocated so the body can perform its various prosaic functions: digestion, temperature regulation, maintenance of bodily fluids, etc.  These various functions are conceived in terms of [[organ systems]], which are abstract structures based around the major organs of the body, and which have complex interactions for sharing and exchanging qi.  Illness is generally believed to be rooted in an imbalance between organ systems, where an excess or deficit of qi in a given system can throw bodily functions out of balance and allow the introduction of disease.  These imbalances are addressed in a number of different ways, according to different practices: the use of herb complexes or dietary changes intended to stimulate or calm particular organ systems, the stimulation of these systems directly by using needles or pressure points, massage systems designed to stimulate and balance the body as a whole, even meditative practices that use the focusing of breath or movement to move qi through the body.&lt;ref name=Matuk2006&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration |author=Camillia Matuk |journal=Journal of Biocommunication |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf |pmid= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AACS&gt;''Traditional Chinese Medicine'', [http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/ManualHealingandPhysicalTouch/acupuncture Acupuncture, American Cancer Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YTHF&gt;Yang Tianhui: Notes from My Visit to the Fuzi Growing Area of Zhangming County (Song Dynasty, 1099 CE), , Heiges=245–56 |pmid=18240287 |doicalchinesemedicine.org/2010/12/yang-tianhui-notes-from-my-visit-to-the-fuzi-growing-area-of-zhangming-county-song-dynasty-1099-ce/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YTHF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IOA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalchinesemedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fruehauf_fuziinterview1.pdf |title='&amp;#39;&quot;The Importance of Aconite (fuzi)&quot;'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IOA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;[[Felix Mann]], quoted in {{cite journal |first=M |last=Bauer |url=http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 |journal=Chinese Medicine Times |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=31 |year=2006 |title=The Final Days of Traditional Beliefs? - Part One}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =TorT&gt;''Trick or Treatment'', [[#Singh2008|Singh &amp; Ernst]], 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&amp;pg=PA70 70-73]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the differences in body model between traditional Chinese medicine and western scientific medicine, tests of efficacy are difficult to construct.  Pharmacological tests on traditional herbs have sometimes revealed effective compounds, though these were not necessarily effective in the way suggested by TCM, and sometimes found that medicinals contain toxins, or have no determinable effect.&lt;ref name=NEC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ERTCM/&gt;&lt;ref name=CTCMMP&gt;''&quot;The contribution of traditional Chinese medicine to modern pharmacology&quot;'', Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, Volume 4, 1983, Mei-ling Shen, pp. 496-500&lt;/ref&gt; Acupuncture has been found to have limited clinical applications; the putative health benefits of massage, meditation, or exercise programs like [[qi gong]] are largely untested.  The overlap between traditional Chinese medicine proper, folk remedies (such as shark fin soup), [[Metaphysics (beyond natural law)|metaphysical belief systems]] (such as [[Chinese astrology]]), and exploitive products (usually sexual potency preparations, containing things like horny goat weed or rhinoceros horn) makes determining the efficacy of TCM as a theoretical construct problematic.  Further, the introduction of traditional practices into the western world has blended TCM in some cases with [[New Age]] ideation that has further obscured the traditional practice.&lt;ref name=DPA&gt;''The Drive for Professionalization in Acupuncture: A preliminary view from the San Francisco Bay area&quot;, Social Science &amp; Medicine, Volume 46, Issue 5, Pages 533-537, H.Baer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TEBA&gt;''&quot;steeped in the mystical concepts of TCM, was introduced to an America infatuated with New Age magical thinking,ref name=TEBA&gt;&quot;'', ''Traditional and Evidence-Based Acupuncture: History, Mechanisms, and Present Status'', GA Ulett, J Han, Southern Medical Journal, December 1998 - Volume 91 - Issue 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical background ==

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is based on [[Hundred Schools of Thought#School of Yin-yang|Yinyangism]] (i.e., the combination of [[Wu xing|Five Phases]] theory with [[yin and yang|Yin-yang]] theory),&lt;ref name=&quot;Zou Yan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later absorbed by [[Daoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Liu 1999, p. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|thumb|right|200px|Yin and Yang symbol for balance. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, good health is believed to be achieved by a balance between Yin and Yang.]]

=== Yin and yang ===
{{Main|Yin and yang}}

Yin and yang are ancient Chinese concepts which can be traced back to the Shang dynasty&lt;ref name=&quot;Men &amp; Guo 2010, p. 60&quot;&gt;Men &amp; Guo 2010, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; (1600-1100 BC). They represent two abstract&lt;ref name=&quot;Men &amp; Guo 2010, p. 62&quot;&gt;Men &amp; Guo 2010, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and complementary aspects every phenomenon in the universe can be divided into.&lt;ref name=&quot;Men &amp; Guo 2010, p. 60&quot;/&gt; Primordial analogies for these aspects are the sun-facing (yang) and the shady (yin) side of a hill.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Two other commonly used representational allegories of yin and yang are water and fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Men &amp; Guo 2010, p. 62&quot;/&gt; In yin-yang theory, detailed attributions are made regarding the yin or yang character of things:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Phenomenon || Yin || Yang

|-
! Degree of humidity
| damp/moist || dry
|}
The concept of yin and yang is also applicable to the human body; for example, the upper part of the body and the back are assigned to yang, while the lower part of the body are believed to have yin character.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Yin and yang characterization also extends to the various body functions, and - more importantly - to disease symptoms (e.g., cold and heat sensations are assumed to be yin and yang symptoms, respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 6&quot;/&gt; Thus, yin and yang of the body are seen as phenomena whose lack (or overabundance) comes with characteristic symptom combinations:
* Yin vacuity (also termed &quot;vacuity-heat&quot;): heat sensations, possible night sweats, insomnia, dry pharynx, dry mouth, dark urine, a red tongue with scant fur, and a &quot;fine&quot; and rapid pulse.&lt;ref&gt;Kaptchuk 2000, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;
* Yang vacuity (&quot;vacuity-cold&quot;): aversion to cold, cold limbs, bright white complexion, long voidings of clear urine, diarrhea, pale and enlarged tongue, and a slightly weak, slow and fine pulse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 142&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;
TCM also identifies drugs believed to treat these specific symptom combinations, i.e., to reinforce yin and yang.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009. p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Five Phases theory ===

Five Phases (五行, {{zh|p=wǔ xíng}}, sometimes also translated as &quot;Five Elements&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60&quot;&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; theory presumes that all phenomena of the universe and of nature can be broken down into five elemental qualities - represented by wood (木, {{zh|p=mù}}), fire (火{{zh|p=huǒ}}), earth (土, {{zh|p=tǔ}}), metal (金, {{zh|p=jīn}}), and water (水, {{zh|p=shuǐ}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aung &amp; Chen 2007, p. 8&quot;&gt;Aung &amp; Chen 2007, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, lines of correspondence can be drawn:

Strict rules are identified to apply to the relationships between the Five Phases in terms of sequence, of acting on each other, of counteraction etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aung &amp; Chen 2007, p. 8&quot;/&gt; All these aspects of Five Phases theory constitute the basis of the [[Zang-fu|zàng-fǔ]] concept, and thus have great influence regarding the TCM model of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60&quot;/&gt; Five Phase theory is also applied in diagnosis and therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60&quot;/&gt;

Correspondences between the body and the universe have historically not only been seen in terms of the Five Elements, but also of the &quot;Great Numbers&quot; (大數, {{zh|p=dà shū}})&lt;ref&gt;Matuk 2006, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the number of acupoints has at times been seen to be 365, in correspondence with the number of days in a year; and the number of main [[meridians]] - 12 - has been seen in correspondence with the number of rivers flowing through the [[History of China|ancient Chinese empire]].&lt;ref name=Matuk2006&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration |author=Camillia Matuk |journal=Journal of Biocommunication |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf |pmid= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SDAM&gt;''&quot;There are 365 days in the year, while humans have 365 joints [or acupoints]...

== TCM model of the body ==
{{Main|TCM model of the body}}
{{sync|TCM model of the body}}

TCM's view of the human body is only marginally concerned with [[anatomy|anatomical]] structures, but focuses primarily on the body's ''functions''&lt;ref&gt;Matuk 2006, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chinese medicine ... emphasizes function. Little emphasis is placed on structure, especially internal structures.&quot; As seen at: Ross 1984, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; (such as digestion, breathing, temperature maintenance, etc.): &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The tendency of Chinese thought is to seek out dynamic functional activity rather than to look for the fixed somatic structures that perform the activities. Because of this, the Chinese have no system of anatomy comparable to that of the West.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;—Ted Kaptchuck, ''The Web That Has No Weaver''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These functions are aggregated and then associated with a primary functional entity - for instance, nourishment of the tissues and maintenance of their moisture are seen as connected functions, and the entity postulated to be responsible for these functions is xuě (blood)&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1984, p. 13 (table)&lt;/ref&gt; - but this is mainly a matter of stipulation, not anatomical insight.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For example, [the term] Xue is used rather than Blood, since the latter implies the blood of Western medicine, with its precise parameters of biochemistry and histiology. Although Xue and blood share some common attributes, fundamentally, Xue is a different concept.&quot; As seen at: Flaws 1984, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary functional entities used by traditional Chinese medicine are qì, xuě, the five zàng organs, the six fǔ organs, and the meridians which extend through the organ systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aung, S.K.H. 2007 p. 19&quot;&gt;Aung, S.K.H. &amp; Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 1-58890-221-8, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  These are all theoretically interconnected: each zàng organ is paired with a fǔ organ, which are nourished by the blood and concentrate qi for a particular function, with meridians being extensions of those functional systems throughout the body.

=== Qi ===
{{Main|Qi#Traditional Chinese medicine}}

TCM distinguishes not only one but several different kinds of qi (气).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aung, S.K.H. 2007 pp 11-12&quot;&gt;Aung, S.K.H. &amp; Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 1-58890-221-8, pp 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; In a general sense, qi is something that is defined by five &quot;cardinal functions&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;Aung, S.K.H. 2007 pp 11-12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'''氣的生理功能'''...(一)推動作用...(二)溫煦作用...(三)防御作用...(四)固攝作用...(五)氣化作用 ['''Physiological functions of qi''' ... 1.) Function of actuation ... 2.) Function of warming ... 3.) Function of defense ... 4.) Function of containment ... 5.) Function of transformation ...] as seen at {{cite web |url=http://www.zgxl.net/sljk/imgbody/zyrt/qi.htm |title=氣|author=郭卜樂|date=24t October 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Qi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Actuation (推動, tuīdòng) - of all physical processes in the body, especially the circulation of all body fluids such as blood in their vessels. This includes actuation of the functions of the zang-fu organs and meridians.
# Warming (溫煦, {{zh|p=wēnxù}}) - the body, especially the limbs.
# Defense (防御, {{zh|p=fángyù}}) - against Exogenous Pathogenic Factors
# Containment (固攝, {{zh|p=gùshè}}) - of body fluids, i.e. keeping blood, sweat, urine, semen etc. from leakage or excessive emission.
# Transformation (氣化, {{zh|p=qìhuà}}) - of food, drink, and breath into qi, xue, and [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Bodily fluids (Jinye)|jinye]] (“fluids”), and/or transformation of all of the latter into each other.
Vacuity of qi will especially be characterized by pale complexion, lassitude of spirit, lack of strength, spontaneous sweating, laziness to speak, non-digestion of food, shortness of breath (especially on exertion), and a pale and enlarged tongue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 142&quot;/&gt;

Qi is believed to be partially generated from food and drink, and partially from air (by breathing).&lt;ref name=&quot;yinyanghouse.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/what_is_qi#jing |title=What is Qi? Qi in TCM Acupuncture Theory |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another considerable part of it is inherited from the parents and will be consumed in the course of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;yinyanghouse.com&quot;/&gt;

In terms of location, TCM uses special terms for qi running inside of the blood vessels and for qi which is distributed in the skin, muscles, and tissues between those. The former is called yíng-qì  (營氣), its function is to complement xuè and its nature has a strong yin aspect (although qi in general is considered to be yang).&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Reninger&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taoism.about.com/od/qi/a/Qi_Forms.htm |title=Qi (Chi): Various Forms Used In Qigong &amp; Chinese Medicine - How Are The Major Forms Of Qi Created Within The Body? |author=Elizabeth Reninger |accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is called weì-qì  (衛氣), its main function is defence and it has pronounced yang nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Reninger&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Qi also circulates in the meridians. Just as the qi held by each of the zang-fu organs, this is considered to be part of the ‘’principal‘’ qi (元氣, {{zh|p=yuán qì}}) of the body&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...元氣生成後，通過三焦而流行分布於全身，內至髒腑，外達腠理肌膚...

=== Xue (blood) ===

In contrast to most of the other functional entities, xuě (血, &quot;blood&quot;) is correlated with a physical form - the red liquid running in the blood vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blood from a TCM Perspective&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its concept is, nevertheless, defined by its functions: nourishing all parts and tissues of the body, safeguarding an adequate degree of moisture,&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/blood_theory_and_disharmonies |title=The Concept of Blood (Xue) in TCM Acupuncture Theory |date=24 June 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sustaining and soothing both consciousness and sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blood from a TCM Perspective&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Typical symptoms of a lack of xuě (usually termed &quot;blood vacuity&quot; [血虚, {{zh|p=xuě xū}}}) are described as: Pale-white or whithered-yellow complexion, dizziness, flowery vision, palpitations, insomnia, numbness of the extremities; pale tongue; &quot;fine&quot; pulse.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jinye (bodily fluids) ====

Closely related to xuě are the jīnyė (津液, usually translated as ‘’body fluids‘’), and just like xuě they are considered to be yin in nature, and defined first and foremost by the functions of nurturing and moisturizing the different structures of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/theory/substances/jinye.cfm |title=Body Fluids (Yin Ye) |publisher=copyright 2001-2010 by Sacred Lotus Arts |accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their other functions are to harmonize yin and yang, and to help with secretion of waste products.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;三、津液的功能 ...（三）调节阴阳 ...（四）排泄废物 ...&quot; [3.)

Jīnyė are ultimately extracted from food and drink, and constitute the raw material for the production of xuě; conversely, xuě can also be transformed into jīnyė.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/theory/substances/jinye.cfm |title=Body Fluids (Yin Ye) |publisher=copyright 2001-2010 by Sacred Lotus Arts |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their palpable manifestations are all bodily fluids: tears, sputum, saliva, gastric juice, joint fluid, sweat, urine, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;津液包括各脏腑组织的正常体液和正常的分泌物，胃液、肠液、唾液、关节液等。习惯上也包括代谢产物中的尿、汗、泪等。&quot; [The (term) jinye comprises all physiological bodily fluids of the zang-fu and tissues, and physiological secretions, gastric juice, intestinal juice, saliva, joint fluid etc. Costumarily this also includes metabolic products like urine, sweat, and tears, etc.] As seen at: {{cite web |url=http://www.zysj.com.cn/lilunshuji/jichulilun/44-4-4.html |title=《中医基础理论》第四章 精、气、血、津液. 第四节 津液 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Basics of TCM theory.

=== The zang-fu ===
{{Main|Zang-fu}}

The '''zàng-fǔ''' ({{zh|s=脏腑|t=臟腑}}) constitute the centre piece of TCM's systematization of bodily functions. Bearing the names of organs, they are, however, only secondarily tied to (rudimental) [[anatomy|anatomical]] assumptions (the fǔ a little more, the zàng much less).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope4651.html |title= Cultural China - Chinese Medicine - Basic Zang Fu Theory |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are primarily defined by their functions,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1984, p.6: &quot;... the Zang Fu, the organ systems of TCM, do not refer so much to structures as to functions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaptchuk 2000, p. 76: &quot;The Chinese Liver is defined first by the activities associated with it, the Western liver by its physical structure&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; they are not equivalent to the anatomical organs - to highlight this fact, their names are usually capitalized.

The term zàng (脏) refers to the five entities considered to be yin in nature - [[Heart (Chinese medicine)|Heart]], [[Liver (Chinese medicine)|Liver]], [[Spleen (Chinese medicine)|Spleen]], [[Lung (Chinese medicine)|Lung]], [[Kidney (Chinese medicine)|Kidney]] -, while fǔ (腑) refers to the six yang organs - [[Small Intestine (Chinese medicine)|Small Intestine]], [[Large Intestine (Chinese medicine)|Large Intestine]], [[Gallbladder (Chinese medicine)|Gallbladder]], [[Urinary Bladder (Chinese medicine)|Urinary Bladder]], [[Stomach (Chinese medicine)|Stomach]] and [[San Jiao|Sānjiaō]].&lt;ref&gt;by citation from the [[Huangdi Neijing]]'s Suwen: ‘’言人身脏腑中阴阳，则脏者为阴，腑者为阳。‘’[Within the human body's zang-fu, there's yin and yang; the zang are yin, the fu are yang].

The zàng's essential functions consist in production and storage of qì and blood; in a wider sense they are stipulated to regulate digestion, breathing, water metabolism, the musculoskeletal system, the skin, the sense organs, aging, emotional processes, mental activity etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope4651.html |title= Cultural China - Chinese Medicine - Basic Zang Fu Theory |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fǔ organs' main purpose is merely to transmit and digest (传化, {{zh|p=chuán-huà}})&lt;ref&gt;&quot;六腑：胆、胃、小肠、大肠、膀胱、三焦；“传化物质”。 [The Six Fu: gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, bladder, sanjiao; &quot;transmit and digest&quot;] as seen at {{cite web |url=http://www.notedyy.com/news/html/?341.html |title=中医基础理论-脏腑学说 |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Basics of TCM theory - The zangfu concept}}&lt;/ref&gt; substances like waste, food, etc.

Since their concept was developed on the basis of [[Wu xing|Wǔ Xíng]] philosophy, each zàng is paired with a fǔ, and each zàng-fǔ pair is assigned to one of five elemental qualities (i.e., the Five Elements or Five Phases).&lt;ref&gt;Aung, S.K.H. &amp; Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 1-58890-221-8, pp 15-16&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; These correspondences are stipulated as:
* Fire (火) = Heart (心, {{zh|p=xīn}}) and Small Intestine (小肠, {{zh|p=xiaǒcháng}}) (and, secondarily, Sānjiaō [三焦, ‘’Triple Burner‘’] and Pericardium [心包, {{zh|p=xīnbaò}}])
* Earth (土) = Spleen (脾, {{zh|p=pí}}) and Stomach (胃, {{zh|p=weì}})
* Metal (金) = Lung (肺, {{zh|p=feì}}) and Large Intestine (大肠, {{zh|p=dàcháng}})
* Water (水) = Kidney (肾, {{zh|p=shèn}}) and Bladder (膀胱, {{zh|p=pǎngguāng}})
* Wood (木) = Liver (肝, {{zh|p=gān}}) and Gallbladder (胆, {{zh|p=dān}})

The zàng-fǔ are also connected to the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)#Twelve standard meridians|twelve standard meridians]] - each yang meridian is attached to a fǔ organ and five of the yin meridians are attached to a zàng. As there are only five zàng but six yin meridians, the sixth is assigned to the [[Pericardium (Chinese medicine)|Pericardium]], a peculiar entity almost similar to the Heart zàng.&lt;ref&gt;Aung, S.K.H. &amp; Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 1-58890-221-8, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meridians ===
[[File:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|Acupuncture chart from the [[Ming Dynasty]] (c. 1368-1644)|200px]]
{{Main|Meridian (Chinese medicine)}}

The meridians (经络, {{zh|p=jīng-luò}}) are believed to be channels running from the
zàng-fǔ in the interior (里, {{zh|p=lǐ}}) of the body to the limbs and joints (&quot;the surface&quot; [表, {{zh|p=biaǒ}}]), transporting qi and xuĕ (blood).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;经络是运行全身气血，联络脏腑肢节，沟通表里上下内外，...&quot; [The jingluo transport qi and blood through the whole body, connecting the zang-fu with limbs and joints, connecting interior with surface, up with down, inside with outside ...] as seen at {{cite web |url=http://www.diyifanwen.com/kaoshizhuanti/fuxizhidao1/0781614101641980_497.htm |title=中医基础理论辅导：经络概念及经络学说的形成: 经络学说的形成 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |language=Chinese |trans_title=guide to basic TCM theory: the jing-luo concept and the emergence of jing-luo theory: the emergence of jing-luo theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aung, S.K.H. &amp; Chen, W.P.D.

=== Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment ===
One of many classifications of symptoms that appear in the various translations and versions of the [[materia medica]] is by what is believed to be classes of symptoms based on the theoretical framework, which is not necessarily adopted by all schools. The following ordering is by one version of about 30 symptom categories, and often appears under ordering in other ways such as by temperature and moisture, or by what are believed to be five planets, elements, phases, spirits, and directions.&lt;ref name= THCKO&gt;[http://www.ancientway.com/articles/tcmherbcategories.html Traditional Chinese Herbal Categories, Kevin O'Neil]&lt;/ref&gt; The skin is considered a defensive shield  and to allow in pathogens, causing allergies, cold and flu. “Warm exterior” substances are believed to treat such ailments resulting in “warm” related symptoms, such as sweat from fever.&lt;ref name= THCKO/&gt; “Cold exterior” symptoms are feeling of chills, sore throat, and a runny nose; the associated substances are believed to induce perspiration and treat these ailments.&lt;ref name= THCKO/&gt; “Heat” symptoms are associated with fever; “clear heat” substances are believed to be anti-infective agents, “drain “fire” substances refers to those for extreme fever, “cool the blood heat” substances for long-term fever, “dry dampness heat” for  fever and infection with yellow or green phlegm or diarrhea, “toxicity” for symptoms such as boils and rashes or foul-smelling diarrhea – believed to be caused by other toxins, and “relieve summer heat” believed to be related to parasitic infection by fresh summer food or summer mosquitoes; [[sweet wormwood]] is often cited as one of these. “Downward draining” substances refers to what are believed to be laxatives, and include “purgatives”, of which [[rhubarb]] root and aloe are believed to work, “moist” laxatives believed to include marijuana (‘’[[Cannabis sativa]]’’) seeds for “dry-type” constipation such as in the elderly and malnourished, “harsh expellants” which are semi-toxic substances believed to cause “explosive” diarrhea, “drain dampness” substances that are believed to increase the flow of urine ([[diuretics]]), which is believed under TCM to relieve water retention and “swelling”, such as due to infection or bruising, as well as being believed to treat fatigue, phlegm, and heavy feelings that may be associated with mold induced allergies.&lt;ref name= THCKO/&gt; For swelling or pain believed to be due to dampness in the weather such as arthritis, “wind dampness” reducing drugs are believed to be effective, such as silkworm feces,  skins such as snake skin, and bones – such as tiger bone, dog bone, and cat bone.
--&gt;

== Concept of disease ==

In general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 77&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Therapy is based on which &quot;pattern of disharmony&quot; can be identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 19, p. 148&quot;&gt;Ergil et al. 19, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, p. 1&quot;&gt;Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, &quot;pattern discrimination&quot; is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 19, p. 148&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, p. 1&quot;/&gt; It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.&lt;ref&gt;Flaws 1990, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.&lt;ref&gt;“Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine”, Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maciocia&gt;{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: &quot;Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.&quot;.&lt;ref name=Deadman&gt;Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji. [http://www.jcm.co.uk/product/catalog/product/view/7937/some-acupuncture-points-which-treat-disorders-of-blood/ &quot;Some acupuncture points which treat disorders of blood&quot;], ''[[Journal of Chinese Medicine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He might then go on to prescribe treatments designed to cool the liver or supplement the lungs.

=== Disease entities ===

In TCM, a disease has two aspects: &quot;bìng&quot; and &quot;zhèng&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Clavey 1995, p. xxx (30 of the introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; The former is often translated as &quot;disease entity&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146&quot;/&gt; &quot;disease category&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Flaws 1990, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;illness&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; or simply &quot;diagnosis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; The latter, and more important one, is usually translated as &quot;pattern&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146&quot;&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flaws 1990, p. 7&quot;&gt;Flaws 1990, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; (or sometimes also as &quot;syndrome&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;). For example, the disease entity of a common cold might present with a pattern of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#The Six Excesses|wind-cold]] in one patient, and with the pattern of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#The Six Excesses|wind-heat]] in another.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From a scientific point of view, most of the disease entitites (病, {{zh|p=bìng}}) listed by TCM constitute mere symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146&quot;/&gt; Examples include headache, cough, abdominal pain, constipation etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since therapy will not be chosen according to the disease entity but according to the pattern, two patients with the same disease entity but different patterns will receive different therapy. Vice versa, patients with similar patterns might receive similar therapy even if their disease entities are different. This is called 异病同治，同病异治 ({{zh|p=yì bìng tóng zhì, tóng bìng yì zhì}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, p. 1&quot;/&gt; &quot;different diseases, same treatment; same disease, different treatments&quot;).

=== Patterns ===

In TCM, &quot;pattern&quot; (证, {{zh|p=zhèng}}) refers to a &quot;pattern of disharmony&quot; or &quot;functional disturbance&quot; within the functional entities the TCM model of the body is composed of.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 122: &quot;... Chinese medicine does not diagnose a disease, but rather a 'pattern of disharmony'... the concept of disharmony ... refers to the functional disturbance of any bowel, viscus, or vital substance.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; There are disharmony patterns of qi, xuě, the body fluids, the zàng-fǔ, and the meridians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clavey 1995, p. xxxi&quot;&gt;Clavey 1995, p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; They are ultimately defined by their symptoms and &quot;signs&quot; (i.e., for example, pulse and tongue findings).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The ground, however, is the total pattern. The ground is made up of all the other signs and symptoms that are not necessarily pathognomonic of the diagnosed disease.&quot; As seen at: Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In clinical practise, the identified pattern usually involves a combination of affected entities&lt;ref name=&quot;Flaws 1990, p. 8&quot;&gt;Flaws 1990, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; (compare with [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Typical examples of patterns|typical examples of patterns]]). The concrete pattern identified should account for ''all'' the symptoms a patient has.&lt;ref&gt;Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Six Excesses ====

The Six Excesses (六淫, {{zh|p=liù yín}},&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also translated as &quot;Pathogenic Factors&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=WbThUt45ZXgC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=tcm+six&amp;hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&amp;q=tcm%20six&amp;f=false|title=Foundations for integrative musculoskeletal medicine: an east-west approach|author=Marcus &amp; Kuchera|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=2004|accessdate=22 March 2011}} p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Six Pernicious Influences&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 39&quot;&gt;Ross 1984, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; with the alternative term of  六邪, {{zh|p=liù xié}}, - &quot;Six Evils&quot; or &quot;Six Devils&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 27&quot;&gt;Ross 1984, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;) are allegorical terms used to describe disharmony patterns displaying certain typical symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88: &quot;The six evils are not detected in a lab, but are known through distinctive signs.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms resemble the effects of six climatic factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 39&quot;/&gt; In the allegory, these symptoms can occur because one or more of those climatic factors (called 六气, {{zh|p=liù qì}}, &quot;the six qi&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deng 1999 , p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;) were able to invade the body surface and to proceed to the interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88&quot;&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes used to draw causal relationships (i.e., prior exposure to wind/cold/etc. is identified as the cause of a disease),&lt;ref&gt;Deng 1999, p. 185: &quot;Or, abnormal changes in the weather, at inappropriate times for that weather condition, can cause the emergence of disease.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while other authors explicitly deny a direct cause-effect relationship between weather conditions and disease,&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88:&quot;Whether the patient had a specific encounter with a cold wind shortly before the onset of the symptoms is not necessarily relevant.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1984, p. 39: &quot;The situation is not so much a linear chain of cause and effect,...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that the Six Excesses are primarily descriptions of a certain combination of symptoms&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88: &quot;It is the patient's presentation that determines the nature of the evil.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; translated into a pattern of disharmony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 39&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is undisputed, though, that the Six Excesses can manifest inside the body without an external cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 79&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, they might be denoted &quot;internal&quot;, e.g., &quot;internal wind&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 79&quot;/&gt; or &quot;internal fire (or heat)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Six Excesses and their characteristic clinical signs are:
# Wind (风, {{zh|p=fēng}}): rapid onset of symptoms, wandering location of symptoms, itching, nasal congestion, &quot;floating&quot; pulse;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deng 1999, p. 186&quot;&gt;Deng 1999, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; tremor, paralysis, convulsion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88&quot;/&gt;
# Cold (寒, {{zh|p=hàn}}): cold sensations, aversion to cold, relief of symptoms by warmth, watery/clear excreta, severe pain, abdominal pain, contracture/hypertonicity of muscles, (slimy) white tongue fur, &quot;deep&quot;/&quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;string-like&quot; pulse,&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, pp. 80 &amp; 142&lt;/ref&gt; or slow pulse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 38&quot;&gt;Ross 1984, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
# Fire/Heat (火, {{zh|p=huǒ}}): aversion to heat, high fever, thirst, concentrated urine, red face, red tongue, yellow tongue fur, rapid pulse.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; (Fire and heat are basically seen to be the same)&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 80&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;
# Dampness (湿, {{zh|p=shī}}): sensation of heaviness, sensation of fullness, symptoms of Spleen dysfunction, greasy tongue fur, &quot;slippery&quot; pulse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 38&quot;/&gt;
# Dryness (燥, {{zh|p=zaò}}): dry cough, dry mouth, dry throat, dry lips, nosebleeds, dry skin, dry stools.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;
# Summerheat (署, {{zh|p=shǔ}}): either heat or mixed damp-heat symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
Six-Excesses-patterns can consist of only one or a combination of Excesses (e.g., wind-cold, wind-damp-heat).&lt;ref name=&quot;Deng 1999, p. 186&quot;/&gt; They can also transform from one into another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deng 1999, p. 186&quot;/&gt;

==== Typical examples of patterns ====

For each of the functional entities (qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc.), typical disharmony patterns are recognized; for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt; blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xuĕ;&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman % Ellis 1996, p. 147-150&lt;/ref&gt; Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen zàng;&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 139 (table)&lt;/ref&gt; wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.&lt;ref&gt;Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, p. 169-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
TCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Flaws &amp; Finney 1996, pp. 9-133, 137-151, 169-174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, pp. 145 et sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* &quot;Upflaming Liver fire&quot; (肝火上炎, {{zh|p=gānhuǒ shàng yán}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden tinnitus or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, irascibility, impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Basic principles of pattern discrimination ====

The process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called 辩证 ({{zh|p=biàn zhèng}}, usually translated as &quot;pattern diagnosis&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;pattern identification&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;pattern discrimination&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flaws 1990, p. 7&quot;/&gt;). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the &quot;Eight Principles&quot; (八纲, {{zh|p=bā gāng}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;
These eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&quot;/&gt; Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&quot;/&gt; The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&quot;/&gt; In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:
* ''Exterior'' (表, {{zh|p=biaǒ}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body - skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 128&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a &quot;floating&quot; pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 128&quot;/&gt;
* ''Interior'' (里, {{zh|p=lǐ}})refers to disease manifestation in the zàng-fǔ, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.&lt;ref&gt;Deng 1999, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected zàng or fǔ entity.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Cold'' (寒, {{zh|p=hàn}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 132&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 132&quot;/&gt;
* ''Heat'' (热, {{zh|p=rè}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 141&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Vacuity'' (虚, {{zh|p=xū}}) often referred to as &quot;deficiency&quot;, can be further differentiated into vacuity of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Qi|qi]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Blood (Xue)|xuě]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|Yin vacuity]] can also be termed &quot;vacuity-heat&quot;, while [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yang vacuity]] is equivalent to &quot;vacuity-cold&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kaptchuck 2000, pp. 230-231&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Repletion'' (实, {{zh|p=shí}}) often called &quot;excess&quot;, generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a vacuity pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...if it not that the right is vacous, then it is that the evil is replete.&quot; As seen at: Deng 1999, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; or a pattern of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#stagnation|stagnation]] (of qi, xuě, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Tierra &amp; Tierra 1998, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; In a concurrent exterior pattern, repletion is characterized by the absence of sweating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 141&quot;/&gt; The signs and symptoms of repletion-cold patterns are equivalent to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#The Six Excesses|cold excess]] patterns, and repletion-heat is similar to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#The Six Excesses|heat excess]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, pp. 80, 142, 193, 197&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Yin and yang]]'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 138&quot;&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 138&quot;/&gt; Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 138&quot;/&gt; Exceptions are [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|vacuity-cold]] and [[Traditional Chinese medicine#The Six Excesses|repletion-heat]] patterns, who are sometimes referred to as &quot;yin patterns&quot; and &quot;yang patterns&quot; respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 138&quot;/&gt;

After the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&quot;/&gt; By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For instance, if by eight-principle pattern identification a heat pattern is detected, qi-blood pattern identification will show whether the heat is located in the blood or qi; organ pattern identification will determine what organ or organs are affected; and disease-evil pattern identification will identify any evil present.&quot; As seen at: Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; This evaluation can be done

==== Considerations of disease causes ====

Although TCM and its concept of disease do not strongly differentiate between cause and effect,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1984, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; pattern discrimination can include considerations regarding the disease cause; this is called 病因辩证 ({{zh|p=bìngyīn biàn zhèng}}, &quot;disease-cause pattern discrimination&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Flaws 1990, p. 8&quot;/&gt;

There are three fundamental categories of disease causes (三因, {{zh|p=sān yīn}}) recognized:&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 77&quot;/&gt;
# external causes: these include the Six Excesses and &quot;Pestilential Qi&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 77&quot;/&gt;
# internal causes: the &quot;Seven Affects&quot; (七情, {{zh|p=qì qíng}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 77&quot;/&gt; sometimes also translated as &quot;Seven Emotions&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 40&quot;&gt;Ross 1984, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;) - joy, anger, pensiveness, sorrow, fear, fright and grief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross 1984, p. 40&quot;/&gt; These are believed to be able to cause damage to the functions of the zàng-fú, especially of the Liver.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;
# non-external-non-internal causes: dietary irregularities (especially: too much raw, cold, spicy, fatty or sweet food; voracious eating; too much alcohol),&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; fatigue, sexual intemperance, trauma, and parasites (虫, {{zh|p=chóng}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiseman &amp; Ellis 1996, p. 77&quot;/&gt;

Traditional Chinese medicines are made from plants and herbs, and occasionally from organ meats or other substances. Medicinals are typically constructed from a number of materials designed - according to its theory - to stimulate certain organ systems or to balance out the undesired aspects of other materials used.  These are often provided in dried form to be steeped into a tea, though practitioners may suggest them as dietary changes instead - adding certain organ meats or herbs to meals, for instance - or they may be powdered and used in pill form.  There are roughly 13,000 medicinals used in China and over 100,000 medicinal recipes recorded in the ancient literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Certainprogress&quot;&gt;Certain progress of clinical research on Chinese integrative medicine, Keji Chen, Bei Yu, Chinese Medical Journal, 1999,  112 (10), p. 934, [http://wenku.baidu.com/view/dfc192a0b0717fd5360cdc44.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Some conceptions of the theory believe that toxicity is needed to fight pathogens in the body, similar to [[homeopathy]],&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Materia Medica, Zhang E.Q., 1988, Publishing House of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine pg 2-195&lt;/ref&gt; so chemicals considered to be toxic are used in some preparations.

|[[Ginger|Ginger root]] ''[[Zingiber officinale]]'') has been used in China for over 2,000 years under a belief that it aids digestion and treats upset stomach, diarrhea, and nausea. TCM also teaches that it helps treat arthritis, colic, diarrhea, and heart conditions. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that it treats the common cold, flu-like symptoms, headaches, and [[menstrual cramp]]s. Today, health care professionals commonly recommend to help prevent or treat nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, pregnancy, and cancer chemotherapy.

|[[Ginseng]]
|[[Ginseng]] root is the most widely sold traditional Chinese medicine.  The name &quot;ginseng&quot; is used to refer to both American ([[Panax quinquefolius]]) and Asian or Korean ginseng ([[Panax ginseng]]), which belong to the species Panax and have a similar chemical makeup. Siberian ginseng or Eleuthero ([[Eleutherococcus senticosus]]) is another type of plant. Asian ginseng has a light tan, gnarled root that often looks like a human body with stringy shoots for arms and legs. In ancient times, herbalists thought that because of the way ginseng looks it could treat many different kinds of syndromes, from fatigue and stress to asthma and cancer. In traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng was often combined with other herbs and used often to bring longevity, strength, and mental alacrity to its users.  Asian ginseng is believed to enhance the immune system in preventing and treating infection and disease. Several clinical studies report that Asian ginseng can improve immune function. Studies have found that ginseng seems to increase the number of immune cells in the blood, and improve the immune system's response to a flu vaccine. In one study, 227 participants received either ginseng or placebo for 12 weeks, with a flu shot administered after 4 weeks. The number of colds and flu were two-thirds lower in the group that took ginseng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/asian-ginseng-000249.htm |title=Asian ginseng |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2009-03-22 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;|

|[[Willow|Salix genus plants]] were used since the time of [[Hippocrates]] (400 BC) when patients were advised to chew on the bark to reduce fever and inflammation. Willow bark has been used throughout the centuries in China and Europe to the present for the treatment of pain (particularly low back pain and [[osteoarthritis]]), [[headache]], and inflammatory conditions such as [[bursitis]] and [[tendinitis]]. The bark of white willow contains salicin, which is a chemical similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). It is thought to be responsible for the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of the herb. In the 1829, salicin was used to develop aspirin. White willow appears to be slower than aspirin to bring pain relief, but its effects may last longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/willow-bark-000281.htm |title=Willow bark |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficacy ===

Regarding Traditional Chinese herbal therapy, only few trials of adequate methodology exist and its effectiveness therefore remains poorly documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&amp;db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;term=36%5Bvolume%5D%20AND%205%5Bissue%5D%20AND%201086%5Bpage%5D%20AND%202007%5Bpdat%5D|title=Placebo-controlled trials of Chinese herbal medicine and conventional medicine comparative study|author=Shang A. et al.|publisher=PubMed.org for Int.J.Epidemol.|date=29 June 2007|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pills and powders ===

The TCM industry traditionally supplied medicines as powders to be measured and/or compounded by individual practitioners. More recently, [[soluble]] granules and [[tablets]] have become available with specific dosage levels. Modern formulations in [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s and sachets used 675 [[plant]] and [[fungi]] ingredients and about 25 from non-plant sources such as [[snakes]], [[geckos]], [[toads]], [[frogs]], [[bees]], and [[earthworms]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Ecological impacts of use of medicines ===

Animal products are used in certain Chinese preparations, which may disturb [[conservationist]]s, [[vegan]]s and [[vegetarians]]. If informed of such restrictions, practitioners can often use alternative substances.

The practice of using [[endangered species]] is controversial within TCM. Modern Materia Medicas such as Bensky, Clavey and Stoger's comprehensive Chinese herbal text discuss substances derived from endangered species in an appendix, emphasizing alternatives.&lt;ref name=Bensky_Clavey_Stoger&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Herbal Medicine Material Medica (3rd Edition)|last=Bensky, Clavey and Stoger|publisher=Eastland Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[animal rights]] movement claims that traditional Chinese medicinal solutions still use [[bear bile]] (xíong dǎn). In 1988, the Chinese Ministry of Health started controlling bile production, which previously used bears killed before winter. Now bears are fitted with a sort of permanent [[catheter]], which was more profitable than killing the bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;治人病还是救熊命——对养熊“引流熊胆”的思考&quot;南风窗. November 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment itself and especially the extraction of the bile is very painful, and damages their stomach and intestines, often resulting in their eventual death. Increased international attention has mostly stopped the use of bile outside of China; gallbladders from butchered cattle (niú dǎn / 牛膽 / 牛胆) are recommended as a substitute for this ingredient.

Medicinal use is impacting [[seahorse]] populations.

Ecological effects are greater than just on the species used in TCM. The worldwide shark population has been devastated to a small fraction of its original population by a growing demand for shark fin soup. Sharks fins are cut off and the live shark which is then dumped back in the ocean to sink and slowly die. Once considered only for rare occasions, with a growing Asian middle class, there is an accompanying demand for shark fin. Sharks take many years to mature to give birth. The problem does not only affect sharks. Since sharks are the top predator in the food chain, the impact on shark populations threatens to throw the entire marine ecosystem out of balance, with an unpredictable	outcome.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 3-6-2011, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture is often accompanied by [[moxibustion]], which involves burning [[mugwort]] on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.&lt;ref name=MAT/&gt; There are three methods of moxibustion: Direct scarring, direct non-scarring, and indirect moxibustion.

[[Auriculotherapy]] (耳灼疗法/耳燭療法) applies acupuncture or moxibustion to the ear.  It is believed that a part of the ear (the [[auricle]]) is a microsystem with the entire body represented on it.

=== Cupping ===

[[Fire cupping|Cupping]] (拔罐) is a type of Chinese massage, consisting of placing several glass &quot;cups&quot; (open spheres) on the body. A match is lit and placed inside the cup and then removed before placing the cup against the skin. As the air in the cup is heated, it expands, and after placing in the skin, cools, creating lower pressure inside the cup that allows the cup to stick to the skin via [[suction]]. When combined with massage oil, the cups can be slid around the back, offering &quot;reverse-pressure massage&quot;.===
=== ''Die-da'' or ''Tieh Ta'' ===
''Die-da'' or ''Tieh Ta'' (跌打) is usually practiced by martial artists who know aspects of Chinese medicine that apply to the treatment of [[Physical trauma|trauma]] and injuries such as bone fractures, sprains, and bruises. Some of these specialists may also use or recommend other disciplines of Chinese medical therapies (or Western medicine in modern times) if serious injury is involved. Such practice of bone-setting (整骨) is not common in the West.

=== Gua Sha ===

[[Gua Sha]] (“to lift up for cholera”, or “to scrape for cholera”) is abrading the skin with pieces of smooth jade, bone, animal tusks or horns or smooth stones; until red spots then bruising cover the area to which it is done. It is believed that this treatment is for almost any ailment including cholera. The red spots and bruising take 3 to 10 days to heal. It is believed that most people can tolerate the pain of treatment, but there is often some soreness in the area that has been treated.&lt;ref&gt;Gua Sha, Guasha.com, Arya Nielsen, Fellow - National Academy of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, former Chair of the New York State Board for Acupuncture, [http://www.guasha.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmwell.com/TCMNaturalTherapy/GuashaCupping/GuaSha-Treatment-of-Disease.html |title=GuaSha Treatment of Disease |publisher=Tcmwell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechifarm.com/legacy/acupuncture_treatment/pdf/gua_sha.pdf |title=Gua Sha: A Clinical Overview, Arya Nielson, Chinese Medicine Times |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The effect of Gua Sha treatment on the microcirculation of surface tissue: a pilot study in healthy subjects, A Nielsen, N Knoblauch, GJ Dobos, [http://explorejournal.com/retrieve/pii/S1550830707001772]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical Qigong exercises ===

Physical Qigong exercises such as [[Tai chi chuan]] (Taijiquan 太极拳/太極拳), Standing Meditation (站樁功), [[Yoga]], [[Brocade BaDuanJin]] exercises (八段锦/八段錦) and other [[Chinese martial arts]].

=== Breathing and meditation exercise ===

[[Qigong]] (气功/氣功) and related breathing and meditation exercise.

=== Massage ===

[[Tui na]] (推拿) massage: a form of massage akin to [[acupressure]] (from which [[shiatsu]] evolved). Oriental massage is typically administered with the patient fully clothed, without the application of grease or oils. Choreography often involves thumb presses, rubbing, percussion, and stretches.

=== Fengshui aesthetics and Chinese astrology ===

TCM doctors may also incorporate beliefs about the alignment of buildings with [[Chinese astrology|astrological]] bodies such as the sun ([[Fengshui]] aesthetics, 风水/風水), or [[Four Pillars of Destiny|astrological beliefs about the year, month, date, and hour of birth]]. Astrological considerations such planting a plant on the solstice or in the correct location ([[Di Dao Yao Cai]]) are believed to be important as to a medicine's effectiveness or toxicity.&lt;ref name=YTHF&gt;Yang Tianhui: Notes from My Visit to the Fuzi Growing Area of Zhangming County (Song Dynasty, 1099 CE), , Heiges=245–56 |pmid=18240287 |doicalchinesemedicine.org/2010/12/yang-tianhui-notes-from-my-visit-to-the-fuzi-growing-area-of-zhangming-county-song-dynasty-1099-ce/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IOA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalchinesemedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fruehauf_fuziinterview1.pdf |title='&amp;#39;&quot;The Importance of Aconite (fuzi)&quot;'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Four Pillars of Destiny]] ([[Bazi]], 八字) are the four components believed under TCM to create a person's destiny or fate. The four components within the moment of birth are the year, the month, the day, and the hour, and are used alongside fortune telling practices such as [[Zǐ wēi dòu shù]] within the realm of [[Chinese Astrology]] as part of diagnosing patients or considerations about medicines.&lt;ref name=Matuk2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=YTHF/&gt;&lt;ref name=AACS&gt;''Traditional Chinese Medicine'', [http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/ManualHealingandPhysicalTouch/acupuncture Acupuncture, American Cancer Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;[[Felix Mann]], quoted in {{cite journal |first=M |last=Bauer |url=http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 |journal=Chinese Medicine Times |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=31 |year=2006 |title=The Final Days of Traditional Beliefs? - Part One}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =TorT&gt;''Trick or Treatment'', [[#Singh2008|Singh &amp; Ernst]], 2008, [http://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&amp;pg=PA70 70-73]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of acupuncture probably dates back to the [[stone age]], as suggested by findings of ancient stone needles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiu, M 1993 p. 2&quot;&gt;Chiu, M (1993). Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion. Elsevier Health Sciences. p. 2. ISBN 0443042233&lt;/ref&gt; Also, hieroglyphs and pictographs documenting acupuncture and moxibustion have been found which are dating back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600-1100 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson, T 2004 pp. 90&quot;&gt;Robson, T (2004). An Introduction to Complementary Medicine. Allen &amp; Unwin. pp. 90. ISBN 1741140544&lt;/ref&gt;

When acupuncture (and herbal medicine) became integrated into an embracing medical theory system is difficult to judge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} TCM theory is, however, inextricably intertwined with the principles of [[Hundred Schools of Thought#School of Yin-yang|Yinyangism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;see [[Huangdi Neijing|''Huang neijing Suwen'']], chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; which was represented for the first time by [[Zou Yan|Zōu Yǎn]] (340 - 260 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zou Yan&quot;/&gt;

The earliest and most fundamental composition identified in TCM is the ''[[Huangdi Neijing|Huăngdì Neìjīng]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;cultural-china.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope3138.html|title=The Medical Classic of the Yellow Emperor|publisher=cultural-china.com|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (黄帝内经, ''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon''), probably dating back to the second century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Gwei-djen and Joseph Needham (1980). Celestial Lancets: A History and Rationale of Acupuncture and Moxa. New York, NY: Routledge/Curzon. pp. 88-89.ISBN 0-7007-1458-8&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, it was composed by the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]] (said to have lived 2697 - 2597 BC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Yellow_Emperor.aspx &quot;Yellow Emperor.&quot;] ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition. 2008. Encyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of a dialogue with his ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultural-china.com&quot;/&gt;

Mythical origin was also claimed regarding the ''[[Shennong Ben Cao Jing|Shénnóng Běn Cǎo Jīng]]'' (神农本草经, ''Shennong's [[Materia Medica]]'') - it traditionally was attributed to the legendary emperor [[Shennong|Shénnóng]] (神农, lit. &quot;Divine Farmer&quot;), said to have lived around 2800 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shennong 神农&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/196Kaleidoscope8524.html|title=Shennong 神农|publisher=cultural-china.com|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original text has been lost, however, there are extant translations.&lt;ref&gt;Du Halde J-B (1736): Description géographique, historique etc. de la Chine, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; The true date of origin is believed to fall into the late Western Han dynasty&lt;ref name=&quot;Shennong 神农&quot;/&gt; (i.e., the first century BC).

Apart from the Huăngdì Neìjīng and Shénnóng's Materia Medica, the foundational texts of TCM also include two other books: the [[Shang Han Lun|Shāng Hán Zá Bìng Lùn]] and the [[Nan Jing (Chinese medicine)|Nán Jīng]].&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The Nán Jīng was probably compiled in the first or second century AD and it attributed to [[Bian Que]].&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first text to discuss the systematic application of Huăngdì Neìjīng theories to the practice of medicine, and highlights practical aspects of acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Shāng Hán Zá Bìng Lùn was written by [[Zhang Zhongjing]] around 200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Very clinically oriented, it is the earliest text to emphasize physical signs and symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Herbal medicine is the main method of treatment discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Having gone through numerous changes over time, it today appears in two volumes: the [[Shang Han Lun|Shāng Hán Lùn]] and the [[Jingui Yaolue|Jīnguì Yàolüè]].&lt;ref&gt;Ergil et al. 2009, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''chemical bond''' is an attraction between [[atom]]s  that allows the formation of [[chemical substance]]s that contain two or more atoms. The bond is caused by the [[electromagnetic force]] attraction between opposite charges, either between [[electrons]] and [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], or as the result of a [[dipole]] attraction. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are &quot;strong bonds&quot; such as [[covalent bond|covalent]] or [[ionic bond]]s and &quot;weak bonds&quot; such as [[intermolecular force#Dipole-dipole interations|dipole-dipole interactions]], the [[London dispersion force]]  and [[hydrogen bonding]]. 

Since opposite charges attract via a simple [[electromagnetic force]], the negatively charged [[electrons]] orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged [[protons]] in the nucleus attract each other. Also, an electron positioned between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them. Thus, the most stable configuration of nuclei and electrons is one in which the electrons spend more time ''between'' nuclei, than anywhere else in space. These electrons cause the nuclei to be attracted to each other, and this attraction results in the bond. However, this assembly cannot collapse to a size dictated by the volumes of these individual particles. Due to the [[matter wave]] nature of electrons and their smaller mass, they occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the nuclei, and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei relatively far apart, as compared with the size of the nuclei themselves. 

In general, strong chemical bonding is associated with the sharing or transfer of electrons between the participating atoms. The atoms in [[molecule]]s, [[crystal]]s, [[metal]]s and diatomic gases— indeed most of the physical environment around us— are held together by chemical bonds, which dictate the [[structure]] of matter.
[[Image:electron dot.svg|300px|thumb|right|Examples of [[Lewis dot]]-style chemical bonds between [[carbon]] ''C'', [[hydrogen]] ''H'', and [[oxygen]] ''O''.  Lewis dot depictures represent an early attempt to describe chemical bonding and are still widely used today.]]

==Overview of main types of chemical bonds==
In the simplest view of a so-called [[covalent bond|''covalent'' bond]], one or more electrons (often a pair of electrons) are drawn into the space between the two atomic nuclei.  Here the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positive charges of ''both'' nuclei, instead of just their own. This overcomes the repulsion between the two positively charged nuclei of the two atoms, and so this overwhelming attraction holds the two nuclei in a fixed configuration of equilibrium, even though they will still vibrate at equilibrium position. In summary, covalent bonding involves sharing of electrons in which the positively charged nuclei of two or more atoms simultaneously attract the negatively charged electrons that are being shared. In a [[polar covalent bond]], one or more electrons are unequally shared between two nuclei.

In a simplified view of an [[ionic bond|''ionic'' bond]], the bonding electron is not shared at all, but transferred. In this type of bond, the outer [[atomic orbital]] of one atom has a vacancy which allows addition of one or more electrons. These newly added electrons potentially occupy a lower energy-state (effectively closer to more nuclear charge) than they experience in a different atom. Thus, one nucleus offers a more tightly bound position to an electron than does another nucleus, with the result that one atom may transfer an electron to the other. This transfer causes one atom to assume a net positive charge, and the other to assume a net negative charge. The ''bond'' then results from electrostatic attraction between atoms, and the atoms become positive or negatively charged [[ion]]s.

The last and rarely mentioned type of bonding is [[metallic bond|''metallic'' bond]].

All bonds can be explained by quantum theory, but, in practice, simplification rules allow chemists to predict the strength, directionality, and polarity of bonds. The [[octet rule]] and [[VSEPR theory]] are two examples.  More sophisticated theories are [[valence bond theory]] which includes [[orbital hybridization]] and [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]], and the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]] which includes [[ligand field theory]]. [[Electrostatics]] are used to describe bond polarities and the effects they have on chemical substances.

==History==
{{Main|History of chemistry|History of the molecule}}

Early speculations into the nature of the '''chemical bond''', from as early as the 12th century, supposed that certain types of [[chemical species]] were joined by a type of [[chemical affinity]].  In 1704, [[Isaac Newton]] famously outlined his atomic bonding theory, in &quot;Query 31&quot; of his [[Opticks]], whereby [[atom]]s attach to each other by some &quot;[[force]]&quot;.  Specifically, after acknowledging the various popular theories in vogue at the time, of how atoms were reasoned to attach to each other, i.e. &quot;hooked atoms&quot;, &quot;glued together by rest&quot;, or &quot;stuck together by conspiring motions&quot;, Newton states that he would rather infer from their cohesion, that &quot;particles attract one another by some [[force]], which in immediate contact is exceedingly strong, at small distances performs the chemical operations, and reaches not far from the particles with any sensible effect.&quot;

In 1819, on the heels of the invention of the [[voltaic pile]], [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] developed a theory of chemical combination stressing the electronegative and electropositive character of the combining atoms.  By the mid 19th century, [[Edward Frankland]], F.A. Kekule, A.S. Couper, A.M. Butlerov, and [[Hermann Kolbe]], building on the [[Radical (chemistry)|theory of radicals]], developed the [[Valence (chemistry)|theory of valency]], originally called &quot;combining power&quot;, in which compounds were joined owing to an attraction of positive and negative poles.  In 1916, chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] developed the concept of the [[Covalent bond|electron-pair bond]], in which two atoms may share one to six electrons, thus forming the [[single electron bond]], a [[single bond]], a [[double bond]], or a [[triple bond]]; in Lewis's own words, &quot;An electron may form a part of the shell of two different atoms and cannot be said to belong to either one exclusively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Gilbert N.|authorlink=Gilbert N. Lewis|year=1916|title=The Atom and the Molecule|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=38|page=772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, [[Walther Kossel]] put forward a theory similar to Lewis' only his model assumed complete transfers of electrons between atoms, and was thus a model of [[ionic bond]]s.  Both Lewis and Kossel structured their bonding models on that of [[Abegg's rule]] (1904).

In 1927, the first mathematically complete quantum description of a simple chemical bond, i.e. that produced by one electron in the hydrogen molecular ion, [[Dihydrogen cation|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], was derived by the Danish physicist Oyvind Burrau.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book| author=Laidler, K. J. |year=1993|title=The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press | page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work showed that the quantum approach to chemical bonds could be fundamentally and quantitatively correct, but the mathematical methods used could not be extended to molecules containing more than one electron. A more practical, albeit less quantitative, approach was put forward in the same year by [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]]. The Heitler-London method forms the basis of what is now called [[valence bond theory]].  In 1929, the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]] (LCAO) approximation was introduced by [[Sir John Lennard-Jones]], who also suggested methods to derive electronic structures of molecules of F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[fluorine]]) and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[oxygen]]) molecules, from basic quantum principles. This [[molecular orbital]] theory represented  a covalent bond as an orbital formed by combining the quantum mechanical [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger]] atomic orbitals which had been hypothesized for electrons in single atoms. The equations for bonding electrons in multi-electron atoms could not be solved to mathematical perfection (i.e., ''analytically''), but approximations for them still gave many good qualitative predictions and results.  Most quantitative calculations in modern [[quantum chemistry]] use either valence bond or molecular orbital theory as a starting point, although a third approach, [[Density Functional Theory]], has become increasingly popular in recent years.

In 1935, H. H. James and A. S. Coolidge carried out a calculation on the dihydrogen molecule that, unlike all previous calculation which used functions only of the distance of the electron from the atomic nucleus, used functions which also explicitly added the distance between the two electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; With up to 13 adjustable parameters they obtained a result very close to the experimental result for the dissociation energy. Later extensions have used up to 54 parameters and give excellent agreement with experiment. This calculation convinced the scientific community that quantum theory could give agreement with experiment. However this approach has none of the physical pictures of the valence bond and molecular orbital theories and is difficult to extend to larger molecules.

==Valence bond theory==
{{Main|Valence bond theory}}
In 1927, valence bond theory was formulated and argued that a chemical bond forms when two [[valence electron]]s, in their respective [[atomic orbital]]s, work or function to hold two nuclei together, by virtue of system energy lowering effects. Building on this theory, chemist [[Linus Pauling]] published in 1931 what some consider one of the most important papers in the history of chemistry: &quot;On the Nature of the Chemical Bond&quot;.  In this paper, elaborating on the works of Lewis, and the valence bond theory (VB) of Heitler and London, and his own earlier work, he presented six rules for the shared electron bond, the first three of which were already generally known:

:'''1.''' The electron-pair bond forms through the interaction of an unpaired electron on each of two atoms.
:'''2.''' The spins of the electrons have to be opposed.
:'''3.''' Once paired, the two electrons cannot take part in additional bonds.

His last three rules were new:

:'''4.''' The electron-exchange terms for the bond involves only one wave function from each atom.
:'''5.''' The available electrons in the lowest energy level form the strongest bonds.
:'''6.''' Of two orbitals in an atom, the one that can overlap the most with an orbital from another atom will form the strongest bond, and this bond will tend to lie in the direction of the concentrated orbital.

Building on this article, Pauling's 1939 textbook: ''On the Nature of the Chemical Bond'' would become what some have called the &quot;bible&quot; of modern chemistry. This book helped experimental chemists to understand the impact of quantum theory on chemistry. However, the later edition in 1959 failed to address adequately the problems that  appeared to be better understood by molecular orbital theory. The impact of valence theory declined during the 1960s and 1970s as molecular orbital theory grew in popularity and was implemented in many large computer programs.  Since the 1980s, the more difficult problems of implementing  valence bond theory into computer programs have been largely solved and valence bond theory has seen a resurgence.

==Comparison of valence bond and molecular orbital theory==
In some respects valence bond theory is superior to molecular orbital theory. When applied to the simplest two-electron molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, valence bond theory, even at the simplest Heitler-London approach, gives a much closer approximation to the [[bond energy]], and it provides a much more accurate representation of the behavior of the electrons as chemical bonds are formed and broken. In contrast simple molecular orbital theory predicts that the hydrogen molecule dissociates into a linear superposition of hydrogen atoms and positive and negative hydrogen ions, a completely unphysical result. This explains in part why the curve of total energy against interatomic distance for the valence bond method lies above the curve for the molecular orbital method at all distances and most particularly so for large distances. This situation arises for all homonuclear diatomic molecules and is particularly a problem for F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the minimum energy of the curve with molecular orbital theory is still higher in energy than the energy of two F atoms.

The concepts of hybridization are so versatile, and the variability in bonding in most organic compounds is so modest, that valence bond theory remains an integral part of the vocabulary of organic chemistry. However, the work of [[Friedrich Hund]], [[Robert Mulliken]], and [[Gerhard Herzberg]] showed that molecular orbital theory provided a more appropriate description of the spectroscopic, ionization and magnetic properties of molecules. The deficiencies of valence bond theory became apparent when hypervalent molecules (e.g. PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) were explained without the use of d orbitals that were crucial to the bonding hybridisation scheme proposed for such molecules by Pauling. [[complex (chemistry)|Metal complexes]] and [[electron deficient]] compounds (e.g. [[diborane]]) also appeared to be well described by molecular orbital theory, although valence bond descriptions have been made.

In the 1930s the two methods strongly competed until it was realised &lt;!-- about when?--&gt; that they are both approximations to a better theory. If we take the simple valence bond structure and mix in all possible covalent and ionic structures arising from a particular set of atomic orbitals, we reach what is called the full configuration interaction wave function. If we take the simple molecular orbital description of the ground state and combine that function with the functions describing all possible excited states using unoccupied orbitals arising from the same set of atomic orbitals, we also reach the full configuration interaction wavefunction. It can be then seen that the simple molecular orbital approach gives too much weight to the ionic structures, while the simple valence bond approach gives too little. This can also be described as saying that the molecular orbital approach is too ''delocalised'', while the valence bond approach is too ''localised''.

The two approaches are now regarded as complementary, each providing its own insights into the problem of chemical bonding. Modern calculations in [[quantum chemistry]] usually start from (but ultimately go far beyond) a molecular orbital rather than a valence bond approach, not because of any intrinsic superiority in the former but rather because the MO approach is more readily adapted to numerical computations. However better valence bond programs are now available.

==Bonds in chemical formulae==
The 3-dimensionality of atoms and molecules makes it difficult to use a single technique for indicating orbitals and bonds. In '''[[molecular formula]]e''' the chemical bonds (binding orbitals) between atoms are indicated by various different methods according to the type of discussion. Sometimes, they are completely neglected. For example, in [[organic chemistry]] chemists are sometimes concerned only with the [[functional group]]s of the molecule. Thus, the molecular formula of ethanol (a compound in [[alcoholic beverage]]s) may be written in a paper in [[conformational isomerism|conformational]], 3-dimensional, full 2-dimensional (indicating every bond with no 3-dimensional directions), compressed 2-dimensional (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OH), separating the functional group from another part of the molecule (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH), or by its atomic constituents (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O), according to what is discussed. Sometimes, even the non-bonding valence shell electrons (with the 2-dimensional approximate directions) are marked, i.e. for elemental carbon &lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;. Some chemists may also mark the respective orbitals, i.e. the hypothetical ethene&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; anion (&lt;sub&gt;\&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;C=C&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) indicating the possibility of bond formation.

Strong chemical bonds are the ''intramolecular'' forces which hold atoms together in [[molecules]]. A strong chemical bond is formed from the transfer or sharing of [[electrons]] between atomic centers and relies on the [[electrostatic attraction]] between the protons in nuclei and the electrons in the orbitals. Although these bonds typically involve the transfer of integer numbers of electrons (this is the [[bond order]], which respresents one transferred electron or two shared electrons), some systems can have intermediate numbers of bonds. An example of this is the organic molecule [[benzene]], where the bond order is 1.5 for each carbon atom, meaning that it has 1.5 bonds (shares three electrons) with each one of its two neighbors.

The types of strong bond differ due to the difference in [[electronegativity]] of the constituent elements. A large difference in electronegativity leads to more polar (ionic) character in the bond.

===Covalent bond===
{{Main|Covalent bond}}
Covalent bonding is a common type of bonding, in which the electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms is small or nonexistent.  Bonds within most [[organic compound]]s are described as covalent.  See [[sigma bond]]s and [[pi bond]]s for LCAO-description of such bonding.

A [[polar covalent bond]] is a covalent bond with a significant ionic character. This means that the electrons are closer to one of the atoms than the other, creating an imbalance of charge. They occur as a bond between two atoms with moderately different electronegativities, and give rise to [[dipole-dipole interactions]]. The electronegativity of these bonds is 0.3 to 1.7 .

A [[coordinate covalent bond]] is one where both bonding electrons are from one of the atoms involved in the bond. These bonds give rise to [[Lewis acids and bases]]. The electrons are shared roughly equally between the atoms in contrast to ionic bonding. Such bonding occurs in molecules such as the [[ammonium ion]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and are shown by an arrow pointing to the Lewis acid. Also known as non-polar covalent bond, the electronegativity of these bonds range from 0 to 0.3.

Molecules which are formed primarily from non-polar covalent bonds are often [[Miscibility|immiscible]] in water or other [[polar solvent]]s, but much more soluble in [[non-polar solvent]]s such as [[hexane]].

===Ionic bond===
{{Main|Ionic bond}}
Ionic bonding is a type of electrostatic interaction between atoms which have a large electronegativity difference. There is no precise value that distinguishes ionic from covalent bonding, but a difference of electronegativity of over 1.7 is likely to be ionic, and a difference of less than 1.7 is likely to be covalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Ionic bonding leads to separate positive and negative [[ions]]. Ionic charges are commonly between −3[[elementary charge|e]] to +3[[elementary charge|e]].
Ionic bonding commonly occurs in [[Salt (chemistry)|metal salts]] such as [[sodium chloride]] (table salt). A typical feature of ionic bonds is that the species form into ionic crystals, in which no ion is specifically paired with any single other ion, in a specific directional bond. Rather, each species of ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge, and the spacing between it and each of the oppositely charged ions near it, is the same for all surrounding atoms of the same type. It is thus no longer possible to associate an ion with any specific other single ionized atom near it. This is a situation unlike that in covalent crystals, where covalent bonds between specific atoms are still discernable from the shorter distances between them, as measured by with such techniques as [[X-ray diffraction]].

Ionic crystals may contain a mixture of covalent and ionic species, as for example salts of complex acids, such as sodium cyanide, NaCN. Many minerals are of this type. X-ray diffration shows that in NaCN, for example, the bonds between sodium [[cation]]s (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and the cyanide [[anion]]s (CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) are ''ionic'', with no sodium ion associated with any particular cyanide. However, the bonds between C and N atoms in cyanide are of the ''covalent'' type, making each of the carbon and nitrogen associated with ''just one'' of its opposite type, to which it is physically much closer than it is to other carbons or nitrogens in a sodium cyanide crystal. 

When such salts dissolve into water, the ionic bonds are typically broken by the interaction with water, but the covalent bonds continue to hold. In solution, the cyanide ions, still bound together as single CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, move independently through the solution, as do sodium ions, as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. These charged ions move apart because each of them are more strongly attracted to a number of water molecules, than to each other. The attraction between ions and water molecules in such solutions is due to a type of weak [[intermolecular force|dipole-dipole]] type chemical bond.

===One- and three-electron bonds===
Bonds with one or three electrons can be found in [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] species, which have an odd number of electrons. The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the hydrogen molecular cation, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. One-electron bonds often have about half the bond energy of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called &quot;half bonds&quot;. However, there are exceptions: in the case of [[dilithium]], the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; than for the 2-electron Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This exception can be explained in terms of hybridization and inner-shell effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Valency and bonding| publisher=Cambridge | year=2005 |pages=96–100 | author=Weinhold, F.; Landis, C. | isbn=0521831288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest example of three-electron bonding can be found in the helium dimer cation, He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and can also be considered a &quot;half bond&quot; because, in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is [[nitric oxide]], NO. The oxygen molecule, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its [[paramagnetism]] and its formal bond order of 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauling&quot;&gt;Pauling, L. ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond''. Cornell University Press, '''1960'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules with odd-electron bonds are usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauling&quot;/&gt;

===Bent bonds===
{{Main|Bent bond}}
[[Bent bond]]s, also known as banana bonds, are bonds in strained or otherwise [[steric effects|sterically hindered]] molecules whose binding orbitals are forced into a banana-like form. Bent bonds are often more susceptible to reactions than ordinary bonds.

===3c-2e and 3c-4e bonds===
In [[three-center two-electron bond]]s (&quot;3c-2e&quot;) three atoms share two electrons in bonding. This type of bonding occurs in electron deficient compounds like [[diborane]]. Each such bond (2 per molecule in diborane) contains a pair of electrons which connect the boron atoms to each other in a banana shape, with a proton (nucleus of a hydrogen atom) in the middle of the bond, sharing electrons with both boron atoms.

[[Three-center four-electron bond]]s (&quot;3c-4e&quot;) also exist which explain the bonding in [[hypervalent molecule]]s. In certain [[cluster chemistry|cluster compounds]], so-called [[four-center two-electron bond]]s also have been postulated.

In certain conjugated π (pi) systems, such as [[benzene]] and other [[aromatic]] compounds (see below), and in conjugated network solids such as [[graphite]], the electrons in the conjugated system of π-bonds are spread over as many nuclear centers as exist in the molecule, or the network.

===Aromatic bond===
{{Main|Aromaticity}}

In [[organic chemistry]], certain configurations of electrons and orbitals infer extra stability to a molecule. This occurs when [[pi bond|π orbitals]] overlap and combine with others on different atomic centres, forming a long range bond. For a molecule to be [[aromatic compound|aromatic]], it must obey [[Hückel's rule]], where the number of π electrons fit the formula 4n + 2, where n is an integer. The bonds involved in the aromaticity are all planar.

In [[benzene]], the prototypical aromatic compound, 18 (n = 4) bonding electrons bind 6 carbon atoms together to form a planar ring structure. The bond &quot;order&quot; (average number of bonds) between the different carbon atoms may be said to be (18/6)/2=1.5, but in this case the bonds are all identical from the chemical point of view. They may sometimes be written as single bonds alternating with double bonds, but the view of all ring bonds as being equivalently about 1.5 bonds in strength, is much closer to truth.

In the case of [[heterocyclic]] aromatics and substituted [[benzene]]s, the electronegativity differences between different parts of the ring may dominate the chemical behaviour of aromatic ring bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.

===Metallic bond===
{{Main|Metallic bond}}
In a metallic bond, bonding electrons are delocalized  over a lattice of atoms.  By contrast, in ionic compounds, the locations of the binding electrons and their charges are static. The freely-moving or delocalization of bonding electrons leads to classical metallic properties such as shininess (surface light reflectivity), electrical and thermal [[conductivity]], [[ductility]], and high [[tensile strength]].

==Intermolecular bonding==
{{Main|Intermolecular Force}}
There are four basic types of bonds that can be formed between two or more (otherwise non-associated) molecules, ions or atoms. [[Intermolecular force]]s cause molecules to be attracted or repulsed by each other. Often, these define some of the physical characteristics (such as the [[melting point]]) of a substance.

*A large difference in [[electronegativity]] between two bonded atoms will cause a permanent charge separation, or dipole, in a molecule or ion.  Two or more molecules or ions with permanent dipoles can interact in '''[[Intermolecular Force#Dipole-dipole interactions|dipole-dipole interactions]]'''. The bonding electrons in a molecule or ion will, on average, be closer to the more electronegative atom more frequently than the less electronegative one, giving rise to [[partial charge]]s on each atom, and causing [[electrostatic force]]s between molecules or ions.

*A '''[[hydrogen bond]]''' is effectively a strong example of a permanent dipole. The large difference in electronegativities between [[hydrogen]] and any of [[fluorine]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], coupled with their lone pairs of electrons cause strong electrostatic forces between molecules. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for the high boiling points of [[water]] and [[ammonia]] with respect to their heavier analogues.

*The '''[[London dispersion force]]''' arises due to instantaneous dipoles in neighbouring atoms. As the negative charge of the [[electron]] is not uniform around the whole atom, there is always a charge imbalance. This small charge will induce a corresponding dipole in a nearby molecule; causing an attraction between the two. The electron then moves to another part of the [[electron cloud]] and the attraction is broken.

*A '''[[cation-pi interaction]]''' occurs between the electron density of [[pi bond]]s above and below an [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic ring]] and a cation.

==Summary: electrons in chemical bonds==
In the (unrealistic) limit of &quot;pure&quot; [[ionic bond]]ing, electrons are perfectly localized on one of the two atoms in the bond. Such bonds can be understood by [[classical physics]]. The forces between the atoms are characterized by [[isotropic]] continuum electrostatic potentials. Their magnitude is in simple proportion to the charge difference.

Covalent bonds are better understood by [[valence bond theory]] or [[molecular orbital theory]]. The properties of the atoms involved can be understood using concepts such as [[oxidation number]]. The electron density within a bond is not assigned to individual atoms, but is instead delocalized between atoms. In valence bond theory, the two electrons on the two atoms are coupled together with the bond strength depending on the overlap between them. In molecular orbital theory, the [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) helps describe the delocalized molecular orbital structures and energies based on the atomic orbitals of the atoms they came from. Unlike pure ionic bonds, covalent bonds may have directed [[anisotropic]] properties. These may have their own names, such as [[sigma bond]] and [[pi bond]].

In the general case, atoms form bonds that are intermediates between ionic and covalent, depending on the relative [[electronegativity]] of the atoms involved. This type of bond is sometimes called [[polar covalent bond|polar covalent]].

The zones, going from the equator upward (and downward) are Tropical, Dry, Moderate, Continental and Polar.

'''Climate''' encompasses the statistics of [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pressure]], [[wind]], [[rainfall]], atmospheric particle count and other [[Meteorology|meteorological]] elemental measurements in a given region over long periods of time. Climate can be contrasted to [[weather]], which is the present condition of these same elements and their variations over shorter time periods.

The climate of a location is affected by its [[latitude]], [[terrain]], and [[altitude]], as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was originally developed by [[Wladimir Köppen]]. The Thornthwaite system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/210739|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf|author=C. W. Thornthwaite|title=An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate|journal=Geographical Review|volume=38|issue=1|pages=55–94|year=1948|jstor=210739}}&lt;/ref&gt; in use since 1948, incorporates [[evapotranspiration]] in addition to temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species diversity and potential impacts of climate changes. The Bergeron and [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]]s focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.

[[Paleoclimatology]] is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from ''proxy variables'' that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in [[lake beds]] and [[ice cores]], and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. [[Climate model]]s are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. [[Climate change]] may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in [[global warming]].

==Definition==
{{Weather}}

Climate (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''klima'', meaning ''inclination'') is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Climate|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1|accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard averaging period is 30&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages |title= Climate averages |accessdate=2008-05-17 |publisher= Met Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) glossary definition is:

''{{quote|Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the &quot;average weather,&quot; or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30&amp;nbsp;years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization ([[WMO]]). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

The difference between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase &quot;Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Weather Service Office Tucson, Arizona. [http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/ Main page.] Retrieved on 2007-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[history|historical]] time spans there are a number of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as [[plate tectonics]]. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: for example, the [[thermohaline circulation]] of the ocean leads to a 5&amp;nbsp;°C (9&amp;nbsp;°F) warming of the northern [[Atlantic ocean]] compared to other ocean basins.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Rahmstorf.

Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]]es determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to [[global warming]] or [[global cooling]].

==Climate classification==
There are several ways to [[Climate classification|classify climates]] into similar regimes. Originally, [[clime]]s were defined in [[Ancient Greece]] to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into ''genetic'' methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and ''empiric'' methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the [[relative frequency]] of different [[air mass]] types or locations within [[synoptic]] weather disturbances. Examples of [[empiric]] classifications include [[climate zone]]s defined by [[plant hardiness]],&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Arboretum]]. [http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.] Retrieved on 2008-03-09&lt;/ref&gt; evapotranspiration,&lt;ref name=&quot;thorne&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Thornethwaite Moisture Index|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Thornthwaite&amp;submit=Search|accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally the [[Köppen climate classification]] which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain [[biome]]s. A common shortcoming of these [[classification scheme]]s is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.

===Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic===

{{Main|Air mass}}

The most simple classification is that involving the concept of air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its [[moisture]] properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for [[tropical]], P for [[Polar region|polar]], A for [[Arctic]] or Antarctic, M for [[monsoon]], E for [[equatorial]], and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Airmass Classification|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=airmass-classification1|accessdate = 2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While air mass identification was originally used in [[weather forecasting]] during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.&lt;ref name=Schwartz1995&gt;{{cite journal|author = Schwartz, M.D.|year = 1995|title = Detecting Structural Climate Change: An Air Mass-Based Approach in the North Central United States, 1958–1992|journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 553–568|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01812.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]] (SSC).  There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).&lt;ref&gt;Robert E.

{{Main|Köppen climate classification}}

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rain forest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], [[polar ice cap]], and [[desert]].

'''Rain forests''' are characterized by high [[rainfall]], with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between {{convert|1750|mm|in}} and {{convert|2000|mm|in}}. Mean monthly temperatures exceed {{convert|18|C|F}} during all months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Woodward.

A '''humid continental''' climate is marked by variable weather patterns and a large seasonal temperature variance. Places with more than three months of average daily temperatures above {{convert|10|C|F}} and a coldest month temperature below {{convert|-3|C|F}} and which do not meet the criteria for an [[arid climate|arid]] or [[semiarid climate]], are classified as continental.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peel, M.

A '''polar ice cap''', or polar ice sheet, is a high-[[latitude]] region of a [[planet]] or [[natural satellite|moon]] that is covered in [[ice]]. Ice caps form because high-[[latitude]] regions receive less energy in the form of [[solar radiation]] from the [[sun]] than [[equator]]ial regions, resulting in lower [[surface temperature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ritter.

A '''desert''' is a [[landscape]] form or region that receives very little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Deserts usually have a large [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] and seasonal temperature range, with high daytime temperatures (in summer up to 45&amp;nbsp;°C or 113&amp;nbsp;°F), and low night-time temperatures (in winter down to 0&amp;nbsp;°C; 32&amp;nbsp;°F) due to extremely low [[humidity]]. Many deserts are formed by [[rain shadow]]s, as mountains block the path of moisture and precipitation to the desert.&lt;ref&gt;[[San Diego State University]].

Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Arctic Climatology and Meteorology.

In recent usage, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], the term &quot;climate change&quot; often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface [[temperature]] known as [[global warming]]. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the [[United Nations]] [[UNFCCC|Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses &quot;climate variability&quot; for non-human caused variations.&lt;ref&gt;

Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major [[ice age]]s. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by [[interglacial]] periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface [[albedo]], reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in [[greenhouse gas]]es, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the [[continent]]s, variations in the Earth's orbit, &lt;ref&gt;[[Milankovitch cycles]]&lt;/ref&gt; changes in the solar output, and volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois State Museum (2002).

Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;Eric Maisonnave. [http://www.cerfacs.fr/globc/research/variability/ Climate Variability.] Retrieved on 2008-05-02. {{Wayback|url=http://www.cerfacs.fr/globc/research/variability/|date =20080610145233|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ocean]]s, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.

The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[greenhouse gas]]). These models predict an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record|global mean surface temperature]], with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
* Simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] [[global climate model]]s discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Climateprediction.net.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''history of Comoros''' goes back some 1500 years.  It has been inhabited by various groups throughout this time.  [[France]] colonised the islands in the 19th century. [[Comoros]] finally became independent in 1975.

==Early inhabitants==
According to myth, the Comoros islands were first visited by Phoenician sailors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Comoros-HISTORY.html  &quot;Comoros History&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of the Nations&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zanzinet.org/zanzibar/people/people.html  Zanzinet Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest inhabitants of the islands were probably Arabs and Africans, the latter probably Bantu-speaking;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-1442/Comoros  &quot;Comoros History&quot;, ''Encyclopedia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest evidence of settlement of the islands dates from the eighth century.&lt;ref name = &quot;ezrfoq&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/comoros/2.htm  &quot;Early voyages and settlements&quot;, Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;  Traces of this original culture have blended with successive waves of [[African]], [[Arab]], [[Malagasy]] and [[Shirazi (ethnic group)|Shirazi]] immigrants.

The most notable of these early immigrants were the [[Shirazi (ethnic group)|Shirazi]] Arab royal clans, who arrived in Comoros in the 15th and 16th centuries and stayed to build mosques, create a royal house and introduce [[architecture]] and [[carpentry]].

Over the centuries, the [[Comoro Islands]] were settled by a succession of diverse groups from the coast of [[Africa]], the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Madagascar]]. Portuguese explorers first visited the archipelago in 1505. 

Apart from a visit by the French Parmentier brothers in 1529, for much of the 16th century the only Europeans to visit the islands were Portuguese; British and Dutch ships began arriving at the turn of the century and the island of [[Ndzwani]] became a major supply point on the route to the East.  Ndzwani was generally ruled by a single sultan, who occasionally attempted to extend his authority to [[Mayotte]] and [[Mwali]]; [[Ngazidja]] was more fragmented, on occasion being divided into as may as 12 small kingdoms. 

Both the British and the French turned their attention to the Comoros islands in the middle of the 19th century. The French finally acquired the islands through a cunning mixture of strategies, including the policy of 'divide and conquer', chequebook politics and a serendipitous affair between a sultana and a French trader that was put to good use by the French, who kept control of the islands, quelling unrest and the occasional uprising.

''For the history of the native sultanates on several of the major islands, see [[Sultans on the Comoros]].''
	
William Sunley, a planter and British Consul from 1848 1866, was an influence on Anjouan.

==Colonial rule==
[[Image:Franz Sikora 038.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore]] (1897)]]
On 25 March 1841, [[France]] purchased the island of [[Maore]] (the name of the island was corrupted in French to &quot;Mayotte&quot;) (ratified 13 June 1843), which became a colony.

In 1850 Sultan Selim of Johanna island seized the [[United States|American]] [[whaler]] ''Maria'' and imprisoned her commander, named Moores. In response the [[United States Navy]] launched the [[Johanna Expedition]] in February 1852 to gain the release of Moores and extract compensation. Initioally the sultan did not meet the demands, and the [[sloop-of-war]] [[USS Dale (1839)|USS ''Dale'']] bombarded the island's fortifications; ultimately Selim paid [[US$]]1,000 and released Captain Moores.&lt;ref&gt;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F14F93F55147B93C6A91789D85F468584F9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/special%20highlights/pirates/Suppression%20of%20Piracy%20on%20Johanna%20Island,%20August%201851,%20Amerman,%20USMC%20HD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Said Ali bin Said Omar, Sultan of [[Bambao]], signed an agreement with the French government that allowed France to establish a protectorate over the entire island of [[Ngazidja]] ([[Grande Comore]]; protectorates were also established over Ndzwani (Anjouan), and [[Mwali]] ([[Mohéli]] island in French) the same year. [[resident (title)|résident]]s were posted on the three islands. 

On 9 April 1908, France declared the protectorates and Mayotte a single colony, Mayotte and dependencies.

On 25 July 1912, it was annexed to [[Madagascar]] as a province of that colony. 

From 16 June 1940 - 1942 the colonial administration remained loyal to [[Vichy France]] (from 1942, under Free French), but 25 September 1942 - 13 October 1946 they were, like Madagascar, under [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation.

Until the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], the islands used to be an important refuelling and provisioning station for ships from [[Europe]] to the [[Indian Ocean]].

Independence came gradually for Comoros. During the middle of the 20th century the French reluctantly began to accede to reasonable requests, and in 1946 Comoros had become a separately administered colony from Madagascar. 

After [[World War II]], the islands became a [[French overseas territory]] and were represented in France's [[National Assembly]].  Internal political autonomy was granted in 1961.  Agreement was reached with France in 1973 for Comoros to become independent in 1978.  On July 6, 1975, however, the Comorian parliament passed a resolution declaring unilateral independence.  The deputies of [[Mayotte]] abstained.

In two [[referendum]]s, in December 1974 and February 1976, the population of Mayotte voted against independence from France (by 63.8% and 99.4% respectively).  Mayotte thus remains under French administration, and the Comorian Government has effective control over only Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli.

In 1961 it was granted autonomous rule and, seven years after the general unrest and left-wing riots of 1968. Comoros broke all ties with France and established itself as an independent republic. From the very beginning Mayotte refused to join the new republic and aligned itself even more firmly to the French Republic, but the other islands remained committed to independence. The first president of Comoros, [[Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane]], did not last long before being ousted in a [[coup]] by [[Ali Soilih]], an [[atheist]] with an Islamic background.

Soilih began with a set of solid [[socialist]] ideals designed to modernize the country. However, the regime faced problems. A French mercenary by the name of [[Bob Denard]], arrived in Comoros at dawn on 13 May 1978, and removed Soilih from power. Solih was shot and killed during the coup. Abdallah returned to govern the country and the mercenaries were given key positions in government.

Later, [[France|French]] settlers, French-owned companies, and Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that now uses about one-third of the land for export crops.

==Abdallah regime==
{{main|History of Comoros (1978-1989)}}
In 1978, president [[Ali Soilih]], who had a firm anti-French line, was killed and [[Ahmed Abdallah]] came to power. Under the reign of Abdallah, Denard was commander of the Presidential Guard (PG) and ''de facto'' ruler of the country.  He was trained, supported and funded by the white regimes in [[South Africa]] (SA) and [[Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe) in return for permission to set up a secret listening post on the islands. South-African agents kept an ear on the important [[African National Congress|ANC]] bases in [[Lusaka]] and [[Dar es Salaam]] watched the war in Mozambique, in which SA played an active role. The Comoros were also used for the evasion of arms sanctions. 

When in 1981 [[François Mitterrand]] was elected president Denard lost the support of the French intelligence service, but he managed to strengthen the link between SA and the Comoros. Besides the military, Denard established his own company SOGECOM, for both the security and construction, and seemed to profit by the arrangement.  Between 1985 an 1987 the relationship of the PG with the local Comorians became worse. 

At the end of the 1980s the South Africans did not wish to continue to support the mercenary regime and France was in agreement. Also President Abdallah wanted the mercenaries to leave. Their response was a (third) coup resulting in the death of President Abdallah, in which Denard and his men were probably involved. South Africa and the French government subsequently forced Denard and his mercenaries to leave the islands in 1989.

==1989-1996==
[[Said Mohamed Djohar]] became president. His time in office was turbulent, including an impeachment attempt in 1991 and a coup attempt in 1992.

On September 28, 1995 Bob Denard and a group of mercenaries took over the Comoros islands in a coup (named operation Kaskari by the mercenaries) against President Djohar. France immediately severely denounced the coup, and backed by the 1978 defense agreement with the Comoros, President [[Jacques Chirac]] ordered his special forces to retake the island. Bob Denard began to take measures to stop the coming invasion. A new presidential guard was created. Strong points armed with heavy machine guns were set up around the island, particularly around the island's two airports. 

On October 3, 1995, 11 p.m., the French deployed 600 men against a force of 33 mercenaries and a 300 man dissident force. Denard however ordered his mercenaries not to fight. Within 7 hours the airports at Iconi and Hahaya and the French Embassy in Moroni were secured. By 3:00 p.m. the next day Bob Denard and his mercenaries had surrendered. This (response) operation, codenamed ''Azalée'', was remarkable, because there were no casualties, and just in seven days, plans were drawn up and soldiers were deployed. Denard was taken to France and jailed. Prime minister [[Caambi El-Yachourtu]] became acting president until Djohar returned from exile in January, 1996. In March 1996, following presidential elections, [[Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim]], a member of the civilian government that Denard had tried to set up in October 1995, became president.

==Secession of Anjouan and Mohéli==
In 1997, the islands of [[Anjouan]] and [[Mohéli]] declared their independence from Comoros. A subsequent attempt by the government to re-establish control over the rebellious islands by force failed, and presently the [[African Union]] is brokering negotiations to effect a reconciliation. This process is largely complete, at least in theory. According to some sources, Mohéli did return to government control in 1998. In 1999, Anjouan had internal conflicts and on August 1 of that year, the 80-year-old first president [[Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim]] resigned, transferring power to a national coordinator, [[Said Abeid]]. The government was overthrown in a coup by army and navy officers on August 9, 2001. [[Mohamed Bacar]] soon rose to leadership of the [[Military dictatorship|junta]] that took over and by the end of the month he was the leader of the country. Despite two coup attempts in the following three months, including one by Abeid, Bacar’s government remained in power, and was apparently more willing to negotiate with Comoros. Presidential elections were held for all of Comoros in 2002, and presidents have been chosen for all three islands as well, which have become a confederation. Most notably, Mohammed Bacar was elected for a 5-year term as president of Anjouan. Grande Comore had experienced troubles of its own in the late 1990s, when President Taki died on November 6, 1998. Colonel [[Azali Assoumani]] became president following a military coup in 1999. There have been several coup attempts since, but he gained firm control of the country after stepping down temporarily and winning a presidential election in 2002.

In May 2006, [[Ahmed Abdallah Sambi]] was elected from the island of [[Anjouan]] to be the president of the [[Union of Comoros]]. He is a well-respected [[Sunni]] cleric who studied in the [[Sudan]], [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. He is respectfully called &quot;[[Ayatollah]]&quot; by his supporters but is considered, and is, a moderate [[Islamist]]. He has been quoted as stating that Comoros is not ready to become an Islamic state, nor shall the [[hijab|veil]] be forced upon any women in the Comoros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200605151054.html  Reports from allafrica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Comoros archipelago]]''' consists of four main islands aligned along a northwest-southeast axis at the north end of the [[Mozambique Channel]], between [[Mozambique]] and the island of [[Madagascar]]. Still widely known by their French names, the islands officially have been called by their [[Swahili language|Swahili]] names by the Comorian government. They are [[Njazidja]] ([[Grande Comore]]), [[Mwali]] ([[Mohéli]]), [[Nzwani]] ([[Anjouan]]), and [[Mahoré]] ([[Mayotte]]). The islands' distance from each other—Njazidja is some 200 kilometers from Mahoré, forty kilometers from Mwali, and eighty kilometers from Nzwani—along with a lack of good harbor facilities, make transportation and communication difficult. The islands have a total land area of 2,236 square kilometers (including Mahoré), and claim territorial waters of 320 square kilometers. Le [[Karthala]] (2316 m) on Grande Comore is an active volcano.  From April 17 to 19, 2005, the volcano began spewing ash and gas, forcing as many as 10,000 people to flee.

'''[[Geographic coordinates]]:'''
{{coord|12|10|S|44|15|E|type:country}}
{{wikiatlas|Comoros}}

==Njazidja==
Njazidja is the largest island, sixty-seven kilometers long and twenty-seven kilometers wide, with a total area of 1,146 square kilometers. The most recently formed of the four islands in the archipelago, it is also of volcanic origin. Two volcanoes form the island's most prominent topographic features: La Grille in the north, with an elevation of 1,000 meters, is extinct and largely eroded; Kartala in the south, rising to a height of 2,361 meters, last erupted in 1977. A plateau averaging 600 to 700 meters high connects the two mountains. Because Njazidja is geologically a relatively new island, its soil is thin and rocky and cannot hold water. As a result, water from the island's heavy rainfall must be stored in catchment tanks. There are no coral reefs along the coast, and the island lacks a good harbor for ships. One of the largest remnants of Comoros' once-extensive rain forests is on the slopes of Kartala. The national capital has been at Moroni since 1962.

==Nzwani==
Nzwani, triangular shaped and forty kilometers from apex to base, has an area of 424 square kilometers. Three mountain chains—Sima, Nioumakele, and Jimilime—emanate from a central peak, Mtingui (1,575 meters), giving the island its distinctive shape. Older than Njazidja, Nzwani has deeper soil cover, but overcultivation has caused serious erosion. A coral reef lies close to shore; the island's capital of Mutsamudu is also its main port.

==Mwali==
Mwali is thirty kilometers long and twelve kilometers wide, with an area of 290 square kilometers. It is the smallest of the four islands and has a central mountain chain reaching 860 meters at its highest. Like Njazidja, it retains stands of rain forest. Mwali's capital is Fomboni.

==Mahoré==
Mahoré, geologically the oldest of the four islands, is thirty-nine kilometers long and twenty-two kilometers wide, totaling 375 square kilometers, and its highest points are between 500 and 600 meters above sea level. Because of greater weathering of the volcanic rock, the soil is relatively rich in some areas. A well-developed coral reef that encircles much of the island ensures protection for ships and a habitat for fish. Dzaoudzi, capital of Comoros until 1962 and now Mahoré's administrative center, is situated on a rocky outcropping off the east shore of the main island. Dzaoudzi is linked by a causeway to le Pamanzi, which at ten kilometers in area is the largest of several islets adjacent to Mahoré. Islets are also scattered in the coastal waters of Njazidja, Nzwani, and Mwali.

==Flora and fauna==
Comorian waters are the habitat of the [[coelacanth]], a rare fish with limblike fins and a cartilaginous skeleton, the fossil remains of which date as far back as 400 million years and which was once thought to have become extinct about 70 million years ago.  A live specimen was caught in 1938 off southern Africa; other coelacanths have since been found in the vicinity of the Comoro Islands.

Several mammals are unique to the islands themselves.  The Macao, a lemur found only on Mahoré, is protected by French law and by local tradition.  Another, Livingstone's fruit bat, although plentiful when discovered by explorer David Livingstone in 1863, has been reduced to a population of about 120, entirely on Nzwani.  The world's largest bat, the jet-black Livingstone fruit bat has a wingspan of nearly two meters.  A British preservation group sent an expedition to Comoros in 1992 to bring some of the bats to Britain to establish a breeding population.  

22 species of bird are unique to the archipelago and 17 of these are restricted to the Union of the Comoros. These include the [[Karthala Scops-owl]], [[Anjouan Scops-owl]] and [[Humblot's Flycatcher]].

Partly in response to international pressures, Comorians in the 1990s have become more concerned about the environment.  Steps are being taken not only to preserve the rare fauna, but also to counteract degradation of the environment, especially on densely populated Nzwani.  Specifically, to minimize the cutting down of trees for fuel, kerosene is being subsidized, and efforts are being made to replace the loss of the forest cover caused by ylang-ylang distillation for perfume.  The Community Development Support Fund, sponsored by the International Development Association (IDA, a World Bank affiliate) and the Comorian government, is working to improve water supply on the islands as well.

==Climate==
''See also: [[Comoro Islands#Climate|Climate]]''

The climate is marine tropical, with two seasons: hot and humid from November to April, the result of the northeastern monsoon, and a cooler, drier season the rest of the year. Average monthly temperatures range from {{convert|23|to|28|°C|°F|1}} along the coasts. Although the average annual precipitation is {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}, water is a scarce commodity in many parts of Comoros. Mwali and Mahoré possess streams and other natural sources of water, but Njazidja and Nzwani, whose mountainous landscapes retain water poorly, are almost devoid of naturally occurring running water. Cyclones, occurring during the hot and wet season, can cause extensive damage, especially in coastal areas. On the average, at least twice each decade houses, farms, and harbor facilities are devastated by these great storms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Comoros-demography.png|thumb|right|Demographics of Comoros, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
The [[Comoros|Comorians]] inhabiting [[Grande Comore]], [[Anjouan]], and [[Mohéli]] (86% of the population) share African-Arab origins. [[Islam]] (See [[Islam in Comoros]]) is the dominant religion, and [[Quranic school]]s for children reinforce its influence. Although Arab culture is firmly established throughout, a small minority are [[Christian]].

The most common language is [[Comorian language|Comorian]], related to [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. French and Arabic also are spoken. About 89% of the population is [[literate]].

[[Population density]] figures conceal a great disparity between the republic's most crowded island, Nzwani, which had a density of 470 persons per square kilometer in 1991; Ngazidja, which had a density of 250 persons per square kilometer in 1991; and Mwali, where the 1991 population density figure was 120 persons per square kilometer. Overall population density increased to about 285 persons per square kilometer by 1994.
By comparison, estimates of the population density per square kilometer of the Indian Ocean's other island microstates ranged from 241 (Seychelles) to 690 (Maldives) in 1993. Given the rugged terrain of Ngazidja and Nzwani, and the dedication of extensive tracts to agriculture on all three islands, population pressures on Comoros are becoming increasingly critical.

The age structure of the population of Comoros is similar to that of many developing countries, in that the republic has a very large proportion of young people. In 1989, 46.4 percent of the population was under fifteen years of age, an above-average proportion even for [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. The population's rate of growth was a relatively high 3.5 percent per annum in the mid 1980s, up substantially from 2.0 percent in the mid-1970s and 2.1 percent in the mid-1960s.

In 1983 the Abdallah regime borrowed US$2.85 million from the [[International Development Association]] to devise a national [[family planning]] program. However, Islamic reservations about [[contraception]] made forthright advocacy and implementation of [[birth control]] programs politically hazardous, and consequently little was done in the way of public policy.

The Comorian population has become increasingly [[urbanisation|urbanized]] in recent years. In 1991 the percentage of Comorians residing in cities and towns of more than 5,000 persons was about 30 percent, up from 25 percent in 1985 and 23 percent in 1980. Comoros' largest cities were the capital, [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], with about 30,000 people, and the port city of [[Mutsamudu]], on the island of Nzwani, with about 20,000 people.

Migration among the various islands is important. Natives of [[Nzwani]] have settled in significant numbers on less crowded [[Mwali]], causing some social tensions, and many Nzwani also migrate to Maore. In 1977 Maore expelled peasants from Ngazidja and Nzwani who had recently settled in large numbers on the island. Some were allowed to reenter starting in 1981 but solely as migrant labor.

The number of Comorians living abroad has been estimated at between 80,000 and 100,000; during the colonial period, most of them lived in [[Tanzania]], [[Madagascar]], and other parts of [[East Africa]]. The number of Comorians residing in Madagascar was drastically reduced after anti-Comorian rioting in December 1976 in [[Mahajanga]], in which at least 1,400 Comorians were killed. As many as 17,000 Comorians left Madagascar to seek refuge in their native land in 1977 alone. About 100,000 Comorians live in France; many of them had gone there for a university education and never returned. Small numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indians]], [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]], [[South Africa]]ns, and Europeans (mostly [[French people|French]]) live on the islands and play an important role in the economy. Most French stepped out after independence in 1975.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Comoros}}
'''Politics of the Union of the Comoros''' takes place in a framework of a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of the Comoros]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament.

As of 2008, [[Comoros]] and [[Mauritania]] are considered by [[United States|US]]-based organization [[Freedom House]] as the only real “[[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]]” of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2008 Freedom House Country Report 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background==
The Union of the Comoros, known as the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros until 2003, is ruled by [[Ahmed Abdallah Sambi]]. The political situation in [[Comoros]] has been extremely fluid since the country's independence in 1975, subject to the volatility of coups and political insurrection. Colonel [[Azali Assoumani]] seized power in a bloodless coup in April 1999, overthrowing Interim President [[Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde]], who himself had held the office since the death of democratically elected President [[Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim]] in November, 1998. 

In May 1999, Azali decreed a constitution that gave him both executive and legislative powers. Bowing somewhat to international criticism, Azali appointed a civilian Prime Minister, [[Bainrifi Tarmidi]], in December 1999; however, Azali retained the mantle of Head of State and army Commander. In December 2000, Azali named a new civilian Prime Minister, [[Hamada Madi]], and formed a new civilian Cabinet. When Azali took power he also pledged to step down in April 2000 and relinquish control to a democratically elected president—a pledge with mixed results.

In a separate nod to pressure to restore civilian rule, the government organized several committees to compose a new constitution, including the August 2000 National Congress and November 2000 Tripartite Commission. The opposition parties initially refused to participate in the Tripartite Commission, but on 17 February, representatives of the government, the Anjouan separatists, the political opposition, and civil society organizations signed a &quot;Framework Accord for Reconciliation in Comoros,&quot; brokered by the [[Organization for African Unity]]

The accord called for the creation of a new [[Tripartite Commission for National Reconciliation]] to develop a &quot;New Comorian Entity&quot; with a new constitution. The new federal Constitution came into effect in 2002; it included elements of [[consociationalism]], including a presidency that rotates every four years among the islands and extensive autonomy for each island. [[Comoros Presidential elections, 2002|Presidential elections]] were held in 2002, at which Azali Assoumani was elected President. In April 2004 [[Comoros legislative election, 2004|legislative elections]] were held, completing the implementation of the new constitution. 

The new Union of the Comoros consists of three islands, [[Grande Comore]], [[Anjouan]] and [[Mohéli]]. Each island has a president, who shares the presidency of the Union on a rotating basis. The president and his vice-presidents are elected for a term of four years. The constitution states that, &quot;the islands enjoy financial autonomy, freely draw up and manage their budgets&quot;.

President Assoumani Azali of Grande Comore is the first Union president. President Mohamed Bacar of Anjouan formed his 13-member government at the end of April, 2003.

On 15 May 2006, [[Ahmed Abdallah Sambi]], a cleric and successful businessman educated in [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Sudan]], was declared the winner of elections for President of the Republic. He is considered a moderate [[Islamist]] and is called [[Ayatollah]] by his supporters. He beat out retired French air force officer [[Mohamed Djaanfari]] and long-time politician [[Ibrahim Halidi]], whose candidacy was backed by [[Azali Assoumani]], the outgoing president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A referendum took place on May 16, 2009 to decide whether to cut down the government's unwieldy political bureaucracy. 52.7% of those eligible voted, and 93.8% of votes were cast in approval of the referendum. The referendum would cause each island's president to become a governor and the ministers to become councilors.&lt;ref name=allafrica20090519&gt;{{cite news

==Autonomous islands==
The constitution gives [[Grande Comore]], [[Anjouan]] and [[Mohéli]] the right to govern most of their own affairs with their own presidents, except the activities assigned to the [[Union of the Comoros]] like Foreign Policy, Defense, Nationality, Banking and others. Comoros considers [[Mayotte]], an overseas collectivity of France, to be part of its territory, with an autonomous status &lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/Comoros%20Constitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of systems of '''transport in Comoros'''.  [[Comoros]] possesses {{convert|880|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of [[highway]], of which {{convert|673|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are paved.  It additionally has three [[seaport]]s: [[Fomboni]], [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] and [[Moutsamoudou]], and does not have a merchant marine, or [[railway]] network.  In terms of [[airport]]s, the country possesses four, all with paved [[runway]]s.  Of the airports, one has runways of length exceeding {{convert|2438|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, with the remaining three having runways shorter than {{convert|1523|m|0|abbr=on}}.

The relative isolation of the Comoro Islands had made air traffic a major means of transportation. One of President Abdallah's accomplishments was to make Comoros more accessible by air. During his administration, he negotiated agreements to initiate or enhance commercial air links with Tanzania and Madagascar. The Djohar regime reached an agreement in 1990 to link Moroni and Brussels by air. By the early 1990s, commercial flights connected Comoros with France, Mauritius, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Madagascar. The national airline was Air Comores. Daily flights linked the three main islands, and air service was also available to Mahoré; each island had airstrips. In 1986 the republic received a grant from the French government's CCCE to renovate and expand Hahaya airport, near Moroni. Because of the absence of regularly scheduled sea transport between the islands, nearly all interisland passenger traffic is by air.

More than 99 percent of freight is transported by sea. Both Moroni on Njazidja and Mutsamudu on Nzwani have artificial harbors. There is also a harbor at Fomboni, on Mwali. Despite extensive internationally financed programs to upgrade the harbors at Moroni and Mutsamudu, by the early 1990s only Mutsamudu was operational as a deepwater facility. Its harbor could accommodate vessels of up to eleven meters' draught. At Moroni, ocean-going vessels typically lie offshore and are loaded or unloaded by smaller craft, a costly and sometimes dangerous procedure. Most freight continues to be sent to Kenya, Reunion, or Madagascar for transshipment to Comoros. Use of Comoran ports is further restricted by the threat of cyclones from December through March. The privately operated Comoran Navigation Company (Société Comorienne de Navigation) is based in Moroni, and provides services to Madagascar. )

Roads serve the coastal areas, rather than the interior, and the mountainous terrain makes surface travel difficult.

In November 1975, [[Comoros]] became the 143rd member of the [[United Nations]]. The new nation was defined as consisting of the entire [[archipelago]], despite the fact that [[France]] maintains control over [[Mayotte]].

== Overview ==
Comoros also is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], the [[European Development Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], and the [[African Development Bank]]. 

The government fostered close relationships with the more conservative (and oil-rich) Arab states, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; It frequently received aid from those countries and the regional financial institutions they influenced, such as the [[Arab Bank for Economic Development]] in Africa and the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; In October 1993, Comoros joined the [[League of Arab States]], after having been rejected when it applied for membership initially in 1977.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Regional relations generally were good.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; In 1985 [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Seychelles]] agreed to admit Comoros as the fourth member of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] (IOC), an organization established in 1982 to encourage regional cooperation.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; In 1993 Mauritius and Seychelles had two of the five [[Embassy|embassies]] in Moroni, and Mauritius and Madagascar were connected to the republic by regularly scheduled commercial flights.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In November 1975, Comoros became the 143d member of the [[United Nations|UN]]. In the 1990s, the republic continued to represent Mahoré in the UN.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Comoros was also a member of the OAU, the EDF, the [[World Bank]], the IMF, the IOC, and the [[African Development Bank]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Comoros thus cultivated relations with various nations, both East and West, seeking to increase trade and obtain financial assistance.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; In 1994, however, it was increasingly facing the need to control its expenditures and reorganize its economy so that it would be viewed as a sounder recipient of investment.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Comoros also confronted domestically the problem of the degree of [[democracy]] the government was prepared to grant to its citizens, a consideration that related to its standing in the world community.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Bilateral relations==
===People's Republic of China===
 {{main|People's Republic of China – Comoros relations}}
Comoros also hosted an embassy of [[China]], which established relations during the Soilih regime.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; The Chinese had long been a source of aid and apparently wished to maintain contact with Comoros to counterbalance Indian and Soviet (later Russian) influence in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; 

In August 2008, a Comorian delegation visited [[China]] on a good-will visit. Together with the Chinese [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|defense minister]] [[Liang Guanglie]], and Chief of Staff of the Comoros armed forces Salimou Mohamed Amiri, pledged to increase cooperation between the military of the two nations. Amiri stated that Comoros will continue to adhere to the [[One-China]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/21/content_10227730.htm Chinese defense minister meets Comoros army chief]&quot;, ''China View''. 2008-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive Chinese-assisted treatment campaign has apparently eliminated [[malaria]] from the Comorian island of [[Moheli]] (population 36,000). Administered by Li Guoqiao at the [[Tropical Medicine Institute]], the program relies on hybrid [[Artemisia annua]] of hybrid ancestry, which was used for a drug regimen by which all residents of the island, whether or not visibly ill, took two doses at a 40-day interval. This eliminated the human reservoir of the disease and reduced hospital admissions to 1% or less of January 2008 levels. Visitors to Moheli are now required to take a antimalarial drugs, a mix of [[artemisinin]], [[primaquine]] and [[pyrimethamine]] that China provides for free. When asked about Artemisia exports, Li was quoted, &quot;We want to grow them in China and whatever we export depends on bilateral relationships.&quot; Comoros has requested a similar program for [[Grande Comore]] and [[Anjouan]], total population 760,000, and Li said that Beijing has agreed in principle.&lt;ref&gt;Africa: Ending Malaria in Sight?

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt; The three years of estrangement following the unilateral declaration of independence and the nationalistic [[Ali Soilih|Soilih]] regime were followed during the conservative [[Ahmed Abdallah|Abdallah]] and [[Said Mohamed Djohar|Djohar]] regimes by a period of growing trade, aid, cultural, and defense links between the former colony and France, punctuated by frequent visits to [[Paris]] by the head of state and occasional visits by the French president to [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; The leading military power in the region, France has detachments on [[Mahoré]] and [[Réunion]], and its [[Indian Ocean]] fleet sails the waters around the islands.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; France and Comoros signed a mutual security treaty in 1978; following the mercenary [[coup]] against Abdallah in 1989, French troops restored order and took responsibility for reorganizing and training the Comorian army.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; With Mahoré continuing to gravitate politically and economically toward France, and Comoros increasingly dependent on the French for help with its own considerable social, political, and economic problems, the issue of Mahoré diminished somewhat in urgency.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The Comoros and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] established full diplomatic relations on 26 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17921&amp;Itemid=65 &quot;Georgia and the Union of the Comoros established diplomatic relations&quot;] ''georgiandaily.com'' 2010-03-26 Link retrieved 2010-03-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===

Comorian relations with [[Japan]] were also significant because Japan was the second largest provider of aid, consisting of funding for [[fisheries]], food, and highway development.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===South Africa===

The close relationship Comoros developed with [[South Africa]] in the 1980s was much less significant to both countries in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; With the reform of its [[apartheid]] government, South Africa no longer needed Comoros as evidence of its ostensible ability to enjoy good relations with a black African state; the end of the [[Cold War]] had also diminished Comoros' strategic value to Pretoria.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Although South Africa continued to provide developmental aid, it closed its consulate in Moroni in 1992.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Since the 1989 coup and subsequent expulsion of South African-financed mercenaries, Comoros likewise turned away from South Africa and toward France for assistance with its security needs.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===Turkey===

Embassy of Comoros in Egypt is accredited to Turkey. Embassy of Turkey in Kenya is accredited to Comoros.

===United States===
 {{main|Comoros – United States relations}}
The [[United States]] established diplomatic relations in 1977 but in September 1993 closed its embassy in Moroni. The two countries enjoy friendly relations.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; The historic under-commitment by the US within France's sphere of interest in the Indian Ocean looks set to continue after a November 2009 meeting between heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/Comoros/Islands/prweb3169794.htm] The Comoros Islands and President Sambi – Could Change Finally have Arrived? November 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Future friendly relations continue to look promising between the Comoros and America.

===Yemen===
{{main|Comoros – Yemen relations}}
In April 2008, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of [[Yemen]] and Comoros Ministry of Fishery and Environment signed a &quot;Memo of Understanding&quot; (MOU) concerning agricultural cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabanews.net/en/news152712.htm Yemen, Comoros sign agricultural MOU].

[[File:Morris Worm.jpg|thumb|[[Morris Worm]] source code disk at the [[Computer History Museum]].]]
[[File:Conficker.svg|thumb|Spread of [[Conficker worm]].]]
A '''computer worm''' is a self-replicating  [[malware]] [[computer program]], which uses a [[computer network]] to send copies of itself to other nodes (computers on the network) and it may do so without any user intervention. This is due to security shortcomings on the target computer. Unlike a [[computer virus]], it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.

==Payloads==
Many '''worms''' that have been created are only designed to spread, and don't attempt to alter the systems they pass through. However, as the [[Morris worm]] and [[Mydoom]] showed, even these &quot;payload free&quot; worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects.  A &quot;[[Payload (software)|payload]]&quot; is code in the worm designed to do more than spread the worm–it might delete files on a host system (e.g., the [[ExploreZip]] worm), encrypt files in a [[Cryptovirology|cryptoviral extortion]] attack, or send documents via [[e-mail]]. A very common payload for worms is to install a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in the infected computer to allow the creation of a &quot;[[zombie computers|zombie]]&quot; computer under control of the worm author. Networks of such machines are often referred to as [[botnets]] and are very commonly used by [[e-mail spam|spam]] senders for sending junk email or to cloak their website's address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001859752_spamdoubles18.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |title=Business &amp; Technology: E-mail viruses blamed as spam rises sharply |date=February 18, 2004 |first=Tiernan |last=Ray }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spammers are therefore thought to be a source of funding for the creation of such worms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,60747,00.html |title=Cloaking Device Made for Spammers |newspaper=Wired |date=October 9, 2003 |first=Brian |last=McWilliams }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/68810/1/.html |title=Unavailable |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the worm writers have been caught selling lists of [[IP address]]es of infected machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/44879 |work=heise online |title=Uncovered: Trojans as Spam Robots |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others try to blackmail companies with threatened [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3513849.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hacker threats to bookies probed |date=February 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backdoors can be exploited by other malware, including worms. Examples include [[Doomjuice]], which spreads better using the backdoor opened by [[Mydoom]], and at least one &lt;!-- which? how soon released after the news went public --&gt; instance of malware taking advantage of the [[rootkit]] and backdoor installed by the [[Sony/BMG]] [[Digital rights management|DRM]] software utilized by millions of music CDs prior to late 2005.{{Dubious|date=January 2010}}

==Worms with good intent==


Beginning with  the very first research into worms at [[Xerox PARC]], there have been attempts to create useful worms. The [[Nachi worm|Nachi]] family of worms, for example, tried to download and install patches from Microsoft's website to fix vulnerabilities in the host system–by exploiting those ''same'' vulnerabilities. In practice, although this may have made these systems more secure, it generated considerable network traffic, rebooted the machine in the course of patching it, and did its work without the consent of the computer's owner or user.

Some worms, such as [[XSS Worm|XSS worms]], have been written for research to determine the factors of how worms spread, such as social activity and change in user behavior, while other worms are little more than a [[Practical joke|prank]], such as one that sends the popular [[image macro]] of an owl with the phrase &quot;[[O RLY?]]&quot; to a print queue in the infected computer. Another research proposed what seems to be the first computer worm that operates on the second layer of the OSI model (Data link Layer), it utilizes topology
information such as Content-addressable memory (CAM) tables and Spanning Tree information stored in switches to propagate and probe for vulnerable nodes until the enterprise network is covered.&lt;ref name=&quot;semiauto_worm&quot;&gt;{{Cite document

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most security experts regard all worms as [[malware]], whatever their payload or their writers' intentions.

== Protecting against dangerous computer worms ==
Worms spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems.&lt;!-- NOTE: this statement is erroneous. a trojan horse is a category similar to a [[master status]]. Any program can be a trojan horse~&gt;  If user interaction is required for the malware to spread, it is called a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]].
--&gt;
Vendors with security problems supply regular security updates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn USN list | Ubuntu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (see &quot;[[Patch Tuesday]]&quot;), and if these are installed to a machine then the majority of worms are unable to spread to it. If a vulnerability is disclosed before the security patch released by the vendor, a [[Zero-day attack]] is possible.

Users need to be wary of opening unexpected email,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/alerts/info/nimda.mspx Information on the Nimda Worm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and should not run attached files or programs, or visit web sites that are linked to such emails. However, as with the [[ILOVEYOU]] worm, and with the increased growth and efficiency of [[phishing]] attacks, it remains possible to trick the end-user into running a malicious code.

[[Antivirus|Anti-virus]] and [[Antispyware|anti-spyware]] software are helpful, but must be kept up-to-date with new pattern files at least every few days. The use of a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is also recommended.

In the April–June, 2008, issue of [[IEEE]] Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, computer scientists describe a potential new way to combat internet worms. The researchers discovered how to contain the kind of worm that scans the Internet randomly, looking for vulnerable hosts to infect. They found that the key is for software to monitor the number of scans that machines on a network sends out. When a machine starts sending out too many scans, it is a sign that it has been infected, allowing administrators to take it off line and check it for viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=4509574&amp;arnumber=4358715&amp;count=10&amp;index=3 |last=Sellke |first=S.

==History==
The actual term &quot;worm&quot;' was first used in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s 1975 novel, ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]''.  In that novel, Nichlas Haflinger designs and sets off a data-gathering worm in an act of revenge against the powerful men who run a national electronic information web that induces mass conformity. &quot;You have the biggest-ever worm loose in the net, and it automatically sabotages any attempt to monitor it... There's never been a worm with that tough a head or that long a tail!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Brunner |title=The Shockwave Rider |location=New York |publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1975 |isbn=0060105593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 1988, [[Robert Tappan Morris]], a [[Cornell University]] computer science graduate student, unleashed what became known as the [[Morris worm]], disrupting perhaps 10% of the computers then on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html#f4n |title=The Submarine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;During the Morris appeal process, the U.S. Court of Appeals estimated the cost of removing the virus from each installation was in the range of $200–53,000.  Possibly based on these numbers, Harvard spokesman Clifford Stoll estimated the total economic impact was between $100,000–10,000,000.  {{cite web |url=http://www.bs2.com/cvirus.htm#anchor111400 |title=Bs2.com homepage |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prompting the formation of the [[CERT Coordination Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  |url=http://www.cert.org/encyc_article/tocencyc.html |title=Security of the Internet |work=CERT/CC |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Phage mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://securitydigest.org/phage/ |title=Phage mailing list |publisher=securitydigest.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris himself became the first person tried and convicted under the 1986 [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dressler |first=J. |title=Cases and Materials on Criminal Law |chapter=United States v.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Within the field of [[computer science]], specifically in the area of [[formal languages]], the '''Chomsky hierarchy''' (occasionally referred to as '''Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy''') is a [[containment hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s.

This hierarchy of grammars was described by [[Noam Chomsky]] in&amp;nbsp;1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | year = 1956 | title = Three models for the description of language | url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/195609--.pdf| journal = IRE Transactions on Information Theory | issue = 2 | pages = 113–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also named after [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]] who played a crucial role in the development of the theory of [[formal language]]s.

== Formal grammars ==
{{main|Formal grammar}}

A formal grammar of this type consists of:

* a finite set of [[Terminal symbol|''terminal symbols'']]
* a finite set of [[Nonterminal symbol|''nonterminal symbols'']]
* a finite set of ''production rules'' with a left and a right-hand side consisting of a sequence of these symbols
* a ''start symbol''

A formal grammar defines (or ''generates'') a ''formal language'', which is a (usually infinite) set of finite-length sequences of symbols (i.e. [[String (computer science)|strings]]) that may be constructed by applying production rules to another sequence of symbols which initially contains just the start symbol.  A rule may be applied to a sequence of symbols by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on the left-hand side of the rule with those that appear on the right-hand side.  A sequence of rule applications is called a ''derivation''.  Such a grammar defines the formal language: all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol.

Nonterminals are usually represented by uppercase letters, terminals by lowercase letters, and the start symbol by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, the grammar with terminals &lt;math&gt;\{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, nonterminals &lt;math&gt;\{S, A, B\}&lt;/math&gt;, production rules
: &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;ABS&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;epsilon;  (where &amp;epsilon; is the empty string)
: &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;BS&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Bb&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;bb&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Ab&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Aa&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt;
and start symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, defines the language of all words of the form &lt;math&gt; a^n b^n &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; copies of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; followed by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; copies of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;).
The following is a simpler grammar that defines the same language: 
Terminals &lt;math&gt;\{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, Nonterminals &lt;math&gt;\{S\}&lt;/math&gt;, Start symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, Production rules
: &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;aSb&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;epsilon;

== The hierarchy ==
[[Image:Chomsky-hierarchy.svg|thumb|right|200px|alt=The Chomsky hierarchy.|Set inclusions described by the Chomsky hierarchy.]]
The Chomsky hierarchy consists of the following levels:

* Type-0 grammars ([[unrestricted grammar]]s) include all formal grammars. They generate exactly all languages that can be recognized by a [[Turing machine]]. These languages are also known as the [[recursively enumerable language]]s.  Note that this is different from the [[recursive language]]s which can be ''decided'' by an [[machine that always halts|always-halting Turing machine]].
* Type-1 grammars ([[context-sensitive grammar]]s) generate the [[context-sensitive language]]s.  These grammars have rules of the form &lt;math&gt;\alpha A\beta \rightarrow \alpha\gamma\beta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a nonterminal and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; strings of terminals and nonterminals. The strings &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; may be empty, but &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; must be nonempty.  The rule &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is allowed if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not appear on the right side of any rule.  The languages described by these grammars are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a [[linear bounded automaton]] (a nondeterministic Turing machine whose tape is bounded by a constant times the length of the input.)
* Type-2 grammars ([[context-free grammar]]s) generate the [[context-free language]]s. These are defined by rules of the form &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \gamma&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a nonterminal and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; a string of terminals and nonterminals. These languages are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic [[pushdown automaton]]. Context-free languages are the theoretical basis for the syntax of most [[programming language]]s.
* Type-3 grammars ([[regular grammar]]s) generate the [[regular language]]s.  Such a grammar restricts its rules to a single nonterminal on the left-hand side and a right-hand side consisting of a single terminal, possibly followed (or preceded, but not both in the same grammar) by a single nonterminal. The rule &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is also allowed here if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not appear on the right side of any rule.  These languages are exactly all languages that can be decided by a [[finite state automaton]]. Additionally, this family of formal languages can be obtained by [[regular expressions]]. Regular languages are commonly used to define search patterns and the lexical structure of programming languages.

Note that the set of grammars corresponding to [[recursive language]]s is not a member of this hierarchy.

Every regular language is context-free, every context-free language, not containing the empty string, is context-sensitive and every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages which are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages which are not context-free and context-free languages which are not regular.

The following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the class of language it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and the form its rules must have.

The '''Cathode Ray Tube''' ('''CRT''') is a [[vacuum tube]] containing an [[electron gun]] (a source of electrons) and a [[fluorescent]] screen, with internal or external means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam, used to create images in the form of light emitted from the fluorescent screen. The image may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures ([[television]], [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets and others.

The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep, heavy, and relatively fragile.

==History==
[[File:FuckinTV.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A common CRT used in [[computer monitor]]s and [[television set]]s]]
The experimentation of [[cathode rays]] is largely accredited to [[J.J. Thomson]], an English [[physicist]] who, in his three famous experiments, was able to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern CRT.  The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897 and is also known as the ''Braun tube''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]] with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

In 1907, Russian scientist [[Boris Rosing]] used a CRT in the receiving end of an experimental [[video signal]] to form a picture. He managed to display simple geometric shapes onto the screen, which marked the first time that CRT technology was used for what is now known as [[television]].&lt;ref name='crthistory'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/CathodeRayTube.htm |title=History of the Cathode Ray Tube |accessdate=2009-10-04 |work=About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cathode ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John B. Johnson]] (who gave his name to the term [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|Johnson noise]]) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of [[Western Electric]], and became a commercial product in 1922.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Overview==
A cathode ray tube is a [[vacuum tube]] which consists of one or more electron guns, possibly internal electrostatic deflection plates, and a phosphor target.&lt;ref name='crthistory' /&gt; In [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.&lt;ref name='workings'&gt;{{Cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.&lt;ref name='workings' /&gt;

[[Image:Egun.jpg|thumb|Electron gun]]

==Oscilloscope CRTs==
In [[oscilloscope]] CRTs, [[electrostatic deflection]] is used, rather than the magnetic deflection commonly used with television and other large CRTs. The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an electric field between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below.  Oscilloscopes use electrostatic rather than magnetic deflection because the inductive reactance of the magnetic coils would limit the frequency response of the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.jfet.org/vclk/ |title=Oscilloscope CRT Clock |accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4667135/fulltext.html |title=US Patent 4667135 - Z-axis orthogonality compensation system for an oscilloscope |accessdate=2009-10-04 |last=Bristol |first=Lloyd R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wps.aw.com/wps/media/objects/877/898586/topics/topic07.pdf |title=The Cathode-Ray Tube |accessdate=2009-10-05 |publisher=Pearson Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosphor persistence===
Various phosphors are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application.  The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen.  Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one microsecond to several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doebelin | first = Ernest | authorlink = | title = Measurement Systems | publisher = McGraw Hill Professional | year = 2003 | page = 972 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=q1mOopLHnTEC&amp;pg=PA972#v=onepage&amp;q= | doi = | isbn = 007292201X, 9780072922011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For visual observation of brief transient events, a long persistence phosphor may be desirable.  For events which are fast and repetitive, or high frequency, a short-persistence phosphor is generally preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Shionoya | first = Shigeo | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Phosphor handbook | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1999 | page = 499 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=lWlcJEDukRIC&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q= | doi = | isbn = 0849375606, 9780849375606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microchannel plate===
When displaying fast one-shot events the electron beam must deflect very quickly, with few electrons impinging on the screen; leading to a faint or invisible image on the display. Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a [[micro-channel plate]] just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of [[secondary emission]] this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness), and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Williams | first = Jim | title = Analog circuit design: art, science, and personalities | publisher = Newnes | year = 1991 | pages = 115–116 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=CFoEAP2lwLEC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q= | isbn = 0750696400, 9780750696401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Yen | first = William M. | authorlink = | coauthors = Shigeo Shionoya, Hajime Yamamoto | title = Practical Applications of Phosphors | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2006 | page = 211 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=cKMSf0iRVSgC&amp;pg=PA211 | isbn = 1420043692, 9781420043693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graticules===
Most oscilloscopes have a [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements.  The graticule  may be permanently marked inside the face of the CRT, or it may be a transparent external plate.  External graticules are typically made of glass or [[Acrylic glass|acrylic]] plastic.   An internal graticule provides an advantage in that it eliminates [[parallax]] error.  Unlike an external graticule, an internal graticule can not be changed to accommodate different types of measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bakshi | first = U.A. | authorlink = | coauthors = A.P.Godse | title = Electronic Devices And Circuits | publisher = Technical Publications | year = 2008 | page = 38 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=uJaQML8-MggC&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q= | isbn = 8184313322, 9788184313321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oscilloscopes commonly provide a means for the graticule to be side-illuminated, which improves its visibility when used in a darkened room or when shaded by a camera hood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hickman | first = Ian | title = Oscilloscopes: how to use them, how they work | publisher = Newnes | year = 2001 | page = 47 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=O2oj04vbQqgC&amp;pg=PA47 | isbn = 0750647574, 9780750647571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color CRTs==
[[Image:CRT phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]
Color tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in [[aperture grille]] designs) or clusters called [[Triad (computers)|&quot;triads&quot;]] (as in [[shadow mask]] CRTs).&lt;ref name='crtmonitorwork'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/03/20/how_crt_and_lcd_monitors_work/1 |title=How CRT and LCD monitors work |accessdate=2009-10-04 |work=bit-tech.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; Color CRTs have three electron guns, one for each primary color, arranged either in a straight line or in a triangular configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor.&lt;ref name='maskgrill'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtMask-c.html |title=The Shadow Mask and Aperture Grill |accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[shadow mask]] tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube.&lt;ref name='crtmonitorwork' /&gt; Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] to achieve the same result.&lt;ref name='maskgrill' /&gt;

===Convergence in color CRTs===
The three beams in color CRTs would not strike the screen at the same point without convergence calibration. Instead, the set would need to be manually adjusted to converge the three color beams together to maintain color accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/ |title=Picture This|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degaussing===
Most CRT television sets and computer monitors have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) coil, which upon power-up creates a brief, alternating magnetic field which decays in strength over the course of a few seconds. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove most cases of shadow mask magnetization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vector monitors==
{{Main|Vector monitor}}
Vector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (game)|Asteroids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971-1984 | author = Van Burnham | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0262524201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster.

==CRT resolution==
[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moiré]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moiré Interference Patterns |accessdate=2009-10-04 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré, however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=2009-10-04 |work=HowStuffWorks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gamma==
CRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and light intensity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=2009-10-04 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=2005-01-01 |work=BroadcastEngineering }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of CRTs==
===Cat's eye===
In better quality tube radio sets a tuning guide consisting of a phosphor tube was used to aid the tuning adjustment. This was also known as a &quot;Magic Eye&quot; or &quot;Tuning Eye&quot;. Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |title=Tuning-Eye Tubes |accessdate=2009-12-01 |publisher=vacuumtube.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter.

===Charactrons===
Some displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used [[Charactron]] CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=CATHODE RAY APPARATUS|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nimo===
[[Image:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]
Nimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by [http://www.ieeinc.com Industrial Electronics Engineers]. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g. [[nixie tube]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s [[Philips|Philips Research Laboratories]] experimented with a type of thin CRT known as the ''Zeus'' display which contained CRT-like functionality in a flat panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6246165/description.html |title=US Patent 6246165 - Magnetic channel cathode}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5905336.html |title=Method of manufacturing a glass substrate coated with a metal oxide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V4J-3VV129M-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=85903dcc1530f04c1a1b55e312bb0621 |title=Introduction to Zeus displays}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V4J-3VV129M-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3e4826dd7116e854524755625e0ea1b3 |title=Transport and extraction in Zeus displays}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V4J-3VV129M-H&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1211459030&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=5672ed5413999f1805b40c4ad352ce5e |title=The application and system aspects of the Zeus display}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title =  Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, Volume 131 | author = Hawkes, Peter W. | publisher =[[Elsevier]][[Academic Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devices were demonstrated but never marketed.

==The future of CRT technology==
===Demise===
Although a mainstay of display technology for decades, the demand for CRT screens has dropped precipitously since 2000, and this falloff has been accelerating in the latter half of that decade. The rapid advances and falling prices of [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[flat panel]] technology, first for computer monitors and then for televisions, has been the key factor in the demise of competing display technologies such as CRT, [[rear-projection television|rear-projection]], and [[plasma display]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wong|first=May|title=Flat Panels Drive Old TVs From Market |publisher=AP via USA Today |date= October 22, 2006 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2006-10-22-crt-demise_x.htm |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of most high-end CRT production by around 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.veritasetvisus.com/LCDTVA/LCDTVA-8,%20Spring-Summer%202009.pdf |title= The Standard TV|publisher= Veritas et Visus |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including high-end Sony and Mitsubishi product lines) means an erosion of the CRT's capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060120/news_1n20sony.html |title=End of an era |publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2005/12/01/matsushita-says-good-bye-to-crts/ |title=Matsushita says good-bye to CRTs |publisher=engadgetHD |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada and the United States, the sale and production of high-end CRT TVs (30-inch screens) in these markets has all but ended by 2007; just a couple years later inexpensive combo CRT TVs (20-inch screens with an integrated VHS or DVD player) have disappeared from discount stores. It has been common to replace CRT-based televisions and monitors in as little as 5–6 years, although they generally are capable of satisfactory performance for a much longer time.

Companies are responding to this trend. Electronics retailers such as Best Buy have been steadily reducing store spaces for CRTs. In 2005, Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays. Samsung did not introduce any CRT models for the 2008 model year at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show and on February 4, 2008 Samsung removed their 30&quot; wide screen CRTs from their North American website and has not replaced them with new models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&amp;type=televisions&amp;subtype=slimfithdtv |title=SlimFit HDTV|publisher=Samsung |accessdate=2008-06-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080110164950/http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&amp;type=televisions&amp;subtype=slimfithdtv &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demise of CRT, however, has been happening more slowly in the developing world.  According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[DSG International (retailer)|DSG (Dixons)]], the largest retailer of domestic electronic equipment, reported that CRT models made up 80–90% of the volume of televisions sold at Christmas 2004 and 15–20% a year later, and that they were expected to be less than 5% at the end of 2006. Dixons ceased selling CRT televisions in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The future is flat as Dixons withdraws sale of 'big box' televisions |publisher=London Evening Standard |date= November 26, 2006 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23376023-details/The+future+is+flat+as+Dixons+withdraws+sale+of+'big+box'+televisions/article.do |accessdate=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
CRTs, despite recent advances, have remained relatively heavy and bulky and take up a lot of space in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens have much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size, and so it becomes impractical to have CRTs larger than {{convert|40|in|cm|0}}. The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] and plasma flat-panels which allow them to easily surpass {{convert|40|in|cm|0}} as well as being thin and wall-mountable, two key features that were increasingly being demanded by consumers. 

By 2006, although the price points of CRTs are generally much lower than LCD and plasma flat panels, large screen CRTs (30-inches or more) are as expensive as a similar-sized LCD. While LCDs are generally the most expensive TV display technology, major innovations have caused prices to drop significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2006-10-22-crt-demise_x.htm | work=USA Today | first=May | last=Wong | title=Flat panels drive old TVs from market | date=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monochrome]] CRTs are even more efficient than color CRTs. This is because up to 2/3 of the [[backlight]] power of LCD and rear-projection displays are lost to the RGB stripe filter. Most LCDs also have poorer color rendition and can change color with [[viewing angle]], though modern [[patterned vertical alignment|PVA]] and [[in-plane switching|IPS]] LCDs have greatly attenuated these problems.

===Resurgence in specialized markets===
In the first quarter of 2008, CRTs retook the #2 technology position in North America from plasma, due to the decline and consolidation of [[plasma display]] manufacturers. DisplaySearch has reported that although in the 4Q of 2007 LCDs surpassed CRTs in worldwide sales, CRTs then outsold LCDs in the 1Q of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/02/19/worldwide-lcd-tv-shipments-surpass-crts-for-first-time-ever/ |title=Worldwide LCD TV shipments surpass CRTs for first time ever |publisher=engadgetHD |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/05/22/lcd-outsells-plasma-8-to-1-in-q1-2008/ |title=LCD outsells plasma 8-to-1 in Q1 2008 |publisher=engadgetHD |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRTs are useful for displaying photos with high pixels per unit area and correct [[color balance]]. LCDs, as currently the most common flatscreen technology, have generally inferior [[color rendition]] (despite having greater overall [[luminosity|brightness]]) due to the [[fluorescent light]]s commonly used as a [[backlight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/monitors/display/lcd-guide_11.html |title=X-bit's Guide: Contemporary LCD Monitor Parameters and Characteristics (page 11) |accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRTs are still popular in the printing and broadcasting industries as well as in the professional video, photography, and graphics fields due to their greater color fidelity, [[display contrast|contrast]], and better viewing from off-axis (wider [[viewing angle]]). CRTs also still find adherents in [[video gaming]] because of their higher resolution per initial cost, lowest possible input lag, fast response time, and multiple [[native resolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/97928.shtml |title=14 Gaming Myths Exposed |publisher=GamePro.com |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health concerns==
{{see also|Electronic waste}}

===Ionizing radiation===
CRTs can emit a small amount of [[X-ray]] radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered unharmful. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Röntgen|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13 µC/(kg·h) or 36 pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=SUBCHAPTER J--RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=April 1, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicity===
Color and monochrome CRTs may contain toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=2010-04-13 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf | title = Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health | accessdate = 2011-01-20 | last = Peters-Michaud | first = Neil | coauthors = John Katers, Jim Barry | format = PDF | work = Cascade Asset Management, LLC | publisher = Basel Action Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=2010-04-13 |publisher=American Elements }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=CHARACTERIZATION OF LEAD LEACHABILITY FROM CATHODE RAY TUBES USING THE TOXICITY CHARACTERISTIC LEACHING PROCEDURE|accessdate=2009-10-04 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead, though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass.  Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA tests.

In October 2001, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the EPA began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, disposal of CRT televisions and monitors is covered by the [[WEEE Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |title=WEEE and CRT Processing |accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flicker===
At low [[refresh rate]]s (below 50 [[Hertz|Hz]]), the periodic scanning of the display may produce an irritating flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with [[peripheral vision]]. A high refresh rate (above 72&amp;nbsp;Hz) reduces the effect. Computer displays and televisions with CRTs driven by digital electronics often use refresh rates of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz or more to largely eliminate any perception of flicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcmech.com/article/crt-monitor-flickering/|title=CRT Monitor Flickering?|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-computer CRTs or CRT for [[sonar]] or [[radar]] may have long persistence phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence  is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.

===High-frequency noise===
CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&amp;nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&amp;nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Netravali | first = Arun N. | coauthors = Barry G. Haskell | title = Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards | publisher = Plenum Publishing Corporation | year = 1995 | page = 100 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q= | isbn = 030644917X, 9780306449178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; some people will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core of the [[flyback transformer]].

===Implosion===
A high [[vacuum]] exists within all cathode ray  tubes, putting the envelope under relatively high stress. If the outer glass envelope is damaged, the glass will break and pieces will fly out at high speed. While modern Cathode Ray Tubes used in televisions and computer displays have [[epoxy]]-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs removed from equipment must be handled carefully to avoid personal injury.&lt;ref name='Bali'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bali | first = S.P. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Colour Television: Theory and Practice | publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill | date = 1994-06-01 | location = | page = 129 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=53nnX4fnnNIC&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q= | doi = | id = | isbn = 0074600249, 9780074600245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security concerns==
Under some circumstances, the signal radiated from the [[electron gun]]s, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured and used to remotely reconstruct what is shown on the CRT, using a process called [[Van Eck phreaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf|title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk?|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special [[TEMPEST]] shielding can mitigate this effect. Such radiation of a potentially exploitable signal however occurs also with LCDs and with all electronics in general.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Recycling==
As [[electronic waste]], CRTs are considered one of the hardest types to recycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.executiveblueprints.com/aboutweee/WEEECRTandMonitor.htm&lt;/ref&gt; CRTs have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphorus, both of which are necessary for the display.  There are several companies in the United States that charge a small fee to collect CRTs, then subsidize their labor by selling the harvested [[copper]], [[wire]], and [[printed circuit boards]]. Leaded CRT glass is sold to get remelted into other CRTs, or even broken down and used in road construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyfederation.org/PDF/14_CRTDilemma.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Two other uses|crystalline solids|the type of glass|lead crystal}}
[[File:Unknown Quartz crystal 66.JPG|thumb|[[Quartz]] crystal. The individual grains of this polycrystalline mineral sample are clearly visible.]]
A '''crystal''' or '''crystalline solid''' is a [[solid]] material whose constituent [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, or [[ion]]s are arranged in an [[order and disorder (physics)|orderly]] repeating pattern extending in all three [[spatial dimensions]]. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as [[crystallography]]. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of [[crystal growth]] is called [[crystallization]] or [[solidification]].
The word ''crystal'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{polytonic|κρύσταλλος}} ({{transl|grc|''krustallos''}}), meaning both “ice” and “[[Quartz#Varieties (according to color)|rock crystal]]”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkru%2Fstallos κρύσταλλος], [[Henry George Liddell]], [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from {{polytonic|κρύος}} ({{transl|grc|''kruos''}}), “icy cold, frost”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkru%2Fos κρύος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2000|contribution=Kreus|contribution-url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE243.html|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition: Appendix I: Indo-European Roots|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most common metals are [[polycrystal]]s. Crystals are often symmetrically intergrown to form [[crystal twin]]s.

==Crystal structure==
[[File:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|[[Insulin]] crystals [[space manufacturing|grown in outer space]]]]
[[File:Halite(Salt)USGOV.jpg|thumb|[[Halite]] (sodium chloride) - a single, large crystal.]]
The process of forming a crystalline structure from a fluid or from materials dissolved in the fluid is often referred to as the '''[[crystallization]]''' process. In the old example referenced by the root meaning of the word crystal, water being cooled undergoes a phase change from liquid to solid beginning with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a polycrystalline structure. The physical properties of the ice depend on the size and arrangement of the individual crystals, or grains, and the same may be said of metals solidifying from a molten state. 

Which [[crystal structure]] the [[fluid]] will form depends on the [[chemistry]] of the fluid, the conditions under which it is being solidified, and also on the [[ambient pressure]]. While the cooling process usually results in the generation of a crystalline material, under certain conditions, the fluid may be frozen in a noncrystalline state. In most cases, this involves cooling the fluid so rapidly that [[atoms]] cannot travel to their [[Bravais lattice|lattice]] sites before they lose mobility. A noncrystalline material, which has no [[long-range order]], is called an [[amorphous]], vitreous, or [[glass]]y material. It is also often referred to as an amorphous solid, although there are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the [[latent heat of fusion]]. 

Crystalline structures occur in all classes of materials, with all types of [[chemical bond]]s. Almost all [[metallic bond|metal]] exists in a polycrystalline state; amorphous or single-crystal metals must be produced synthetically, often with great difficulty. [[ionic bond|Ionically bonded]] crystals can form upon solidification of [[salt]]s, either from a [[molten]] fluid or upon crystallization from a solution. [[Covalent]]ly bonded crystals are also very common, notable examples being [[diamond]], [[silica]], and [[graphite]]. [[Polymer]] materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization. Weak [[van der Waals force]]s&lt;!-- &quot;van&quot;, see [[Talk:Van der Waals#Van should be capitalized unless preceded by first name]] rebuttal --&gt; can also play a role in a crystal structure; for example, this type of bonding loosely holds together the [[hexagonal]]-patterned sheets in graphite.

Most crystalline materials have a variety of [[crystallographic defect]]s. The types and structures of these defects may have a profound effect on the properties of the materials.

==Crystalline phases==

*[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For example, water [[ice]] is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form [[Ice Ih|Ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]], but can also exist as the cubic [[ice Ic|Ice I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]], the [[rhombohedral]] [[ice II]], and many other forms.
*[[Amorphous]] phases are also possible with the same molecule, such as [[amorphous ice]]. In this case, the phenomenon is known as [[polyamorphism]].
*For pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as [[allotropy]]. For example, [[diamond]], [[graphite]], and [[fullerene]]s are different allotropes of [[carbon]].

Since the initial discovery of crystal-like individual arrays of atoms that are not regularly repeated, made in 1982 by [[Dan Shechtman]], the acceptance of the concept and the word [[quasicrystal]] have led the [[International Union of Crystallography]] to redefine the term crystal to mean &quot;any solid having an essentially discrete diffraction diagram&quot;, thereby shifting the essential attribute of crystallinity from [[Euclidean space|position space]] to [[Frequency domain|Fourier space]]. Within the family of crystals one distinguishes between traditional crystals, which are periodic, or repeating, at the atomic scale, and aperiodic (incommensurate) crystals which are not. This broader definition adopted in 1996 reflects the current understanding that microscopic periodicity is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for crystals.

While the term &quot;crystal&quot; has a precise meaning within [[materials science]] and [[solid-state physics]], colloquially &quot;crystal&quot; refers to solid objects that exhibit well-defined and often pleasing geometric shapes. In this sense of the word, many types of crystals are found in nature. The shape of these crystals is dependent on the types of molecular bonds between the atoms to determine the structure, as well as on the conditions under which they formed. [[Snowflake]]s, diamonds, and table [[salt]] are common examples of crystals.

Some crystalline materials may exhibit special electrical properties such as the [[ferroelectric effect]] or the [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]]. Additionally, [[light]] passing through a crystal is often [[Refraction|refracted]] or bent in different directions, producing an array of [[color]]s; [[crystal optics]] is the study of these effects. In periodic [[dielectric]] structures a range of unique optical properties can be expected as seen in [[photonic crystal]]s.

==Occurrence in nature==
By volume and weight the largest concentrations of crystals in the earth are part the Earth's solid bedrock. Here crystals have formed by [[magmatic]] and [[metamorphic]] processes giving origin to large masses of [[crystalline rock]]. Other crystals have formed out of precipitation from fluids, commonly water, to form [[druse (geology)|druse]]s or [[quartz]] veins. Water [[ice]] in form of [[Snow]], [[sea ice]] and glaciers are also very common occurrences of crystalline matter on earth. Many living [[organism]] are able to produce crystals, for example [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] in the case of most [[mollusc]]s or [[hydroxylapatite]] in the case of [[vertebrate]]s.

===Rocks===
[[Inorganic]] [[matter]], if free to take that [[physical state]] in which it is most stable, tends to crystallize. There is no practical limit to the size a crystal may attain under the right conditions, and [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] [[single crystal]]s in excess of 10 m are found in the [[Cave of the Crystals]] in Naica, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text National Geographic, 2008. Cavern of Crystal Giants]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crystalline [[rock (geology)|rock]] masses have consolidated from [[aqueous]] [[solution]] or from molten [[magma]]. The vast majority of [[igneous rocks]] belong to this group and the degree of crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as [[granite]], which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized, but many [[lavas]] were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly; in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or [[glass]]y matter is frequent. Other crystalline rocks, the [[evaporite]]s such as [[rock salt]], [[gypsum]] and some [[limestone]]s have been deposited from aqueous solution, mostly owing to [[evaporation]] in [[arid]] [[climate]]s. Still another group, the [[metamorphic rocks]] which includes the [[marble]]s, [[mica-schist]]s and [[quartzite]]s; are recrystallized, that is to say, they were at first fragmental rocks, like [[limestone]], [[shale]] and [[sandstone]] and have never been in a [[molten]] condition nor entirely in solution. The high temperature and pressure conditions of [[metamorphism]] have acted on them erasing their original structures, and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{1911|article=Petrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water ice===
Water [[ice]] in form of [[Snow]], [[sea ice]] and glaciers are very common occurrences of crystalline matter on earth.

===Organigenic crystals===
Many living [[organism]] are able to produce crystals for example [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] in the case of most [[mollusc]]s or [[hydroxylapatite]] in the case of [[vertebrate]]s.

'''Cytosine''' ('''C''') is one of the four main bases found in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], along with [[adenine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]] ([[uracil]] in RNA). It is a [[pyrimidine]] derivative, with a [[heterocyclic]] [[aromatic ring]] and two substituents attached (an [[amine]] group at position 4 and a [[Ketone|keto]] group at position 2). The [[nucleoside]] of cytosine is [[cytidine]].  In Watson-Crick [[base pair]]ing, it forms three hydrogen bonds with [[guanine]].

==History==
Cytosine was discovered by [[Albrecht Kossel]] in 1894 when it was hydrolysed from calf [[thymus]] tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Kossel, A.; Steudel, H. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1903, 38, 49&lt;/ref&gt; A structure was proposed in 1903, and was synthesized (and thus confirmed) in the laboratory in the same year.

Cytosine recently found use in [[quantum computation]]. The first time any
[[quantum]] mechanical properties were harnessed to process [[information]]
took place on August 1st in 1998 when researchers at Oxford implemented [[David Deutsch|David Deutsch's]] [[Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm|algorithm]] on a two [[qubit]] NMRQC ([[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]] Quantum Computer) based on the cytosine [[molecule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jones | first = J.A. | coauthors = M. Mosca | title = Implementation of a quantum algorithm on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer | journal = J.Chem.Phys | volume = 109| issue = 109 | pages = 1648–1653 | publisher = | date = 1998-08-01 | url = http://www.citebase.org/abstract?id=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Aquant-ph%2F9801027 | doi = 10.1063/1.476739 | id = | accessdate = 2007-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical reactions==
[[File:Cytosine chemical structure.svg|thumb|left|100px|Cytosine with numbered components. [[Methylation]] occurs on carbon nr 5.]]
Cytosine can be found as part of DNA, as part of RNA, or as a part of a [[nucleotide]]. As [[cytidine triphosphate]] (CTP), it can act as a co-factor to enzymes, and can transfer a phosphate to convert [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) to [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).

In DNA and RNA, cytosine is paired with [[guanine]]. However, it is inherently unstable, and can change into [[uracil]] ([[deamination|spontaneous deamination]]). This can lead to a [[point mutation]] if not repaired by the [[DNA repair]] [[enzymes]] such as uracil glycosylase, which cleaves a uracil in DNA. 

Cytosine can also be [[methylated]] into [[5-methylcytosine]] by an enzyme called [[DNA methyltransferase]] or be methylated and [[hydroxylated]] to make [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]].
Active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases could have both beneficial and detrimental implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chahwan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author= Chahwan R., Wontakal S.N., and Roa S.| title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination| journal=Trends in Genetics| volume = 26| pages = 443–448| year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005| pmid = 20800313| issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Computational chemistry''' is a branch of [[chemistry]] that uses principles of [[computer science]] to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses the results of [[theoretical chemistry]], incorporated into efficient [[computer program]]s, to calculate the structures and properties of [[molecule]]s and solids. Its necessity arises from the well-known fact that apart from relatively recent results concerning the [[Dihydrogen cation|hydrogen molecular ion]] (see references therein for more details), the quantum [[n-body problem]] cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.  While its results normally complement the information obtained by chemical [[experiment]]s, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical [[phenomena]]. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.

Examples of such properties are structure (i.e. the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and [[interaction energy|relative]] (interaction) [[energy|energies]], [[electron]]ic [[charge density|charge distribution]]s, [[dipole]]s and higher [[multipole moment]]s, [[vibrational spectroscopy|vibrational frequencies]], [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] or other [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] quantities, and [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for [[scattering theory|collision]] with other particles.

The methods employed cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied.  That system can be a single molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid.  Computational chemistry methods range from highly accurate to very approximate; highly accurate methods are typically feasible only for small systems. [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''Ab initio'' methods]] are based entirely on theory from first principles.  Other (typically less accurate) methods are called empirical or semi-empirical because they employ experimental results, often from acceptable models of atoms or related molecules, to approximate some elements of the underlying theory.

Both ''ab initio'' and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations.  These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, [[periodic boundary conditions]]), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all.  For example, most ''ab initio'' calculations make the [[Born&amp;ndash;Oppenheimer approximation]], which greatly simplifies the underlying [[Schrödinger equation]] by freezing the nuclei in place during the calculation.  In principle, [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' methods]] eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced.  In practice, however, it is impossible to eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains.  The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable.

In some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the long-time [[phase space]] behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the potential energy surface are employed, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of [[molecular dynamics]]. Furthermore, [[cheminformatics]] uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like [[machine learning]] based on physicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.

==History==
Building on the founding discoveries and theories in the [[history of quantum mechanics]], the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] in 1927. The books that were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Edgar Bright Wilson|E. Bright Wilson]]'s 1935 ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics – with Applications to Chemistry'', [[Henry Eyring|Eyring]], Walter and Kimball's 1944 ''Quantum Chemistry'', Heitler's 1945 ''Elementary Wave Mechanics – with Applications to Quantum Chemistry'', and later [[Charles Coulson|Coulson]]'s 1952 textbook ''Valence'', each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow.

With the development of efficient [[computer]] technology in the 1940s, the solutions of elaborate [[wave equation]]s for complex [[atom]]ic systems began to be a realizable objective.  In the early 1950s, the first semi-empirical atomic orbital calculations were carried out. Theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers. A very detailed account of such use in the United Kingdom is given by Smith and Sutcliffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = S. J. | coauthors = Sutcliffe B. T., | title = The development of Computational Chemistry in the United Kingdom | journal = Reviews in Computational Chemistry | volume = 70 | pages = 271–316 | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''ab initio'' [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] calculations on diatomic molecules were carried out in 1956 at MIT, using a [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]] of [[Slater orbital]]s. For diatomic molecules, a systematic study using a minimum basis set and the first calculation with a larger basis set were published by Ransil and Nesbet respectively in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schaefer | first =Henry F. III | title = The electronic structure of atoms and molecules | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. | year = 1972 | pages = 146 | location = Reading, Massachusetss }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first polyatomic calculations using Gaussian orbitals were carried out in the late 1950s. The first [[configuration interaction]] calculations were carried out in Cambridge on the [[EDSAC]] computer in the 1950s using [[Gaussian orbital]]s by [[Francis Boys|Boys]] and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boys | first = S. F. | coauthors = Cook G. B., Reeves C.

G. | coauthors = Walker T. E. H and Hinkley R. K. | title = A bibliography of ''ab initio'' molecular wave functions | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1971 | location = Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest molecules included were [[naphthalene]] and [[azulene]].&lt;ref&gt;Preuss, H. (1968). [[International Journal of Quantum Chemistry]] 2: 651.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buenker, R. J.; Peyerimhoff S. D. (1969). [[Chemical Physics Letters]] 3: 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Abstracts of many earlier developments in ''ab initio'' theory have been published by Schaefer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schaefer | first =Henry F.

In 1964, [[Hückel method]] calculations (using a simple [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) method for the determination of electron energies of molecular orbitals of π electrons in conjugated hydrocarbon systems) of molecules ranging in complexity from [[butadiene]] and [[benzene]] to [[ovalene]], were generated on computers at Berkeley and Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Streitwieser | first =A. | coauthors = Brauman J. I. and [[Charles Coulson|Coulson]] C. A. | title = Supplementary Tables of Molecular Orbital Calculations | publisher =Pergamon Press | year = 1965 | location = Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt; These empirical methods were replaced in the 1960s by [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical methods]] such as [[CNDO/2|CNDO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pople | first = John A.

In the early 1970s, efficient ''ab initio'' computer programs such as ATMOL, [[GAUSSIAN]], IBMOL, and POLYAYTOM, began to be used to speed up ''ab initio'' calculations of molecular orbitals. Of these four programs, only GAUSSIAN, now massively expanded, is still in use, but many other programs are now in use. At the same time, the methods of [[molecular mechanics]], such as [[Force field (chemistry)|MM2]], were developed, primarily by [[Norman Allinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allinger | first = Norman | authorlink = Norman Allinger

One of the first mentions of the term &quot;computational chemistry&quot; can be found in the 1970 book ''Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences'' by Sidney Fernbach and Abraham Haskell Taub, where they state &quot;It seems, therefore, that 'computational chemistry' can finally be more and more of a reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fernbach | first = Sidney | coauthors = Taub, Abraham Haskell | title = Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences | publisher = Routledge | year = 1970 | isbn = 0677140304}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, widely different methods began to be seen as part of a new emerging discipline of ''computational chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/bookhome/114034476 Reviews in Computational Chemistry vol 1, preface]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Journal of Computational Chemistry]]'' was first published in 1980.

==Fields of application==

The term ''theoretical chemistry'' may be defined as a mathematical description of chemistry, whereas ''computational chemistry'' is usually used when a mathematical method is sufficiently well developed that it can be automated for implementation on a computer. In theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists and mathematicians develop [[algorithm]]s and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for [[chemical reaction]]s. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.

There are two different aspects to computational chemistry:
* Computational studies can be carried out to find a starting point for a laboratory synthesis, or to assist in understanding experimental data, such as the position and source of spectroscopic peaks.
* Computational studies can be used to predict the possibility of so far entirely unknown molecules or to explore reaction mechanisms that are not readily studied by experimental means.

Thus, computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects.

Several major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry:
* The prediction of the molecular structure of molecules by the use of the simulation of forces, or more accurate quantum chemical methods, to find stationary points on the energy surface as the position of the nuclei is varied.
* Storing and searching for data on chemical entities (see [[chemical database]]s).
* Identifying [[correlation]]s between [[chemical structure]]s and properties (see [[QSPR]] and [[QSAR]]).
* Computational approaches to help in the efficient synthesis of compounds.
* Computational approaches to design molecules that interact in specific ways with other molecules (e.g. [[drug design]] and [[catalysis]]).

==Accuracy==

The words ''exact'' and ''perfect'' do not appear here, as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly. However, almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme.

Molecules consist of nuclei and electrons, so the methods of [[quantum mechanics]] apply. Computational chemists often attempt to solve the non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]], with relativistic corrections added, although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic [[Dirac equation]]. In principle, it is possible to solve the Schrödinger equation in either its time-dependent or time-independent form, as appropriate for the problem in hand; in practice, this is not possible except for very small systems. Therefore, a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

Accuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in [[ab initio]] models comprising many electrons, due to the computational expense of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with sufficient accuracy. Errors for energies can be less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen electrons is computationally tractable by approximate methods such as [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

There is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions, such as those in biochemistry. Large molecules can be studied by semi-empirical approximate methods. Even larger molecules are treated by [[classical mechanics]] methods that employ what are called [[molecular mechanics]].  In QM/MM methods, small portions of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the remainder is treated approximately (MM).

== Methods ==
A single molecular formula can represent a number of molecular isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the [[potential energy surface]]) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei. A stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the stationary point is a [[Transition state|transition structure]] and the coordinate is the [[reaction coordinate]]. This process of determining stationary points is called geometry optimization.

The determination of molecular structure by geometry optimization became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.

The total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, usually with no relativistic terms included, and by making use of the [[Born&amp;ndash;Oppenheimer approximation]], which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions, thereby simplifying the Schrödinger equation. This leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei. A notable exception are certain approaches called [[direct quantum chemistry]], which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing. Density functional methods and semi-empirical methods are variants on the major theme. For very large systems, the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics. The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are:

=== ''Ab initio'' methods ===
{{Main|Ab initio quantum chemistry methods}}

The programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different [[quantum chemistry|quantum-chemical]] methods that solve the molecular [[Schrödinger equation]] associated with the [[molecular Hamiltonian]]. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; are called ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]''. This does not imply that the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods have to be employed, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best that is possible with a finite word length on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).

[[Image:Electron correlation.png|thumb|right|300px|Diagram illustrating various ''ab initio'' electronic structure methods in terms of energy. Spacings are not to scale.]]

The simplest type of ''ab initio'' electronic structure calculation is the [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] (HF) scheme, an extension of [[molecular orbital theory]], in which the correlated electron&amp;ndash;electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect is included in the calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock limit. Many types of calculations (known as [[post-Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] methods) begin with a Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron&amp;ndash;electron repulsion, referred to also as [[electronic correlation]]. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. In order to obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-orbit coupling|spin orbit]] terms, both of which are only really important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, in addition to the choice of method, it is necessary to choose a [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|LCAO]] [[ansatz]]. Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.

The Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant. In some cases, particularly for bond breaking processes, this is quite inadequate, and several [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field|configurations]] need to be used. Here, the coefficients of the configurations and the coefficients of the basis functions are optimized together.

The total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the [[molecular geometry]]; in other words, the [[potential energy surface]]. Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics. The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different [[isomer]]s and the [[Transition state theory|transition structure]]s for conversion between isomers, but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface.

A particularly important objective, called computational [[thermochemistry]], is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]] to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol or 4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called [[quantum chemistry composite methods]].

=== Density functional methods ===
{{Main|Density functional theory}}

Density functional theory (DFT) methods are often considered to be ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]'' for determining the molecular electronic structure, even though many of the most common [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]s use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-[[electronic density|electron density]] rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock exchange term and are known as
[[hybrid functional]] methods.

=== Semi-empirical and empirical methods ===
{{Main|Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods}}

Semi-empirical [[quantum chemistry]] methods are based on the [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data. They are very important in computational chemistry for treating large molecules where the full Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock method without the approximations is too expensive. The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.

Semi-empirical methods follow what are often called empirical methods, where the two-electron part of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is not explicitly included. For π-electron systems, this was the [[Hückel method]] proposed by [[Erich Hückel]], and for all valence electron systems, the [[Extended Huckel method|extended Hückel method]] proposed by [[Roald Hoffmann]].

=== Molecular mechanics ===
{{Main|Molecular mechanics}}

In many cases, large molecular systems can be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely. [[Molecular mechanics]] simulations, for example, use a single classical expression for the energy of a compound, for instance the [[harmonic oscillator]]. All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or ''ab initio'' calculations.

The database of compounds used for parameterization, i.e., the resulting set of parameters and functions is called the [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations. A force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules, for instance proteins, would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class.

These methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules, and allow studies of the approach and interaction (docking) of potential drug molecules (e.g. [http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf] and [http://www.bio-balance.com/GPCR_Activation.pdf]).

=== Methods for solids ===
{{Main|Computational chemical methods in solid state physics}}

Computational chemical methods can be applied to [[solid state physics]] problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.

=== Chemical dynamics ===
Once the electronic and [[molecular geometry|nuclear]] variables are [[separation of variables|separated]] (within the Born&amp;ndash;Oppenheimer representation), in the time-dependent approach, the [[wave packet]] corresponding to the nuclear [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] is propagated via the [[time evolution]] [[operator (physics)]] associated to the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] (for the full [[molecular Hamiltonian]]). In the [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]] energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the [[scattering theory]] formalism. The potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the [[potential energy surface]]s. In general, the [[potential energy surface]]s are coupled via the [[vibronic coupling]] terms.

The most popular methods for propagating the [[wave packet]] associated to the [[molecular geometry]] are:
* the [[split operator technique]],
* the [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev (real) polynomial]],
* the [[multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree]] method (MCTDH),
* the [[semiclassical]] method.

=== Molecular dynamics ===
{{Main|Molecular dynamics}}

Molecular dynamics (MD) uses [[Newton's laws of motion]] to examine the time-dependent behavior of systems, including vibrations or Brownian motion, using a classical mechanical description. MD combined with [[density functional theory]] leads to the [[Car&amp;ndash;Parrinello method]].

== Interpreting molecular wave functions ==

The [[atoms in molecules]] model developed by [[Richard Bader]] was developed in order to effectively link the quantum mechanical picture of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful older models such as the theory of [[Lewis pair]]s and the [[Valence bond theory|valence bond model]]. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful models are connected with the [[topology]] of the quantum charge density. This method improves on the use of [[Mulliken population analysis]].

== Software packages ==
There are many  self-sufficient [[:Category:Computational chemistry software|software packages]] used by computational chemists. Some include many methods covering a wide range, while others concentrating on a very specific range or even a single method. Details of most of them can be found in:
* [[Biomolecular]] modelling programs: [[List of protein structure prediction software|proteins]], [[List of nucleic acid simulation software|nucleic acid]].
* [[List of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Molecular mechanics]] programs.

'''''Crash'''''  is a novel by English author [[J. G. Ballard]], first published in 1973. It is a story about [[symphorophilia]] or [[Traffic collision|car-crash]] [[sexual fetishism]]: its protagonists become sexually aroused by staging and participating in real car-crashes.  The novel was written in a highly sensationalized manner.

It was a highly controversial novel: famously one [[publisher's reader]] returned the verdict &quot;This author is beyond psychiatric help. Do Not Publish!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Svendsen]], ''A Philosophy of Boredom'', trans. John Irons (London: Reaktion Books, 2005), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was made into a [[Crash (1996 film)|movie of the same name]] in 1996 by [[David Cronenberg]]. 

==Plot summary==

The story is told through the eyes of [[narrator]] James Ballard, named after the author himself, but it centers on the sinister figure of Dr. Robert Vaughan, a “former TV-scientist, turned nightmare angel of the expressways”. Ballard meets Vaughan after being involved in a car accident himself near [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]. Gathering around Vaughan is a group of alienated people, all of them former crash-victims, who follow him in his pursuit to re-enact the crashes of celebrities, and experience what the narrator calls &quot;a new sexuality, born from a perverse technology&quot;. Vaughan’s ultimate fantasy is to die in a head-on collision with movie star [[Elizabeth Taylor]].

==Analysis==
The book explores themes such as the transformation of human psychology by modern technology, and [[consumer culture]]'s fascination with [[celebrities]] and technological commodities. The human characters in the novel are cold and passionless, unable to become sexually excited unless some kind of technology is involved (typically architecture and cars). The gruesome damage inflicted on car-crash victims is not seen as shocking, but as the liberation of new sexual possibilities that have yet to be explored, such as in one scene where a man and a woman have sex in a car that was involved in an accident, but rather than have [[sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], he penetrates a wound on her thigh that she received in the crash.

Finally, the book asks why we, as an enlightened society, accept such a “perverse technology” – that kills a vast number of people yearly – as such an integral part of our culture.

Ballard writes in the foreword: “Do we see, in the car-crash, the portents of a nightmare marriage between technology, and our own sexuality? … Is there some deviant logic unfolding here, more powerful than that provided by reason?”

==Quotes==

*“After having … been constantly bombarded by road-safety propaganda, it was almost a relief to find myself in a real accident.”
*“Trying to exhaust himself, Vaughan devised an endless almanac of terrifying wounds and insane collisions: The lungs of elderly men punctured by door-handles; the chests of young women impaled on steering-columns; the cheek of handsome youths torn on the chromium latches of quarter-lights. To Vaughan, these wounds formed the key to a new sexuality, born from a perverse technology. The images of these wounds hung in the gallery of his mind, like exhibits in the museum of a slaughterhouse.”
*&quot;The crushed body of the sportscar had turned her into a being of free and perverse sexuality, releasing within its dying chromium and leaking engine-parts, all the deviant possibilities of her sex.&quot;
*Ballard (as author) talking about his reasons for writing the book: &quot;I wanted to rub the human face in its own vomit, and force it to look in the mirror.&quot;

== References in popular culture ==
* Both the novel and &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; have been acknowledged as influences on [[John Foxx]]'s 1980 album ''[[Metamatic]]'', which features titles such as &quot;Underpass&quot; and &quot;No-One Driving&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

'''C''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|iː}}, like [[C|the letter C]]) is a general-purpose computer [[programming language]] developed between 1969 and 1973 by [[Dennis Ritchie]] at the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] for use with the [[Unix]] [[operating system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ie&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Giannini|first1=Mario|last2=Code Fighter, Inc.|first2=|last3=[[Columbia University]]|first3=|editor=Hossein Bidgoli|encyclopedia=The Internet encyclopedia|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0471222011|page=164|title=C/C++}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although C was designed for implementing [[system software]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.adaic.com/docs/reports/lawlis/k.htm | title = Guidelines for Choosing a Computer Language: Support for the Visionary Organization | year = 1997 | author = Patricia K. Lawlis, c.j. kemp systems, inc. | publisher = Ada Information Clearinghouse | accessdate = 2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also widely used for developing portable [[application software]].

C is one of the most popular programming languages of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.langpop.com/ | title = Programming Language Popularity | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html | title = TIOBE Programming Community Index | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are very few [[computer architecture]]s for which a C [[compiler]] does not exist. C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably [[C++]], which began as an extension to C.

==Design==
C is an [[imperative programming|imperative]] ([[procedural programming|procedural]]) [[system programming|systems implementation]] language.  It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward [[compiler]], to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal [[Run-time system|run-time support]].  C was therefore useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in [[assembly language]].

Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage [[cross-platform]] programming.  A standards-compliant and [[porting|portably]] written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.  The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.

==Characteristics==
Like most imperative languages in the [[ALGOL]] tradition, C has facilities for [[structured programming]] and allows [[scope (programming)|lexical variable scope]] and [[recursion]], while a static [[type system]] prevents many unintended operations.  In C, all executable code is contained within [[subroutine|functions]]. Function [[parameter (computer science)|parameters]] are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing [[pointer (computing)|pointer]] values. Heterogeneous aggregate data types (&lt;code&gt;[[Struct (C programming language)|struct]]&lt;/code&gt;) allow related data elements to be combined and manipulated as a unit.  C program source text is free-format, using the [[semicolon]] as a [[Statement (programming)|statement]] terminator.

C also exhibits the following more specific characteristics:
* Partially [[weak typing]]; for instance, characters can be used as integers
* Low-level access to [[computer memory]] by converting machine addresses to typed [[pointer (computing)|pointers]]
* Function and data pointers supporting ''ad hoc'' [[type polymorphism|run-time polymorphism]]
* [[Array data type|array]] indexing as a secondary notion, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic
* A [[C preprocessor|preprocessor]] for [[macro (computer science)|macro]] definition, [[source code]] file inclusion, and conditional compilation
* Complex functionality such as [[input/output|I/O]], [[string (computer science)|string]] manipulation, and mathematical functions consistently delegated to [[library (computer science)|library routines]]
* A large number of compound operators, such as &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

==History==
===Early developments===
The initial development of C occurred at [[AT&amp;T]] [[Bell Labs]] between 1969 and 1973;&lt;ref name=&quot;dottcl&quot; /&gt; according to Ritchie, the most creative period occurred in 1972.  It was named &quot;C&quot; because its features were derived from an earlier language called &quot;[[B (programming language)|B]]&quot;, which according to [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]] was a stripped-down version of the [[BCPL]] programming language.

The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the [[Unix]] operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a [[PDP-7]] by Ritchie and Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues.  Eventually they decided to port the operating system to a [[PDP-11]].  B's inability to take advantage of some of the PDP-11's features, notably [[byte]] addressability, led to the development of an early version of C.

The original PDP-11 version of the Unix system was developed in assembly language.  By 1973, with the addition of &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; types, the C language had become powerful enough that most of the [[Unix]] [[kernel (computers)|kernel]] was rewritten in C.  This was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than assembly.  (Earlier instances include the [[Multics]] system (written in [[PL/I]]), and MCP ([[MCP (Burroughs Large Systems)|Master Control Program]]) for the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5000]] written in [[ALGOL]] in 1961.)

===K&amp;R C===
In 1978, [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] published the first edition of ''[[The C Programming Language (book)|The C Programming Language]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&amp;r1e&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kernighan | first = Brian W. | authorlink = Brian Kernighan | coauthors = [[Dennis M. Ritchie]] | title = [[The C Programming Language (book)|]] | edition = 1st | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | date = February 1978 | location = [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] | isbn = 0-13-110163-3 }} The first widely available book on the C programming language.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, known to C programmers as &quot;K&amp;R&quot;, served for many years as an informal [[specification]] of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as ''K&amp;R C''. The second edition of the book&lt;ref name=&quot;k&amp;r2e&quot; /&gt; covers the later [[ANSI C]] standard.

K&amp;R introduced several language features:
* standard I/O library
* &lt;code&gt;long int&lt;/code&gt; data type
* &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; data type
* compound assignment operators of the form &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;''op'' (such as &lt;code&gt;=-&lt;/code&gt;) were changed to the form ''op''&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; to remove the semantic ambiguity created by such constructs as &lt;code&gt;i=-10&lt;/code&gt;, which had been interpreted as &lt;code&gt;i&amp;nbsp;=-&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/code&gt; instead of the possibly intended &lt;code&gt;i&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;-10&lt;/code&gt;

Even after the publication of the 1989 C standard, for many years K&amp;R C was still considered the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written K&amp;R C code can be legal Standard C as well.

In early versions of C, only functions that returned a non-&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; value needed to be declared if used before the function definition; a function used without any previous declaration was assumed to return type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, if its value was used.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

long some_function();
/* int */ other_function();

/* int */ calling_function()
{
    long test1;
    register /* int */ test2;

    test1 = some_function();
    if (test1 &gt; 0)
          test2 = 0;
    else
          test2 = other_function();
    return test2;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

All the above commented-out &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; declarations could be omitted in K&amp;R C.

Since K&amp;R function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter [[type checking|type checks]] were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if multiple calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments.  Separate tools such as Unix's [[lint programming tool|lint]] utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files.

In the years following the publication of K&amp;R C, several unofficial features were added to the language, supported by compilers from AT&amp;T and some other vendors. These included:

* &lt;code&gt;[[void type|void]]&lt;/code&gt; functions (i.e. functions with no return value)
* functions returning &lt;code&gt;[[Struct (C programming language)|struct]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[union (computer science)|union]]&lt;/code&gt; types (rather than pointers)
* [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]] for &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; data types
* [[enumerated type]]s

The large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a [[C standard library|standard library]], together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&amp;R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.

===ANSI C and ISO C===
{{Main|ANSI C}}

During the late 1970s and 1980s, versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of [[mainframe computer]]s, [[minicomputer]]s, and [[microcomputer]]s, including the [[IBM PC]], as its popularity began to increase significantly.

In 1983, the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. In 1989, the standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 &quot;Programming Language C&quot;.  This version of the language is often referred to as [[ANSI C]], Standard C, or sometimes C89.

In 1990, the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms &quot;C89&quot; and &quot;C90&quot; refer to the same programming language.

ANSI, like other national standards bodies, no longer develops the C standard independently, but defers to the ISO C standard.  National adoption of updates to the international standard typically occurs within a year of ISO publication.

One of the aims of the C standardization process was to produce a [[superset]] of K&amp;R C, incorporating many of the unofficial features subsequently introduced. The standards committee also included several additional features such as [[function prototype]]s (borrowed from C++), &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; pointers, support for international [[character encoding|character sets]] and [[locale]]s, and preprocessor enhancements. The syntax for parameter declarations was also augmented to include the style used in C++, although the K&amp;R interface continued to be permitted, for compatibility with existing source code.

C89 is supported by current C compilers, and most C code being written today is based on it. Any program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any [[system platform|platform]] with a conforming C implementation, within its resource limits.  Without such precautions, programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] libraries, or to a reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of data types and byte [[endianness]].

In cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming or K&amp;R C-based compilers, the &lt;code&gt;__STDC__&lt;/code&gt; macro can be used to split the code into Standard and K&amp;R sections to prevent using on a K&amp;R C-based compiler features available only in Standard C.

===C99===
{{Main|C99}}

After the ANSI/ISO standardization process, the C language specification remained relatively static for some time. In 1995 Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 C standard was published, to correct some details and to add more extensive support for international character sets. The C standard was further revised in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which is commonly referred to as &quot;[[C99]]&quot;. It has since been amended three times by Technical Corrigenda. The international C standard is maintained by the [[working group]] [[SC22|ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22]]/WG14.

C99 introduced several new features, including [[inline function]]s, several new [[data type]]s (including &lt;code&gt;long long int&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;complex&lt;/code&gt; type to represent [[complex number]]s), [[variable-length array]]s, support for [[variadic macro]]s (macros of variable [[arity]]) and support for one-line comments beginning with &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;, as in [[BCPL]] or C++. Many of these had already been implemented as extensions in several C compilers.

C99 is for the most part backward compatible with C90, but is stricter in some ways; in particular, a declaration that lacks a type specifier no longer has &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; implicitly assumed. A standard macro &lt;code&gt;__STDC_VERSION__&lt;/code&gt; is defined with value &lt;code&gt;199901L&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that C99 support is available. [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], [[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]] and other C compilers now support many or all of the new features of C99.

===C1X===
{{Main|C1X}}
In 2007, work began in anticipation of another revision of the C standard, informally called &quot;C1X&quot;. The C standards committee has adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that have not been tested by existing implementations.

==Uses==
C is often used for &quot;[[system programming]]&quot;, including implementing [[operating system]]s and [[embedded system]] applications, due to a combination of desirable characteristics such as code portability and efficiency, ability to access specific hardware addresses, ability to [[type punning|pun types]] to match externally imposed data access requirements, and low [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] demand on system resources. C can also be used for website programming using [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] as a &quot;gateway&quot; for information between the Web application, the server, and the browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Dr. Dobb's Sourcebook | publisher = Miller Freeman, Inc. | date = Nov/Dec 1995 issue | location = U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reasons for choosing C over [[interpreted language]]s are its speed, stability, and near-universal availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6863 | publisher = linuxjournal.com | title = Using C for CGI Programming | accessdate = 2010-01-04 | date = 2005-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of C's wide acceptance and efficiency is that compilers, libraries, and interpreters of ''other'' programming languages are often implemented in C. The primary implementations of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] ([[CPython]]), [[Perl]] 5, and [[PHP]] are all written in C.

Due to its thin layer of abstraction and low overhead, C allows efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures, which is useful for programs that perform a lot of computations. For example, the [[GNU Multi-Precision Library]], the [[GNU Scientific Library]], [[Mathematica]] and [[MATLAB]] are completely or partially written in C.

C is sometimes used as an [[intermediate language]] by implementations of other languages. This approach may be used for portability or convenience; by using C as an intermediate language, it is not necessary to develop machine-specific code generators. Some languages and compilers which have used C this way are [[BitC]], [[C++]], [[COBOL]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Gambit (Scheme implementation)|Gambit]], [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]], [[Squeak]], and [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]].  However, C was designed as a programming language, not as a compiler target language, and is thus less than ideal for use as an intermediate language. This has led to development of C-based intermediate languages such as [[C--]].

C has also been widely used to implement [[end-user (computer science)|end-user]] applications, but much of that development has shifted to newer languages.

==Syntax==

{{Main|C syntax}}

C has a [[formal grammar]] specified by the C standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;h&amp;s5e&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Harbison | first = Samuel P. | coauthors = Guy L. Steele | title = C: A Reference Manual | edition = 5th | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2002 | location = [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] | isbn = 0-13-089592-X }} Contains a [[Backus-Naur form|BNF]] grammar for C.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike languages such as [[Fortran#FORTRAN_77|FORTRAN 77]], C source code is [[free-form language|free-form]] which allows arbitrary use of whitespace to format code, rather than column-based or text-line-based restrictions. Comments may appear either between the delimiters &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;, or (in C99) following &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; until the end of the line.

C source files contain declarations and function definitions. Function definitions, in turn, contain declarations and [[Statement (programming)|statements]]. Declarations either define new types using keywords such as &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;, or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type followed by the variable name. Keywords such as &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;, sometimes called &quot;curly brackets&quot;) to limit the scope of declarations and to act as a single statement for control structures.

As an imperative language, C uses ''statements'' to specify actions. The most common statement is an ''expression statement'', consisting of an expression to be evaluated, followed by a semicolon; as a side effect of the evaluation, functions may be [[procedure call|called]] and variables may be [[assignment (computer science)|assigned]] new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, C provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. [[Structured programming]] is supported by &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;(-&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;) conditional execution and by &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; iterative execution (looping). The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; statement has separate initialization, testing, and reinitialization expressions, any or all of which can be omitted. &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; can be used to leave the innermost enclosing loop statement or skip to its reinitialization. There is also a non-structured &lt;code&gt;[[goto]]&lt;/code&gt; statement which branches directly to the designated [[label (programming language)|label]] within the function. &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; selects a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; to be executed based on the value of an integer expression.

Expressions can use a variety of built-in operators (see below) and may contain function calls. The order in which arguments to functions and operands to most operators are evaluated is unspecified. The evaluations may even be interleaved. However, all side effects (including storage to variables) will occur before the next &quot;[[sequence point]]&quot;; sequence points include the end of each expression statement, and the entry to and return from each function call.  Sequence points also occur during evaluation of expressions containing certain operators (&lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[?:]]&lt;/code&gt; and the [[comma operator]]). This permits a high degree of object code optimization by the compiler, but requires C programmers to take more care to obtain reliable results than is needed for other programming languages.

Although mimicked by many languages because of its widespread familiarity, C's syntax has often been criticized. For example, Kernighan and Ritchie say in the Introduction of ''The C Programming Language'', &quot;C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better.&quot;

Some specific problems worth noting are:
* Not checking number and types of arguments prior to C99 when the function declaration has an empty parameter list. (This provides [[backward compatibility]] with [[The C Programming Language (book)|K&amp;R C]], which lacked prototypes.)
* Some questionable choices of operator precedence, as mentioned by Kernighan and Ritchie above, such as &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; binding more tightly than &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; in expressions like &lt;code&gt;x &amp; 1 == 0&lt;/code&gt;, which would need to be written &lt;code&gt;(x &amp; 1) == 0&lt;/code&gt; to be properly evaluated.
* The use of the &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; operator, used in mathematics for equality, to indicate assignment, following the precedent of [[Fortran]] and [[PL/I]], but unlike [[ALGOL]] and its derivatives. Ritchie made this syntax design decision consciously, based primarily on the argument that assignment occurs more often than comparison.
* Similarity of the assignment and equality operators (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;), making it easy to accidentally substitute one for the other. In many cases, each may be used in the context of the other without a compilation error (although some compilers produce warnings). For example, the conditional expression in &lt;code&gt;if (a=b)&lt;/code&gt; is true if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not zero after the assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~nxiao/cs10/errors.htm |title=10 Common Programming Mistakes in C |publisher=Cs.ucr.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A lack of [[infix notation|infix]] operators for complex objects, particularly for string operations, making programs which rely heavily on these operations (implemented as functions instead) somewhat difficult to read.
* A declaration syntax that some find unintuitive, particularly for [[function pointer]]s. (Ritchie's idea was to declare identifiers in contexts resembling their use: &quot;[[declaration reflects use]]&quot;.)

===Keywords===
C89 has 32 keywords (reserved words with special meaning): &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;signed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;.

C99 adds five more keywords: &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;restrict&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_Bool&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_Complex&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;_Imaginary&lt;/code&gt;.

C supports a rich set of [[operator (programming)|operators]], which are symbols used within an [[expression (programming)|expression]] to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for:
* [[arithmetic]]: [[addition|&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;]], [[subtraction|&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;]], [[multiplication|&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;]], [[division (mathematics)|&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;]], [[modulo operation|&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;]]
* [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]]: &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
** [[augmented assignment]]: &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
* [[bitwise logic]]: &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
* [[bitwise shift]]s: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* [[boolean logic]]: &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;
* [[?:|conditional evaluation]]: [[?:|&lt;code&gt;? :&lt;/code&gt;]]
* equality testing: [[equality (mathematics)|&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;]], [[inequality (mathematics)|&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;]]
* [[function call|calling functions]]: &lt;code&gt;( )&lt;/code&gt;
* increment and decrement: &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;
* [[record (computer science)|member selection]]: &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* object size: &lt;code&gt;[[sizeof]]&lt;/code&gt;
* [[order relation]]s: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
* [[pointer (computing)|reference and dereference]]: &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt;
* sequencing: [[comma operator|&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;]]
* [[order of operations#Mathematical precedence|subexpression grouping]]: &lt;code&gt;( )&lt;/code&gt;
* [[type conversion]]: &lt;code&gt;(''typename'')&lt;/code&gt;

==&quot;Hello, world&quot; example==
The &quot;[[hello, world]]&quot; example, which appeared in the first edition of [[The C Programming Language (book)|K&amp;R]], has become the model for an introductory program in most programming textbooks, regardless of programming language. The program prints &quot;hello, world&quot; to the [[standard output]], which is usually a terminal or screen display.

The original version was:{{#tag:ref|Page 6 of the original K&amp;R&lt;ref name=&quot;k&amp;r1e&quot; /&gt;}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
main()
{
    printf(&quot;hello, world\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A standard-conforming &quot;hello, world&quot; program is:&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The original example code will compile on most modern compilers that are not in strict standard compliance mode, but it does not fully conform to the requirements of either C89 or C99. In fact, C99 requires that a diagnostic message be produced.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- READ THIS BEFORE YOU EDIT! If you think there is a better way, first see talk page archive #8 for why. If you still want to change it, discuss it first.
--&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    printf(&quot;hello, world\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line of the program contains a [[preprocessing|preprocessing directive]], indicated by &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;.  This causes the preprocessor—the first tool to examine source code as it is compiled—to substitute the line with the entire text of the &lt;code&gt;[[stdio.h]]&lt;/code&gt; standard header, which contains declarations for standard input and output functions such as &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;. The angle brackets surrounding &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; indicate that &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; is located using a search strategy that prefers standard headers to other headers having the same name. Double quotes may also be used to include local or project-specific header files.

The next line indicates that a function named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is being defined. The &lt;code&gt;[[main function (programming)|main]]&lt;/code&gt; function serves a special purpose in C programs; the run-time environment calls the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function to begin program execution. The type specifier &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the ''return value,'' the value that is returned to the invoker (in this case the run-time environment) as a result of evaluating the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, is an integer. The keyword &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter list indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function takes no arguments.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function actually has two arguments, &lt;code&gt;int argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char *argv[]&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, which can be used to handle [[command line arguments]].  The C standard requires that both forms of &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; be supported, which is special treatment not afforded any other function.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening curly brace indicates the beginning of the definition of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function.

The next line ''calls'' (diverts execution to) a function named &lt;code&gt;[[printf]]&lt;/code&gt;, which was declared in &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; and is supplied from a system [[library (computer science)|library]].  In this call, the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function is ''passed'' (provided with) a single argument, the address of the first character in the string literal &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello, world\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The string literal is an unnamed [[Array data type|array]] with elements of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, set up automatically by the compiler with a final 0-valued character to mark the end of the array (&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; needs to know this). The &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; is an ''escape sequence'' that C translates to a ''[[newline]]'' character, which on output signifies the end of the current line.  The return value of the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function is of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, but it is silently discarded since it is not used. (A more careful program might test the return value to determine whether or not the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function succeeded.) The semicolon &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; terminates the statement.

The ''return'' statement terminates the execution of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function and causes it to return the integer value 0, which is interpreted by the run-time system as an exit code indicating successful execution.

The closing curly brace indicates the end of the code for the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function.

==Data types==

{{Main|C variable types and declarations}}

C has a static [[weak typing]] [[type system]] that shares some similarities with that of other [[ALGOL]] descendants such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].  There are built-in types for integers of various sizes, both signed and unsigned, [[floating-point number]]s, characters, and enumerated types (&lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;).  C99 added a [[boolean datatype]].  There are also derived types including [[Array data type|array]]s, [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]]s, [[record (computer science)|records]] (&lt;code&gt;[[Struct (C programming language)|struct]]&lt;/code&gt;), and untagged [[union (computer science)|unions]] (&lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;).

C is often used in low-level systems programming where escapes from the type system may be necessary.  The compiler attempts to ensure type correctness of most expressions, but the programmer can override the checks in various ways, either by using a ''[[type conversion|type cast]]'' to explicitly convert a value from one type to another, or by using pointers or unions to reinterpret the underlying bits of a value in some other way.

===Pointers===
C supports the use of pointers, a very simple type of [[reference (computer science)|reference]] that records, in effect, the address or location of an object or function in memory.  Pointers can be ''dereferenced'' to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function.  Pointers can be manipulated using assignment and also [[pointer arithmetic]].  The run-time representation of a pointer value is typically a raw memory address (perhaps augmented by an offset-within-word field), but since a pointer's type includes the type of the thing pointed to, expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time.  Pointer arithmetic is automatically scaled by the size of the pointed-to data type.  (See [[#Array-pointer interchangeability|Array-pointer interchangeability]] below.)  Pointers are used for many different purposes in C.  [[String (computer science)|Text strings]] are commonly manipulated using pointers into&lt;!-- yes, &quot;into&quot; --&gt; arrays of characters.  [[Dynamic memory allocation]], which is described below, is performed using pointers.  Many data types, such as [[tree (data structure)|tree]]s, are commonly implemented as dynamically allocated &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; objects linked together using pointers.  Pointers to functions are useful for [[callback (computer science)|callbacks]] from event handlers.

A ''[[null pointer]]'' is a pointer that explicitly points to no valid location. Even though it is created by setting a pointer to literal zero '0', it is not necessarily zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf ISO/IEC 9899:1999 specification], p. 47, § 6.3.2.3 (3)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dereferencing a null pointer is therefore undefined, typically resulting in a [[Segmentation fault|run-time error]].  Null pointers are useful for indicating special cases such as no ''next'' pointer in the final node of a [[linked list]], or as an error indication from functions returning pointers.  In code, null pointers are usually represented by &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, and logically evaluate to false.

Void pointers (&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;) point to objects of unknown type, and can therefore be used as &quot;generic&quot; data pointers. Since the size and type of the pointed-to object is not known, void pointers cannot be dereferenced, nor is pointer arithmetic on them allowed, although they can easily be (and in many contexts implicitly are) converted to and from any other object pointer type.

Careless use of pointers is potentially dangerous.  Because they are typically unchecked, a pointer variable can be made to point to any arbitrary location, which can cause undesirable effects.  Although properly-used pointers point to safe places, they can be made to point to unsafe places by using invalid [[data pointer|pointer arithmetic]]; the objects they point to may be deallocated and reused ([[dangling pointer]]s); they may be used without having been initialized ([[wild pointer]]s); or they may be directly assigned an unsafe value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer.  In general, C is permissive in allowing manipulation of and conversion between pointer types, although compilers typically provide options for various levels of checking. Some other programming languages address these problems by using more restrictive [[reference (computer science)|reference]] types.

===Arrays===
&lt;!-- Please be careful when editing this.  C does NOT forbid bounds checking, nor does it require that pointers are memory addresses.  Of course it does not require bounds checks, either, and all common implementations map those language constructs to the machine in an &quot;obvious way&quot;, but there are ANSI-conforming implementations that handle these things in other ways. --&gt;

[[Array data type|Array]] types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time.  (The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays.)  However, it is also possible to allocate a block of memory (of arbitrary size) at run-time, using the standard library's &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; function, and treat it as an array.  C's unification of arrays and pointers (see below) means that true arrays and these dynamically-allocated, simulated arrays are virtually interchangeable.  Since arrays are always accessed (in effect) via pointers, array accesses are typically ''not'' checked against the underlying array size, although the compiler may provide [[bounds checking]] as an option.  Array bounds violations are therefore possible and rather common in carelessly written code, and can lead to various repercussions, including illegal memory accesses, corruption of data, [[buffer overflow|buffer overruns]], and run-time exceptions.

C does not have a special provision for declaring multidimensional arrays, but rather relies on recursion within the type system to declare arrays of arrays, which effectively accomplishes the same thing.  The index values of the resulting &quot;multidimensional array&quot; can be thought of as increasing in [[row-major order]].

Multidimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied [[linear algebra]]) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is well suited to this particular task. However, since arrays are passed merely as pointers, the bounds of the array must be known fixed values or else explicitly passed to any subroutine that requires them, and dynamically sized arrays of arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing. (A workaround for this is to allocate the array with an additional &quot;row vector&quot; of pointers to the columns.)

C99 introduced &quot;variable-length arrays&quot; which address some, but not all, of the issues with ordinary C arrays.

{{See also|C string}}

===Array-pointer interchangeability===
A distinctive (but potentially confusing) feature of C is its treatment of arrays and pointers. The array-subscript notation &lt;code&gt;x[i]&lt;/code&gt; can also be used when &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer; the interpretation (using pointer arithmetic) is to access the &lt;code&gt;(i + 1)&lt;/code&gt;''th'' object of several adjacent data objects pointed to by &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, counting the object that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; points to (which is &lt;code&gt;x[0]&lt;/code&gt;) as the first element of the array.

Formally, &lt;code&gt;x[i]&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;*(x + i)&lt;/code&gt;. Since the type of the pointer involved is known to the compiler at compile time, the address that &lt;code&gt;x + i&lt;/code&gt; points to is ''not'' the address pointed to by &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; incremented by &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; bytes, but rather incremented by &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; multiplied by the size of an element that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; points to. The size of these elements can be determined with the operator &lt;code&gt;[[sizeof]]&lt;/code&gt; by applying it to any dereferenced element of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, as in  &lt;code&gt;n = sizeof *x&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;n = sizeof x[0]&lt;/code&gt;.

Furthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt;), the name of an array is automatically converted to a pointer to the array's first element; this implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use [[call-by-value|pass-by-value]] semantics, arrays are ''in effect'' passed by [[reference (computer science)|reference]].

The number of elements in a declared array &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; can be determined as &lt;code&gt;sizeof x / sizeof x[0]&lt;/code&gt;.

An interesting demonstration of the interchangeability of pointers and arrays is shown below. The four assignments are equivalent and each is valid C code.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* x is an array OR a pointer. i is an integer. */

x[i] = 1;         /* equivalent to *(x + i) */
*(x + i) = 1;
*(i + x) = 1;
i[x] = 1;         /* equivalent to *(i + x) */
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that although all four assignments are equivalent, only the first represents good coding style. The last line might be found in [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest|obfuscated C]] code.

Despite this apparent equivalence between array and pointer variables, there is still a distinction to be made between them. Even though the name of an array is, in most expression contexts, converted into a pointer (to its first element), this pointer does not itself occupy any storage, unlike a pointer variable. Consequently, what an array &quot;points to&quot; cannot be changed, and it is impossible to assign a value to an array variable. (Array ''values'' may be copied, however, e.g., by using the &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; function.)

==Memory management==
One of the most important functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing [[computer memory|memory]] and the objects that are stored in memory. C provides three distinct ways to allocate memory for objects:
* [[Static memory allocation]]: space for the object is provided in the binary at compile-time; these objects have an [[Variable (programming)#Scope and extent|extent]] (or lifetime) as long as the binary which contains them is loaded into memory. Static variables are automatically initialized to zero upon memory allocation.
* [[Automatic memory allocation]]: temporary objects can be stored on the [[call stack|stack]], and this space is automatically freed and reusable after the block in which they are declared is exited
* [[Dynamic memory allocation]]: blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library functions such as &lt;code&gt;[[malloc]]&lt;/code&gt; from a region of memory called the [[dynamic memory allocation|heap]]; these blocks persist until subsequently freed for reuse by calling the library function &lt;code&gt;[[malloc|free]]&lt;/code&gt;

These three approaches are appropriate in different situations and have various tradeoffs. For example, static memory allocation has no allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve a small amount of overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially have a great deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. On the other hand, stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time. Most C programs make extensive use of all three.

Where possible, automatic or static allocation is usually preferred because the storage is managed by the compiler, freeing the programmer of the potentially error-prone chore of manually allocating and releasing storage. However, many data structures can grow in size at runtime, and since static allocations (and automatic allocations in C89 and C90) must have a fixed size at compile-time, there are many situations in which dynamic allocation must be used. Prior to the C99 standard, variable-sized arrays were a common example of this (see &lt;code&gt;[[malloc]]&lt;/code&gt; for an example of dynamically allocated arrays).

Automatically and dynamically allocated objects are only initialized if an initial value is explicitly specified; otherwise they initially have indeterminate values (typically, whatever [[bit|bit pattern]] happens to be present in the [[computer storage|storage]], which might not even represent a valid value for that type). If the program attempts to access an uninitialized value, the results are undefined. Many modern compilers try to detect and warn about this problem, but both [[Type I and type II errors|false positives and false negatives]] occur.

Another issue is that heap memory allocation has to be manually synchronized with its actual usage in any program in order for it to be reused as much as possible.  For example, if the only pointer to a heap memory allocation goes out of scope or has its value overwritten before &lt;code&gt;[[malloc|free()]]&lt;/code&gt; has been called, then that memory cannot be recovered for later reuse and is essentially lost to the program, a phenomenon known as a ''[[memory leak]].''  Conversely, it is possible to release memory too soon and continue to access it; however, since the allocation system can re-allocate or itself use the freed memory, unpredictable behavior is likely to occur.  Typically, the symptoms will appear in a portion of the program far removed from the actual error, making it difficult to track down the problem.  Such issues are ameliorated in languages with [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]].

==Libraries==
The C programming language uses [[library (software)|libraries]] as its primary method of extension. In C, a library is a set of functions contained within a single &quot;archive&quot; file.  Each library typically has a [[header file]], which contains the prototypes of the functions contained within the library that may be used by a program, and declarations of special data types and macro symbols used with these functions. In order for a program to use a library, it must include the library's header file, and the library must be linked with the program, which in many cases requires [[compiler flag]]s (e.g., &lt;code&gt;-lm&lt;/code&gt;, shorthand for &quot;math library&quot;).

The most common C library is the [[C standard library]], which is specified by the [[ISO standard|ISO]] and [[ANSI C]] standards and comes with every C implementation (“freestanding” [embedded] C implementations may provide only a subset of the standard library). This library supports stream input and output, memory allocation, mathematics, character strings, and time values.

Another common set of C library functions are those used by applications specifically targeted for [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, especially functions which provide an interface to the [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. These functions are detailed in various standards such as [[POSIX]] and the [[Single UNIX Specification]].

Since many programs have been written in C, there are a wide variety of other libraries available. Libraries are often written in C because C compilers generate efficient [[object code]]; programmers then create interfaces to the library so that the routines can be used from higher-level languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

==Language tools==
Tools have been created to help C programmers avoid some of the problems inherent in the language, such as statements with undefined behavior or statements that are not a good practice because they are more likely to result in unintended behavior or run-time errors.

Automated source code checking and auditing are beneficial in any language, and for C many such tools exist, such as [[lint programming tool|Lint]]. A common practice is to use Lint to detect questionable code when a program is first written. Once a program passes Lint, it is then compiled using the C compiler. Also, many compilers can optionally warn about syntactically valid constructs that are likely to actually be errors. [[MISRA C]] is a proprietary set of guidelines to avoid such questionable code, developed for embedded systems.

There are also compilers, libraries and operating system level mechanisms for performing array bounds checking, [[buffer overflow]] detection, [[serialization]] and [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]], that are not a standard part of C.

Tools such as [[IBM Rational Purify|Purify]], [[Valgrind]], and linking with libraries containing special versions of the [[malloc|memory allocation functions]] can help uncover runtime memory errors.

==Related languages==
C has directly or indirectly influenced many later languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[PHP]], [[JavaScript]], [[LPC (programming language)|LPC]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and Unix's [[C Shell]]. The most pervasive influence has been syntactical: all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression syntax of C with type systems, data models and/or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically.

When object-oriented languages became popular, [[C++]] and [[Objective-C]] were two different extensions of C that provided object-oriented capabilities. Both languages were originally implemented as [[source-to-source compiler]]s; source code was translated into C, and then compiled with a C compiler.

The [[C++]] programming language was devised by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] as one approach to providing [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] functionality with C-like syntax. C++ adds greater typing strength, scoping and other tools useful in object-oriented programming and permits [[generic programming]] via templates. Nearly a superset of C, C++ now supports most of C, with a few exceptions (see [[Compatibility of C and C++]] for an exhaustive list of differences).

[[Objective-C]] was originally a very &quot;thin&quot; layer on top of, and remains a strict superset of C that permits object-oriented programming using a hybrid dynamic/static typing paradigm.   Objective-C derives its syntax from both C and [[Smalltalk]]: syntax that involves preprocessing, expressions, function declarations and function calls is inherited from C, while the syntax for object-oriented features was originally taken from Smalltalk.

[[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] was designed in order to provide Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]] with a programming language that could be easily learned by programmers already familiar with C or C++.  Conventions like the semicolon at the end of statements and the curly brackets used to separate the components in the hierarchy of code are evidence of C#'s C-based heritage.

The [[D (programming language)|D programming language]] makes a clean break with C while maintaining the same general syntax, unlike C++, which maintains nearly complete backwards compatibility with C. D abandons a number of features of C which [[Walter Bright]] (the designer of D) considered undesirable, including the [[C preprocessor]] and [[C trigraph|trigraph]]s. Some, but not all, of D's extensions to C overlap with those of C++.

[[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]] is a language developed by a team at Bell Labs, and while it retains some of the syntax and the general style of C, it also includes [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] and [[Communicating sequential processes|CSP]]-based concurrency.

The [[Go (programming language)|Go]] programming language, under development at [[Google]], streamlines C's syntax by eliminating unnecessary semicolons and parentheses. It supports a simpler form of object-oriented programming than those of C++ or Java, and also adds garbage collection and concurrency features.

[[Python (programming language)|Python]] has a different sort of C heritage.  While the syntax and semantics of Python are radically different from C, the most widely used Python implementation, [[CPython]], is an [[open source]] C program. This allows C users to extend Python with C, or embed Python into C programs. This close relationship is one of the key factors leading to Python's success as a general-use dynamic language.

[[Perl (programming language)|Perl]] is another example of a popular programming language rooted in C. The overall structure of Perl derives broadly from C. The standard Perl implementation is written in C and supports extensions written in C.

'''''Castle of the Winds''''' ('''''CotW''''') is a [[Tile-based game#Video games|tile-based]] [[roguelike]] [[computer game]] for [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.x]]. It was developed by SaadaSoft and published by [[Epic Games|Epic MegaGames]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/12525/Playing_Catch_Up_Castle_of_the_Winds_Rick_Saada.php &quot;Playing Catch Up: Castle of the Winds' Rick Saada&quot;] from ''[[Gamasutra]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release history==
The game is composed of two parts: '''''A Question of Vengeance''''', released as [[shareware]], and '''''Lifthransir's Bane''''', sold [[Commercial software|commercially]]. A combined license for both parts was also sold.

In 1998, the game's author, [[Rick Saada]], decided to distribute the entirety of ''Castle of the Winds'' free of charge.&lt;ref name=saada&gt;[http://www.exmsft.com/~ricks/ The Saada Homepage]. Retrieved on December 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a 16 bit application, the program will not run natively under 64 bit versions of the Windows operating system.

==Gameplay==
The game differs from most roguelikes in a number of ways. Its interface is [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]-dependent, but supports keyboard shortcuts (such as 'g' to get an item). ''Castle of the Winds'' also allows the player to restore saved games after dying.

===Magic===
The game favors the use of magic in combat, as spells are the only weapons that work from a distance. The [[player character]] automatically gains a spell with each [[Experience point|experience level]], and can permanently gain others using corresponding books, until all thirty spells available are learned. There are two opposing pairs of elements: cold vs. [[fire]] and [[lightning]] vs. [[acid]]/[[poison]]. Spells are divided into six categories: attack, defense, healing, movement, divination, and miscellaneous.

===Items===
''Castle of the Winds'' possesses an inventory system that limits a player's load based on weight and bulk, rather than by number of items. It allows the character to use different containers, including packs, belts, chests, and bags. Other items include weapons, armor, protective clothing, purses, and ornamental jewellery. Almost every item in the game can be normal, cursed, or enchanted, with curses and enchantments working in a manner similar to ''[[NetHack]]''. Although items do not break with use, they may already be broken or rusted when found. Most objects that the character currently carries can be renamed.

===Time===
The game tracks how much time has been spent playing the game. Although story events are not triggered by the passage of time, it does determine when merchants rotate their stock. Victorious players are listed as &quot;[[Valhalla]]'s Champions&quot; in the order of time taken, from fastest to slowest. If the player dies, they are still put on the list, but are categorized as &quot;Dead&quot;, with their experience point total listed as at the final killing blow. The amount of time spent also determines the difficulty of the last boss.

==Plot==
Although secondary to its [[hack and slash]] gameplay, ''Castle of the Winds'' has a plot loosely based on [[Norse mythology]], told with setting changes, unique items, and occasional passages of text.

The player begins in a tiny [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]], near which he used to live. His [[farm]] has been destroyed and his [[godparent]]s killed. After clearing out an abandoned mine, the player finds a scrap of parchment that reveals the death of the player's godparents as having been ordered. The player then returns to the hamlet to find it pillaged, and decides to travel to Bjarnarhaven.

Once in Bjarnarhaven, the player explores the levels beneath a nearby fortress, eventually facing Hrungnir, the Hill Giant Lord, the one responsible for ordering the player's godparents death. Hrungnir carries the Enchanted Amulet of Kings. Upon activating the amulet, the player is informed of his past by his dead father, after which the player is transported to the town of Crossroads, and ''Part I'' ends. The game can be imported or started over in ''Part II''.

The town of Crossroads is run by a Jarl who at first does not admit the player, but later provides advice and two enchanted items. The player then enters the nearby ruined titular Castle of the Winds. There the player meets his deceased grandfather, who instructs him to venture into the dungeons below, defeat Surtur, and reclaim his birthright. Venturing deeper, the player encounters monsters run rampant, a desecrated crypt, a necromancer, and the installation of various special rooms for elementals. The player eventually meets and defeats the Wolf-Man leader, Bear-Man leader, the four [[Jötunn|Jotun]] kings, a Demon Lord, and finally Surtur. Upon defeating Surtur, the player seats themselves upon the throne, completing the game.

==Graphics==
All terrain tiles, some landscape features, all monsters and objects, and some spell/effect graphics take the form of Windows 3.1 icons. Multi-tile graphics, such as ball spells and town buildings, are bitmaps included in the executable file. No graphics use colors other than the Windows-standard 16-color palette, plus transparency. They exist in monochrome versions as well, meaning that the game will display well on monochrome monitors.

The map view is identical to the playing-field view, except for scaling to fit on one screen. A simplified map view is available to improve performance on slower computers. The latter functionality also presents a cleaner display, as the aforementioned scaling routine does not always work correctly.

      <comment>/* Calvinism Today */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calvinism}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed|expand-protestant=yes}}

'''Calvinism''' (also called '''Reformed tradition''', the '''Reformed faith''', or '''Reformed theology''') is a [[Protestant]] [[theology|theological]] system and an approach to the [[Christian]] life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgmarshall.org/Reformed/kuyper_lecturescalvinism.html|title=Calvinism As A Life System|author=Kuyper, Abraham|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reformed tradition was advanced by several theologians such as [[Martin Bucer]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli]], but this branch of Christianity bears the name of the French [[Protestant Reformation|reformer]] [[John Calvin]] ('''Jean Cauvin''' in [[Old French]]) because of his prominent influence on it and because of his role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 16th century. Today, this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the [[Reformed churches]] of which Calvin was an early leader. Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself.&lt;ref&gt;Warfield, p. 359: &quot;Sometimes ['Calvinism'] designates merely the individual teaching of John Calvin. Sometimes it designates, more broadly, the doctrinal system confessed by that body of Protestant Churches known historically, in distinction from the Satanist Churches, as 'the Reformed Churches' but also quite commonly called 'the Calvinistic Churches' because the great scientific exposition of their faith in the Reformation age, and perhaps the most influential of any age, was given by John Calvin. Sometimes it designates, more broadly still the entire body of conceptions, theological, ethical, philosophical, social,political, which, under the influence of the  mind of John Calvin, raised itself to dominance in the Protestant lands of the post-Reformation age, and has left a permanent mark not only upon the thought of mankind, but upon the life-history of men, the social order of civilized peoples and even the political organization of States.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The system is often summarized in the [[Calvinism#Five_points_of_Calvinism|Five Points of Calvinism]] and is best known for its doctrines of [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] and [[total depravity]], stressing the absolute sovereignty of God.

== Historical background ==
{{Main|History of Calvinism}}

[[File:John Calvin - best likeness.jpg|thumb|John Calvin]]

[[John Calvin]]'s international influence on the development of the doctrines of the [[Protestant Reformation]] began in 1534 when Calvin was 25. That marks his start on the first edition of ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (published 1536). He revised this work several times, and produced a French vernacular translation. The ''Institutes'', together with Calvin's polemical and pastoral works, his contributions to [[confession of faith|confessional documents]] for use in churches, and his massive outpouring of [[Exegesis|commentary on the Bible]], meant that Calvin had a direct personal influence on Protestantism. Along with [[Martin Bucer]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr Vermigli]], and [[Ulrich Zwingli]], Calvin influenced the doctrines of the Reformed churches. He eventually became the most prominent of those reformers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The rising importance of the Reformed churches and of Calvin belongs to the second phase of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Evangelical churches began to form after [[Martin Luther]] was excommunicated from the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. Calvin was a French exile in [[Geneva]]. He had signed the Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]] as it was revised by [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melancthon]] in 1540. However, his influence was first felt in the [[Reformation in Switzerland|Swiss Reformation]] whose leader was [[Ulrich Zwingli]]. It soon became evident that doctrine in the [[Reformed churches]] was developing in a direction independent of Martin Luther's, under the influence of numerous writers and reformers among whom Calvin eventually became preeminent. Much later, when his fame was attached to the Reformed churches, their whole body of doctrine came to be called &quot;Calvinism&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Spread ===

Although much of Calvin's practice was in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas of a &quot;correctly&quot; reformed church to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in [[Scotland]] (see [[John Knox]]), the [[Netherlands]], with men such as William Ames, T J Frelinghuysen and Wilhelmus a Brakel and parts of [[Germany]] (especially those adjacent to the Netherlands) with the likes of Olevianus and his colleague Zacharias Ursinus. It was influential in France, Hungary, then-independent [[Transylvania]], [[Lithuania]] and Poland. Calvinism gained some popularity in [[Scandinavia]], especially Sweden, but was rejected in favor of [[Lutheranism]] after the [[Uppsala Synod|synod of Uppsala]] in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance and Reformation'' by William Gilbert, [http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12 The Reformation in Germany and Scandinavia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most settlers in the American Mid-Atlantic and [[New England]] were Calvinists, including the English [[Puritan]]s, the French [[Huguenot]] and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam (New York), and the [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] of the Appalachian back country. Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonizers of [[South Africa]], beginning in the 17th century, who became known as [[Boer]]s or [[Afrikaner Calvinism|Afrikaners]].

[[Sierra Leone]] was largely colonized by Calvinist settlers from [[Nova Scotia]], who were largely [[Black Loyalist]]s, blacks who had fought for the [[British Empire|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. [[John Marrant]] had organized a congregation there under the auspices of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion|Huntingdon Connection]]. Some of the largest Calvinist communions were started by 19th and 20th century [[missionary|missionaries]]. Especially large are those in [[Indonesia]], [[Korea]] and [[Nigeria]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Today, the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]] has 75 million believers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html Major Branches of Religions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism, though these points identify the Calvinist view on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life.

=== Five points of Calvinism ===
&lt;!-- Note: Outside links (e.g., [[Five points of Calvinism]], [[TULIP]]) point to this section; do not delete or modify its name without addressing those links. --&gt;
{{TULIP}}
Calvinist theology is sometimes identified with the five points of Calvinism, also called the doctrines of grace, which are a point-by-point response to the five points of the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] [[Five articles of Remonstrance|Remonstrance]] (see [[History of Calvinist-Arminian debate]]) and which serve as a summation of the judgments rendered by the [[Synod of Dort]] in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Arminian Controversy and the Synod of Dort]],&quot; [http://spindleworks.com/library/vandergugten/arminian_c.htm Spindleworks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin himself never used such a model and never combated Arminianism directly. In fact, Calvin died in 1564 and Jacob Arminias was born in 1560, and so the men were not contemporaries. The Articles of Remonstrance were authored by opponents of reformed doctrine and Biblical Monergism. They were rejected in 1619 at the Synod of Dort, more than 50 years after the death of Calvin.

The five points therefore function as a summary of the differences between Calvinism and Arminianism, but not as a complete summation of Calvin's writings or of the theology of the Reformed churches in general. In English, they are sometimes referred to by the [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] TULIP&lt;ref name=&quot;gotquestions.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.gotquestions.org/calvinism.html gotquestions.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (see below), though this puts them in a different order than the [[Canons of Dort]].

The central assertion of these canons is that God is able to save every person upon whom he has mercy, and that his efforts are not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.

*&quot;[[Total depravity]]&quot;: This doctrine, also called &quot;total inability&quot;, asserts that as a consequence of the [[Fall of Man|fall of man into sin]], every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of [[sin]]. People are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term &quot;total&quot; in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.)&lt;ref&gt;David Steele and Curtis Thomas, &quot;The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented,&quot; pg.25, &quot;The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be. Instead, the word 'total' is used to indicate that the &quot;whole&quot; of man's being has been affected by sin.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;[[Unconditional election]]&quot;: This doctrine asserts that God's choice from [[eternity]] of those whom he will bring to himself is not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people. Rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God's mercy alone. Conversely, God has also chosen from [[eternity]] to withhold himself from the unelect, and [[reprobation|condemn them]] to face his wrath.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 9:10-16, [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&amp;c=9&amp;v=1&amp;t=ESV#top Blueletterbible.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;[[Limited atonement]]&quot;: Also called &quot;particular redemption&quot; or &quot;definite atonement&quot;, this doctrine asserts that [[Jesus]]'s [[substitutionary atonement]] was definite and certain in its design and accomplishment. This implies that only the sins of [[the elect]] were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death.   Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is designed for some and not all. Hence, Calvinists hold that the atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine is driven by the Calvinistic concept of the sovereignty of God in salvation and their understanding of the nature of the atonement.
*&quot;[[Irresistible grace]]&quot;: This doctrine, also called &quot;efficacious grace&quot;, asserts that the saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has determined to save (that is, the elect) and, in God's timing, overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to a saving faith.  This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved.  The doctrine holds that every influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, &quot;graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-highway.com/compare.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;[[Perseverance of the saints]]&quot;: Perseverance (or preservation) of the [[saints]] (the word &quot;saints&quot; is used in the Biblical sense to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not in the technical sense of one who is exceptionally [[holy]], [[Canonization|canonized]], or in [[heaven]]). The doctrine asserts that since God is sovereign and his will cannot be frustrated by humans or anything else, those whom God has called into communion with himself will continue in faith until the end. Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with or will return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/boettner/predest.iv.vi.html |chapter=The Perseverance of the Saints |title=The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination |author=[[Loraine Boettner]] |accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sovereign grace ===

Calvinism stresses the [[total depravity]] or total inability of humanity's ethical nature against a backdrop of the sovereign [[Divine grace|grace]] of God in [[salvation]]. It teaches that [[Fall of Man|fallen]] people are morally and spiritually unable to follow God or escape their condemnation  before him.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John “Commentaries to the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians”. Translated by Rev. William Pringle. Ephesians Ch 2:1. http://www.ccel.org&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as the work of God (divine intervention) in which God changes their unwilling [[heart (Symbolism and Metaphor)|hearts]] from rebellion to willing obedience.

In this view, all people are entirely at the mercy of God, who would be just in condemning all people for their [[sin]]s, but who has chosen to be merciful to some. Thus, one person is saved while another is condemned, not because of a foreseen willingness, faith, or any other virtue in the first person, but because God sovereignly chose to have mercy on him.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. “Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans”. Translated by John Owen. Ch 9:10-13. http://www.ccel.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although the person must believe the gospel and respond to be saved, this obedience of faith is God's gift, and thus God completely and sovereignly accomplishes the salvation of sinners. Views of predestination to [[damnation]] (the doctrine of [[reprobation]]) are less uniform than is the view of predestination to [[salvation]] (the doctrine of election) among self-described Calvinists (see [[Supralapsarianism and Infralapsarianism]]).

In practice, Calvinists teach sovereign grace primarily for the encouragement of the church because they believe the doctrine demonstrates the extent of God's love in saving those who could not and would not follow him, as well as quashing pride and self-reliance and emphasizing the Christian's total dependence on the grace of God. In the same way, [[sanctification]] in the Calvinist view requires a continual reliance on God to purge the Christian's depraved heart from the power of sin and to further the Christian's joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&amp;var1=ArtRead&amp;var2=270&amp;var3=authorbio&amp;var4=AutRes&amp;var5=42|title=Gospel-Driven Sanctification|author=Bridges, Jerry|accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nature of the atonement ====

An additional point of disagreement with Arminianism implicit in the five points is the Calvinist understanding of the doctrine of Jesus's [[substitutionary atonement]] as a punishment for the sins of the elect, which was developed by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and especially [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]] and Calvin himself. Calvinists argue that if Christ takes the punishment in the place of a particular sinner, that person must be saved since it would be unjust for him then to be condemned for the same sins.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. “Institutes of the Christian Religion” . Christian Classics Ethereal Library. Book 2 Ch 16. 1536. Web. 7 Jul. 2010. &lt;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive and binding nature of this [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|satisfaction model]] has strong implications for each of the five points, and it has led Arminians to subscribe instead to the [[Atonement (Governmental view)|governmental theory of the atonement]]. Under that theory, no particular sins or sinners are in view, but all of humanity are included in those whose sins have been taken away. The atonement was not the penalty of the law, but a substitute for the penalty, which allows God to remit the penalty by his grace when any sinner repents and believes in Jesus as the Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|3:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covenant theology ===
{{Main|Covenant theology}}

Although the doctrines of grace have generally received the greater focus in contemporary Calvinism, covenant theology is the historic superstructure that unifies the entire system of doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]] |title=God of Promise, Introducing Covenant Theology |year=2006 |isbn=0-8010-1289-9 |publisher = Baker Books |location = Grand Rapids, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvinists take God's [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] to mean that the relationship between God and his creation must be by voluntary condescension on God's part. This relationship he establishes is [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]]al: the terms of the relationship are unchangeably decreed by God alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1647) [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VII.html VII.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reformed writings commonly refer to an intra-[[Trinity|Trinitarian]] covenant of redemption. The greater focus is the relationship between God and man, which in historic Calvinism is seen as bi-covenantal, reflecting the early [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] distinction between [[Law and Gospel]]. The covenant of works encompasses the moral and [[natural law]], dictating the terms of creation. By its terms, man would enjoy eternal life and blessedness based on his continued personal and perfect righteousness. With the [[fall of man]], this covenant continues to operate, but only to condemn sinful man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1647) [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VII.html VII.2]; [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XIX.html XIX.1, 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The covenant of grace is instituted at the fall, and administered through successive historic [[covenant theology#Biblical covenants|covenants]] seen in Scripture for the purpose of redemption. By its terms, salvation comes not by any personal performance, but by promise. Peace with God comes only through a mediator, the fulfillment of which is found in the person and work of [[Jesus Christ]]. Christ is seen as the [[federal head]] of his elect people, and thus the covenant is the basis of the doctrines of the [[substitutionary atonement]] and the [[imputed righteousness|imputation]] of the [[active obedience]] of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1647) [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VII.html VII.3]; [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VIII.html XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worship regulated by God ===
{{Main|Regulative principle of worship}}

The regulative principle regarding worship, which distinguishes the Calvinist approach to the public [[Christian worship|worship]] of God from other views, is that only those elements that are instituted or appointed by command or example in the [[New Testament]] are permissible in worship. In other words, the regulative principle maintains that God institutes in the scriptures what he requires for worship in the church, and everything else is prohibited. As the regulative principle is reflected in Calvin's own thought, it is driven by his evident antipathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and her worship, and it associates musical instruments with [[icon]]s, which he considered violations of the [[Ten Commandments]]' prohibition of graven images.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/joh_barber/PT.joh_barber.Luther.Calvin.Music.Worship.html |journal=Reformed Perspectives Magazine |volume=8 |issue=26 |date=June 25, 2006 |title=Luther and Calvin on Music and Worship |author=John Barber |accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this basis, many early Calvinists also eschewed [[musical instrument]]s and advocated [[exclusive psalmody]] in worship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm |accessdate=2007-11-16 |year=1998 |title= Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God |author=Brian Schwertley}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Calvin himself allowed other scriptural songs as well as psalms,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot; /&gt; and this practice typified [[presbyterian worship]] and the worship of other Reformed churches for some time.  The original Lord's Day service designed by John Calvin was a highly liturgical service with the Creed, Alms, Confession and Absolution, the Lord's supper, Doxologies, prayers, Psalms being sung, the Lords prayer being sung, Benedictions. The following are Orders of Service for the Lords Day as designed by John Calvin:

Since the 19th century, however, most of the Reformed churches have modified their understanding of the regulative principle and make use of musical instruments, believing that Calvin and his early followers went beyond the biblical requirements&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot; /&gt; and that such things are circumstances of worship requiring biblically rooted wisdom, rather than an explicit command. Despite the protestations of those few who hold to a strict view of the regulative principle, today [[hymn]]s and musical instruments are in common use, as are [[contemporary worship music]] styles and [[worship band]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frame |title=Worship in Spirit and Truth |year=1996 |isbn=0-87552-242-4 |publisher=P&amp;R Pub. |location=Phillipsburg, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==

Many efforts have been undertaken to reform or expand on Calvinism, and these variations appear to a greater or lesser degree throughout the history of Calvinism.

=== Lapsarianism ===
{{Main|Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism}}

Within [[scholasticism|scholastic]] Calvinist theology, there are two schools of thought over ''when'' and ''whom'' God predestined: [[supralapsarianism]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''supra'', &quot;above&quot;, here meaning &quot;before&quot; + ''lapsus'', &quot;fall&quot;) and [[infralapsarianism]] (from the Latin: ''infra'', &quot;beneath&quot;, here meaning &quot;after&quot; + ''lapsus'', &quot;fall&quot;). The former view, sometimes called &quot;high Calvinism&quot;, argues that [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] occurred partly to facilitate God's purpose to choose some individuals for salvation and some for damnation. Infralapsarianism, sometimes called &quot;low Calvinism&quot;, is the position that, while the Fall was indeed planned, it was not planned with reference to who would be saved.

Supralapsarians believe that God chose which individuals to save before he decided to allow the race to fall and that the Fall serves as the means of realization of that prior decision to send some individuals to [[hell]] and others to [[heaven]] (that is, it provides the grounds of condemnation in the [[reprobation|reprobate]] and the need for [[salvation]] in the elect). In contrast, infralapsarians hold that God planned the race to fall logically prior to the decision to save or damn any individuals because, it is argued, in order to be &quot;saved&quot;, one must first need to be saved from something and therefore the decree of the Fall must precede predestination to salvation or damnation.

These two views vied with each other at the Synod of Dort (1618), an international body representing Calvinist Christian churches from around Europe, and the judgments that came out of that council sided with infralapsarianism ([[Canons of Dort]], First Point of Doctrine, Article 7). The influential [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] also teaches (in Hodge's words &quot;clearly impl[ies]&quot;) the infralapsarian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.ii.html|title=Systematic Theology - Volume II - Supralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; view, but is sensitive to those holding to supralapsarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.iii.html|title=Systematic Theology - Volume II - Infralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lapsarian controversy has a few vocal proponents on each side today, but overall it does not receive much attention among modern Calvinists.

=== Four-point Calvinism ===
{{Main|Amyraldism}}

Another revision of Calvinism is called &quot;[[Amyraldism]]&quot;, &quot;hypothetical [[universalism]]&quot;, or &quot;four-point Calvinism&quot;, also known as Four-point Calvinism, Moderate Calvinism, Modified Calvinism, or Unlimited Limited Atonement. This drops the limited atonement in favor of an [[unlimited atonement]] saying that God has provided Christ's atonement for all alike, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elects those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of [[unconditional election]].&lt;ref name=Sproul&gt;Sproul R.C. ''The Truth of the Cross.'' Reformation Trust Publishing: 2007 ISBN 978-1-56769-087-3, pp.140-142&lt;/ref&gt;

This doctrine was most thoroughly systematized by the French Reformed theologian at the [[Academy of Saumur]], [[Moses Amyraut]], for whom it is named. His formulation was an attempt to bring Calvinism more nearly alongside the Lutheran view.  In England, hypothetical universalism (which is not entirely consistent with Amyraldianism) was held by the early 17th century theologians [[John Davenant]] and [[John Preston (clergyman)|John Preston]] and was propounded at the [[Westminster Assembly]] by the English Presbyterian leaders [[Edmund Calamy the Elder]], [[Lazarus Seaman]] and [[Stephen Marshall (English clergyman)|Stephen Marshall]].  In a different, more idiosyncratic form, it was expounded in England by the writings of the Reformed pastor [[Richard Baxter]] and gained strong adherence among the [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]] and some [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterians]] in the [[13 colonies|American colonies]], during the 17th and 18th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Amyraldism can be found among various [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] groups in the United States and within the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]]. &quot;Four point&quot; Calvinism is prevalent in conservative and moderate groups among [[Presbyterian]] churches, [[Reformed churches]], [[Reformed Baptist]]s and some [[non-denominational]] churches, and is not uncommon among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] members of the [[Church of England]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Historically, Amyraldism has been called &quot;moderate Calvinism&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]] in J. Matthew Pinson (ed.), ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Norman Geisler]] uses this term to describe his own views, which [[James White (theologian)|James R. White]] calls &quot;merely a modified form of historic [[Arminianism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James White, ''The Potter's Freedom'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. C. Sproul]] believes there is confusion about what the doctrine of limited atonement actually  teaches. While he considers it possible for a person to believe four points without believing the fifth, he claims that a person who really understands the other four points ''must'' believe in limited  atonement because of what Martin Luther called a resistless logic.&lt;ref name=Sproul/&gt;

[[Mark Driscoll]] calls this &quot;[http://www.marshillchurch.org/media/christ-on-the-cross/unlimited-limited-atonement Unlimited Limited Atonement]&quot;, or &quot;Four-and-a-half point Calvinism&quot;, whereby Jesus, ''by dying for everyone, purchased everyone as His possession and He then applies His forgiveness to the elect by grace and applies His wrath to the non-elect. Objectively, Jesus' death was sufficient to save anyone, and, subjectively, only efficient to save those who repent of their sin and trust in Him.''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marshillchurch.org/media/christ-on-the-cross/unlimited-limited-atonement | title=Unlimited Limited Atonement | first=Mark | last = Driscoll | date = November 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hyper-Calvinism ===
{{Main|Hyper-Calvinism}}

Hyper-Calvinism first referred to an eccentric view that appeared among the early English [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]] in the 18th century. Their system denied that the call of the gospel to &quot;[[repentance|repent]] and believe&quot; is directed to every single person and that it is the duty of every person to trust in Christ for salvation. While this doctrine has always been a minority view, it has not been relegated to the past and may still be found in some small denominations and church communities today, most notably Fred Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, which is infamous for its picketing of soldiers' funerals. The term also occasionally appears in both [[theological]] and [[secular]] controversial contexts, where it usually connotes a negative opinion about some variety of [[theological determinism]], [[predestination]], or a version of Evangelical Christianity or Calvinism that is deemed by the critic to be unenlightened, harsh, or extreme.

=== Neo-orthodoxy ===
{{Main|Neo-orthodoxy}}

In the mainline Reformed churches, Calvinism has undergone expansion and revision through the influence of [[Karl Barth]] and [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] theology. Barth was an important Swiss Reformed theologian who began writing early in the 20th century, whose chief accomplishment was to counter-act the influence of [[the Enlightenment]] in the churches. The [[Barmen declaration]] is an expression of the Barthian reform of Calvinism. Conservative Calvinists (as well as some liberal reformers) regard it as confusing to use the name &quot;Calvinism&quot; to refer to neo-orthodoxy or other liberal revisions stemming from Calvinist churches due to their differing theological views.

=== Neo-Calvinism ===
{{Main|Neo-Calvinism}}

Besides the traditional movements within the conservative Reformed churches, several trends have arisen through the attempt to provide a contemporary, but theologically conservative approach to the world.

A version of Calvinism that has been adopted by both theological conservatives and liberals gained influence in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Reformed churches, late in the 19th century, dubbed &quot;neo-Calvinism&quot;, which developed along lines of the theories of Dutch theologian, statesman and [[journalist]], [[Abraham Kuyper]]. More traditional Calvinist critics of the movement characterize it as a revision of Calvinism, although a conservative one in comparison to modernist Christianity or neo-orthodoxy. Neo-Calvinism, &quot;Calvinianism&quot;, or the &quot;[[Reformational philosophy|reformational movement]]&quot;, is a response to the influences of [[the Enlightenment]], but generally speaking it does not touch directly on the articles of salvation. Neo-Calvinists intend their work to be understood as an update of the Calvinist [[worldview]] in response to modern circumstances, which is an extension of the Calvinist understanding of religion to [[science|scientific]], [[society|social]] and [[politics|political]] issues. To show their consistency with the historic Reformed movement, supporters may cite Calvin's ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion|Institutes]]'', book 1, chapters 1-3, and other works. In the United States, Kuyperian neo-Calvinism is represented among others, by the ''Center for Public Justice'', a faith-based political [[think-tank]] headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Neo-Calvinism branched off in more theologically conservative movements in the United States. The first of these to rise to prominence became apparent through the writings of [[Francis Schaeffer]], who had gathered around himself a group of scholars, and propagated their ideas in writing and through [[L'Abri]], a Calvinist study center in Switzerland. This movement generated a reawakened social consciousness among [[evangelicalism|Evangelicals]].

==== Christian Reconstructionism ====
{{Main|Christian Reconstructionism}}

A neo-Calvinist movement called &quot;[[Christian Reconstructionism]]&quot; is much smaller, more radical, and [[Theocracy|theocratic]], but by some believed to be widely influential in American family and political life. Reconstructionism is a distinct revision of Kuyper's approach, which sharply departs from that root influence through the complete rejection of [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], and by formulating suggested applications of the sanctions of Biblical Law for modern civil governments. These distinctives are the least influential aspects of the movement. Its intellectual founder, the late [[R.J. Rushdoony|Rousas J. Rushdoony]], based much of his understanding on the [[presuppositional apologetics|apologetical]] insights of [[Cornelius Van Til]], father of [[presuppositionalism]] and [[professor]] at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] (although Van Til himself did not hold to such a view). It has some influence in the conservative Reformed churches in which it was born, and in Calvinistic Baptist and [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] churches mostly in the United States, Canada, and to a lesser extent in the UK.

Reconstructionism aims toward the complete rebuilding of the structures of society on Christian and Biblical presuppositions, not, according to its promoters, in terms of &quot;top down&quot; structural changes, but through the steady advance of the Gospel of Christ as men and women are converted, who then live out their obedience to God in the areas for which they are responsible. In keeping with the [[Theonomy|Theonomic Principle]], it seeks to establish laws and structures that will best instantiate the ethical principles of the [[Bible]], including the [[Old Testament]] as expounded in the case laws and summarized in the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]. Not a political movement, strictly speaking, Reconstructionism has nonetheless been influential in the development of aspects of the [[Christian Right]] that some critics have called &quot;[[Dominionism]]&quot;. Reconstructionism assumes that God institutes in the Scriptures everything he requires for the ordering of self and society, extending the [[regulative principle of worship]] to all areas of life.

=== Calvinism Today ===
{{Main|New Calvinism}}

Calvinism has undergone a resurgence in North America in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/september/42.32.html |title=Young, Restless, Reformed |author=Collin Hansen |date=2006-09-22 |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TIME]]'' magazine described the New Calvinism as one of the &quot;10 ideas changing the world&quot; in 2009 and cited its adherents to be largely [[Reformed Baptist]] or [[Southern Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1884779_1884782_1884760,00.html |title=10 Ideas Changing the World Right Now: The New Calvinism |magazine=TIME |author=David van Biema |date=2009) |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures today which are associated with Calvinism include [[Mark Dever]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9marks.org/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID314526_CHID616022_CIID1554164,00.html 9marks.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Driscoll]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://theresurgence.com/time_magazine_new_reformed TheResurgence.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ligon Duncan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformation21.org/calvin/2008/12/why-read-through-calvins-insti.php Reformation21.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Chandler,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kowalker.com/2009/04/17/matt-chandlers-journey-to-calvinism-2/ Kowalker.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=May 2011}} [[Timothy J.

== Social and Religious Influences of Calvinism ==
=== Usury and capitalism ===

One school of thought attributes Calvinism with setting the stage for the later development of [[capitalism]] in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]] (1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin expressed himself on usury in a 1545 letter to a friend, Claude de Sachin, in which he criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;The letter is quoted in {{cite book | last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He qualified his view, however, by saying that money should be lent to people in dire need without hope of interest, while a modest interest rate of 5% should be permitted in relation to other borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book | last = Haas | first = Guenther H. | title = The Concept of Equity in Calvin's Ethics | publisher = [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]] | location = Waterloo, Ont., Canada | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-889-20285-0 | pages = 117ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arminianism ===
{{Main|Arminianism}}

{{See also|History of Calvinist-Arminian debate}}

A theological and political movement in opposition to Calvinism, now called &quot;[[Arminianism]]&quot;, was founded by Dutch theologian [[Jacob Arminius]] and revised and pursued by the [[Remonstrants]]. Arminius rejected several tenets of the Calvinist doctrines of salvation — namely, the latter four of what would later be known as the five points of Calvinism. The term &quot;Arminianism&quot; today often serves as an umbrella term for both Arminius's doctrine and the Remonstrants', but Arminius's followers sometimes distinguish themselves as &quot;Reformed Arminians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Ashby, &quot;A Reformed Arminian View&quot;, in {{cite book | last = Pinson | first = J. Matthew, editor | title = Four Views on Eternal Security | publisher = [[Zondervan]] | location = Grand Rapids | year = 2002 | isbn = 0310234395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Remonstrants' doctrine was condemned at the [[Synod of Dort]] held in [[Dordrecht]], [[Holland]], in 1618/1619, and followers of either Arminius or the Remonstrants are not generally considered &quot;Reformed&quot; by most Calvinists. Many [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]] adopted the position advocated by the Remonstrants, and Arminius's system was revived by evangelist [[John Wesley]] and is common today, particularly in [[Methodism]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''countable set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with the same [[cardinality]] ([[cardinal number|number]] of elements) as some [[subset]] of the set of [[natural number]]s. A set that is not countable is called ''[[uncountable set|uncountable]]''. The term was originated by [[Georg Cantor]]. The elements of a countable set can be counted one at a time&amp;mdash;although the counting may never finish, every element of the set will eventually be associated with a natural number.

Some authors use ''countable set'' to mean a set with the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudin&quot;&gt;For an example of this usage see {{Harv|Rudin|1976|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the two definitions is that under the former, [[finite set]]s are also considered to be countable, while under the latter definition, they are not considered to be countable. To resolve this ambiguity, the term '''at most countable''' is sometimes used for the former notion, and '''countably infinite''' for the latter.  The term '''denumerable''' is also used to mean countably infinite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lang&quot;&gt;See {{Harv|Lang|1993|loc=&amp;sect;2 of Chapter I}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A set ''S'' is called '''countable''' if there exists an [[injective function]] ''f'' from ''S'' to the [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,...\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Since there is an obvious [[bijection]] between &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^* = \{1,2,3,...\},&lt;/math&gt; it makes no difference whether one considers 0 to be a natural number of not. In any case, this article follows [[ISO 31-11]] and the standard convention in [[mathematical logic]], which make 0 a natural number.&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''f'' is also [[surjective function|surjective]] and therefore [[bijection|bijective]], then ''S'' is called '''countably [[infinite set|infinite]].'''

As noted above, this terminology is not universal: some authors define countable not to include finite sets, i.e. they define ''countable'' to mean what is here called &quot;countably infinite&quot;.

For alternative (equivalent) formulations of the definition in terms of a bijective function or a surjective function, see the section [[#Formal definition and properties|Formal definition and properties]] below.

==Introduction==

A ''[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'' is a collection of ''elements'', and may be described in many ways. One way is simply to list all of its elements; for example, the set consisting of the integers 3, 4, and 5 may be denoted &lt;math&gt;\{ 3, 4, 5 \}&lt;/math&gt;. This is only effective for small sets, however; for larger sets, this would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead of listing every single element, sometimes an ellipsis (&quot;...&quot;) is used, if the writer believes that the reader can easily guess what is missing; for example, &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3, \dots, 100 \}&lt;/math&gt; presumably denotes the set of [[integer]]s from 1 to 100. Even in this case, however, it is still ''possible'' to list all the elements, because the set is ''finite''; it has a specific number of elements.

Some sets are ''infinite''; these sets have more than ''n'' elements for any integer ''n''. For example, the set of natural numbers, denotable by &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots \}&lt;/math&gt;, has infinitely many elements, and we cannot use any normal number to give its size. Nonetheless, it turns out that infinite sets do have a well-defined notion of size (or more properly, of ''cardinality'', which is the technical term for the number of elements in a set), and not all infinite sets have the same cardinality.

To understand what this means, we must first examine what it ''does not'' mean. For example, there are infinitely many odd integers, infinitely many even integers, and (hence) infinitely many integers overall. However, it turns out that the number of odd integers, which is the same as the number of even integers, is also the same as the number of integers overall. This is because we arrange things such that for every integer, there is a distinct odd integer: ... −2 → −3, −1 → −1, 0 → 1, 1 → 3, 2 → 5, ...; or, more generally, ''n'' → 2''n'' + 1. What we have done here is arranged the integers and the odd integers into a ''one-to-one correspondence'' (or ''[[bijection]]''), which is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps between two sets such that each element of each set corresponds to a single element in the other set.

However, not all infinite sets have the same cardinality. For example, [[Georg Cantor]] (who introduced this branch of mathematics) demonstrated that the [[real number]]s cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (non-negative integers), and therefore that the set of real numbers has a greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers.

A set is ''countable'' if: (1) it is finite, or (2) it has the same cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers. Equivalently, a set is ''countable'' if it has the same cardinality as some [[subset]] of the set of natural numbers. Otherwise, it is ''uncountable''.

==Formal definition and properties==
By definition a set ''S'' is '''countable''' if there exists an [[injective function]]
:&lt;math&gt;f: S \to \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;
from ''S'' to the [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,...\}.&lt;/math&gt;

It might seem natural to divide the sets into different classes: put all the sets containing one element together; all the sets containing two elements together; ...; finally, put together all infinite sets and consider them as having the same size.
This view is not tenable, however, under the natural definition of size.

To elaborate this we need the concept of a [[bijection]]. Although a &quot;bijection&quot; seems a more advanced concept than a number, the usual development of mathematics in terms of set theory defines functions before numbers, as they are based on much simpler sets. This is where the concept of a bijection comes in: define the correspondence

:''a'' ↔ 1, ''b'' ↔ 2, ''c'' ↔ 3

Since every element of { ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' } is paired with ''precisely one'' element of { 1, 2, 3 }, ''and'' vice versa, this defines a bijection.

We now generalize this situation and ''define'' two sets to be of the same size if (and only if) there is a bijection between them. For all finite sets this gives us the usual definition of &quot;the same size&quot;. What does it tell us about the size of infinite sets?

Consider the sets ''A'' = { 1, 2, 3, ... }, the set of positive [[integer]]s and ''B'' = { 2, 4, 6, ... }, the set of even positive integers. We claim that, under our definition, these sets have the same size, and that therefore ''B'' is countably infinite. Recall that to prove this we need to exhibit a bijection between them. But this is easy, using n ↔ 2n, so that
:1 ↔ 2, 2 ↔ 4, 3 ↔ 6, 4 ↔ 8, ....

As in the earlier example, every element of A has been paired off with precisely one element of B, and vice versa. Hence they have the same size. This gives an example of a set which is of the same size as one of its proper subsets, a situation which is impossible for finite sets.

Likewise, the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is countably infinite, as can be seen by following a path like the one in the picture: [[File:Pairing natural.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Cantor pairing function]] assigns one natural number to each pair of natural numbers]] The resulting mapping is like this:
:0 ↔ (0,0), 1 ↔ (1,0), 2 ↔ (0,1), 3 ↔ (2,0), 4 ↔ (1,1), 5 ↔ (0,2), 6 ↔ (3,0) ....
It is evident that this mapping will cover all such ordered pairs.

Interestingly: if you treat each pair as being the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] of a [[vulgar fraction]], then for every positive fraction, we can come up with a distinct number corresponding to it. This representation includes also the natural numbers, since every natural number is also a fraction ''N''/1. So we can conclude that there are exactly as many positive rational numbers as there are positive integers. This is true also for all rational numbers, as can be seen below (a more complex presentation is needed to deal with negative numbers).

'''Theorem:''' The [[Cartesian product]] of finitely many countable sets is countable.

This form of triangular [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] [[recursion|recursively]] generalizes to [[vector space|vectors]] of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly mapping the first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) maps to (5,3) which maps to 39.

Sometimes more than one mapping is useful. This is where you map the set which you want to show countably infinite, onto another set; and then map this other set to the natural numbers. For example, the positive [[rational number]]s can easily be mapped to (a subset of) the pairs of natural numbers because ''p''/''q ''maps to (''p'', ''q'').

What about infinite subsets of countably infinite sets? Do these have fewer elements than '''N'''?

'''Theorem:''' Every subset of a countable set is countable. In particular, every infinite subset of a countably infinite set is countably infinite.

For example, the set of [[prime number]]s is countable, by mapping the ''n''-th prime number to ''n'':
*2 maps to 1
*3 maps to 2
*5 maps to 3
*7 maps to 4
*11 maps to 5
*13 maps to 6
*17 maps to 7
*19 maps to 8
*23 maps to 9
*etc.

What about sets being &quot;larger than&quot; '''N'''? An obvious place to look would be '''Q''', the set of all [[rational number]]s, which intuitively may seem much bigger than '''N'''. But looks can be deceiving, for we assert:

'''Theorem:''' '''Q''' (the set of all rational numbers) is countable.

'''Q''' can be defined as the set of all fractions ''a''/''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' &gt; 0. This can be mapped onto the subset of ordered triples of natural numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') such that ''a'' ≥ 0, ''b'' &gt; 0, ''a'' and ''b'' are [[coprime]], and ''c'' ∈ {0, 1} such that ''c'' = 0 if ''a''/''b'' ≥ 0 and ''c'' = 1 otherwise.

*0 maps to (0,1,0)
*1 maps to (1,1,0)
*−1 maps to (1,1,1)
*1/2 maps to (1,2,0)
*−1/2 maps to (1,2,1)
*2 maps to (2,1,0)
*−2 maps to (2,1,1)
*1/3 maps to (1,3,0)
*−1/3 maps to (1,3,1)
*3 maps to (3,1,0)
*−3 maps to (3,1,1)

*1/4 maps to (1,4,0)
*−1/4 maps to (1,4,1)
*2/3 maps to (2,3,0)
*−2/3 maps to (2,3,1)
*3/2 maps to (3,2,0)
*−3/2 maps to (3,2,1)
*4 maps to (4,1,0)
*−4 maps to (4,1,1)
*...

By a similar development, the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable, and so is the set of [[definable number]]s.

'''Theorem:''' (Assuming the [[axiom of countable choice]]) The [[union (set theory)|union]] of countably many countable sets is countable.

For example, given countable sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''' ...

Using a variant of the triangular enumeration we saw above:

*''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 0

*''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 1
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 2

*''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 3
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 4
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 5

*''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 6
*''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 7
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 8
*''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 9

*''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; maps to 10
*...

Note that this only works if the sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''',... are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]]. If not, then the union is even smaller and is therefore also countable by a previous theorem.

Also note that the [[axiom of countable choice]] is needed in order to index ''all'' of the sets '''a''', '''b''', '''c''',...

'''Theorem:''' The set of all finite-length [[sequence]]s of natural numbers is countable.

This set is the union of the length-1 sequences, the length-2 sequences, the length-3 sequences, each of which is a countable set (finite Cartesian product). So we are talking about a countable union of countable sets, which is countable by the previous theorem.

'''Theorem:''' The set of all finite [[subset]]s of the natural numbers is countable.

If you have a finite subset, you can order the elements into a finite sequence. There are only countably many finite sequences, so also there are only countably many finite subsets.

The following theorem gives equivalent formulations in terms of a bijective function or a [[surjective function]].  A proof of this result can be found in Lang's text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lang&quot;/&gt;

'''Theorem:''' Let ''S'' be a set. The following statements are equivalent:
# ''S'' is countable, i.e. there exists an injective function
#:&lt;math&gt;f\colon S \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Either ''S'' is empty or there exists a surjective function
#:&lt;math&gt;g\colon \mathbb{N} \to S&lt;/math&gt;.
# Either ''S'' is finite or there exists a [[bijection]]
#:&lt;math&gt;h\colon \mathbb{N} \to S&lt;/math&gt;.

Several standard properties follow easily from this theorem.  We present them here tersely.  For a gentler presentation see the sections above.   Observe that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; in the theorem can be replaced with any countably infinite set.  In particular we have the following Corollary.

'''Corollary:''' Let ''S'' and ''T'' be sets.
# If the function
#:&lt;math&gt;f\colon S \to T&lt;/math&gt; is injective and ''T'' is countable then ''S'' is countable.
# If the function
#:&lt;math&gt;g: S \to T&lt;/math&gt; is surjective and ''S'' is countable then ''T'' is countable.

'''Proof:''' For (1) observe that if ''T'' is countable there is an injective function
&lt;math&gt;h: T \to \mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt;  Then if
&lt;math&gt;f: S \to T&lt;/math&gt; is injective
the composition &lt;math&gt;h \circ f: S \to \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; is injective, so ''S'' is countable.

For (2) observe that if ''S'' is countable there is a surjective function
&lt;math&gt;h: \mathbb{N} \to S.&lt;/math&gt;  Then if &lt;math&gt;g\colon S \to T&lt;/math&gt; is surjective the composition &lt;math&gt;g \circ h: \mathbb{N} \to T&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, so ''T'' is countable.

'''Proposition:''' Any subset of a countable set is countable.

'''Proof:''' The restriction of an injective function to a subset of its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is still injective.

'''Proposition:'''  The [[Cartesian product]] of two countable sets ''A'' and ''B'' is countable.

'''Proof:''' Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is countable as a consequence of the definition because the function &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;f(m,n) = 2^m 3^n&lt;/math&gt; is injective.  It then follows from the Basic Theorem and the Corollary that the Cartesian product of any two countable sets is countable. This follows because if ''A'' and ''B'' are countable there are surjections &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{N} \to A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g: \mathbb{N} \to B&lt;/math&gt;. So
:&lt;math&gt;f \times g: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to A \times B&lt;/math&gt;
is a surjection from the countable set &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to the set
&lt;math&gt; A \times B&lt;/math&gt; and the Corollary implies &lt;math&gt; A \times B&lt;/math&gt; is countable. This result generalizes to the Cartesian product of any finite collection of countable sets and the proof follows by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the number of sets in the collection.

'''Proposition:''' The [[integers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are countable and the [[rational numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are countable.

'''Proof:''' The integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are countable because the function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 2^n&lt;/math&gt; if ''n'' is non-negative and &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 3^{|n|}&lt;/math&gt; if ''n'' is negative is an injective function. The rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are countable because the function &lt;math&gt;g\colon \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;g(m,n) = m/(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; is a surjection from the countable set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to the rationals &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proposition:''' If &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is a countable set for each &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n&lt;/math&gt; is countable.

'''Proof:''' This is a consequence of the fact that for each ''n'' there is a surjective function &lt;math&gt; g_n : \mathbb{N} \to A_n&lt;/math&gt; and hence the function
:&lt;math&gt;G : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n&lt;/math&gt;
given by &lt;math&gt; G(n,m) = g_n(m)&lt;/math&gt; is a surjection.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is countable the Corollary implies &lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n&lt;/math&gt; is countable. We are using the [[axiom of countable choice]] in this proof in order to pick for each &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; a surjection &lt;math&gt;g_n&lt;/math&gt; from the non-empty collection of surjections from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''[[Cantor's Theorem]]''' asserts that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is its [[power set]], i.e. the set of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then there is no surjective function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.  A proof is given in the article [[Cantor's Theorem]].   As an immediate consequence of this and the Basic Theorem above we have:

'''Proposition:''' The set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt; is not countable; i.e. it is [[uncountable]].

For an elaboration of this result see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]].

The set of [[real number]]s is uncountable (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]), and so is the set of all infinite [[sequence]]s of natural numbers.  A topological proof for the uncountability of the real numbers is described at [[finite intersection property]].

==Minimal model of set theory is countable==
If there is a set which is a standard model (see [[inner model]]) of ZFC set theory, then there is a minimal standard model (''see'' [[Constructible universe]]). The [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]] can be used to show that this minimal model is countable. The fact that the notion of &quot;uncountability&quot; makes sense even in this model, and in particular that this model ''M'' contains elements which are
* subsets of ''M'', hence countable,
* but uncountable from the point of view of ''M'',
was seen as paradoxical in the early days of set theory, see [[Skolem's paradox]].

The minimal standard model includes all the [[algebraic number]]s and all effectively computable [[transcendental number]]s, as well as many other kinds of numbers.

==Total orders==
Countable sets can be [[total order|totally ordered]] in various ways, e.g.:
*[[Well order]]s (see also [[ordinal number]]):
**The usual order of natural numbers
**The integers in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, .., −1, −2, −3, ..
*Other:
**The usual order of integers
**The usual order of rational numbers

[[Image:Cahn-Ingold-Prelog-priority-diagram.png|thumb|320px|right|An example of the prioritisation of structure within the CIP system. Priority is assigned according to the substitution of elements with higher atomic numbers, or other attached groups]]

The '''Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules''', '''CIP system''' or '''CIP conventions''' (after [[Robert Sidney Cahn]], [[Christopher Kelk Ingold]] and [[Vladimir Prelog]]) are a set of rules used in [[organic chemistry]] to name the [[stereoisomers]] of a molecule.&lt;ref&gt;J. March. ''Advanced Organic Chemistry'' 3Ed. ISBN 0-471-85472-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC]] Rules for the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry.  Section E, Stereochemistry (Recommendations 1974).  [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1976/pdf/4501x0011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A molecule may contain any number of [[stereocenter]]s and any number of [[Covalent bond#Bond order|double bond]]s, and each gives rise to two possible configurations.  The purpose of the CIP system is to assign an [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: R- and S-|R or S descriptor]] to each stereocenter and an [[Cis-trans isomerism#E/Z notation|E or Z descriptor]] to each double bond so that the configuration of the entire molecule can be specified uniquely by including the descriptors in its systematic name.

The key article by the three authors setting out the CIP rules was published in 1966 &lt;ref&gt;The following two papers define the CIP system.  The papers provide a number of additional rules beyond the main points covered above, such as describing less common forms of stereoisomerism (such as chiral axes and planes), and resolving more difficult priority assignments. For example, note that the above rules fail to generate stereo descriptors for compounds such as (1''s'',2''s'',3''s'')-1,2,3-trichlorocyclopropane (in which all three chlorine atoms are on the same side of the ring).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Robert Sidney Cahn]]; [[Christopher Kelk Ingold]]; [[Vladimir Prelog]]

The Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rules are distinctly different from those of other naming conventions, such as general [[IUPAC nomenclature]], since they are designed for the specific task of naming stereoisomers rather than the general classification and description of compounds.

==Steps for naming==

The steps for naming molecules using the CIP system are often presented as:

# Identification of [[stereocenter]]s and [[Covalent bond#Bond order|double bond]]s
# Assignment of priorities to the groups attached to each stereocenter or double-bonded atom
# Assignment of R/S and E/Z descriptors

===Assignment of priorities===

[[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: R- and S-|R/S]] and E/Z descriptors are assigned by using a system for ranking priority of the groups attached to each stereocenter. This procedure, often known as ''the sequence rules'', is the heart of the CIP system.

1. Compare the atomic number (Z) of the atoms directly attached to the stereocenter; the group having the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority. 

2. If there is a tie, we must consider the atoms at distance 2 from the stereocenter—as a list is made for each group of the atoms bonded to the one directly attached to the stereocenter. Each list is arranged in order of decreasing atomic number. Then the lists are compared atom by atom; at the earliest difference, the group containing the atom of higher atomic number receives higher priority. 

3. If there is still a tie, each atom in each of the two lists is replaced with a sub-list of the other atoms bonded to it (at distance 3 from the stereocenter), the sub-lists are arranged in decreasing order of atomic number, and the entire structure is again compared atom by atom. This process is repeated, each time with atoms one bond farther from the stereocenter, until the tie is broken.

====Isotopes====

If two groups differ only in [[isotope]]s, [[mass number]]s are used at each step to break ties in atomic number.

====Double and triple bonds====

If an atom ''A'' is double-bonded to an atom ''B'', ''A'' is treated as being singly bonded to two atoms: ''B'' and a '''ghost atom''' that has the same atomic number as ''B'' but is not attached to anything except ''A''. In turn, when ''B'' is replaced with a list of attached atoms, ''A'' itself is excluded in accordance with the general principle of not doubling back along a bond that has just been followed, but a ghost atom for ''A'' is included so that the double bond is properly represented from both ends.

A triple bond is handled the same way except that ''A'' and ''B'' each carry two ghost atoms instead of one.

It needs to be mentioned also that two substituents on an atom may, in rare cases, be geometrical isomers. Consider for example the compound (3''Z'',6''E'')-3,5,7-trimethylnona-3,6-diene. It soon becomes clear that the 5-carbon is chiral because it has four different substituents. Thus it is necessary to introduce the rule that the Z-isomer has higher priority than the E-isomer.

====Cycles====

To handle a molecule containing one or more cycles, one must first expand it into a tree (called a '''hierarchical digraph''' by the authors) by traversing bonds in all possible paths starting at the stereocenter. When the traversal encounters an atom through which the current path has already passed, a ghost atom is generated in order to keep the tree finite. A single atom of the original molecule may appear in many places (some as ghosts, some not) in the tree.

=== Assigning descriptors ===
==== Stereocenters: R/S ====
After the [[substituent]]s of a [[stereocenter]] have been assigned their priorities, the molecule is so oriented in space that the group with the lowest priority is pointed away from the observer. If the substituents are numbered from 1 (highest priority) to 4 (lowest priority), then the sense of rotation of a curve passing through 1, 2 and 3 distinguishes the [[stereoisomer]]s. A center with a clockwise sense of rotation is an ''R'' or ''rectus'' center and a center with a counterclockwise sense of rotation is an ''S'' or ''sinister'' center. The names are derived from the [[Latin]] for right and left, respectively.

A practical method of determining whether an enantiomer is R or S is by using the [[right-hand rule]]: one wraps the molecule with the fingers in the direction 1→2→3. If the thumb points in the direction of the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; substitutent, the enantiomer is R. Otherwise, it's S.

It is possible in rare cases that two substituents on an atom differ only in their absolute configuration (''R'' or ''S''). If the relative priorities of these substituents need to be established, ''R'' takes priority over ''S''. When this happens, the descriptor of the stereocenter is a lowercase letter (''r'' or ''s'') instead of the uppercase letter normally used.

[[Image:CIP system example.svg|270px|Two examples of stereocenters. The lowest substituent (number 4) is shown only by a wavy line, and is assumed to be behind the rest of the molecule. Both centres shown are S isomers.]]

==== Double bonds: E/Z ====
For alkenes and similar double bonded molecules, the same prioritizing process is followed for the substituents. In this case, it is the placing of the two highest priority substituents with respect to the double bond which matters. If both high priority substituents are on the same side of the double bond, i.e. in the [[cis configuration]], then the [[stereoisomer]] is assigned a ''Z'' or ''Zusammen configuration''. If, by contrast they are in a [[trans configuration]], then the stereoisomer is assigned an ''E'' or ''Entgegen configuration''. In this case the identifying letters are derived from [[German language|German]] for 'together' and 'in opposition to', respectively.

=== Examples ===

|bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; valign=top| The hypothetical molecule [[bromochlorofluoroiodomethane]] shown in its R-configuration would be a very simple chiral compound. The priorities are assigned based on [[atomic number]] (''Z''): [[iodine]] (Z = 53) &gt; [[bromine]] (Z = 35) &gt; [[chlorine]] (Z = 17) &gt; [[fluorine]] (Z = 9). Allowing fluorine (lowest priority) to point away from the viewer the rotation is clockwise hence the '''R'''-assignment.

|bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; valign=top| In the assignment of [[L-serine]] highest priority is given to the nitrogen atom (Z = 7) in the amino group (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Both the methylalcohol group (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH ) and the carboxylic acid group (COOH) have carbon atoms (Z = 6) but priority is given to the latter because the carbon atom in the COOH group is connected to a second oxygen '''(Z=8)''' whereas in the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group carbon is connected to a hydrogen atom (Z=1). Lowest priority is given to the hydrogen atom and as this atom points away from the viewer the counterclockwise decrease in priority over the three remaining substituents completes the assignment as '''S'''.  
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;| [[File:S-Carvone.png|80px]]
|bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; valign=top| The stereocenter in [[Carvone|S-carvone]] is connected to one hydrogen atom (not shown, priority 4) and three carbon atoms. The isopropene group has priority 1 (carbon atoms only) and for the two remaining carbon atoms priority is decided with the carbon atoms two bonds removed from the stereocenter, one part of the [[keto]] group (O,O,C priority 2) and one part of an alkene (H,C,C priority 3). The resulting counterclockwise rotation results in a '''S''' assignment.

== Multiple descriptors in one molecule ==

If a compound has more than one stereocenter each center is denoted by either R or S.

For example, [[ephedrine]] exists with both (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) configuration. This compound also exists as the [[diastereoisomer]]s with (1R,2R) and (1S,2S) configuration. The last two stereoisomers are not ephedrine, but [[pseudoephedrine]]. All isomers are 2-methylamino-1-phenyl-1-propanol in systematic nomenclature. Pseudoephedrine is chemically distinct from ephedrine with only the three dimensional configuration in space, as notated by the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rules.

=== Relative configuration ===

The relative configuration of two [[stereoisomer]]s may be denoted by the descriptors R and S with an asterisk (*). &quot;R*,R*&quot; means two centres having identical configurations (R,R or S,S); &quot;R*,S*&quot; means two centres having opposite configurations (R,S or S,R).

To designate two [[anomer]]s the relative stereodescriptors alpha (α) and beta (β) are used. In the α anomer the ''anomeric carbon'' and the ''reference atom'' do have opposite configurations (R,S or S,R), whereas in the β anomer they are the same (both R or both S).
&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Goldbook [http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05260.html ''relative configuration'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faces ==

[[Image:RefaceAndSiFace.png|400px|right|Benzophenone viewed from Re face]]Stereochemistry also plays a role assigning ''faces'' to trigonal molecules such as [[ketone]]s. A [[nucleophile]] in a [[nucleophilic addition]] can approach the [[carbonyl]] group from two opposite sides or faces. When an achiral nucleophile attacks [[acetone]], both faces are identical and there is only one reaction product. When the nucleophile attacks [[butanone]], the faces are not identical (''[[enantiotopic]]'') and a [[Racemic mixture|racemic product]] results. When the nucleophile is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecule [[diastereoisomer]]s are formed. When one face of a molecule is shielded by substituents or geometric constraints compared to the other face the faces are called [[diastereotopic]]. The same rules that determine the stereochemistry of a stereocenter (R or S) also apply when assigning the face of a molecular group. The faces are then called the '''re-faces''' and '''si-faces'''. In the example displayed on the right, the compound [[acetophenone]] is viewed from the re face. Hydride addition as in a reduction process from this side will form the S-enantiomer and attack from the opposite Si face will give the R-enantiomer.  However, one should note that adding a chemical group to the prochiral centre from the '''re-face''' will not always lead to an S stereocenter, as the priority of the chemical group has to be taken into account. That is, the absolute stereochemistry of  the product is determined on its own and not by considering which face it was attacked from.  In the above mentioned example, if [[chloride]] ('''Cl-''') was added to the prochiral centre from the '''re-face''', this would result in an R-enantiomer.

'''Celibacy''' refers to a state of being [[single person|unmarried]], or a state of [[abstention]] from [[sexual intercourse]] or the abstention by vow from [[marriage]].&lt;ref name=M-W&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/celibacy  Celibacy]. Retrieved 2010-12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English word celibacy derives from the Latin {{lang|la|''caelebs''}}, meaning &quot;unmarried&quot;. This word derives from two [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stems, *{{PIE|kaiwelo-}} &quot;alone&quot; and *{{PIE|lib(h)s-}} &quot;living&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=celibacy Celibacy]. Retrieved 2009-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstinence and celibacy==
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
The words ''abstinence'' and ''celibacy'' are often used interchangeably, but are different. [[Sexual abstinence]] or [[continence]] refers to abstaining from sexual intercourse. &lt;ref&gt;art. Abstinence and Continence, in ''Dictionary of Moral Theology.'' Compiled under the Direction of H. E. Cardinal Roberti. Ed. Mgr. Pietro Palazzini. London: Burns &amp; Oates Publishers of th Holy See 1962; &lt;/ref&gt;  The term &quot;celibacy&quot; is used to refer to an unmarried state.  According to [[Paul the Apostle]], marriage is a social obligation that has the potential of distracting from Christ. For him, celibacy is the single life, free from such distraction, not a life of saintly denial. Sex, in turn, is not sinful but natural, and sex within marriage is both proper and necessary. &lt;ref&gt;Will Deming, ''Paul on marriage and celibacy: the hellenistic background of 1 Corinthians 7.'' William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co 2003; 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the later St. Jerome, celibacy is a moral virtue, consisting by not living in the flesh but outside the flesh, as it were (vivere in carne praeter carnem). Celibacy excludes not only libidinous acts, but also sinful thoughts or desires of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;art. Celibacy, clerical, in ''Dictionary of Moral Theology.'' Compiled under the Direction of H. E. Cardinal Roberti. Ed. Mgr. Pietro Palazzini. London: Burns &amp; Oates Publishers of th Holy See 1962; &lt;/ref&gt; The first Conciliar document on celibacy of the Western Christian Church (Canon 33 of the Spanish Council of Elvira, c. 305 AD) states that the discipline of celibacy is to refrain from the ''use'' of marriage, i.e. refrain from having carnal contact with your spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Cholij ''Clerical Celibacy in East and West''. Gracewing 1990; 2nd Rev. ed., p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''The New Celibacy'', Gabrielle Brown states that &quot;abstinence is a response on the outside to what's going on, and celibacy is a response from the inside.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gabrielle. ''The New Celibacy: A Journey to Love, Intimacy, and Good Health in a New Age.'' Rev. ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, celibacy (even short-term celibacy that is pursued for non-religious reasons) is much more than not having sex. It is more intentional than abstinence, and its goal is personal growth and empowerment. This perspective on celibacy is echoed by several authors including Elizabeth Abbott, [[Wendy Keller]], and [[Wendy Shalit]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Elizabeth. ''A History of Celibacy''. Cambridge, MA: DaCapo, 1999.; Keller, Wendy. ''The Cult of the Born-Again Virgin: How Single Women Can Reclaim Their Sexual Power''. Deerfield Beach, FL: Health Communications, 1999.; Shalit, Wendy. ''A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue''. New York: Touchstone, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many evangelicals prefer the term &quot;abstinence&quot; to &quot;celibacy.&quot; Assuming everyone will marry, they focus their discussion on refraining from premarital sex and focusing on the joys of a future marriage. But some evangelicals, particularly older singles, desire a positive message of celibacy that moves beyond the &quot;wait until marriage&quot; message of abstinence campaigns. They seek a new understanding of celibacy that is focused on God rather than a future marriage or a life-long vow to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Colon, Christine, and Bonnie Field. Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{See also|Sexuality and Buddhism}}
The rule of celibacy in the Buddhist religion, whether [[Mahayana]] or [[Theravada]], has a long history. Celibacy was advocated as an ideal rule of life for all [[Bhikkhu|monk]]s and [[Bhikkhuni|nun]]s by [[Gautama Buddha]], except for Japan where it is not strictly followed due to historical political developments following the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Gautama, later known as the Buddha, is very well known for his renunciation of his wife, Princess [[Yasodharā]], and son, [[Rahula]]. In order to pursue an ascetic life, he needed to renounce aspects of the impermanent world, including his wife and son. Later on both his wife and son joined the ascetic community and are mentioned in the Buddhist texts to have become enlightened.

==Christianity==
Celibacy is viewed differently by the Catholic Church and the various Protestant communities. It includes [[clerical celibacy]], celibacy of the [[consecrated life]], voluntary lay celibacy, and celibacy outside of marriage.

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|19}}, [[Jesus Christ]] says &quot;11 Not all can accept [this] word, but only those to whom that is granted. 12 Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.&quot;

The Apostle Paul endorsed celibate life in his letter to the Corinthian Church,
{{quote|&quot;I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife. There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world – how she may please her husband. This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Later, Paul says &quot;Concerning the virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.” (1 Cor 7:25).

Celibacy as a vocation may be independent from [[religious vows]] (as is the case with [[consecrated virgins]], [[ascetics]] and hermits). Traditionally though, most celibate persons have been religious and monastics (monks resp. brothers and nuns resp. sisters). In the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] traditions, bishops are required to be celibate. In the Eastern Christian traditions, priests and deacons are allowed to be married, yet have to remain celibate if they are unmarried at the time of [[ordination]].

The [[Protestant Reformation]] initially rejected celibate life as a whole and even sexual continence for priests, though especially from the 19th century on, Protestant celibate communities have emerged, especially from [[Anglican]] and [[Lutheran]] backgrounds.

A few minor [[Christian]] sects even advocated celibacy as a better way of life for everyone. These groups included the [[Shakers]], the [[Harmony Society]] and the [[Ephrata Cloister]].

Celibacy not only for religious and monastics (brothers/monks and sisters/nuns) but also for bishops is upheld by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565340/Celibacy.html Celibacy]. Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQgBdNN Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic perspective===
{{See also|Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)}}
In the Roman Catholic Church the apostles were considered the first priests and bishops in the Church. The call to be eunuchs for the sake of heaven in Matthew 19 is considered a call to be sexually continent. Some say this developed into mandatory celibacy for priests who are believed to be the successors of the apostles. This is in spite of the fact that Peter was the first apostle called by Jesus (Matthew 4) and Peter was married (Matthew 8). A footnote in the New American Bible says: “Some scholars take the [call to be eunuchs for the sake of heaven to be meant for] those who have been divorced by their spouses and who have refused to enter into another marriage” (p. 1041).
The view of the Roman Catholic Church remains that celibacy is more a reflection of life in Heaven, a source of detachment from the material world which aids in one's relationship with God. Celibacy is designed to &quot;consecrate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to &quot;the affairs of the Lord, they give themselves entirely to God and to men. It is a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God.&quot;[1]

Catholic priests are called to be espoused (married) to the Church itself, and espoused to God, without overwhelming, exclusive commitments interfering with the relationship. Celibacy was not required of popes, bishops, or priests in the early church. The early church resisted asceticism and celibacy as ideals for clergy and popes, bishops, and priests married and sired children for over a thousand years after Christ &lt;ref&gt; Encyclopedia of Catholicism, San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1995. &lt;/ref&gt; Celibacy became obligatory for all priests in the west in the 12th century at the First Lateran Council (1123), Second Lateran Council (1139), and the Council of Trent (1545–64).&lt;ref&gt;New Advent, &quot;Celibacy of the Clergy&quot; (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03481a.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, only celibate men are ordained as priests in the [[Latin Rite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canon 1037 |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3R.HTM |publisher=Vatican |work=1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]]|accessdate=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canon 1031 |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Q.HTM |publisher=Vatican |work=1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]]|accessdate=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married men may become deacons, and married clergy who have converted from other denominations may become Catholic priests without becoming celibate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cholij| first=Roman |title=Priestly Celibacy in Patristics and in the History of the Church|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_01011993_chisto_en.html |publisher=Vatican |year=1993 |accessdate=6 April 2008}} A priest who is married at time of ordination continues to be married, with full obligation to all expectations of the marriage, but cannot remarry and remain in the practice of the priesthood.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory priestly celibacy is not a ''doctrine'', or dogma, of the Church (examples of Catholic doctrine would be the principle of the absolute respect for life or the belief in the Assumption and Immaculate Conception or the reservation of the priesthood to men) but a ''church rule'' or discipline, like the use of the vernacular (local) language in Mass or the ancient rule of Lenten fasting and abstinence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic.com Article&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Celibacy and the Priesthood|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Celibacy_and_the_Priesthood.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it can, at least theoretically, change at any time, though it still must be obeyed by Catholics in good standing. Some rules are more susceptible to alteration or exception than others, and this rule has been affirmed for some time. The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] ordain both celibate and married men. However, in both the East and the West, bishops are chosen from among those who are celibate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Niebuhur | first =Gustav | title =Bishop's Quiet Action Allows Priest Both Flock And Family | work =The New York Times | date =16 February 1997 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EEDD133FF935A25751C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1990 Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium, Canons 285, 373, 374, 758| publisher =Libreria Editrice Vaticana |year= 1990| url = http://www.gwo.cz/pravda/1990_Code_of_Canon_Law.htm|accessdate=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All rites of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition where marriage is not allowed after ordination.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} However many priests who resign end up marrying, and in remote areas or &quot;missions&quot; practising Catholic priests sometimes have ''de facto'' wives. In Ireland several priests have maintained &quot;secret&quot; families, the two most prominent being Bishop [[Eamonn Casey]] and Father [[Michael Cleary (priest)]].

The Catholic view on celibacy is based on the Christ's example, on his teaching as given in {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:11-12|NIV}} and on the writings of [[Saint Paul|Paul]], who wrote of the advantages celibacy allowed a man in serving the Lord,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck255&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Celibacy was &quot;held in high esteem&quot; from the Church's beginnings. It is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian [[Origen]]. Clerical celibacy began to be demanded in the 4th century, including [[papal decretal]]s beginning with [[Pope Siricius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter54&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory celibacy was typically expected of priests in the 11th century, as part of efforts to reform the medieval church, and became universal in the 12th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter145&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible explanation for the origins of obligatory celibacy revolves around more practical reason, &quot;the need to avoid claims on church property by priests' offspring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/nyregion/22egan.html | work=The New York Times | title=On Eve of Retirement, Cardinal Breathes Life Into Debate on Priestly Celibacy | first=Paul | last=Vitello | date=22 March 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains a matter of Canon Law (and oftentimes a criterion for certain religious orders, especially [[Franciscans]]) that priests do not own land and therefore cannot pass it on to legitimate or illegitimate children. The land belongs to the Church through the local diocese as administered by the Local Ordinary, or Bishop.

==== Universal celibacy ====
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
[[Jesus]]' characterization (in {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:30|NIV}}) of the future status of all persons in [[heaven]] is officially designated &quot;universal celibacy&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic.com Article&quot;/&gt; by the Roman Catholic Church: &quot;For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.&quot;

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, celibacy is usually associated with the ''[[sadhu]]s'' (&quot;holy men&quot;), ascetics who withdraw from worldly ties.

Celibacy, termed ''[[brahmacharya]]'' in Vedic scripture, is the fourth of the ''[[yamas]]'' and the word literally translated means &quot;dedicated to the Divinity of Life&quot;. The word is often used in yogic practice to refer to celibacy or denying pleasure, but this is only a small part of what ''brahmacharya'' represents.[http://gopal4mission.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/greatly-inspiring-brahmacharya-quotes/#Quotes_by_Swami_Krishnananda_discipline_of_Swami_Sivananda ] The purpose of practicing ''brahmacharya'' is to keep you focused on your purpose in life, the things that instill a feeling of peace and contentment.
==Brahma Kumaris==
In the religious movement of [[Brahma Kumaris]], celibacy is also promoted for peace and to defeat power of [[lust]] and to prepare for life in forthcoming Heaven on earth for 2,500 years when children will be created by the power of the mind even for householders to like like holy brother and sister. &lt;ref&gt;Babb, Lawrence A. (1987). Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition (Comparative Studies in Religion and Society). Oxford University Press. ISBN 0706925637. &quot;Sexual intercourse is unnecessary for reproduction because the souls that enter the world during the first half of the Cycle are in possession of a special yogic power (yog bal) by which they conceive children&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, David V (2001). The New Believers. Cassell &amp; Co. pp. 265. ISBN 0-304-35592-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brahma Kumaris]] belief system, celibacy is given the utmost importance. It is said that, as per the direction of the Supreme God those lead a pure and celibate life will be successfully able to conquer the surging vices. The power of celibacy creates an unseen environment of divinity bringing peace, power, purity, prosperity and fortune. Those with the power of celibacy are eligible to claim a bright future of Golden Age of heaven / Paradise. [[Brahma Kumaris]] concept of identifying the self as a soul, different from physical body, is deeply linked to the philosophy of celibacy. It is said that the craving for sex and impure thoughts are the reason for the whole trouble in the universe today.

==Islamic perspective==
{{See also|Nikah}}
Islam does not promote celibacy; rather it condemns [[premarital sex]]. In fact, according to Islam, marriage enables one to attain the highest form of righteousness within this sacred spiritual bond. It disagrees with the concept that marriage acts as a form of distraction in attaining nearness to God. The [[Qur'an]] (57:27) states, &quot;But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them but only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance.&quot; Notice that what it actually says is that real monasticism came from God, but is not mandatory for anybody, and that mandatory monasticism is an invention of man. This is no different than the teaching of the Bible on the matter. 

The following sayings about the Prophet are just that, sayings, and do not appear in the Quran:

&quot;There have been people who have come to the prophet and explained how they love to be engaged in prayer and fasting for the sake of God. The Prophet Mohammed told them that, despite this being good, it is also a blessing to raise a family, to remain moderate and not to concentrate too much on one aspect as not only can this be unhealthy for an individual as well as upon society, it may also take one away from God.&quot;

&quot;The Prophet Muhammad said that he who does not do ''[[nikah]]'' (marry) is not from me (does not follow my example).&quot;

==Secular==

The [[radical feminist]] group [[Cell 16]] were strongly championing celibacy as a challenge to male dominance, following in a tradition of celibacy dating back to the early feminists. They advocated women separate from &quot;men who are not consciously working for female liberation&quot;, but advised periods of celibacy. There have been activists who have been celibate to devote energy to their cause.

The earliest roots of celibacy were secular.  In the 6th century BC, &quot;Pythagoras himself established a small community that set a premium on study, vegetarianism, and sexual restraint or abstinence.  Later philosophers believed that celibacy would be conducive to the detachment and equilibrium required by the philosopher's calling.  Similarly, the increasing number of cults- e.g.s, Manichaeans and Gnostics-- had an inner circle requiring continence&quot; &lt;ref&gt; &quot;celibacy&quot;, The New Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th ed.,vol 3 Chicago, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics}}
A '''coalition government''' is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[government]] in which several [[political party|parties]] cooperate. The usual reason given for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a [[majority]] in the [[parliament]]. A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis, for example during wartime, or economic crisis, to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political science)|political legitimacy]], or [collective ideology] it desires whilst also playing a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed '''all-party coalitions''' ([[National government|national unity governments]], [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.

==In practice==
{{Section OR|date=June 2009}}
To deal with a situation in which no clear majorities appear through general elections, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or [[Minority government|minority cabinets]] which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a coalition with majority in a parliament, ideally, are more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of non-confidence. [[Majority government]]s based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained. 

Coalition cabinets are common in countries in which a parliament is [[proportional representation|proportionally representative]], with several organized political parties represented. It usually does not appear in countries in which the cabinet is chosen by the [[Executive (government)|executive]] rather than by a lower house, such as in the [[United States]] (however, coalition cabinets are common in [[Brazil]]). In [[semi-presidential system]]s such as [[France]], where the president formally appoints a [[prime minister]] but the government itself must still maintain the confidence of parliament, coalition governments occur quite regularly.

==Coalition governments worldwide==
{{see also|List of countries with coalition governments}}
Countries which often operate with coalition cabinets include: the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Kosovo]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kenya]], [[India]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Thailand]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Switzerland]] has been ruled by a coalition of the four strongest parties in parliament from 1959 to 2008, called the &quot;[[Zauberformel|Magic Formula]]&quot;. The [[United Kingdom]] also operates a formal coalition cabinet between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] parties.

===Coalitions composed of few parties===
In Germany, for instance, coalition government is the norm, as it is rare for either the [[Christian-Democratic Union of Germany]] and [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CDU/CSU) or the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least one of the smaller parties. For example, [[Helmut Kohl]]'s CDU governed for years in coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), from 1998 to 2005 [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s SPD was in power with the [[German Green Party|Greens]] and from 2009 Angela Merkel, CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.

In both countries, grand coalitions of the two large parties also occur, but these are relatively rare and large parties usually prefer to associate with small ones. However, if none of the larger parties can receive enough votes to form their preferred coalition, a grand coalition might be their only choice for forming a government. This was the situation in Germany in 2005 when Angela Merkel became Chancellor: in early [[German federal election, 2005|elections]], the CDU/CSU did not garner enough votes to form a majority coalition with the FDP; similarly the SPD and Greens did not have enough votes to continue on with their formerly ruling coalition. A grand coalition government was subsequently forged between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Partnerships like these typically involve carefully structured cabinets. The CDU/CSU ended up holding the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellory]] while the SPD took the majority of cabinet posts.

In Ireland, coalition governments are quite common with a single party not having ruled since 1977. Coalitions are typically formed of two or more parties always consisting of one of the two biggest parties, [[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Fine Gael]], and one or more smaller parties or independent members of parliament. The current government consists of [[Fine Gael]] and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]].

===Coalitions composed of many parties===
A coalition government may consist of any number of parties.

===Examples of coalitions===
====Germany====
In [[Politics of Germany|Germany]], the coalitions rarely consist of more than two parties (where CDU and CSU, two non-competing parties which always form a single [[caucus]], are in this regard considered a single party).

====Belgium====
In [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], where there are separate [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speaking and [[French language|French]] speaking parties for each political grouping, coalition cabinets of up to six parties are quite common.

====Finland====
In [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], no party has had an absolute majority in the parliament since independence, and multi-party coalitions have been the norm. Finland experienced its most stable government ([[Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet|Lipponen I]] and [[Paavo Lipponen's second cabinet|II]]) since [[Finland's declaration of independence|independence]] with a five-party governing coalition, a so called &quot;rainbow government&quot;. The Lipponen cabinets set the stability record, and were unusual in the respect that both moderate (SDP) and extreme left wing (Left Alliance) parties sat in the government with the major right-wing party (National Coalition). The current government ([[Kiviniemi I]]) is a four-party coalition.

====India====
[[Politics of India|India]]'s present governing coalition, the [[United Progressive Alliance]], consists of 13 separate parties.

====Israel====
A similar situation exists in [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], which has dozens of different parties with representation in the [[Knesset]]. The only faction to ever gain a majority of Knesset seats was [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]], an alliance of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] and [[Mapam]] that held an absolute majority for a brief period from 1968-1969. Historically, control of the Israeli government has alternated between periods of rule by the right-wing [[Likud]] in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties. [[Ariel Sharon|Ariel Sharon's]] formation of the centrist [[Kadima]] party in 2006 drew support from former Labor and Likud members, and Kadima ruled in coalition with several other parties.

====Japan====
Post-World War II [[Politics of Japan|Japan]] has historically been dominated by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] but there was a brief coalition government formed after the [[Japanese general election, 1993|1993 election]] following LDP's first loss of its overall [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] majority since 1955.

====Australia====
In [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|National]] parties are united in an effectively permanent coalition, known simply as [[Coalition (Australia)|the Coalition]]. The Coalition has become so stable, at least at the federal level, that in practice the lower house of Parliament has become a [[two-party system|two-party]] house, with the Coalition and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] being the major parties.

Other coalitions have been formed from time to time. Coalitions formed at a State/Territory level have included:
*In [[Tasmanian Government|Tasmania]]:
:*Liberal–[[Australian Greens|Greens]] coalition in [[Tasmanian state election, 1996|1996]];
:*Labor–Greens coalitions formed in [[Tasmanian state election, 1989|1989]] and [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010]].
*In the [[ACT Government|Australian Capital Territory]]:
:*Liberal–[[Independent (politician)|Independent]] coalition in [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 1998|1998]];
:*Labor–Greens coalitions in [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2001|2001]] and [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|2008]].

====United Kingdom====
{{see also|National Government (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom coalition government}}
In the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], coalition governments (sometimes known as ''national governments'') usually have been appointed only in times of national crisis. The most prominent was the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] of 1931 to 1940. There were multi-party coalitions during both [[world war]]s. Apart from this, when no party has had a majority, minority governments normally have been formed with one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote for the legislation governments need to function. However, in 1997 a Labour-LibDem coalition was under serious consideration on both sides around the time of Labour's landslide victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Minority Government Work:Hung Parliaments and the Challenges for Westminster and Whitehall|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]], following which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], which had won most seats, formed a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats]] in order to gain a parliamentary majority. This was the first time that the Conservatives and Lib Dems had made a power-sharing deal at Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/05/lib-dems-government-deal|title=Tories and Lib Dems enter full coalition government|publisher=The New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, having been formed 70 years virtually to the day after the establishment of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime coalition,&lt;ref&gt;Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, [[David Cameron]] on 11 May 2010. Churchill formed his War Cabinet on 11 May: Winston S. Churchill (1949) ''Their Finest Hour''.&lt;/ref&gt; although there had been an [[Lib-Lab pact|agreement, stopping short of a full coalition, between the Labour and Liberal parties]] from March 1977 until July 1978, when a series of by-election defeats had eroded Labour's majority of three seats which had been gained at the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 election]].

====Canada====
In [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], the [[Great Coalition]] was formed in 1864 by the [[Clear Grits]], [[Parti bleu]], and [[Liberal-Conservative Party]]. During the [[First World War]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] attempted to form a coalition with the opposition Liberals to broaden support for controversial conscription legislation. The Liberal Party refused the offer but some of their members did cross the floor and join the government. Although sometimes referred to as a coalition government, according to the definition above, it was not. It was disbanded after the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/05/13/f-coalition-government.html |title=Coalition Government: Precedents from around the world |publisher=CBC News |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2008 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], two of Canada's opposition parties announced they had signed an agreement to form what would become the country's second coalition government since [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] if they defeat the Conservative minority government in a vote of non-confidence;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coalition Set To Topple Canada PM|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122818032317670973.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-02|author=Menon, Nirmala}}&lt;/ref&gt; unseating [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister. The agreement outlined a formal coalition consisting of two opposition parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]. The [[Bloc Québécois]] agreed to support the proposed coalition on confidence matters for 18 months. In the end, parliament was prorogued by Stephen Harper and the coalition dispersed following the election.

==Arguments for and against coalition government==
Advocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more [[consensus]]-based politics, in that a government comprising differing parties (often based on different [[ideologies]]) would need to concur in regard to governmental [[policy]]. Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular [[opinion]] of the [[Constituency|electorate]] within a country. 

Those who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony. This is because coalitions would necessarily include different parties with differing beliefs and who, therefore, may not always agree on the correct path for governmental policy. Sometimes the results of an election are such that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, such as in [[Flanders]] or [[Northern Ireland]]. A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play &quot;[[kingmaker]]&quot; and, particularly in close elections, gain far more for their support than their vote would otherwise indicate.

Coalition governments have also been criticized for sustaining a [[consensus]] on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the opposition's proposals — even if there is [[disagreement]] within the ruling parties about the issue.

Powerful parties can also act in an [[Oligocracy|oligocratic]] way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to [[two-party system]]s, which typically exists because of stifling the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory [[nomination rules]] regulations and [[plurality voting system]]s, and so on.

A single, more powerful party can shape the policies of the coalition disproportionately. Smaller or less powerful parties can be intimidated to not openly disagree. In order to maintain the coalition, they will have to vote against the party's platform in the parliament. If they do not, the party has to leave the government and loses executive powers.

'''Chemical engineering'''  is the branch of [[engineering]] that deals with the application of [[physical science]] (e.g., [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]), and life sciences (e.g., [[biology]], [[microbiology]] and [[biochemistry]]) with [[mathematics]] and [[economics]], to the process of converting raw [[material]]s or [[chemical]]s into more useful or valuable forms. In addition to producing useful materials, modern chemical engineering is also concerned with pioneering valuable new materials and techniques – such as [[nanotechnology]], [[fuel cells]] and [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;From Petroleum to Penicillin. The First Hundred Years of Modern Chemical Engineering: 1859–1959. – Burnett, J. N.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical engineering largely involves the design, improvement and maintenance of processes involving chemical or [[biological]] transformations for large-scale [[manufacture]]. Chemical engineers ensure the processes are operated safely, sustainably and economically. Chemical engineers in this branch are usually employed under the title of '''process engineer'''. A related term with a wider definition is chemical technology. A person employed in this field is called a [[chemical engineer]].

==Chemical engineering timeline==
{{chemical engineering}}
{{Main|History of chemical engineering}}
In 1824, French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], in his &quot;On the Motive Power of Fire&quot;, was the first to study the [[thermodynamics]] of [[combustion reaction]]s.  In the 1850s, German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]] began to apply the principles developed by Carnot to chemical systems at the atomic to molecular scale.&lt;ref&gt;Mechanical Theory of Heat – Nine Memoirs on the development of concept of &quot;Entropy&quot; by Rudolf Clausius [1850–1865]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the years 1873 to 1876 at [[Yale University]], American mathematical physicist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], the first to be awarded a Ph.D. in engineering in the U.S., in a series of three papers, developed a mathematical-based, graphical methodology, for the study of chemical systems using the thermodynamics of Clausius.  In 1882, German physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], published a founding thermodynamics paper, similar to Gibbs, but with more of an electro-chemical basis, in which he showed that measure of [[chemical affinity]], i.e., the &quot;force&quot; of [[chemical reaction]]s, is determined by the measure of the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the reaction process. The following timeline shows some of the key steps in the development of the science of chemical engineering:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.che.ncsu.edu/history/HistoryoftheChEDepartment.pdf History of Chemical Engineering] – at North Carolina State University (and in general).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Image:Chemengg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chemical engineers operate processes at plants, above is the image of processes at an industry control room]]
Chemical engineers design processes to ensure the most economical operation. This means that the entire production chain must be planned and controlled for costs. A chemical engineer can both simplify and complicate &quot;showcase&quot; reactions for an economic advantage. Using a lower pressure or temperature makes several reactions easier; ammonia, for example, is simply produced from its component elements in a high-pressure reactor. On the other hand, reactions with a low yield can be recycled continuously, which would be complex, arduous work if done by hand in the laboratory. It is not unusual to build 8-step, or even 10-step evaporators to reuse the vaporization  energy for an economic advantage. In contrast, laboratory chemists evaporate samples in a single step.

The individual processes used by chemical engineers (e.g., [[distillation]] or [[filtration]]) are called [[unit operation]]s and consist of [[chemical reaction]]s, [[mass transfer|mass-]], [[heat transfer|heat-]] and [[fluid dynamics|momentum-]] transfer operations. Unit operations are grouped together in various configurations for the purpose of [[chemical synthesis]] and/or [[separation of mixture|chemical separation]]. Some processes are a combination of intertwined transport and separation unit operations, (e.g., [[reactive distillation]]).

Three primary physical laws underlying chemical engineering design are [[conservation of mass]], [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy]]. The movement of mass and energy around a chemical process are evaluated using [[mass balance]]s and [[energy balance]]s, laws that apply to discrete parts of equipment, unit operations, or an entire plant.  In doing so, chemical engineers must also use principles of [[thermodynamics]], [[reaction kinetics]], [[fluid mechanics]] and [[transport phenomena]]. The task of performing these balances is now aided by [[process simulation|process simulators]], which are complex software models (see [[List of Chemical Process Simulators]]) that can solve mass and energy balances and usually have built-in modules to simulate a variety of common unit operations.

== Design ==
Chemical engineers design chemical production equipment and entire chemical plants:
* Piping and pump sizing and specification
* [[Chemical reactor]]s
** [[Continuous stirred-tank reactor]]
** [[Plug flow reactor]]
** Catalytic reactor
* Separation equipment
** [[Distillation column]]
** Extraction column
** [[Evaporation]]
** [[Filtering]]
** [[Reverse osmosis]]
* [[Process Engineering|Process Systems Engineering]]
** Process control and instrumentation

Design is worked through in a number of phases. With the process concept and intended chemical reactions in hand, a [[Flowchart|Flowsheet]] is designed, which includes all material flows in the process, including not only starting materials and products, but all intermediates, wastes and [[unit operation]]s. Preliminary design is done to approximate cost, space and environmental requirements to further evaluate the viability of the concept. Later stages require the design and specification of all parts and each piece of equipment in the process, and finally, cost calculation and project planning. Supervision of the work, testing, simulation follow. Running the process and its maintenance continues, with continual improvement, for the life of the process, followed by shutdown and cleanup of the site.

== Modern chemical engineering ==
The modern discipline of chemical engineering encompasses much more than just process engineering.  Chemical engineers are now engaged in the development and production of a diverse range of products, as well as in commodity and specialty [[chemical]]s. These products include high performance materials needed for [[aerospace]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]], [[electronics|electronic]], [[environmental engineering|environmental]], [[space]] and [[military]] applications. Examples include ultra-strong fibers, [[Cloth|fabrics]], [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s, [[adhesives]] and composites for vehicles, [[Biocompatibility|bio-compatible materials]] for implants and [[prosthetics]], [[gel]]s for medical applications, [[pharmaceuticals]], and films with special [[dielectric]], optical or [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] properties for opto-electronic devices. Additionally, chemical engineering is often intertwined with [[biology]] and [[biomedical engineering]].  Many chemical engineers work on biological projects such as understanding biopolymers ([[proteins]]) and [[human genome project|mapping the human genome]].
The line between chemists and chemical engineers is growing ever more thin as more and more chemical engineers begin to start their own innovation using their knowledge of chemistry, physics and mathematics to create, implement and mass produce their ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{redirect|Compactness|the concept in first-order logic|compactness theorem}}
In [[mathematics]], specifically [[general topology]] and [[metric topology]], a '''compact space''' is an abstract mathematical [[topological space|space]] whose topology has the '''compactness''' property, which has many important implications not valid in general spaces. Compactness is not easy to describe precisely in an intuitive manner; in some sense it says that the topology allows the space to be considered as &quot;small&quot; (compactness is a kind of topological counterpart to [[finite set|finiteness]] of sets), even though as a set it may be quite large. Moreover, more intuitive characterizations of compactness are often dependent on additional properties of the topological space to be valid; the following description assumes the space is a [[metric space]], so that &quot;closeness&quot; of points has meaning. Then compactness means that whenever one chooses infinitely many sample points from the space, there is bound to be at least one point of the space to which some of the samples ultimately get arbitrarily close. This could be because some point is itself sampled infinitely many times (as would necessarily happen if the space were finite), but a more significant possibility is that the point itself is not in the sample, but that any neighborhood of the point, however small, does contain infinitely many sample points.

Important, but non-obvious, examples of compact spaces are any closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'',''b''] of the [[real number]]s, or any [[rectangle]] (including its boundary) of the plane. More generally the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]] characterizes compactness of subspaces of the real numbers, or more generally of finite dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s, as those subsets that are both [[closed set|closed]] and bounded. Apart from closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space, typical examples of compact spaces include spaces consisting not of geometrical points but of [[function space|functions]]. The term ''compact'' was introduced into mathematics by [[Maurice Fréchet]] in 1906 as a distillation of this concept.  Compactness in this more general situation plays an extremely important role in [[mathematical analysis]], because many classical and important theorems of 19th century analysis, such as the [[extreme value theorem]], are easily generalized to this situation.  A typical application is furnished by the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] and in particular the [[Peano existence theorem]], in which one is able to conclude the existence of a function with some required properties as a limiting case of some more elementary construction.

There are several different notions of compactness, noted below, that are equivalent in some settings; the  version described above is known as [[sequential compactness]]. In general [[metric space]]s various notions of compactness, including sequential compactness and [[limit point compact]]ness are equivalent. In general [[topological space]]s, however, the different notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent, and the most useful notion, introduced by [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]] in 1929, involves the existence of certain finite families of [[open set]]s that [[Cover (topology)|cover]] the space in the sense that each point of the space must lie in some set contained in the family. This more subtle definition exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of [[finite set]]s.  In spaces that are compact in this latter sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds [[local property|locally]] (that is, in a neighborhood of each point) into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many [[#Theorems|theorems]] are of this character.

==Introduction==
An example of a compact space is the [[unit interval]] [0,1] of real numbers.  If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some [[accumulation point]] in that interval. For instance, the odd terms of the sequence {{nowrap|1, 1/2, 1/3, 3/4, 1/5, 5/6, 1/7, 7/8,&amp;hellip;}} get arbitrarily close to&amp;nbsp;0, while the even ones get arbitrarily close to&amp;nbsp;1. If one would choose the sequence of points at [[random variable|random]], then ''any'' point of the interval would ultimately be approached arbitrarily closely by some of the chosen points. The given example sequence shows the importance of including the boundary points of the interval, since the limit points must be in the space itself: an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be [[bounded set|bounded]], since in the interval [0,∞) one could choose the sequence of points {{nowrap|0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;hellip;}}, of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.

In two dimensions, closed [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary.  However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior.  Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can tend to the missing point without tending to any point ''within'' the space.  Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.

Compactness generalizes many important properties of [[closed (topology)|closed]] and bounded intervals in the real line; that is, intervals of the form [''a'',''b''] for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''. For instance, any continuous function defined on a compact space into an ordered set (with the [[order topology]]) such as the real line is bounded. Thus, what is known as the [[extreme value theorem]] in [[calculus]] generalizes to compact spaces. In this fashion, one can prove many important theorems in the class of compact spaces, that do not hold in the context of non-compact ones.

Various definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality.  A subset of [[Euclidean space]] in particular is called compact if it is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]].  This implies, by the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], that any infinite [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] from the set has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in the set.  This puts a fine point on the idea of taking &quot;steps&quot; in a space.  Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as [[sequential compactness]] and [[limit point compact]]ness, can be developed in general [[metric space]]s.

In general [[topological space]]s, however, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent, and the most useful notion of compactness&amp;mdash;originally called ''bicompactness''&amp;mdash;involves families of [[open set]]s that &quot;cover&quot; the space in the sense that each point of the space must lie in some set contained in the family.  Specifically, a topological space is compact if, whenever a collection of open sets covers the space, some subcollection consisting only of finitely many open sets also covers the space. That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known [[local property|locally]]&amp;mdash;in a neighborhood of each point of the space&amp;mdash;and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space.  An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a [[continuous function]] on a compact interval is [[uniformly continuous]]: here continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.

==Definition==
Formally, a [[topological space]] is called ''compact'' if each of its [[open cover]]s has a [[finite set|finite]] [[subcover]]. Otherwise it is called ''non-compact''.  Explicitly, this means that for every arbitrary collection 

:&lt;math&gt;\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}&lt;/math&gt;

of open subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;X=\bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

there is a finite subset &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;X=\bigcup_{i\in J} U_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Some branches of mathematics such as [[algebraic geometry]], typically influenced by the French school of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], use the term ''quasi-compact'' for the general notion, and reserve the term ''compact'' for topological spaces that are both [[Hausdorff spaces|Hausdorff]] and ''quasi-compact''.  A single compact set is sometimes referred to as a ''compactum''; following the [[Latin]] [[Latin declension#Second declension (o)|second declension (neuter)]], the corresponding plural form is ''compacta''.

===Compactness of subspaces===
A subset ''K'' of a topological space ''X'' is called compact if is compact in the [[induced topology]].  Explicitly, this means that for every arbitrary collection
:&lt;math&gt;\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}&lt;/math&gt;

of open subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;K\subset\bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

there is a finite subset &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;K\subset\bigcup_{i\in J} U_i.&lt;/math&gt;

== Historical development ==
In the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness.  On the one hand, [[Bernard Bolzano]] ([[#CITEREFBolzano1817|1817]]) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a [[limit point]].  Bolzano's proof relied on the [[method of bisection]]: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected.  The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point.  The full significance of Bolzano's theorem, and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by [[Karl Weierstrass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=952–953}}; {{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880's, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for [[function spaces|spaces of functions]] rather than just numbers or geometrical points.   The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of [[Giulio Ascoli]] and [[Cesare Arzelà]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|loc=Chapter 46, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The culmination of their investigations, the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]], was a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to families of [[continuous function]]s, the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions.  The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's &quot;limit point&quot;.  Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of [[integral equation]]s, as investigated by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Erhard Schmidt]].  For a certain class of [[Green function]]s coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem held in the sense of [[mean convergence]]&amp;mdash;or convergence in what would later be dubbed a [[Hilbert space]].  This ultimately led to the notion of a [[compact operator]] as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space.    It was [[Maurice René Fréchet|Maurice Fréchet]] who, in [[#CITEREFFréchet1906|1906]], had distilled the essence of the Bolzano–Weierstrass property and coined the term ''compactness'' to refer to this general phenomenon.

However, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the turn of the century from the study of the [[linear continuum|continuum]], which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis.  In 1870, [[Eduard Heine]] showed that a [[continuous function]] defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact [[uniformly continuous]].  In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. The significance of this lemma was recognized by [[Émile Borel]] ([[#CITEREFBorel1895|1895]]), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by [[Pierre Cousin]] (1895) and [[Henri Lebesgue]] ([[#CITEREFLebesgue1904|1904]]).  The [[Heine–Borel theorem]], as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.

This property was significant because it allowed for the passage from [[local property|local information]] about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function).  This sentiment was expressed by {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}}, who also exploited it in the development of the [[Lebesgue integral|integral now bearing his name]].  Ultimately the Russian school of [[point-set topology]], under the direction of [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]], formulated Heine–Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a [[topological space]].  {{harvtxt|Alexandrov|Urysohn|1929}} showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fréchet, now called (relative) [[sequential compactness]], under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers.  It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.
&lt;!--
One of the main reasons for studying compact spaces is because they are in some ways very similar to [[finite set]]s: there are many results which are easy to show for finite sets, whose proofs carry over with minimal change to compact spaces. Here is an example:

* Suppose ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space]], and we have a point ''x'' in ''X'' and a finite subset ''A'' of ''X'' not containing ''x''. Then we can [[separated sets|separate]] ''x'' and ''A'' by [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhoods]]: for each ''a'' in ''A'', let ''U''(''x'') and ''V''(''a'') be disjoint neighborhoods containing ''x'' and ''a'', respectively. Then the intersection of all the ''U''(''x'') and the union of all the ''V''(''a'') are the required neighborhoods of ''x'' and ''A''.

Note that if ''A'' is [[infinite]], the proof fails, because the intersection of arbitrarily many neighborhoods of ''x'' might not be a neighborhood of ''x''. The proof can be &quot;rescued&quot;, however, if ''A'' is compact: we simply take a finite subcover of the cover {''V''(''a'') : ''a'' in A} of ''A'', then intersect the corresponding finitely many ''U''(''x''). In this way, we see that in a Hausdorff space, any point can be separated by neighborhoods from any compact set not containing it. In fact, repeating the argument shows that any two disjoint compact sets in a Hausdorff space can be separated by neighborhoods – note that this is precisely what we get if we replace &quot;point&quot; (i.e. [[singleton set]]) with &quot;compact set&quot; in the Hausdorff [[separation axiom]]. Many of the arguments and results involving compact spaces follow such a pattern.

== Examples ==
=== General topology ===
* Any [[finite topological space]], including the [[empty set]], is compact.  Slightly more generally, any space with a [[finite topology]] (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the [[trivial topology]].
* Any space carrying the [[cofinite topology]] is compact.
* Any [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of [[Alexandroff one-point compactification]]. The one-point compactification of '''R''' is homeomorphic to the circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;; the one-point compactification of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is homeomorphic to the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;. Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.
* The [[right order topology]] or [[left order topology]] on any bounded [[totally ordered set]] is compact. In particular, [[Sierpinski space]] is compact.
* '''R''' carrying the [[lower limit topology]] satisfies the property that no uncountable set is compact.
* In the [[cocountable topology]] on '''R''' (or any uncountable set for that matter), no infinite set is compact.
* Neither of the spaces in the previous two examples are [[locally compact]] but both are still [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]]

=== Analysis and algebra ===
* The closed [[unit interval]] [0,&amp;nbsp;1] is compact. This follows from the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. The open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) is not compact: the [[open cover]]  (&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;1−&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;)  for ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;  does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of ''[[rational numbers]]'' in the closed interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\frac{1}{\pi}-\frac{1}{n}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{1}{\pi}+\frac{1}{n},1\right]&lt;/math&gt; cover all the rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] for ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 4,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;  but this cover does not have a finite subcover. (Note that the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.)
* The set '''R''' of all real numbers is ''not compact'' as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1, ''n'' + 1)}}, where ''n'' takes all integer values in '''Z''', cover '''R''' but there is no finite subcover. 
* More generally, [[compact group]]s such as an [[orthogonal group]] are compact, while groups such as a [[general linear group]] are not.
* For every [[natural number]] ''n'', the ''n''-[[sphere]] is compact. Again from the Heine–Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional [[normed vector space]] is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its [[closed unit ball]] is compact.
* On the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. ([[Alaoglu's theorem]])
* The [[Cantor set]] is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.
* Since the [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic integers]] are [[homeomorphic]] to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.
* Consider the set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of all functions &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; so that a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_n\}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; converges towards &lt;math&gt;f\in K&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{f_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; converges towards &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. There is only one such topology; it is called the [[topology of pointwise convergence]]. Then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a compact topological space; this follows from the [[Tychonoff theorem]].
* Consider the set ''K'' of all functions ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&amp;nbsp;→ [0,&amp;nbsp;1] satisfying the [[Lipschitz condition]] |''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''y'')|&amp;nbsp;≤ |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''| for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;∈ [0,&amp;nbsp;1].  Consider on ''K''&amp;thinsp; the metric induced by the [[uniform convergence|uniform distance]] &lt;math&gt;d(f,g)=\sup\{|f(x)-g(x)| \colon x\in [0,1]\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] the space ''K'' is compact.
* The [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of any [[bounded linear operator]] on a [[Banach space]] is a nonempty compact subset of the [[complex number]]s '''C'''. Conversely, any compact subset of '''C''' arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space [[sequence spaces#ℓp spaces|&lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt;]] may have any compact nonempty subset of '''C''' as spectrum.
* The [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of any [[commutative ring]] with the [[Zariski topology]] (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], &quot;quasi&quot; referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.
* The [[spectrum of a boolean algebra|spectrum]] of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is compact, a fact which is part of the [[Stone representation theorem]].  [[Stone space]]s, compact [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied.  Such spaces are also useful in the study of [[profinite group]]s.
* The [[structure space]] of a commutative unital [[Banach algebra]] is a compact Hausdorff space.
* The [[Hilbert cube]] is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem.

== Theorems ==
Some theorems related to compactness (see the [[glossary of topology]] for the definitions):

* A [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] image of a compact space is compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.2}}; See also {{planetmathref|id=4689|title=Compactness is preserved under a continuous map}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pre-image of a compact space under a [[proper map]] is compact.
* The [[extreme value theorem]]: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Corollary 5.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.)
* A closed subset of a compact space is compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.3}}; {{planetmathref|id=4177|title=Closed set in a compact space is compact}}; {{planetmathref|id=4691|title=Closed subsets of a compact set are compact}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A finite union of compact sets is compact.
* A nonempty compact subset of the [[real number]]s has a greatest element and a least element.
* The [[product topology|product]] of any collection of compact spaces is compact. ([[Tychonoff's theorem]], which is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]])
* Every topological space ''X'' is a [[dense topological subspace|dense subspace]] of a compact space having at most one point more than ''X'', by the [[Compactification (mathematics)|Alexandroff one-point compactification]].  By the same construction, every [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space ''X'' is a dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than ''X''..
*Let X be a [[total order|simply ordered]] set endowed with the [[order topology]]. Then X is compact if and only if X is a [[complete lattice]] (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steen|Seebach|1995|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Characterizations of compactness
The following are equivalent.
# A topological space ''X''  is compact.
# Any collection of closed subsets of ''X'' with the [[finite intersection property]] has nonempty intersection.
# ''X'' has a sub-base such that every cover of the space by members of the sub-base has a finite subcover ([[Alexander's sub-base theorem]])
# Every [[Net (mathematics)|net]] on ''X'' has a convergent subnet (see the article on [[Net_(mathematics)|nets]] for a proof).
# Every [[mathematical filter|filter]] on ''X'' has a convergent refinement.
# Every [[ultrafilter]] on ''X'' converges to at least one point.
# Every infinite subset of ''X'' has a [[Limit_point#complete accumulation point|complete accumulation point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kelley|1955|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Euclidean space
For any [[subset]] ''A'' of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the following are equivalent:
# ''A'' is compact.
# Every [[open cover]] of ''A'' has a finite [[subcover]].
# Every [[sequence]] in ''A'' has a [[Limit of a sequence|convergent]] subsequence, whose limit lies in ''A''.
# Every infinite subset of ''A'' has at least one [[limit point]] in ''A''.
# ''A'' is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] ([[Heine-Borel theorem]]).
# ''A'' is [[complete (topology)|complete]] and [[totally bounded]].

In practice, the condition (5) is easiest to verify, for example a closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] or closed ''n''-ball.

;Metric spaces
* A [[metric space]] (or [[uniform space]]) is compact if and only if it is [[completeness (topology)|complete]] and [[totally bounded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.3.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the metric space ''X'' is compact and an open cover of ''X'' is given, then there exists a number δ &gt; 0 such that every subset of ''X'' of diameter &lt; δ is contained in some member of the cover. ([[Lebesgue's number lemma]])
* Every compact metric space is [[Separable space|separable]].
* A metric space (or more generally any [[first-countable]] [[uniform space]]) is compact if and only if every [[sequence]] in the space has a convergent subsequence. ([[Sequentially compact]])

;Hausdorff spaces
* A compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, compact sets can be separated by open sets: if ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are compact and disjoint, there exist disjoint open sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K_1 \subset U_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_2 \subset U_2&lt;/math&gt;. This is to say, compact Hausdorff space is [[normal space|normal]].
* Two compact Hausdorff spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are homeomorphic if and only if their [[mathematical ring|rings]] of continuous real-valued functions C(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and C(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[ring homomorphism|isomorphic]].  ([[Gelfand–Naimark theorem]])  Properties of the [[Banach space]] of [[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space]] are central to abstract analysis.
* Every continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is [[closed map|closed]] and [[proper map|proper]] (i.e., the pre-image of a compact set is compact.) In particular, every continuous [[bijective]] map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a [[homeomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Corollary 5.2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A topological space can be embedded in a compact Hausdorff space if and only if it is a [[Tychonoff space]].

== Other forms of compactness ==
There are a number of topological properties which are equivalent to compactness in [[metric spaces]], but are inequivalent in general topological spaces. These include the following.

* [[Sequentially compact space|Sequentially compact]]: Every [[sequence]] has a convergent subsequence.
* [[countably compact space|Countably compact]]: Every countable open cover has a finite subcover.  (Or, equivalently, every infinite subset has an ω-accumulation point.)
* [[Pseudocompact space|Pseudocompact]] : Every real-valued [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] on the space is bounded.
* [[Limit point compact]]: Every infinite subset has an [[accumulation point]].

While all these conditions are equivalent for [[metric space]]s, in general we have the following implications:

* Compact spaces are countably compact.
* Sequentially compact spaces are countably compact.
* Countably compact spaces are pseudocompact and weakly countably compact.

Not every countably compact space is compact; an example is given by the [[first uncountable ordinal]] with the [[order topology]].
Not every compact space is sequentially compact; an example is given by 2&lt;sup&gt;[0,1]&lt;/sup&gt;, with the product topology {{harv|Scarborough|Stone|1966|loc=Example 5.3}}.
 
A metric space is called pre-compact or [[totally bounded]] if any sequence has a Cauchy subsequence; this can be generalised to [[uniform space]]s. For complete metric spaces this is equivalent to compactness. See [[relatively compact]] for the topological version.

Another related notion which (by most definitions) is strictly weaker than compactness is [[locally compact space|local compactness]].

Generalizations of compactness include [[H-closed]] and the property of being an [[H-set]] in a parent space. A space is
H-closed if every open cover has a finite subfamily whose union is dense. Whereas we say '''X''' is an H-set of '''Z''' if
every cover of '''X''' with open sets of '''Z''' has a finite subfamily whose '''Z''' closure contains '''X'''.
