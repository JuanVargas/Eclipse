 area of approximately 86,600 square kilometers, less than 1% of the land area of the former [[Soviet Union]]. Of the three Transcaucasian states, Azerbaijan has the greatest land area. Special administrative subdivisions are the [[Nakhchivan|Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]], which is separated from the rest of Azerbaijan by a strip of [[Armenia]]n territory, and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region]], entirely within Azerbaijan. (The status of Nagorno-Karabakh was under negotiation in 1994.) Located in the region of the southern Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea to the east, Georgia and Russia to the north, Iran to the south, and Armenia to the southwest and west. A small part of Nakhchivan also borders Turkey to the northwest. The capital of Azerbaijan is the ancient city of Baku, which has the largest and best harbor on the Caspian Sea and has long been the center of the republic's oil industry.

==Topography and drainage==
[[File:Azerbaijan topographic map-de.svg|thumb|300px|Topographic map of Azerbaijan.]]
The elevation changes over a relatively short distance from lowlands to highlands; nearly half the country is considered mountainous. Notable physical features are the gently undulating hills of the subtropical southeastern coast, which are covered with tea plantations, orange groves, and lemon groves; numerous mud volcanoes and mineral springs in the ravines of [[Kobustan Mountain]] near Baku; and coastal terrain that lies as much as twenty-eight meters below sea level.

Except for its eastern Caspian shoreline and some areas bordering Georgia and Iran, Azerbaijan is ringed by mountains. To the northeast, bordering Russia's Dagestan Autonomous Republic, is the [[Greater Caucasus]] range; to the west, bordering Armenia, is the [[Lesser Caucasus]] range. To the extreme southeast, the [[Talysh Mountains]] form part of the border with Iran. The highest elevations occur in the Greater Caucasus, where [[Bazardüzü|Mount Bazar-dyuzi]] rises 4,485 meters above sea level. Eight large rivers flow down from the Caucasus ranges into the central [[Kura-Aras Lowlands]], alluvial flatlands and low delta areas along the seacoast designated by the Azerbaijani name for the [[Mtkvari River]](Kur) and its main tributary, the Aras. The Mtkvari, the longest river in the Caucasus region, forms the delta and drains into the Caspian a short distance downstream from the confluence with the Aras. The [[Mingechaur Reservoir]], with an area of 605 square kilometers that makes it the largest body of water in Azerbaijan, was formed by damming the Kura in western Azerbaijan. The waters of the reservoir provide hydroelectric power and irrigation of the Kura-Aras plain. Most of the country's rivers are not navigable. About 15% of the land in Azerbaijan is arable.

==Mountains==
Azerbaijan is nearly surrounded by mountains. The [[Greater Caucasus]] range, with the country’s highest elevations, lies in the north along the border with [[Russia]] and run southeast to the [[Abseron Peninsula]] on the [[Caspian Sea]]. The country’s highest peak, [[Bazardüzü|Bazardyuze Dagi]], rises to 4,485 m in this range near the Azerbaijan-Russia border. The [[Lesser Caucasus]] range, with elevations up to 3,500 m, lies to the west along the border with Armenia. The [[Talish Mountains]] form part of the border with Iran at the southeast tip of the country.

[[Kobustan Mountain]], located near [[Baku]], is carved by deep ravines, from which bubble mud [[volcano]]es and [[mineral spring]]s.

==Climate==
===Temperature===
The climate varies from subtropical and humid in the southeast to subtropical and dry in central and eastern Azerbaijan. Along the shores of the Caspian Sea it is temperate, while the higher mountain elevations are generally cold. [[Baku]], on the Caspian, enjoys mild weather that averages {{convert|4|°C|1}} in January and {{convert|25|°C}} in July.

===Rainfall===
Most of Azerbaijan receives little rainfall, only {{convert|152|to|254|mm|in|2|sp=us}} annually on average. As a result, agricultural areas require irrigation. Approximately {{convert|14500|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of the land is irrigated. The greatest precipitation falls in the highest elevations of the Caucasus but also in the [[Länkäran Lowlands]] of the extreme southeast. The yearly average in these areas can exceed {{convert|1000|mm|in|2|sp=us}}.

==Environmental problems==
Air and water pollution are widespread and pose great challenges to economic development. Major sources of pollution include oil refineries and chemical and metallurgical industries, which in the early 1990s continued to operate as inefficiently as they had in the Soviet era. Air quality is extremely poor in Baku, the center of oil refining. Some reports have described Baku's air as the most polluted in the former Soviet Union, and other industrial centers suffer similar problems.

The Caspian Sea, including Baku Bay, has been polluted by oil leakages and the dumping of raw or inadequately treated sewage, reducing the yield of caviar and fish. In the Soviet period, Azerbaijan was pressed to use extremely heavy applications of pesticides to improve its output of scarce subtropical crops for the rest of the Soviet Union. The continued regular use of the pesticide DDT in the 1970s and 1980s was an egregious lapse, although that chemical was officially banned in the Soviet Union because of its toxicity to humans. Excessive application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers has caused extensive groundwater pollution and has been linked by Azerbaijani scientists to birth defects and illnesses. Rising water levels in the Caspian Sea, mainly caused by natural factors exacerbated by man-made structures, have reversed the decades-long drying trend and now threaten coastal areas; the average level rose 1.5 meters between 1978 and 1993. Because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, large numbers of trees were felled, roads were built through pristine areas, and large expanses of agricultural land were occupied by military forces.

Like other former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan faces a gigantic environmental cleanup complicated by the economic uncertainties left in the wake of the Moscow-centered planning system. The Committee for the Protection of the Natural Environment is part of the Azerbaijani government, but in the early 1990s it was ineffective at targeting critical applications of limited funds, establishing pollution standards, or monitoring compliance with environmental regulations. Early in 1994, plans called for Azerbaijan to participate in the international Caspian Sea Forum, sponsored by the European Union (EU).

; [[Natural hazard]]s:
: Droughts; some lowland areas threatened by rising levels of the Caspian Sea
; [[Natural environment|Environment]]--current issues:
: Local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baky and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe air, water, and soil [[pollution]]; soil pollution results from the use of [[DDT]] as a pesticide and also from toxic defoliants used in the production of [[cotton]].

Armenia and Azerbaijan do not have formal diplomatic relations today.
|See [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations]], [[Khojaly Massacre]], [[Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan]]

The neighboring nations of [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] have had formal governmental relations since 1918. The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War)]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War)]], in the past century, with last one ended with provisional [[Bishkek Protocol|cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek]]. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. In 2008, Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] declared that ''“Nagorno Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality”'' and that ''“in 1918, [[Yerevan]] was granted to the [[Armenians]].  It was a great mistake.  The [[Erivan khanate|khanate of Iravan]] was the [[Azeris|Azeri]] territory, the Armenians were guests here”''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan], ''[[REGNUM News Agency]]'', January 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with mutual massacres in Azerbaijan and Armenia resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the [[United States|U.S.]], [[France]], and [[Russia]] and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several [[Western Europe]]an nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, barring a diplomatic passport, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml Azerbaijan Country Page]. [[NCSJ]]: Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States &amp; Eurasia. Accessed May 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;regnum.ru&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html | title= Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan | publisher= [[REGNUM News Agency]] | author =  | date=January 17, 2008 | accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan formally recognizes the government of the [[Republic of Cyprus]], as the sole representative of the island, but has not yet established diplomatic relations with Cyprus.

See [[Azerbaijan–Cyprus relations]]

Azerbaijan, like all other countries except Turkey, formally recognizes the government of the [[Republic of Cyprus]] (with whom it has not yet established diplomatic relations), which under UN and EU law represents the entire island, but interestingly enough, the parliament of Azerbaijan's [[Nakhchivan|Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] issued a resolution recognizing the Turkish Cypriot North (The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]) as a sovereign state.  While this recognition is not regarded by Azerbaijan and internationally as 'official state-to-state', Azerbaijan itself maintained cordial unofficial relations with the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|TRNC]]. In 2004, Azerbaijan threatened to formally recognize the TRNC if the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] was voted down by the Greek Cypriots (who rejected the plan in one of twin referendums held April 24, 2004 in both the Greek and Turkish zones simultaneously), but Azerbaijan backed off the threat when it was pointed out by Cyprus that doing so would be hypocritical, as a portion of its territory just like that of Cyprus itself is under occupation and would probably result in negative impact on its ongoing dispute with Armenia over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].  Recently, in July 2005, Azerbaijan announced its intentions to recognize TRNC passports and to commence direct flights from Baku to Ercan Airport in the TRNC (by-passing both [[Turkey]] and the Republic of Cyprus); however, aside from a flight handled by the private company [[Imair]] in August 2005, none have taken place. Azerbaijan has become very cool towards the Turkish Cypriot North, due to tensions arising from the possible normalization of diplomatic ties between Turkey and [[Armenia]] which Azerbaijan fears will mean the loss of key leverage in the resolution of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishpolicy.com/images/stories/2005-04-neighbors/TPQ2005-4-ismailzade.pdf Turkey and Azerbaijan: The Honeymoon is Over] by Fariz Ismailzade.

===Nagorno-Karabakh/Armenia===
{{see also|Nagorno-Karabakh conflict}}
[[Armenia]] supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan in the longstanding and very bitter separatist conflict against the Azerbaijani Government;

Nagorno-Karabakh is a region within Azerbaijan. The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh [[Supreme Soviet]] voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against ethnic Azeris in Armenia and ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan. In 1990, after violent episodes in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, [[Baku]] and [[Sumgait]], [[Moscow]] declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sent troops to the region, and [[Black January|forcibly occupied Baku]], killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian paramilitaries operating in Karabakh. Moscow also deployed troops to [[Yerevan]]. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was heavily influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring nations in order to keep both under control.

More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting from 1992 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized [[Shusha]] and [[Lachin]] (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in occupying almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the [[UN Security Council]] adopted [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh War|four resolutions]] calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 when [[Russia]] brokered a cease-fire.

Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by Russia, [[France]], and the [[United States]] and has representation from [[Turkey]], the U.S., several European nations, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, [[sniper]]-fire, and [[land mine|landmine]] incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Since 1997, the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. One side or the other rejected each of those proposals. Beginning in 1999, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Most recently the OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in [[Key West]], [[Florida]]. [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] launched the talks on April 3, 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia, and France until April 6, 2001. The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.

The two countries are still technically at war.

The '''Azerbaijani Armed Forces''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Silahlı Qüvvələri}}) were re-established according to the Law of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] on the Armed Forces from 9 October 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.az official web page of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR) had originally formed its own armed forces from 26 June 1918.  However these were dissolved after Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Soviet Union as the  [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 28 April 1920. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991-92 the armed forces were reformed based on Soviet bases and equipment left on Azeri soil.

The armed forces have three branches: the [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]], the [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]], and the [[Azerbaijani Navy]].&lt;ref name=JSSA-MT /&gt; Associated forces include the [[Azerbaijani National Guard]], the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], and the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], which can be involved in state defense under certain circumstances.

According to the Azerbaijani media sources the military expenditures of Azerbaijan for 2009 were set at $2.46 billion [[United States dollar|USD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gov`t allots over $2bn for 2009 defense spending |url= http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=8601 |publisher= AzerNEWS |first= |last= |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate= 2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, however according to [[SIPRI]], only $1.473 billion was spent in that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIPRI&quot; /&gt; [[IISS]] also suggests that the defence budget in 2009 was $1.5 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=Routledge for the IISS |location=London|isbn=1857435575 |page=176}} &lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan has its own [[Azerbaijan Defense Industry|Defense Industry]], which manufactures small arms.

==Overview==
Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Azerbaijan has been undergoing extensive modernization and capacity expanding programs, with the military budget increasing from around $300 million in 2005 to $2.46 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL1597375 | work=Reuters | title=Azerbaijan announces 53 pct rise in army spending | date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total armed forces number 56,840 men in the land forces, 7,900 men in the air force and air defence force, and 2,200 men in the navy.&lt;ref name&quot;IISS 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=Routledge for the IISS |location=London|isbn=1857435575 |page=176}} &lt;/ref&gt; There are also 19,500 personnel in the National Guard, State Border Service, and Internal Troops.&lt;ref name=Blandy12&gt;C.

Azerbaijan has acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-[[List of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]]. Azerbaijan participates in [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]]. Azerbaijan joined the [[U.S.-led coalition against Iraq]] in 2003. It sent 150 troops to Iraq, and later troops to Kosovo. Azeri troops are still serving in Afghanistan.

Despite the rise in Azerbaijan's defence budget, which now doubles Armenia's entire state budget,&lt;ref&gt;Blandy, 'Azerbaijan: Is War Over Nagornyy Karabakh a Realistic Option?, 2008, p.6, quoting http://nvo.ng.ru/wars/2007-02-09/2_poroh.html Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the armed forces did not have a high state of battle readiness and were ill-prepared for wide scale combat operations&lt;ref name=&quot;Blandy, 2008, p.7&quot;&gt;Blandy, 2008, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; till the year 2008. Though, recent acquisition of modern hardware, training methods together with NATO IPAP, where the first cycle was finished successfully (2005–2007) and the second cycle of (2008–2010) is recently finished, the Azerbaijani military potential has risen significantly.{{cn|date=May 2011}}

Today '[[National Hero of Azerbaijan]]' is the highest national title in the country, awarded for outstanding services of national importance to Azerbaijan in defense, as well as other deeds in other spheres.

==History of Azerbaijan military==
{{Main|Military history of Azerbaijan}}

===Azerbaijan Democratic Republic===
[[File:Mehmandarov.jpg|thumb|125px|left|[[Samad bey Mehmandarov]], the Minister of Defense of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]]]
The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created on June 26, 1918. First ''de facto'' Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]]. When the Ministry was formally established Gen. [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] became the minister, and then Lt-Gen. [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Lt-Gen. Mamedbey Sulkevich (March 1919 - 10 December 1919) and Maj-Gen. Abdulhamid bey Gaitabashi (10 December 1919 – April 1920).&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/print.php?id=104326 Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/53397.html Today.Az - Azerbaijan marks Day of Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an [[Armenia]]n revolt that had just broken out in [[Karabakh]], the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 of the total 30,000 soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.&lt;ref&gt;
Hugh Pope, &quot;Sons of the conquerors: the rise of the Turkic world&quot;, New York: The Overlook Press, 2006, p. 116, ISBN 1-58567-804-X&lt;/ref&gt; The national Army of Azerbaijan was abolished by the Bolshevik government, 15 of the 21 army generals were executed by the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Azeri army parade.jpg|thumb|250px|Parade of the army of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1919 to the victory in [[Battle of Baku]]]]

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union. Much of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] was supplied by Baku. By a decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was recognised with orders and medals.
[[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the German [[Wehrmacht]] targeted [[Baku]] because of the importance of its oil fields to the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Swietochowski, Tadeusz(1995) ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 800,000 Azerbaijanis fought within the ranks of the Soviet Army of which 400,000 died. Azeri national formations of the [[Red Army]] included the 223rd, 227th, 396th, 402nd, and 416th Rifle Divisions. Azeri Major-General [[Hazi Aslanov]] was awarded twice Hero of the Soviet Union.

===Dissolution of the Soviet armed forces===
During the Cold War, Azerbaijan had been the deployment area of units of the Soviet [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]] whose principle formations included three motor rifle divisions (23rd, 60th, and 296th).  The 4th Army also included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. The 75th Motor Rifle Division, part of the [[7th Guards Army]], was isolated in [[Nakhichevan]]. The 75th Division's stores and equipment were apparently transferred to the Nakhichevan authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See reference at [[7th Guards Army]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan also hosted the 49th Arsenal of the Soviet [[Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation|Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery]], which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units.

The first president of Azerbaijan, [[Ayaz Mutallibov]], did not wish to build an independent army, wanting to rely instead largely on Soviet troops. Even when the Parliament decided that an army should be formed in September 1991, disagreements between the government and the opposition [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]] impeded creation of a unified force.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group, Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Management and Reform Crisis Group Europe Briefing N°50, 29 October 2008, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the first unit of the new army was formed on the basis of the 18-110 military unit of [[mechanized infantry]] of the [[Soviet Ground Forces]] (probably part of the [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]]) located in [[Shikhov]], south of Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://dejure.az/index.php/cra-hakimiyyti/70-nazirliklr/99-azrbaycan-respublikas-muedafi-nazirliyi | title= Azərbaycan Respublikası Müdafiə Nazirliyi. 1991-dən sonra | trans_title= Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan Republic. Events after 1991 |accessdate=2010-07-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the parliamentary decision, Lieutenant-General [[Valeh Barshadli]] became the first [[Minister of Defense (Azerbaijan)|Minister of Defense of Azerbaijan]], from September 5 to December 11, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-qanun.az/print.php?internal=view&amp;target=1&amp;docid=6648&amp;doctype=0 |title=Azərbaycan Respublikası Müdafiə Nazirliyinin yaradılması haqqında AZƏRBAYCAN RESPUBLİKASI PREZİDENTİNİN FƏRMANI |trans_title=Order of President of Azerbaijan Republic on establishment of Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan Republic |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later from May to September 4, 1992 he served as [[Chief of General Staff of Azerbaijani Armed Forces]].

In summer 1992, the nascent Defense Ministry received a resolution by the Azerbaijani president on the privatization of units and formations in Azerbaijani territory. It then forwarded an ultimatum to Moscow demanding control over vehicles and armaments of the 135th and 139th Motor Rifle Regiments of the 295th Motor Rifle Division.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/4-2002/dp/hscwa/?form=print How South Caucasus was armed], Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (Moscow, Russia)&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1992, Azerbaijan ratified the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE), which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment. Azerbaijan approved the CFE flank agreement in May 1997.

The transfer of the property of the 4th Army (except for part of the property of the 366th Motor Rifle Regiment of the [[8th Cavalry Corps (Soviet Union)#Postwar|23rd Motor Rifle Division]] captured by Armenian armed formations in 1992 during the regiment's withdrawal from Stepanakert) and the 49th arsenal was completed in 1992. Thus, by the end of 1992, Azerbaijan received arms and military hardware sufficient for approximately four motor rifle divisions with prescribed army units. It also inherited naval ships. There are also reports that 50 combat aircraft from the disbanded [[Baku Air Defence Army|19th Army]] of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] came under Azeri control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
[[File:Mahir and Allahverdi.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani officers during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]]]
After Lt Gen Barshadli became Chief of General Staff, [[Minister_of_Defense_(Azerbaijan)#Ministers_of_Defense_of_Azerbaijan_Republic|subsequent defense ministers from 1992]] have included:

* Maj.-Gen. [[Tajeddin Mehdiyev]] (December 1991 - January 1992)
* Colonel [[Shahin Musayev]] (January–February 1992)
* Interior Troops Colonel [[Tahir Aliyev]] (February–March 1992)
* [[Rahim Gaziyev]] (March 1992-February 1993)
* Maj.-Gen. [[Dadash Rzayev]] (February–June 1993)
* Colonel [[Safar Abiyev]] (June–August 1993)
* Maj.-Gen. [[Vahid Musayev]] (August–September 1993)
* Maj. Gen. [[Mammadrafi Mammadov]] (September 1993 - February 1995)
* Col.-Gen. [[Safar Abiyev]] (since 1995)

The Azeri armed forces took a series of devastating defeats by Armenian forces&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm 1993 UN Security Council Resolutions on Nagorno-Karabakh]&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1992–1994 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which resulted in the loss of control of Nagorno-Karabakh proper and seven surrounding [[rayon]]s, comprising roughly 16%&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html CIA World Factbook. Azerbaijan. 2008:&quot;''Azerbaijan has lost 16% of its territory and must support some 600,000 internally displaced persons as a result of the conflict.''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; of the territory of [[Azerbaijan]]. Azerbaijani sources insist that Armenian victory was largely due to military help from [[Russia]] and the wealthy [[Armenian diaspora]]. Armenians partially deny the allegation, claiming that Russian side was equally supplying Armenian and Azerbaijani sides with weapons and mercenaries. During the war, the Azeri armed forces were also aided by Turkish military advisers, and Russian, Ukrainian, Chechen and Afghan mercenaries.

==Land forces==
[[File:RSZO Smertch.jpg|right|thumb|Azerbaijan has a dozen 300mm salvo rocket systems 9A52 “Smerch” with a range of 70-{{convert|90|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}.]]
The [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]] number 85,000 strong, according to UK [[Advanced Research and Assessment Group]] estimates.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt; The 2,500 men of the National Guard are also part of the ground forces. In addition, there are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS157&quot;/&gt; Other paramilitary agencies consist of Interior Ministry [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], 12,000 strong, and the land component of the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], 5,000 strong.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;

Azerbaijan has signed numerous contracts to strengthen its armed forces and to train its military with Turkey's assistance. Over the last 15 years, Azerbaijan has been preparing its military for possible action against Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan may attempt to retake Karabakh and the surrounding regions by force.

===Organization===
[[File:Azerbaijan Army 2007 OrBat.png|thumb|[[Azerbaijani Army]] Order of Battle]]
The Land Forces consist of five army corps:&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;
*1st Army Corps also known as Evlax Army Corps (concentrated near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]])
*2nd Army Corps also known as Pirekeshkul Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories and part is deployed on the [[Azerbaijan]]-[[Iran]]ian border)
*3rd Army Corps also known as Shamkir Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories)
*4th Army Corps also known as Baku Army Corps (covers [[Absheron]] and the coast)
*5th Army Corps also known as Nakhchivan Army Corps (deployed in [[Nakhichevan]])

The Land Forces include 23 motor rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, a multiple rocket launcher brigade, and an anti-tank regiment.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt; The IISS Military Balance reported in 2007 that the Land Forces had an estimated 40 SA-13 Gopher, SA-4 Ganef, and SA-8 Gecko air defence missile systems, with '80-240 eff.' to support the army in the battlefield. (IISS 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;157)

The [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan]] are mostly supplied from the Land Forces, though the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]] do also supply some. As of March 2011, 94 peacekeepers were deployed with the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isaf.nato.int/images/stories/File/Placemats/PLACEMAT.MARCH%2004..pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, it also actively supported the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo and Iraq.

The Azeri [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan|peacekeeping unit]] deployed in Iraq consisted of 14 officers, 16 sergeants and 120 privates, a total of 150 troops. The unit secured the [[hydroelectric power station]] and reservoir in [[Haditha, Iraq|Al Haditha]] from August 2003. In December 2008, Azerbaijan withdrew the unit from Iraq.

==Air forces==
[[File:Soviet MiG-29 DF-ST-99-04977.JPG|thumb|Azerbaijan purchased [[MiG-29]]s from [[Ukraine]] in 2006.]]
The [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]] is a single unified service branch.&lt;ref name=JSSA-MT&gt;Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments - Russia and the CIS: Air Force, dated 18 June 2009, and {{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |month= |title=World Defence Almanac  |journal=Military Technology |volume= XXXII |issue= 1 |pages=244–245|publisher=Monch Publishing Group |location=Bonn, Germany |issn=0722-3226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 8,000 men serve in the air force and air defence force.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;

The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has around 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters.&lt;ref name=IISS158 /&gt; The country has four major airbases. [[Nasosnaya Air Base]] has fighters, [[Kyurdamir Air Base]] a bomber regiment, [[Ganja Air Base]] transports, and [[Baku Kala Air Base]] the helicopter unit. There are also four other airbases which do not appear to have aircraft based there. These are [[Dollyar Air Base]], [[Nakhichevan Airport]], [[Sanqacal]] Air Base, and [[Sitalcay]] Air Base.

The Azeri Air Force uses [[MiG-21]], [[MiG-23]], [[Su-24]] and [[Su-25]] aircraft, as well as the [[MiG-29]] purchased from [[Ukraine]] in 2006 and [[Il-76]] transport aircraft. The MiG-29 have been designated as the standard aircraft for the AzAF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/38475.html Azerbaijan shows 4th generation MiG-29 multirole fighter jets.]&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan is holding talks with  either [[China]] or [[Pakistan]] to purchase [[JF-17]] Thunder aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.am/en/news/8954.html China supplies FC-1 multipurpose fighters to Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MiG-25]]s previously in service have been retired seemingly in the 2007-09 period.

Azerbaijan's helicopter force is concentrated at [[Baku Kala Air Base]] and according to the IISS consists of a single regiment with around 14-15 Mi-24, 12-13 Mi-8 and 7 Mi-2. [[Jane's Information Group]] and the IISS give figures which agree with only a single aircraft's difference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/sng/azerb/azerb.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, end of 2010 Russian Rosvertol announced that Azerbaijan armed forces signed a deal for 24 pieces of Mi-35M (Hind-E) gunships what would further enhance the Azeri ground attack formations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Azerbaijan-Orders-24-Mi-35M-Helicopter-Gunships-06789/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helihub.com/2011/02/25/azerbaijan-buys-24-mi-35m-attack-helicopters/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Force has [[Aero L-29 Delfín|L-29]] and [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] advanced training aircraft in store. The [[Azerbaijan Border Guard]] and Voluntary Society of Defense, Patriotism and Sport have [[Yakovlev]] light training aircraft.

Azerbaijan has missile and radar systems intended to defend Azeri airspace. About 100 NATO designated [[SA-2]] Guideline (original name S-75), [[SA-3 Goa]] (S-125 Pechora-2M), and the [[S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|SA-5 Gammon]] (S-200) are in static installations.&lt;ref&gt;[[IISS]] Military Balance 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;158&lt;/ref&gt; These may be around Baku and the central part to cover the whole Azeri aerospace. Russia has agreed to sell systems for 2 divisions of [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]]PMU2 to Azerbaijan worth $300 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;azers300&quot;&gt;[http://www.historyoftruth.com/news/latest/7654-russian-defense-ministry-confirms-readiness-to-sell-s-300-to-azerbaijan Russian Defense Ministry Confirms Readiness to Sell S-300 to Azerbaijan.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also in Azerbaijan there is a former Soviet early warning radar. The [[Qabala Radar]] is a bistatic phased-array installation, currently operated by the [[Russian Space Forces]] under a contract until 2012. The contract was signed in 2002 and will expire in 2012 where it would be given back to the Azerbaijani government. The contract costs Russia $7 million per year. The radar station has a range of up to 6,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres (3,728&amp;nbsp;mi), and was designed to detect [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] launches as far as from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Whether the Russian Government shares any of the station's radar data with Azerbaijan is unknown.

===Training and education===
Azerbaijani pilots are trained in the Azerbaijan Air Force School and then developing their skills in operational units. Azerbaijan has an experience exchange with Turkey, Ukraine, the United States and a number of NATO countries. The Turkish Air Force School has a great role in the training of Azeri military pilots. Azerbaijani pilots are also trained in Ukraine’s Pilot Training School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=97127 Azerbaijan’s military aviation opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navy==
The [[Azerbaijan Navy]] has about 2,200 personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane's Fighting Ships]], 2010, accessed February 2010. IISS 2007 attributes 2,000 personnel&lt;/ref&gt; The navy has a Petya class light frigate, ''Qusar'' (G 121), and a number of [[patrol craft]], including one Turk class, ''Araz,'' P 223, one Brya (Project 722) class, P 218, one Shelon (Project 1388M) class, P 212, one Poluchat class (Project 368), P 219, one Luga class (Project 888), T 710, and four Petrushka (Polish UK-3 class), P 213, P 214, P 215, and P 216. There are four [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s consisting of 2 [[Sonya class minesweeper]] and 2 [[Yevgenya class minesweeper]]s. (Jane's Fighting Ships 2010)

The Navy is also attributed with 5 [[landing craft]], 3 Polnochny and 2 Vydra,(IISS 2007) plus three research ships, 1 Project 10470, A 671, ex Svyaga, 1 Balerian Uryvayev class survey vessel (AG) and one Vadim Popov class survey vessel (AG).

The U.S. Navy has helped train the Azeri Navy. There is also an agreement to provide US support to refurbish Azeri warships in the [[Caspian Sea]]. In 2006, the US Government donated 3 motorboats to the Azerbaijani navy. In 2007 an agreement between Azeri Navy and a US military company was concluded, which stated that a part of the Azeri Navy would be equipped with advanced laser marksmanship systems. The US company specialists were also to give training on the use of the new equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/40483.html Azeri Navy to be equipped with marksmanship system lasers]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of separate U.S. programmes are underway under the [[Caspian Guard Initiative]], focused mostly on enhancing Azerbaijani and Kazakh maritime border security.

In May 2011, President of the [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic]] [[Rovnag Abdullayev]] stated that Azerbaijan to start production of national warships after 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan to produce warships|url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=146812|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan to produce ships|url=http://www.news.az/articles/economy/33686|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

===Special forces===
[[File:Azspecialforce.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani Special Forces during military parade in 2008]]
The Azerbaijani Navy maintains the 641st Special Warfare Naval Unit. There is also unconfirmed reports of a 'Tigers' special warfare unit. It is said that the 'Tigers' unit was established in cooperation with the [[Turkish Navy]] in 2001. The training and structure of the Tigers are similar to Turkish special forces, [[Su Altı Taarruz]] and [[United States]] Special Forces who have close training relationships with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yandunts.blogspot.com/2007/04/us-foreign-aid-turkeys-akhtamar-ploy.html U.S. foreign aid, Turkey's Akhtamar ploy, looking for intelligence in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; The first Tiger units were established at [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] following a joint training program with Turkey.

The US has also participated in joint naval exercises with the Azeri Navy’s 641st Special Warfare Naval Unit, headquartered at the Azeri Naval Station outside Baku.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=CHO20070409&amp;articleId=5322 US trains and modernizes Azerbaijani Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan]] directs domestic military supplies for Azerbaijan. It was established in 2005. The Defence Industries Ministry subsumed the State Department for Military Industry and for Armaments and the Military Science Center, each of which was formerly a separate agency within the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry.

The defense industry has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/02/2b0bdd2d-49a6-4bff-826d-05edefe4dbdb.html Azerbaijan Defense Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other contracts, Azerbaijani defence industries and Turkish companies, Azerbaijan will produce 40mm revolver grenade launchers, 107mm and 122mm MLRS systems, Cobra 4x4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR vehicles in Baku.&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership1&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.az/articles/politics/26065 Azerbaijan, Turkey to produce revolver grenade launchers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership2&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136785 Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defense Industry plans to assume several projects on technical modernization of Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership3&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.az/articles/politics/25988 Azerbaijan, Turkey sign contract on joint rocket production]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership4&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136603 Azerbaijani Defense Industry Ministry conducts negotiations with Turkish “Otokar” Company on production of armored vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In December 2009, an agreement on military assistance was signed by Turkey and Azerbaijan. The agreement envisions [[Ankara]]’s supplying Azerbaijan with weapons, military equipment and, if necessary, soldiers in case war with Armenia over Karabakh resumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=17085 Azeri lawmakers hail Turkey military aid accord]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkey]] has supported the Azerbaijani military by providing training to Azerbaijani military personnel and delivering military equipment and armaments. Due to help from Turkish specialists and instructors, thousands of Azerbaijani officers have been trained to western standards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Turkey has provided Azerbaijan with infantry weapons, tactical vehicles (jeeps, trucks, etc.) professional training, military organization, technology transfer, licenced military hardware production and other services.&lt;ref&gt;[[NATO]], [http://www.nato.int/KFOR/chronicle/2002/chronicle_10/01.htm Azerbaijani troops part of the KFOR family]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Section 907]] of the United States [[Freedom Support Act]] bans any kind of direct United States [[aid]] to the Azerbaijani government. Despite this law there is extensive U.S. military cooperation with Azerbaijan. This has included Special Forces and naval aid, consultations with [[United States European Command]], and linkages through the U.S. National Guard [[State Partnership Program]].

On 19 May 2006, Azerbaijani Defense Minister [[Safar Abiyev]] and the then commander of [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] General [[Tom Hobbins]] met in [[Baku]] to discuss military cooperation. He said the objective of his visit was to become familiar with the state of Azerbaijani armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azernews.net/eng/gizli/view.php?d=14940 NATO &amp; Azerbaijan relations]&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbins pointed to the progress made in the NATO-Azerbaijan relations, saying that the successful implementation of the NATO [[Partnership for Peace]] program in Azerbaijan has brought the country even closer to the alliance. He said that the two countries' air forces will expand cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.az/news/politics/26307.html U.S. &amp; Azerbaijani Air Force cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. state of [[Oklahoma]] is linked with Azerbaijan through the [[U.S. National Guard]] [[State Partnership Program]] (SPP)). [[Oklahoma National Guard]] troops have been sent on training and humanitarian missions to Baku.

===Israel===
Azerbaijan and [[Israel]] cooperate on numerous areas of the defense industry. Azerbaijan has shown great interest in Israeli technology over the years. In particular, an agreement was reached over the construction of the factory of intelligence and combat drones in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;panarmenian.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537 Israel rearms Azerbaijani army] on [[PanARMENIAN.Net]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenianreporter.am/go/article/2009-07-03-israel-azerbaijan-to-step-up-military-cooperation Washington briefing : Israel, Azerbaijan to step up military cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2009, Israel and Azerbaijan had been negotiating on the production of [[Namer (vehicle)|Namer]] armoured [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Panarmenian.net [http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537 panarmenian &gt; Israel rearms Azerbaijani army], 30 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There is no further information as to whether any agreement has been made.

===NATO===
[[File:Azerbaijani soldiers in Iraq 11.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijan deployed 150 peacekeepers during the [[Iraq War]]]]
The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and Azerbaijan actively cooperate on defence institutional reforms and have developed practical cooperation in many other areas. Azerbaijan’s [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) and its [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) linkages lay out the programme of cooperation between Azerbaijan and NATO.

The Azerbaijani government has however delayed implementing IPAP-recommended reforms, however, in part at least because no decision has been taken to seek NATO membership. This is because Azerbaijan's foreign policy 'seeks to balance interests with the U.S., EU, Russia and Iran.'&lt;ref&gt;[[International Crisis Group]], Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Reform and Management, Europe Briefing No.50, Baku/Tblisi/Brussels, 29 October 2008, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a NATO diplomatic source some key officials at NATO headquarters in [[Brussel]]s were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. &quot;[[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Baltic states]],&quot; are among the member-states also backing a fast track for Azerbaijan’s NATO membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav060409.shtml EurasiaNet.org - Eurasia insight - Azerbaijan: Baku can leapfrog over Ukraine, Georgia for NATO membership]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 5 June 2006 the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] held a training program for about 100 representatives of the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations of Azerbaijan Republic]], [[Republican Prosecutor's Office]], [[Azerbaijan Defense Ministry|Defense Ministry]] and other law-enforcement bodies. The objective of the training was to enhance Azerbaijan's ability to prevent the spread of weapon of mass destruction and related materials. According to a U.S. Embassy official, the program was organized as part of U.S. efforts to help Azerbaijan implement its NATO IPAP, specifically to strengthen Azerbaijan's ability to control its land and sea borders: &quot;This training is being implemented within the frame of International struggle against spread of weapons of mass destruction. It is a good case that Azerbaijan is our active partner in struggle against spread of weapons of mass destruction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.az/news/society/27013.html Partnership for Peace training] and [http://today.az/news/politics/27639.html Military doctrine to be adopted]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a limited amount of military cooperation with the other countries of [[GUAM]]: [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], Azerbaijan, and [[Moldova]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perspektivy.info/rus/konturi/vojennoje_sotrudnichestvo_mezhdu_postsovetskimi_gosudarstvami_2008-09-25.htm Военное сотрудничество между постсоветскими государствами] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Satellite image of Armenia in May 2003.jpg|right|300px|Map of Armenia]]

[[Armenia]] is a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region, between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s, bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. 

The terrain is mostly mountainous and flat, with fast flowing rivers and few forests but with many trees. The climate is highland continental: hot summers and cold winters. The land rises to 4,095 m above sea-level at [[Mount Aragats]].

Pollution from toxic chemicals such as [[DDT]] is not helping the already poor soil quality in many parts of the country.

Armenia is trying to address its environmental problems. It has established a Ministry of Nature Protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal, whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities. Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, a group of 12 former Soviet republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues. The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as soon as alternative energy sources are identified.

==Physical environment==
[[Image:Armenia 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Detailed map of Armenia]] 
Armenia is located in southern Transcaucasia, the region southwest of [[Russia]] between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Modern Armenia term means under [[Republic of Armenia]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) Republic]] and occupies part of historical Armenia, whose ancient centers were in the valley of the [[Araks River]] and the region around [[Lake Van]] in Turkey. Armenia is bordered on the north by Georgia, on the east by [[Azerbaijan]], on the southwest by the [[Nakhchivan|Nakhchivan Republic of Azerbaijan]], on the south by Iran, and on the west by Turkey.

==Topography and drainage==
[[Image:Armenia Topography.png|thumb|left|Topography of Armenia]]
Twenty-five million years ago, a geological upheaval pushed up the Earth's crust to form the Armenian Plateau, creating the complex topography of modern Armenia. The Lesser Caucasus range extends through northern Armenia, runs southeast between [[Lake Sevan]] and Azerbaijan, then passes roughly along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border to Iran. Thus situated, the mountains make travel from north to south difficult. Geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes, which have plagued Armenia. In December 1988, the second largest city in the republic, Leninakan (now [[Gyumri]]), was heavily damaged by a massive quake that killed more than 25,000 people.

About half of Armenia's area of approximately {{convert|29,800|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}} has an elevation of at least {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, and only 3 % of the country lies below {{convert|650|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The lowest points are in the valleys of the Araks River and the Debet River in the far north, which have elevations of {{convert|380|and|430|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, respectively. Elevations in the Lesser Caucasus vary between {{convert|2640|and|3280|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. To the southwest of the range is the Armenian Plateau, which slopes southwestward toward the Araks River on the Turkish border. The plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes. The largest of these, [[Mount Aragats]], {{convert|4430|m|ft|0|sp=us}} high, is also the highest point in Armenia. Most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country, where the two major cities, [[Yerevan]] and Gyumri (which was called Aleksandropol' during the tsarist period), are located.

The valleys of the Debet and Akstafa rivers form the chief routes into Armenia from the north as they pass through the mountains. Lake Sevan, {{convert|72.5|km|mi|0|sp=us}} across at its widest point and {{convert|376|km|mi|1|sp=us}} long, is by far the largest lake. It lies {{convert|2070|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level on the plateau. Terrain is most rugged in the extreme southeast, which is drained by the Bargushat River, and most moderate in the Araks River valley to the extreme southwest. Most of Armenia is drained by the [[Araks]] or its tributary, the [[Hrazdan]], which flows from Lake Sevan. The Araks forms most of Armenia's border with Turkey and Iran while the [[Zangezur Mountains]] form the border between Armenia's southern province of [[Syunik]] and Azerbaijan's adjacent Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.
[[Image:Armenian terrain.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Armenian terrain]]

==Climate==
{{See also|Armenia#Climate|l1=Climate of Armenia}}

Temperatures in Armenia generally depend upon elevation. Mountain formations block the moderating climatic influences of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, creating wide seasonal variations. On the Armenian Plateau, the mean midwinter temperature is {{convert|0|°C|°F}}, and the mean midsummer temperature exceeds {{convert|25|°C|°F}}. Average precipitation ranges from {{convert|250|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year in the lower Araks River valley to {{convert|800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} at the highest altitudes. Despite the harshness of winter in most parts, the fertility of the plateau's volcanic soil made Armenia one of the world's earliest sites of agricultural activity.

==Environmental Problems==

A broad public discussion of environmental problems began in the mid-1980s, when the first &quot;green&quot; groups formed in opposition to Yerevan's intense industrial air pollution and to nuclear power generation in the wake of the 1986 reactor explosion at Chernobyl'. Environmental issues helped form the basis of the nationalist independence movement when environmental demonstrations subsequently merged with those for other political causes in the late 1980s.

In the postcommunist era, Armenia faces the same massive environmental cleanup that confronts the other former Soviet republics as they emerge from the centralized planning system's disastrous approach to resource management. By 1980 the infrequency of sightings of Mount Ararat, which looms about sixty kilometers across the Turkish border, became a symbol of worsening air pollution in Yerevan.

In independent Armenia, environmental issues divide society (and scientists) sharply into those who fear &quot;environmental time bombs&quot; and those who view resumption of pollution-prone industrial operations as the only means of improving the country's economy. In the early 1990s, the latter group blamed Armenia's economic woes on the role played by the former in closing major industries.

In 1994 three national environmental laws were in effect: the Law on Environmental Protection, the Basic Law on the Environment, and the Law on Mineral Resources. The Council of Ministers, Armenia's cabinet, includes a minister of the environment. However, no comprehensive environmental protection program has emerged, and decisions on environmental policy have been made on an ad hoc basis.

Environmental conditions in Armenia have been worsened by the Azerbaijani blockade of supplies and electricity from outside. Under blockade conditions, the winters of 1991-92, 1992–93, and 1993-94 brought enormous hardship to a population lacking heat and electric power. (The large-scale felling of trees for fuel during the winters of the blockade has created another environmental crisis.) The results of the blockade and the failure of diplomatic efforts to lift it led the government to propose reconstruction of the Armenian Atomic Power Station at Metsamor, which was closed after the 1988 earthquake because of its location in an earthquake-prone area and which had the same safety problems as reactors listed as dangerous in Bulgaria, Russia, and Slovakia. After heated debates over startup continued through 1993, French and Russian nuclear consultants declared operating conditions basically safe. Continuation of the blockade into 1994 gave added urgency to the decision.

Another environmental concern is a significant drop in Lake Sevan's water level because of drawdowns for irrigation and the diversion of water to hydroelectric plants to compensate for the electric power lost through the inactivity of the nuclear plant at Metsamor. This crisis was addressed in 1992-93 by construction of a tunnel to divert water into the lake from the Arpa River. Engineers estimated that once the project is finished, the tunnel will allow 500 million cubic meters of water to be drawn from the lake annually, while maintaining a constant water level. The Ministry of the Environment reported that the lake's water level had dropped by fifty centimeters in 1993. Experts said that this drop brought the level to within twenty-seven centimeters of the critical point where flora and fauna would be endangered.

Among major industrial centers closed to curtail pollution were the Nairit Chemical Plant, the Alaverdy Metallurgical Plant, and the Vanadzor Chemical Combine. Economic requirements triumphed over environmental considerations when the Soviet-era Nairit plant was reopened in January 1992 after being closed in 1989 because of the massive air pollution it caused. Newly independent Armenia needed the income from foreign sales of Nairit rubber and chemical products, many of which had been assigned exclusively to that plant under the Soviet system and were still unavailable elsewhere to the former Soviet republics in the early 1990s. Up-to-date environmental safety technology and adherence to international standards were promised at Nairit when the decision to resume production was announced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Demographics of Armenia''' is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Armenia]], including population growth, [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population.

==Demographics trends==
After registering a steady increase all through the Soviet period, the [[Censuses of Armenia|population of Armenia]] declined from 3.604 million in 1991 to 3.211 million in 2003. The latest estimate is 3.251 million on January 1, 2010.

[[Armenia]] is the only republic of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] that has a nearly-homogeneous population.  It is also the second-most densely populated post-Soviet state after [[Moldova]].  Ethnic minorities include [[Russians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Yazidi]] [[Kurds]], [[Iranians]], [[Greeks]], [[Georgians]], and [[Belarusians]].  There are also smaller communities of [[Vlachs]], [[Mordvin people|Mordvins]], [[Ossetians]], [[Udi people|Udis]], and [[Tats]]. Minorites of [[Poles]] and [[Caucasus Germans]] also exist though they are heavily [[Russification|Russified]].&lt;ref name=&quot;minorities&quot;&gt;Garnik Asatryan and Victoria Arakelova, ''[http://www.osce.org/documents/oy/2002/01/148_en.pdf The Ethnic Minorities of Armenia]'', Routledge, part of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Armenians are Christian, primarily of [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] rite. Armenia is considered the first nation to adopt Christianity, which was first preached in Armenia by two Apostles of [[Jesus]], [[St. Bartholomew]] and [[St. Thaddeus]] in the 1st century.  The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] can  trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries.  The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church, a form of Oriental ([[Non-Chalcedonianism]]) Orthodoxy, which is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Catholics]] and evangelical Protestants.

There has been a problem of population decline due to elevated levels of [[emigration]] after the break-up of the [[USSR]]. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have decreased drastically in the recent years, and a moderate influx of Armenians returning to Armenia have been the main reasons for the trend, which is expected to continue. In fact Armenia is expected to resume its positive population growth by 2010. According to Birthright Armenia website, a census done in 2004 shows Armenia's population to be 2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birthrightarmenia.org/pages.php?al=emigration Emigration Issues in Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politics of Armenia''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the President is the [[head of government]], and of a platform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament.
==Politics since the dissolution of the Soviet Union==
The population of [[Armenia]] voted overwhelmingly for independence in a September 1991 referendum, followed by a presidential election in October 1991 that gave 83% of the vote to [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]]. Ter-Petrossian had been elected head of government in 1990, when the [[National Democratic Union of Armenia|National Democratic Union party]] defeated the Armenian Communist Party. Ter-Petrossian was re-elected in 1996. Following public demonstrations against Ter-Petrossian's policies on [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]], the President resigned in January 1998 and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]], who was elected President in March 1998. Following the [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting|assassination in Parliament]] of Prime Minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]] and parliament Speaker [[Karen Demirchyan]] and six other officials, on 27 October 1999, a period of political instability ensued during which an opposition headed by elements of the former Armenian National Movement government attempted unsuccessfully to force Kocharyan to resign. Kocharyan was successful in riding out the unrest. In May 2000, [[Andranik Margaryan]] replaced [[Aram Sargsyan]] as Prime Minister.

Kocharyan's re-election as president in 2003 was followed by widespread allegations of ballot-rigging. He went on to propose controversial constitutional amendments on the role of parliament. These were rejected in a referendum the following May at the same time as parliamentary elections which left Kocharyan's party in a very powerful position in parliament. There were mounting calls for the President's resignation in early 2004 with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.

The unicameral parliament (also called the [[National Assembly of Armenia|National Assembly]]) is dominated by a coalition, called &quot;Unity&quot; (Miasnutyun), between the [[Republican Party of Armenia|Republican]] and [[People's Party of Armenia|Peoples]] Parties and the Agro-Technical Peoples Union, aided by numerous independents. [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaksutyun]], which was outlawed by Ter-Petrosian in 1995-96 but legalized again after Ter-Petrosian resigned, also usually supports the government. A new party, the [[Republic (Armenia)|Republic Party]], is headed by ex-Prime Minister [[Aram Sargsyan]], brother of [[Vazgen Sargsyan]], and has become the primary voice of the opposition, which also includes the [[Armenian Communist Party]], the [[National Unity (Armenia)|National Unity party]] of [[Artashes Geghamyan]], and elements of the former Ter-Petrossian government.

The Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style [[parliamentary democracy]] as the basis of its [[form of government]]. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum since 1995, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the [[Electoral Commission (Armenia)|Electoral Commission]], and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. For the most part however, Armenia is considered one of the more pro-democratic nations in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].  Observers noted, though, that opposition parties and candidates have been able to mount credible campaigns and proper polling procedures have been generally followed. Elections since 1998 have represented an improvement in terms of both fairness and efficiency, although they are still considered to have fallen short of international standards. The new constitution of 1995 greatly expanded the powers of the executive branch and gives it much more influence over the judiciary and municipal officials.

The observance of [[human rights]] in Armenia is uneven and is marked by shortcomings. [[Police brutality]] allegedly still goes largely unreported, while observers note that defendants are often beaten to extract confessions and are denied visits from relatives and lawyers. Public demonstrations usually take place without government interference, though one rally in November 2000 by an opposition party was followed by the arrest and imprisonment for a month of its organizer. Freedom of religion is not always protected under existing law. Nontraditional churches, especially the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], have been subjected to harassment, sometimes violently. All churches apart from the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] must register with the government, and proselytizing was forbidden by law, though since 1997 the government has pursued more moderate policies. The government's policy toward conscientious objection is in transition, as part of Armenia's accession to the Council of Europe. Most of Armenia's ethnic [[Azeri]] population was deported in 1988-1989 and remain refugees, largely in Azerbaijan. Armenia's record on discrimination toward the few remaining [[national minorities]] is generally good. The government does not restrict internal or international travel. Although freedom of the press and speech are guaranteed, the government maintains its monopoly over [[television]] and [[radio]] broadcasting.

==Government==
Armenia became independent from the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]] on 28 May 1918 as the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] (DRA).  After the DRA collapsed on 2 December 1920, it was absorbed into the [[Soviet Union]] and became part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]].  The TSFSR dissolved in 1936 and Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union known as the [[Armenian SSR]]. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, beginning on 23 September 1991 the official name of the nation has been the Republic of Armenia (Armenian: Hayastani Hanrapetut'yun). The data code for the country is AM.

The capital and largest city is  [[Yerevan]]. In addition to the Yerevan administrative region, Armenia is split into ten administrative divisions, known as ''marzer'' (singular: ''marz''); these are [[Ararat (province)|Ararat]],  [[Aragatsotn Province|Aragatsotn]], [[Armavir (province)|Armavir]], [[Gegharkunik Province|Gegharkunik]], [[Kotayk Province|Kotayk]], [[Lori (province)|Lori]], [[Shirak Province|Shirak]], [[Syunik]], [[Tavush]], and [[Vayots Dzor]].

The flag of Armenia consists of three equal horizontal bands of red (top), blue, and orange.

==Legislative branch==
[[File:Armenian parliament building.jpg|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Armenia]] in Yerevan]]
The [[Azgayin Zhoghov]] (or ''[[National Assembly]]'') is the [[legislative branch]] of the government of [[Armenia]].  It is a [[unicameral]] body of 131 members, elected for four-year terms: 56 members in single-seat constituencies and 75 by proportional representation. The proportional-representation seats in the National Assembly are assigned on a party-list basis amongst those parties that receive at least 5% of the total of the number of the votes.
The [[unicameral parliament]] is controlled by a coalition of three political parties: the conservative Republican party [http://www.hhk.am], the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], and the [[Country of Law]] party. The main opposition is composed of several smaller parties joined in the [[Justice (Armenia)|Justice Bloc]].

{{Armenian parliamentary election, 2007}}

The first [[primary election]] in Armenia was held by the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] in November 2007 to select the presidential candidate. Some 300.000 people voted.&lt;ref name=&quot;A1 Plus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.a1plus.am/en/?page=issue&amp;iid=55090| title=A1 Plus, ARFD Nominates Vahan Hovhannisyan|accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Horizon Armenian Weekly'', English Supplement, 2007 3 December, page E1, &quot;ARF conducts 'Primaries' &quot;, a Yerkir agency report from Yerevan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption==
{{Main|Corruption in Armenia}}

[[Political corruption]] is a widespread and growing problem in Armenian society. In 2008, [[Transparency International]] reduced its [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] for Armenia from 3.0 in 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;TI-GCP-2008-p225&quot;&gt;''[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/32778/502137 Global Corruption Report 2008]'', [[Transparency International]], Chapter 7.4, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; to 2.9 out of 10 (a lower score means more perceived corruption); Armenia slipped from 99th place in 2007 to 109th out of 180 countries surveyed (on a par with [[Argentina]], [[Belize]], [[Moldova]], [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Vanuatu]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;2008-CPI-Table&quot;&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table ''2008 CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX''], Transparency International, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite legislative revisions in relation to elections and party financing, corruption either persists or has re-emerged in new forms.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/32774/502121 Global Corruption Report 2008]'', Transparency International, Chapter 7, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] in Armenia views corruption in Armenia as &quot;a serious challenge to its development.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.am/?page=Speeches&amp;id=9 &quot;Strengthening Cooperation between the National Assembly, Civil Society and the Media in the Fight Against Corruption&quot;], Speech by Ms. Consuelo Vidal, (UN RC / UNDP RR), April 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armenia]] is the second most densely populated of the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. It is situated between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].

Until independence, '''Armenia's economy'' was based largely on [[industry]]—[[Chemical substance|chemicals]], [[electronics|electronic products]], [[machinery]], [[processed food]], [[synthetic rubber]] and [[textiles]]; it was highly dependent on outside resources. [[Agriculture]] accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Armenian mines produce [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[gold]] and [[lead]]. The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant) from Russia; the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.

Like other former States, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake|1988 earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. In 1992-93, GDP fell nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the [[Armenian dram|dram]], suffered [[hyperinflation]] for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.

Nevertheless, the [[Government of Armenia]], helped by the cease-fire that has been in effect in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] since 1994, has been able to carry out wideranging economic reforms which paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors such as agriculture in the economy.

This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The IMF, [[World Bank]], EBRD, as well as other IFIs and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed [[USD|$]]800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the [[earthquake zone]].

Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improve the investment climate, and accelerate the privatization process. A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a Law on Privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization. The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization. By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at [[Metsamor]]. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was [[privatized]] in 2002. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct [[investment]]. Economic ties with [[Russia]] remain close, especially in the energy sector. The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in 2005, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement. Investment in the [[construction]] and [[industry|industrial]] sectors is expected to continue in 2006 and will help to ensure annual average real [[GDP]] growth of about 13.9%.

==Overview==
Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its [[mineral]] deposits ([[gold]], [[bauxite]]) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed [[economic system]] of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment.

==History of the modern Armenian economy==
[[Armenia]] emerged from the [[umbra]] of the former [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 and migrated from a [[centrally planned economy]] ([[Communist]] system) to a [[market economy]] ([[capitalism|capitalist]] system). Both the [[nation]] and the [[economy]] are [[Nascent market|nascent]]. Regional conflict retards [[economic growth]]. In addition, the border with [[Turkey]] is closed, making access to sea ports difficult and [[transportation]] [[logistics]] challenging to a country largely dependent upon imports. In 2003, Armenia became a member of the [[WTO]] ([[World Trade Organization]]). The nation is making substantial progress in privatizing ownership of what used to be State Owned [[industries]] under the former Soviet system. Despite marked progress, Armenia still suffers from a large trade imballance and is still largely dependent upon foreign aid and remittances from Armenian nationals working abroad, and members of the [[diaspora]] donating aid through [[NGO]]s (non-governmental organizations) such as the church. There are some foreign capital inflows, but no robust foreign investment. Despite progress since the Soviet era, the unemployment rate still hovers near 30% and there remains a huge gulf between actual and potential [[Gross Domestic Product]].

==Global competitiveness==
The Armenian economy's competitiveness is low and stagnating according to the [[Global Competitiveness Index]], in which Armenia's ranking slipped from 80th out of 132 countries in 2006-2007 index to 93rd out of 131 countries in the 2007-2008 index (just below [[Libya]], [[Namibia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Pakistan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/Global_Competitiveness_Reports/Reports/gcr_2007/gcr2007_rankings.pdf &quot;2007-2008 Global Competitiveness Index rankings and 2006–2007 comparisons&quot;], World Economic Forum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia's economy is highly anticompetitive with government-connected individuals enjoying de facto monopolies over the import and distribution of basic commodities and foodstuffs, and under-reporting revenue to avoid paying taxes.

Despite pronouncements at the highest levels of government on the importance of free competition, Armenia is next to last in the effectiveness of its anti-monopoly policy according to the 2010 results of the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;&gt;{{Armenia in 2010. A Year of Uncertainty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vahram Nercissiantz]], [[Serzh Sargsyan|President Sarkisian]]'s chief economic adviser, &quot;Businessmen holding state positions have turned into oligarchs who have avoided paying sufficient taxes by abusing their state positions, distorted markets with unequal conditions, breached the rules of competition, impeded or prevented small and medium-sized business’ entry into manufacturing and thereby sharply deepened social polarization in the republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb26-Media&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/press/press/en/2009/02/7A8B57C4-E9C7-46EB-8DFD-FC6288D165EF.asp ''Press Review''], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the advice of economic advisors who cautioned Armenia's leadership against the consolidation of economic power in the hands of a few, in January 2001, the Government of Armenia established the [http://www.competition.am/?lng=2 State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition]. Its members cannot be dismissed by the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Jan-4-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=2724 ''Competitive Edge: The pitfalls of monopolies, and the challenges of a business-influenced parliament''], ArmeniaNow.com, January 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monopolies===
According to one analyst, Armenia's economic system is [[anticompetitive]] due to the structure of the economy being a type of &quot;[[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]].&quot; &quot;The result is the prices with us do not drop even if they do on international market, or they do quite belated and not to the size of the international market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Nov-14-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=3382&amp;CID=3245&amp;IID=1209&amp;lng=eng ''Price Predictions: With present inflation at nearly triple expectation, economists challenge 2009 forecast''], ArmeniaNow.com, November 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the estimate of a former [[Prime Minister of Armenia|prime minister]], [[Hrant Bagratian]], 55 percent of Armenia's [[GDP]] is controlled by 44 families.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Jan-4-2008&quot;/&gt;

In early 2008, the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition named 60 companies having &quot;dominant positions&quot; in Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Jan-4-2008&quot;/&gt;

In October 2009, when visiting [[Yerevan]], the [[World Bank|World Bank’s]] managing director, [[Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala]], warned that Armenia will not reach a higher level of development unless its leadership changes the &quot;oligopolistic&quot; structure of the national economy, bolsters the rule of law and shows &quot;zero tolerance&quot; towards corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct-10-2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/content/article/1855547.html Armenia Warned To End ‘Oligopoly’], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]])October 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I think you can only go so far with this economic model,&quot; Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told a news conference in Yerevan. &quot;Armenia is a lower middle-income country. If it wants to become a high-income or upper middle-income country, it can not do so with this kind of economic structure. That is clear.&quot; She also called for a sweeping [[reform]] of tax and customs administration, the creation of a &quot;strong and independent judicial system&quot; as well as a tough fight against government corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct-10-2009&quot;/&gt; The warning was echoed by the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/content/article/1889521.html &quot;Armenia Learning From Crisis, Says World Bank &quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), November 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==GDP==
The [[Gross Domestic Product]] of Armenia stood at 8.8 billion [[US dollars]] in 2010; with a population of 3.2 million, this amounts to a [[GDP per capita]] of $2,676 ([[purchasing power parity]] $5,178).&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;  GDP growth for 2010 was at 2.9 percent, and inflation was at 8 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

GDP growth is expected to be around 3 percent in 2011, with inflation returning to 4-5 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

In comparison, in 2006, the GDP was estimated to be 6.6 billion USD  per calendar year and the GDP per capita  (purchasing power parity) was estimated at $5,400 US. The [[Economic growth|growth rate]] was high at 13.4%, but the relatively low base must be considered. Low [[inflation]] was maintained around 2.6% annually.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth===
After a decade of double-digit growth, Armenia's economy declined by 14.4 percent in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;  The year-to-date growth as of October 2010 was 2.8 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; In 2010, the main macro deficiencies of the Armenian economy — namely, unsustainable growth drivers, a narrow and resource-dominated export base, and overdependence on private transfers — were still prevalent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; 

According to official figures, Armenia’s economy grew by 13.8 percent in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;EurasiaNet-Apr24-08&quot;&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav042408.shtml &quot;ARMENIA: GAS PRICE HIKE POSES CHALLENGE FOR GOVERNMENT&quot;], EurasiaNet, April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to research funded by the [[USAID]] CAPS project, Armenia's exceptionally high rate of economic growth during the last decade has been largely dependent on external factors (e.g. remittances, assistance from international financial and donor organization). Furthermore, the study concluded that despite its record growth on most macro-economic metrics, Armenia is &quot;low and lagging&quot; in competitiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatCompReportOfAM-2008&quot;&gt;[http://ev.am/ACR.htm &quot;2008 National Competitiveness Report of Armenia&quot;], Economy and Values Research Center, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Statistical Service]], the booming construction and service sectors remain the driving forces of the high growth rate of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Sept-20-2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2007/09/ac00c04d-a570-479a-8d0c-9554e4acb7b6.asp &quot;Armenian Growth Still In Double Digits&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), September 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cash remittances===
Cash [[remittances]] sent back home from Armenians working abroad—mostly in Russia and the United States—are growing and contribute significantly to Armenia's Gross Domestic Product (between 15 to 30 percent). They help Armenia sustain double-digit economic growth and finance its massive trade deficit.

According to the [[Central Bank of Armenia]], during the first half of 2008, cash remittances sent back to Armenia by Armenians working abroad rose by 57.5 percent and totaled $668.6 million USD, equivalent to 15 percent of the country's first-half Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug5-08&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/08/4CC57703-F346-4E3C-8CA4-CD1E571BEC5A.ASP &quot;Cash Transfers To Armenia Jump To New High&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the latter figures only represent cash remittances processed through Armenian commercial banks. According to [[RFE/RL]], comparable sums are believed to be transferred through non-bank systems, implying that cash remittances make up approximately 30 percent of Armenia's GDP in the first half of 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug5-08&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, cash remittances through bank transfers rose by 37 percent to a record-high level of $1.32 billion USD.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug5-08&quot;/&gt; According to the Central Bank of Armenia, in 2005, cash remittances from Armenians working abroad reached a record-high level of $1 billion, which is worth more than one fifth of the country’s 2005 Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/02/70759614-25c5-449b-8ed9-91ac340adc17.asp &quot;Survey Highlights Armenia’s Lingering Unemployment&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Net private transfers decreased in 2009, but saw a continuous increase during the first six months of 2010. Since private transfers from the Diaspora tend to be mostly injected into consumption of imports and not in high value-added sectors, the transfers have not resulted in sizeable increases in productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Construction sector===
Armenia experienced a construction boom during the latter part of the 2000s.  According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's booming construction sector generated about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP during the first eight months of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Sept-20-2007&quot;/&gt; According to a World Bank official, 30 percent of Armenia's economy in 2009 came from the construction sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot;/&gt;

However, during the January to September 2010 period, the sector experienced a 5.2 percent year-on-year decrease, which according to the [[Civilitas Foundation]] is an indication of the unsustainability of a sector based on an elite market, with few products for the median or low budgets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Retail trade===
In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;  The existing monopolies throughout the retail sector have made the sector non-responsive to the crisis and resulted in near zero growth. The aftermath of the crisis has started to shift the structure in the retail sector in favor of food products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Services sector===
In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the [[services sector]] was the driving force behind Armenia's recent high economic growth rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Sept-20-2007&quot;/&gt;  In 2010, the volume of services increased as much as 7.4 percent from January to September, over the same period in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

====Tourism====
{{main|Tourism in Armenia}}
According to official data, in 2007, a record-high 500,000 [[tourists]] visited Armenia — most of them ethnic Armenians from Europe, Russia and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct17-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/148592E2-A277-4CEC-B421-918B4342679C.ASP &quot;Armenia To Cut Visa Fees In Bid To Boost Tourism&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 saw a noticeable increase in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Armenia – estimated to be 80,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

However, according to private tour operators and other individuals familiar with the country’s tourism industry, government claims that hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Armenia each year are wide of the mark.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-2010-June-04&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title= Armenian Tourism Figures Questioned |url=http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2062487.html | publisher=RFE/RL |date=2010-06-04| accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Official statistics show that as many 575,000 tourists visited Armenia from abroad in 2009; the government stated earlier in 2010 that the figure will surpass 620,000 in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-2010-June-04&quot;/&gt;  However, data from the National Statistical Service shows that there were only 65,000  foreigners staying in Armenian hotels in 2009.  Ara Vartanian, the chairman of the Armenian Trade and Industry Chamber, thinks that this measure is a far more objective indicator of the tourist influx into the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-2010-June-04&quot;/&gt;

===Industrial sector===
Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; According to the National Statistical Service, during the January–August 2007 period, Armenia's [[industrial sector]] was the single largest contributor to the country's GDP, but remained largely stagnant with industrial output increasing only by 1.7 percent per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Sept-20-2007&quot;/&gt; In 2005, Armenia's industrial output (including electricity) made up about 30 percent of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Feb-10-2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/02/7a425352-3ed4-4b17-a352-e11d38026faa.asp &quot;Government Downplays Economic Cost Of Russian Gas Price Hike&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
{{main|Mining in Armenia}}
40 percent of Armenia's exports in 2009 were [[mining]] exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot;/&gt;

===Agricultural sector===
{{main|Agriculture in Armenia}}
As of 2010, the [[agricultural sector|agricultural production]] comprises on average 25 percent of Armenia's GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug-8-2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/08/218f6eeb-de6f-47e4-970e-dba7583d7d39.asp &quot;Kocharian Orders Tax Exemption For Armenian Farmers&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
Armenia's agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of January–September 2010.  This was owing to bad weather, a lack of a government stimulus package, and the continuing effects of decreased agricultural subsidies by the Armenian government (per [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] requirements).&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

==Foreign aid==
===United States===
The [[Armenian government]] receives [[foreign aid]] from the government of the [[United States]] through the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the[[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].

On March 27, 2006, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] signed a five-year, $235.65 million compact with the Government of Armenia. The single stated goal of the &quot;Armenian Compact&quot; is &quot;the reduction of rural poverty through a sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector.&quot; The Compact includes a $67 million to rehabilitate up to 943 kilometers of rural roads, more than a third of Armenia's proposed &quot;Lifeline road network&quot;. The Compact also includes a $146 million project to increase the productivity of approximately 250,000 farm households through improved water supply, higher yields, higher-value crops, and a more competitive agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC-AM-FactSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.mcc.gov/documents/factsheet-032706-armenia.pdf &quot;Armenia and Millennium Challenge Corporation: Building a Dynamic Partnership for Poverty Reduction through Economic Growth&quot;], Millennium Challenge Corporation, March 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the volume of US assistance to Armenia remained near 2009 levels; however, longer-term decline continued. The original Millennium Challenge Account commitment for $235 million had been reduced to about $175 million due to Armenia’s poor governance record. Thus, the MCC would not complete road construction. Instead, the irrigated agriculture project was headed for completion with apparently no prospects for extension beyond 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===European Union===
With curtailment of the MCC funding, the European Union may replace the US as Armenia’s chief source of foreign aid for the first time since independence. From 2011 to 2013, the European Union is expected to advance at least €157.3 million ($208 million) in aid to Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

==External trade==
===Exports ===
In 2010, Armenia’s exports remained resource-dependent, largely because the non-resource-intensive sectors were significantly less competitive. Armenia has not succeeded in increasing and diversifying exports beyond raw materials thus leaving room for a greater vulnerability to external shocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; There was a 43.9 percent increase in overall exports during the January to September period. The main three export destinations were Bulgaria with 15.2 percent of total exports, followed by Germany with 14.2 percent and Russia with 13.9 percent. Raw minerals were the main export sent to Bulgaria and Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Imports ===
The global economic crisis has had less impact on imports because the sector is more diversified than exports. In the first nine months of 2010, imports grew about 19 percent, just about equal to the decline of the same sector in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Deficit===
During the first half of 2008, Armenia's widening current-account [[trade deficit]] grew by 66 percent to $1.39 billion USD, with a 40 percent rise in imports. Furthermore, Armenian exports fell by about one percent to $520 million USD.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug5-08&quot;/&gt;

According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's trade deficit in 2006 was $1.2 billion with growth in exports being largely flat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Mar-30-2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2007/03/43d15c73-f5fe-49e8-a4ce-2d4234f33cf6.asp &quot;Armenia Keeps Up Robust Growth&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), March 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first 11 months of 2006, net imports grew by 21 percent to $1.95 billion, while exports stood at $895 million, up 0.3 percent from the same period in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Jan-8-2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2007/01/4b0b1a8a-57d2-4bfe-80a7-fe750c1c3ce9.asp &quot;Armenia Posts Record-High Trade Deficit&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partners===
====European Union====
In 2010, EU countries accounted for 32.1 percent of Armenia’s foreign trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; Germany is Armenia’s largest trading partner among EU member states, accounting for 7.2 percent of trade; this is due largely to mining exports. Armenian exports to EU countries have skyrocketed by 65.9 percent, making up more than half of all 2010 January to September exports. Imports from EU countries increased by 17.1 percent, constituting 22.5 percent of all imports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with the [[European Union]] totaled $200 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Mar-30-2007&quot;/&gt; During the first 11 months of 2006, the European Union remained Armenia's largest trading partner, accounting for 34.4 percent of its $2.85 billion commercial exchange during the 11-month period.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Jan-8-2007&quot;/&gt;

====Russia and former Soviet republics====
Bilateral trade with Russia stood at more than $700 million for the first nine months of 2010 – on track to rebound to $1 billion mark first reached in 2008 prior to the global economic crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with [[Russia]] and other [[former Soviet republics]] was $205.6 million (double the amount from the same period the previous year), making them the country’s number one trading partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Mar-30-2007&quot;/&gt; During the first 11 months of 2006, the volume of Armenia’s trade with Russia was $376.8 million or 13.2 percent of the total commercial exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Jan-8-2007&quot;/&gt;

====China====
As of early 2011, trade with China is dominated by imports of Chinese goods and accounts for about 10 percent of Armenia's foreign trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-17-2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2312784.html ''Chinese FM Visits Armenia, Urges Closer Ties''], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The volume of Chinese-Armenian trade soared by 55 percent to $390 million in January–November 2010. Armenian exports to China, though still modest in absolute terms, nearly doubled in that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-17-2011&quot;/&gt;

====Iran====
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Iran was $200 million - which is approximately equal to the trade between Armenia and Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;  The number of Iranian tourists has risen in recent years, with an estimated 80,000 Iranian tourists in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

====Turkey====
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Turkey was about $200 million, with trade taking place without open borders, across Georgian territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;  This figure is not expected to increase significantly so long as the land border between the Armenia and Turkey remains closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

====United States====
From January–September 2010, bilateral trade with the United States measured approximately $150 million, on track for about a 30 percent increase over 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; An increase in Armenia’s exports to the US in 2009 and 2010 has been due to shipments of aluminum foil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

During the first 11 months of 2006, [[U.S.]]-Armenian trade totaled $152.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Jan-8-2007&quot;/&gt;

====Georgia====
The volume of Georgian-Armenian trade remains modest in both relative and absolute terms. According to official Armenian statistics, it rose by 11 percent to $91.6 million in January–November 2010. The figure was equivalent to just over 2 percent of Armenia’s overall foreign trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-16-2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2311549.html ''Armenia, Georgia Agree On Joint Border Control''], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign debt==
Armenia's national debt has increased significantly since 2008 when public external debt consisted of only 13.5 percent of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;   By the end of 2010, Armenia’s external debt is projected to form about 42 percent of GDP, and 50 percent in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

As of late November 2009, the Armenian government's [[foreign debt]] was around $3 billion USD, having doubled in size over the course of the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot;/&gt; With the Armenian government needing more anti-crisis loans from the World Bank and other foreign donors, the [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] is expected to exceed 40 percent in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot;/&gt; According to a World Bank official, a country that has around 12 percent rate of growth or even lower, at the range of 7 to 8 percent, can afford a level of [[public debt]] of up to 50 percent. The official warned that the debt servicing payments of the Armenian government will surge by 2013 and absorb &quot;quite significant part of tax revenues.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot;/&gt;

According to another estimate, the ratio between the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the state's foreign debt has reached 46 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmNow-Nov-27-2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/news/19375/change_needed_in_distribution_of_fo Change Needed in Distribution of Foreign Credits: Union chair says economic indexes &quot;disturbing&quot;], ArmeniaNow.com, November 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Economists generally agree that a country is [[insolvency|insolvent]], if its foreign debt surpasses 50 percent of its GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmNow-Nov-27-2009&quot;/&gt; Critics of the government say that the $500 million credit from Russia should have gone to develop industry, instead of going to the construction sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmNow-Nov-27-2009&quot;/&gt;

==Transportation routes and Energy lines==
===Internal===
Since early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/6B68C3F8-5DCC-4B9B-81E5-C638FEDE172D.ASP &quot;Armenia ‘Pressing Ahead’ With Iran Rail Link&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]], October 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Aug13-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/08/F3509195-D04E-4187-AA45-23B61ACF430F.asp &quot;Armenia Scrambles To Restore Vital Supplies Via Georgia&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Through Georgia===
Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.

The only operational rail link into Armenia is from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through [[Abkhazia]] along the [[Black Sea]]. However, the rail link between Abkhazia and Georgia proper has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot;/&gt;

The Georgian Black Sea ports of [[Batumi]] and [[Poti]] process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia. The Georgian railway, which runs through the town of Gori in central Georgia, is the main transport link between Armenia and the aforementioned Georgian seaports. Fuel, wheat and other basic commodities are transported to Armenia by rail.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Aug13-2008&quot;/&gt;

Armenia's main rail and road border-crossing with Georgia (at {{coord|41|13|41.97|N|44|50|9.12|E|type:landmark_region:AM|display=inline}}) is along the [[Debed river]] near the Armenian town of [[Bagratashen]] and the Georgian town of [[Sadakhlo]].

The Upper Lars border crossing (at [[Darial Gorge]]) between Georgia and Russia across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] served as Armenia's sole overland route to the former Soviet Union and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Dec24-2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/content/article/1913022.html &quot;Russia, Georgia Agree To Reopen Border Gate&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), December 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was controversially shut down by the Russian authorities in June 2006, at the height of a Russian-Georgian spy scandal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Dec24-2009&quot;/&gt; Upper Lars is the only land border crossing that does not go through Georgia's Russian-backed breakaway regions of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]]. The other two roads linking Georgia and Russia run through South Ossetia and Abkhazia, effectively barring them to international traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Dec24-2009&quot;/&gt; This crossing is expected to reopen starting on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Dec24-2009&quot;/&gt;

===Through Turkey and Azerbaijan===
An economic blockade with [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]] has cut Armenia's [[Kars Gyumri Akhalkalaki railway line|rail link between Gyumri and Kars]] to Turkey; the rail link with Iran through the Azeri exclave of Nakhichevan; and a natural gas and oil pipeline line with Azerbaijan. Also non-functioning are roads with Turkey and Azerbaijan. Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.

In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Through Iran===
A [[Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline|new gas pipeline to Iran]] has been completed, and a road to Iran through the southern city of [[Meghri]] allows trade with that country.  An oil pipeline to pump Iranian oil products is also in the planning stages.

As of October 2008, the Armenian government is considering implementing an ambitious project to build a railway to Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot;/&gt; The 400 kilometer railway would pass through Armenia's mountainous southern province of [[Syunik]] which borders Iran. Economic analysts say that the project would cost at least $1 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of Armenia's 2008 state budget).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot;/&gt;  As of 2010, the project has been continuously delayed, with the rail link estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and stretch 313&amp;nbsp;km (200 miles).&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;  In June 2010, Transport Minister Manuk Vartanian revealed that Yerevan is seeking as much as $1 billion in loans from China to finance the railway’s construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-17-2011&quot;/&gt;

==Labor==
[[File:2006 Labor Force by Occupation.png|thumb|250px|Armenia labor force by occupation (2006 est.)]]

===Monthly wages===
According to the state-owned [[Armenpress]] news agency, the average monthly [[wage]] in Armenia for the first half of 2007 was 70,700 [[Armenian dram|dram]]s (about $210 USD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/archive/105751.html &quot;Average Wage In Armenia Rises To $210&quot;], [[ARMENPRESS]], August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 24, 2008, the average monthly [[salary]] is 75,000 drams (about $242 US dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;EurasiaNet-Apr24-08&quot;/&gt; According to the ROA National Statistical Service, the average monthly salary during January - June 2008 is 86,850 drams (about $287 at the time). About 62% of officially registered wage earners earn at least the average monthly wage, while only 19.6% receive a monthly salary of over 100,000 drams (about $330 at the time).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hetq.am/eng/economy/8244/ &quot;Mortgage Loans Beyond the Reach of the Middle Class&quot;], Hetq Online, July 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unemployment===
According to research commissioned by the Yerevan office of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], at least one in three working-age Armenians was [[unemployed]] as of February 2005 despite several consecutive years of double-digit economic growth. The finding sharply contrasts with government's official unemployment rate of about 10 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;/&gt; A 2003 household survey conducted by the National Statistical Survey found that the real unemployment rate is about 33 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;/&gt;

===Migrant workers===
Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenia's residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work. Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration. OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005. According to estimates by the National Statistical Survey, the rate of labor emigration was twice as higher in 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;/&gt;

According to an [[OSCE]] survey, a typical Armenian [[migrant worker]] is a married man aged between 41 and 50 years who &quot;began looking for work abroad at the age of 32-33.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;/&gt;

In 2010, the value of the Armenian Dram (AMD) was artificially kept high during the height of the global economic crisis. Had the AMD been allowed to depreciate to its market level, exports would have become more competitive and the purchasing power of the majority of the population who are dependent on remittances from abroad would have increased. Instead, the value of the AMD was kept high, out of a fear of inflation and concern about alienating the powerful government-connected importers of oil, sugar, flour, cigarettes and beverages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

The AMD/USD exchange rate depreciated by 6.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, before it began to show the expected end-of-the-year appreciation. In comparison between the January to October periods of 2010 and 2009, depreciation stands at 4.7 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

==Government revenue and taxation==
The Armenian government collected 383.5 billion drams ($1.26 billion) in various taxes in the first nine months of 2008 (a 33.2 percent increase from the same period last year).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008-Tax&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/A7925A64-775F-40AF-99A4-8B22C65C89C8.ASP &quot;Government Keeps Up Strong Growth In Tax Revenues&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), October 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
     
Many large companies have a privileged status when it comes to taxation.  Big business is not taxed in proportion to its capacity and output, and the disproportionate burden falls on small and medium size businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===New VAT tax===
Over half of the tax revenues in the January–August 2008 time period were generated from value-added taxes ([[VAT tax]]). By comparison, corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008-Tax&quot;/&gt; This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008-Tax&quot;/&gt;

===Tax evasion===
Many Armenian companies, especially those owned by government-connected tycoons, have long reported suspiciously low earnings, thereby avoiding paying larger taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008-Tax&quot;/&gt;

==Environmental issues==
Armenia is trying to address its environmental problems. It has established a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal, with the resulting revenues used for environmental protection activities. Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a group of 12 former Soviet republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues. The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as soon as alternate energy sources can be identified.

==Energy==
{{main|Energy in Armenia}}

==Banking==
Armenia's financial system is not integrated into the global network. According to the head of the Armenian Central Bank’s (CBA) department for financial system policies and analyses (Vahe Vardanyan) Armenian banks have no large asset concentrations in foreign markets, particularly in capital markets. They nearly have no purchased securities (so-called securitized packages). For this reason, Armenia was virtually unaffected by the [[Liquidity crisis of September 2008]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Oct3-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=3280&amp;CID=3168&amp;IID=1203&amp;lng=eng &quot;Untouched and Out of Touch: Armenia not affected by US crisis due to relative insignificance&quot;], ArmeniaNow, October 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenian banking assets are very low and make up only 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Oct3-2008&quot;/&gt;

==Takeover of Armenian industrial property by the Russian state and Russian companies==
In implementing its strategy to regain political dominance over post-Soviet countries by taking over their economic infrastructure, the Russian state, since 2000, has acquired several key assets in the energy sector and Soviet-era industrial plants. Property-for-debt or equity-for-debt swaps (acquiring ownership by simply writing off the Armenian government's debts to Russia) are usually the method of acquiring assets. The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official [[corruption in Armenia]] have allowed the success of this process.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;&gt;Socor, Vladimir. [http://www.iasps.org/strategic/socor12.htm &quot;Armenia's Energy Sector, Other Industrial Assets Passing Under Russia's Control&quot;], ''IASPS Policy Briefings: Oil in Geostrategic Perspective'', November 13, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the [[Armenian Electricity Network]] (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;/&gt;

In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenia’s largest cement factory to the Russian [[ITERA]] gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;&gt;Danielyan, Emil. [http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/business/articles/eav050703.shtml RUSSIA TIGHTENS GRIP ON ARMENIA WITH DEBT AGREEMENTS], ''Eurasianet'', May 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia. The document was signed for Russia by Prime Minister [[Mikhail Kasyanov]] and Industry Minister [[Ilya Klebanov]], while Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]] and defense and security strongman [[Serge Sarkisian]] signed for Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;/&gt; The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are:
* Armenia's largest thermal power plant which is in the town of [[Hrazdan]] and is gas-burning
* the Mars electronics and robotics plant in Yerevan, a Soviet-era flagship for both civilian and military production
* three research-and-production enterprises—for mathematical machines, for the study of materials, and for automated control equipment—these being Soviet-era military-industrial plants

In January 2003, the Armenian government and [[United Company RUSAL]] signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian government's remaining 26% share of [[RUSAL ARMENAL]] aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusal.ru/en/armenal.aspx RUSAL ARMENAL]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company [[Gazprom]] and increased Gazprom's stake in the Russian-Armenian company [[ArmRosGazprom]] from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;EURA-Nov-3-06&quot;&gt;Socor, Vladimir. [http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2371612 &quot;RUSSIA CEMENTS CONTROL OF ARMENIA’S ENERGY SYSTEM&quot;], ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'', November 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This left the Armenian government with a 32% stake in ArmRosGazprom. The transaction will also help finance ArmRosGazprom's acquisition of the [[Hrazdan electricity generating plant]]’s fifth power bloc (Hrazdan-5), the leading unit in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;EURA-Nov-3-06&quot;/&gt;

In October 2008 the Russian bank [[Gazprombank]], the banking arm of Gazprom, acquired 100 percent of Armenian bank [[Areximbank]] after previously buying 80 percent of said bank in November 2007 and 94.15 percent in July of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.armenews.com/article.php3?id_article=44934 Gazprombank acquiert entièrement la banque arménienne Areximbank]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over non-transparent deals===
Critics of the Kocharian government say that the Armenian administration never considered alternative ways of settling the Russian debts. According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector – abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;/&gt;

Political observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government’s work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and now President) [[Serge Sarkisian]], Kocharian’s closest political associate. Other top government officials, including Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]], had little say on the issue. Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after Sarkisian’s frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;/&gt;

Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multimillion-dollar debts to Russia over the past decade, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia. For example, pro-Western [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;/&gt;

[[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]
}}
The '''Armed Forces of the Republic of [[Armenia]]''' comprise two services: the [[Armenian Army|Army]], and the [[Armenian Air Force|Air Force and Air Defense]] (a unified branch).&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook 2010, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt; It was partially formed out of the former [[Soviet Army]] forces stationed in the [[Armenian SSR]] (mostly units of the [[7th Guards Army]] of the [[Transcaucasian Military District]]).  Being a [[landlocked country]], Armenia has no [[navy]].

The [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the military is the [[President of Armenia]], currently [[Serzh Sargsyan]]. The Ministry of Defense is in charge of political leadership, currently headed by [[Seyran Ohanian]], while military command remains in the hands of the [[General Staff]], headed by the Chief of Staff, who is currently [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Yuri Khatchaturov]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mil.am/eng/index.php?page=7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Armenia]] established a Ministry of Defense on January 28, 1992. Border guards subject to the Ministry patrol Armenia's borders with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], while [[Russia]]n troops continue to monitor its borders with [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/102-military-base.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1992, Armenia has been a member of the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]], which acts as another deterrent to Azeri military intervention over Nagorno-Karabakh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/csto.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] was ratified by the Armenian parliament in July 1992. The treaty establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of military equipment, such as tanks, artillery, armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft, and combat helicopters, and provides for the destruction of weaponry in excess of those limits. [[Armenia]]n officials have consistently expressed determination to comply with its provisions and thus Armenia has provided data on armaments as required under the CFE Treaty. Despite this, Azerbaijan accuses Armenia of diverting a large part of its military forces to [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and thus circumventing these international regulations. Armenia is not a significant exporter of conventional weapons, but it has provided support, including material, to the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] of Nagorno-Karabakh during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].

==Overview==
[[File:MovingtoLachin.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Armenian forces during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]]]]
In March 1993, Armenia signed the multilateral [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which calls for the eventual elimination of chemical weapons. Armenia acceded to the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-[[nuclear weapon]]s state in July 1993. The [[U.S.]] and other Western governments have discussed efforts to establish effective nuclear export control systems with Armenia and expressed satisfaction with Armenia's full cooperation. In 2004 Armenia sent 46 non-combat troops to [[Iraq]], which included bomb-disposal experts, [[Physician|doctor]]s, and transport specialists.

==General Staff==
The Armenian Armed Forces are Headquartered in [[Yerevan]], where most of the general staff is based. Currently headed by Chief of Staff General Seyran Ohanian, the General Staff is responsible for operational command of the Armenian Military and its three major branches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mil.am/eng/index.php?page=6&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jane's]]'' reported in 2008 that the [[Armenian Army]] had 20 [[T-80]]s 100 [[T-72]]s and 80 [[T-54]]s in service.&lt;ref&gt;Jane's World Armies Armenia, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]]'s report of 2007, also in service were 80 [[BMP-1]]s, 20 BMP-1Ks, 30 [[BMP-2]]s, and 22 BRM-1K infantry fighting vehicles. Wheeled APCs reported included 25 [[BTR-60]]s, 100 look-a-like BTR, 21 [[BTR-70]]s, 50 [[BTR-80]]s, 145 [[MT-LB]]s, and a number of [[BRDM-2]] scout vehicles.&lt;ref name=IISS2007&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2007 |last=[[IISS]] |first=  |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge for the IISS |location=London|isbn=978-1-85743-437-8 |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eskiyaordusu2&quot;&gt;[http://www.iiss.org/publications/military-balance/ IISS The Military Balance 2010, page 172]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Russians have supplied newer replacement equipment to Armenia over the years, the numbers have never been sufficient to upgrade all ground force formations and many of the lower readiness units still have older, Soviet-legacy systems that have not been upgraded or in many cases effectively maintained. These older systems are placing great demands on the logistics system for service, maintenance, replacement parts and necessary upgrades, costing the army dearly both financially and in overall readiness.The ground force is currently engaged in an effort of reassessment reorganisation and restructuring, as the future of Armenia's defence needs a revised force structure and unit mix. Clearly, the army must maintain much of its traditional mechanised formations, but it also is looking to lighten and make more mobile and self-sustainable a small number of other formations. It must develop these newer formations to support its international requirements and effectively operate in mountainous and other rugged terrain, but it must do this without affecting the mechanised capability that is needed to confront Azerbaijan's conventional forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eskiyaordusu1&quot;&gt;[http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Armies/Armenia-Armenia.html Armenia (Armenia), Assessment Janes World armies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Armenia has followed a policy of developing its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. In 2000, [[Centre for International Studies and Research]] reported that the Armenian Army has the most combat capability of the three [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] countries' armies (the other two being [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fairbanks, [http://www.ceri-sciencespo.com/archive/nov00/Fairbanks.pdf Public and private armies in the Caucasus], [[Sciences Po]], November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CSTO]] Secretary, [[Nikolay Bordyuzha]], came to a similar conclusion after collective military drills in 2007 when he stated that, ''&quot;the Armenian Army is the most efficient one in the post-Soviet space&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/21078/&lt;/ref&gt;  This was echoed more recently by Igor Korotchenko, a member of the Public Council, [[Russian Ministry of Defense]], in a March 2011 interview with Voice of Russia radio.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.am/eng/news/49916.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia's military is presently reducing&lt;!--better to say 'since' when and name the pertinent 'presently' 'currently' year--&gt;, having had its budget recently reduced by 20 percent.&lt;ref name=CACI&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/spending.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Standing army|active forces]] now numbers 10,357 soldiers, including 30,634 conscripts (total 40,421)&lt;ref name=IISS2007 /&gt; On January 25, 2010, the Armenian Defense Minister [[Seyran Ohanyan]] said that 48% of students in Armenia avoid army service for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=42044 48% of Armenian students avoid army service ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army is functionally divided into ''Active'' and ''Reserve Forces''. Their main functions include deterrence, defense, [[peace]] support and [[crisis management]], humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Armenian society.

The Active Forces mainly have peacekeeping and defensive duties, and are further divided into Deployment Forces, Immediate Reaction, and Main Defense Forces. The Reserve Forces consists of Enhancement Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, and Training Grounds. They deal with planning and reservist preparation, armaments and equipment storage, training of formations for active forces rotation or increase in personnel.

During peacetime the Army maintains permanent [[combat]] and [[mobilization]] readiness. They become part of multinational military formations in compliance with [[international treaties]] Armenia is a signatory to, participate in the preparation of the population, the national economy and the maintenance of wartime reserves and the [[infrastructure]] of the country for defense.

In times of crisis the Army's main tasks relate to participation in operations countering [[terrorism|terrorist activities]] and defense of strategic facilities (such as [[nuclear power]] plants and major industrial facilities), assisting the security forces in proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]], illegal armaments traffic and international terrorism.

In case of low- and medium-intensity military conflict the Active Forces that are part of the Army participate in carrying out the initial tasks for the defense of the [[territorial integrity]] and [[sovereignty]] of the country. In case of a high intensity conflict the Land Forces, together with the Air Force, Air Defense and Border Guards, form the defense group of the Armenian Armed Forces aiming at countering aggression and protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country.

Experiments in developing small arms have been undertaken in Armenia, producing the [[K-3 (rifle)|K-3]] assault rifle, but Jane's Infantry Weapons estimates that the programme has ceased, and the rifle is not in widespread service with the army.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Infantry-Weapons/K-3-5-45&amp;nbsp;mm-assault-rifle-Armenia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air Force ==
[[Image:Hyeairforce.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Armenian Air Force]] [[Su-25]] attack aircraft fly in [[V formation]] over [[Yerevan]]'s Republican Square]]
[[Image:Roundel of Armenia.svg|25px]] The [[Armenian Air Force]] consists of 15 [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]] ground attack planes, one [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] jet fighter, 12 [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunships, four [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] trainer and attack aircraft, 16 [[Yakovlev Yak-52|Yak-52]] trainer aircraft, two [[Ilyushin Il-76|Il-76]] cargo planes, 13 [[Mil Mi-8]] transport helicopters, and nine [[Mil Mi-2]] light utiliy helicopters. 18 [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] fighter jets of the [[Russian 102nd Military Base]] at [[Gyumri]] also help defend Armenian airspace.

=== Air Defense ===

The Armenian Air Defense is the anti-aircraft branch of the Armed Forces of Armenia. It was equipped and organized as part of the military reform program of Ter-Grigoriants. It consists of an anti-aircraft missile brigade and two regiments armed with 100 anti-aircraft complexes of various models and modifications, including the [[SA-8]], [[M79 Osa]], [[Lyulev 9M8 Krug|Krug]], [[S-75 Dvina|S-75]], [[S-125]], and SA-7s. Russia has [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] long range surface-to-air missiles at the Russian 102nd Military Base. There are also 24 [[Scud]] [[ballistic missile]]s with eight launchers.
Numerical strength is estimated at about 3,000 servicemen, with plans for further expansion.

In late December 2010, the Armenian Defense Minister, Seyran Ohanyan, officially acknowledged that the army are equipped with the Russian-made [[S-300]] surface-to-air missiles.  The statement was made while the Minister was inspecting a new air-defense command point that maintains “state-of-the-art equipment&quot; built specifically for the operation of the S-300s.  Russian specialists had begun training their Armenian counter-parts in 2005 in the use of the sophisticated missile systems.   Speaking to [[Radio Free Europe]]'s Armenian service, Defense Ministry spokesman David Karapetyan confirmed that the Armenian army now has S-300s in its missile arsenal.  He declined to specify their number and dates of delivery.&lt;ref&gt;http://asbarez.com/90524/armenia-confirms-possession-of-sophisticated-missiles/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military of Karabakh ==
{{Main|Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army}}

In addition to forces mentioned above, there are 20,000 active soldiers defending [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a disputed territory which seceded from Azerbaijan in 1991 and is now a [[de-facto]] independent state. They are well trained and well equipped with the latest in military software and hardware.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Blandy, [http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/arag/document-listings/caucasus/08(17)CWB.pdf Azerbaijan: Is War Over Nagornyy Karabakh a Realistic Option?], [[Advanced Research and Assessment Group]], [[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]], Caucasus Series 08/17, 2008, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Karabakh army's heavy military hardware includes: 316 tanks, 324 armored vehicles, 322 artillery pieces of calibers over 122&amp;nbsp;mm, 44 multiple rocket launchers, and a new anti-aircraft defense system.&lt;ref&gt;DeRouen, Karl and Uk Heo (eds.) ''Civil Wars of the World: Major Conflicts since World War II''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2007, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the NKR Defence Army maintains a small air-force of 2 [[Su-25]]s, 5 [[Mi-24]]s and 5 other helicopters.

== International military cooperation ==
===Russia ===

The [[Russian 102nd Military Base]], the former 127th Motor Rifle Division, is stationed in Armenia.  The military alliance of the two nations and, in particular, the presence of Russian troops on Armenian soil has been a key element of Armenia's national security doctrine since Armenia gained independence in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;asbarez.com&quot;&gt;http://www.asbarez.com/2009/12/17/armenia-russia-sign-arms-export-deal-2/&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia is Armenia's closest ally. Russia stations an estimated 5,000 soldiers of all types in Armenia, including 3,000 officially reported to be based at the 102nd Military Base located in [[Gyumri]].  In 1997, the two countries signed a far-reaching friendship [[treaty]], which calls for mutual assistance in the event of a military threat to either party and allows [[Russian border guard]]s to patrol Armenia's frontiers with [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. In early 2005, the 102nd Military Base had 74 tanks, 17 battle infantry vehicles, 148 armored personnel carriers, 84 artillery pieces, 18 [[MiG-29]] fighters, one battery of [[SA-6]] and two batteries of [[SA-10 Grumble|S-300]] anti-aircraft missiles. However in 2005-2007, following an agreement on the withdrawal of two Russian military bases from Georgia, a great deal of military hardware was moved to the 102nd Base from the Russian [[12th Military Base]] in [[Batumi]] and the 62nd Military Base at [[Akhalkalaki]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Russia also supplies weapons at the relatively lower prices of the Russian domestic market as part of a collective security agreement since January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/12/51161.html| title=Russian supply|accessdate=2006-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to unconfirmed reports by the Azeri media, Russia has supplied $1 billion worth of arms and ammunitions to Armenia in 1996; and handed over an additional $800 million worth of arms to Armenia in 2008-2009.  According to AzerNews, the weapons in this latest transfer include 21 tanks, 12 armored vehicles, five other battle machines, a great number of rocket launchers, over 1,050 cases of grenades, nearly 7,900 types of ammunition, 120 grenade launchers, over 4,000 sub-machine guns, TNT fuses, mines of various types, 14 mine-launchers, 9 Grad launchers, five canons, and other weapons.&lt;ref&gt;AzerNews [http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=9867 Russia `donates` $800m arms to Armenia] 14-01-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] [[Military education and training|training]] is another sphere of Russian-Armenian military cooperation. In the first years of [[sovereignty]] when Armenia lacked a military educational establishment of its own, officers of its army were trained in [[Russia]]. Even now when Armenia has a military [[college]] on its own territory, the Armenian officer [[corps]] honors the tradition and is trained at Russian military educational establishments. Currently, 600 Armenian servicemen are being trained in Russia. In Armenia as of 1997, the training was conducted by the &quot;In the name of Marshal Bagramyan&quot; Training Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry Of Defence of The Republic Of Armenia, [http://www.mil.am/eng/?page=11 Official Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first meeting of the joint Russian-Armenian government panel for military-technical cooperation that took place during autumn 2005, Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]] reported that, Russian factories will participate in the Armenian program of military modernization, and that Russia is prepared to supply the necessary spare parts and equipment. [[Yerevan]] and [[Moscow]] have further plans to develop closer ties.

In step with this, Armenia and Russia agreed to work together in exporting weapons and other military equipment to third countries, which was signed by Defense Minister Seyran Ohanian and a visiting senior Russian official, Konstantin Biryulin, during a meeting of a Russian-Armenian inter-governmental commission on bilateral military-technical cooperation, in December 2009.  The agreement envisages the two countries' interaction in exporting military production to third countries, which will help to strengthen the armed forces of the two states, and further cement the already close Russian-Armenian military cooperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;asbarez.com&quot;/&gt;

A Russian-Armenian defense agreement signed in August 2010 extends Russia’s military presence in Armenia till 2044 and commits Russia to supplying Armenia with modern and compatible weaponry and special military hardware at reduced prices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armenialiberty.org/content/article/2200677.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2009, Azerbaijani media published allegations that Russia had made extensive weapons transfers to Armenia throughout 2008 costing about $800 million. On January 12, 2009, the Russian ambassador was invited to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Azerbaijan)|Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and asked about this information. On January 21, 2009, Russian ministry of foreign relations officially denied the transfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://day.az/news/politics/144560.html Day.az. МИД России опроверг информацию о поставках Армении российского оружия на $800 млн.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the materials published by [[WikiLeaks]] in December 2010, Azerbaijani defence minister [[Safar Abiyev]] claimed that in January 2009 during his visit to Moscow, his Russian counterpart [[Anatoly Serdyukov]] unofficially had admitted to weapons transfers &quot;after the second bottle of vodka&quot; that evening, although officially it was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/197735 The Guardian. Embassy cables: Truth about Putin and Medvedev – over a bottle of vodka]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective Security Treaty Organisation ===
On October 7, 2002, the Presidents of [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]] and [[Tajikistan]], signed a charter in [[Tashkent]], founding the [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation]] (CSTO) (Russian: Организация Договора о Коллективной Безопасности (ОДКБ~ODKB)) or simply Ташкентский договор (The [[Tashkent Treaty]]). [[Nikolai Bordyuzha]] was appointed secretary general of the new organisation.  On 23 June 2006, [[Uzbekistan]] became a full participant in the CSTO and its membership was formally ratified by its parliament on 28 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurasianhome.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the CSTO is  an observer organisation at the [[United Nations General Assembly observers|United Nations General Assembly]].

The charter reaffirmed the desire of all participating states to abstain from the use or threat of force. Signatories would not be able to join other military alliances or other groups of states, while aggression against one signatory would be perceived as an aggression against all. To this end, the CSTO holds yearly military command exercises for the CSTO nations to have an opportunity to improve inter-organisation cooperation. The largest-scale CSTO military exercise held, to date, were the &quot;Rubezh 2008&quot; exercises hosted in [[Armenia]] where a combined total of 4,000 troops from all 7 constituent CSTO member countries conducted operative, strategic, and tactical training with an emphasis towards furthering the efficiency of the collective security element of the CSTO partnership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pims.org/news/2008/08/06/rubezh-2008-the-first-large-scale-csto-military-exercise&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Defense of Armenia has repeatedly stated that it would expect direct military assistance from the CSTO in case war with Azerbaijan resumes, as recently as December 2009, Defense Minister Ohanyan made the same statement. According to the Armenian website Asbarez, in August, 2009, Nikolay Bordyuzha, the CSTO's secretary-general, confirmed that official [[Yerevan]] can count on such support.&lt;ref name=&quot;asbarez.com&quot;/&gt;

On February 4, 2009, an agreement to create the Collective Rapid Reaction Force (KSOR) was reached by five of the seven CSTO members, with plans finalized on June 14, 2009. Armenia is one of the five member states. The force is intended to be used to repulse military aggression, conduct [[anti-terrorist]] operations, fight [[transnational crime]] and [[drug trafficking]], and neutralize the effects of [[natural disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090204/119984654.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefastertimes.com/defensespending/2009/10/30/with-russian-prodding-csto-begins-taking-shape/ With Russian Prodding, CSTO Begins Taking Shape]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NATO ===
Armenia participates in [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] (PiP) program and it is in a NATO organization called [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC). Armenia is in the process of implementation of [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]]s (IPAPs), which is a program for those countries that have the political will and ability to deepen their relationship with NATO. Cooperative Best Effort exercise (the first where Russia was represented) was run on Armenian territory in 2003.

=== Greece ===
[[Greece]] is Armenia's closest ally in NATO and the two cooperate on multiple issues. A number of Armenian officers are trained in Greece every year, and military aid/material assistance has been provided to Armenia. In 2003, the two countries signed a military cooperation accord, under which Greece will increase the number of Armenian servicemen trained at the military and military-medical academies in Athens.

In February 2003, [[Armenia]] sent 34 peace keepers to [[Kosovo]] where they became part of the [[Greece|Greek]] contingent. Officials in [[Yerevan]] have said the Armenian military plans to substantially increase the size of its peace-keeping detachment and counts on Greek assistance to the effort. In June 2008, Armenia sent 72 peacekeepers to Kosovo for a total of 106 peacekeepers.

=== Baltic States ===
[[Lithuania]] has been sharing experience and providing consultations to the Armenian Defense Ministry in the field of democratic control of armed forces, military and defense concepts and public relations since 2002. Started in 2004, Armenian officers have been invited to study at the Lithuanian War Academy and the Baltic Defense College in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]].  Lithuania covers all study expenditures.  In early 2007, two Armenian officers for the first time took part in a Baltic lead international exercise, Amber Hope, which was held in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groong.usc.edu/news/msg211150.html Lithuanian Defense Minister Going To Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] has been steadily upping its military clout in the region. In early 2003, [[United States Department of Defense]] announced several major military programs in the [[Caucasus]]. [[Federal government of the United States|Washington's]] military aid to Armenia in 2005 amounted to $5 million, and in April 2004, the two sides signed a military-technical cooperation accord, which some American military analysts &lt;!--such as?--&gt; believe implies the use of Armenian airfields by the [[U.S. Air Force]] in the [[War on Terror]]. In late 2004, Armenia deployed a unit of 46 soldiers, which included a logistic, medical and support soldiers to Iraq in support of the American-led Coalition. And in 2005, the United States allocated $7 million to modernize the military communications of the Armenian Armed Forces.

== Peacekeeping operations ==
Currently Armenia is involved in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan. There are also debates within the government to send peacekeepers to [[Lebanon]] since there are a large number of Armenians living there.

=== Kosovo ===
[[Image:ArmenianPatrolKosovo.jpg|thumb|right|210px|An Armenian patrol maintaining a checkpoint in [[Kosovo]].]]
There are currently 70 Armenian soldiers serving in [[Kosovo]] as peacekeepers.

Armenia joined the [[Kosovo Force]] in [[Kosovo]] in 2004. Armenian &quot;blue helmets&quot; serve within the [[Greek Army]] battalion. The relevant memorandum was signed on September 3, 2003 in [[Yerevan]] and ratified by the Armenian Parliament on December 13, 2003. The sixth deployment of Armenian peacekeepers departed for Kosovo on November 14, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.serbianna.com/news/2006/02761.shtml|title=Armenia to deploy more soldiers to Kosovo|accessdate=2006-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Armenian National Assembly voted unanimously to double the peacekeeping force in Kosovo by sending an extra 34 peacekeepers to the region, increasing the total number of peacekeepers in the region to 68.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr-inside.com/armenia-to-double-its-peacekeepers-contingent-r604186.htm Armenia to double its peacekeepers' contingent in Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; Artur Aghabekian, chairman of the Armenian parliament's committee on defense and security, cited the need to double the forces to help Kosovo achieve full international recognition adding that that would set an important precedent for the full recognition of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/05/6C24AE91-DAA8-49EE-AF52-7EB24774AEA0.ASP Armenia To Send More Troops To Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
After the end of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], Armenia deployed a unit of 46 peacekeepers under [[Poland|Polish]] command. Armenian peacekeepers were based in [[Al-Kut]], 62 miles from the capital of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://news.monstersandcritics.com/intelandterror/article_1089436.php/Armenias_third_contingent_of_peacekeepers_now_in_Iraq| title=Armenia's third contingent of peacekeepers now in Iraq|accessdate=2006-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2006 the fourth shift of Armenian peacekeepers departed for Iraq. The shift included 3 staff commanders, 2 medical officers, 10 combat engineers and 31 drivers. Throughout the length of the deployment, there was one Armenian wounded and no deaths. The Armenian government extended the small troop presence in Iraq by one year at the end of 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armenian defense minister to visit Iraq as Armenia to extend the small troop presence | url=http://library.aua.am/library/news/archive/2006_11-14.htm | publisher=The Associated Press |date=2006-11-13 | accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ARMENIAN PEACEKEEPERS TO STAY AN EXTRA YEAR IN IRAQ | url=http://www.azg.am/?lang=EN&amp;num=2005120601 | publisher=AZG Armenian Daily |date=06/12/2005 | accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 2008, Armenia withdrew its contingent of 46 peacekeepers. This coincided with the withdrawal of the Polish contingent in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jJANqHYIy4fh_F3IKdxJh0t1APQg Armenian troops pull out of Iraq: US military]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Afghanistan ===
Currently, Armenia deployed 40 soldiers to Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).  They are serving under [[Germany|German]] command protecting an [[airport]] in [[Konduz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rferl.org&quot;&gt;http://www.rferl.org/content/Armenian_Parliament_Endorses_Troop_Deployment_To_Afghanistan/1898715.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-combat deaths==
The Armenian government’s stated efforts to strengthen and reform the military are called into question by continuing non-combat deaths and other violent incidents in the army ranks, which have come under greater public scrutiny in 2010.  It is very likely that these incidents have some connection with the former [[Soviet Ground Forces]]' phenomenon of [[dedovshchina]] (institutionalised bullying). In a report released in February 2011, the [[Helsinki Citizens’ Assembly]], a [[Vanadzor]]-based human rights group, claimed that 42 Armenian soldiers died in 2010, and that only 9 of them were shot by Azerbaijani forces. It said more than half of them were murdered by fellow servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armenia Reports ‘Unprecedented’ Arms Acquisitions | url=http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2317594.html | publisher=RFE/RL |date=2011-02-22 | accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Armenia}}
Since its independence, '''Armenia''' has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have friendly relations both with [[Iran]], [[Russia]], and the West, including the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://times.am/2010/03/29/armenian-foreign-policy-between-russia-iran-and-u-s/ - &quot;Armenian Foreign Policy Between Russia, Iran And U.S.&quot; - 29 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dispute over the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the recent war over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]]. Armenia is a member of more than 40 different international organizations including the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[La Francophonie]]. It is also an observer member of the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. [[Eduard Nalbandyan]] currently serves as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Armenia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Armenia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].

==International organization participation==

==Armenian Genocide recognition==
{{Main|Recognition of the Armenian Genocide}}
[[Image:Nations recognising the Armenian Genocide.svg|thumb|200px|left|Political map showing states which have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide.]]
Armenia has been joined by many nations, in demanding recognition of the Armenian genocide. Countries that officially recognize the Armenian genocide include [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Lebanon]], [[Lithuania]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/riksdagen-erkande-folkmord-pa-armenier-1.1059812&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]], [[Uruguay]], [[Vatican City]] and [[Venezuela]]; and even the [[New South Wales]] in Australia.  Although part of the United Kingdom, [[Wales]] also officially recognizes the Armenian Genocide.  [[US House Resolution 106]] was introduced on January 30, 2007 later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill currently has 225 co-sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.capwiz.com/y/issues/bills/?billnum=H.RES.106&amp;congress=110&lt;/ref&gt; The bill called for former President [[George W. Bush]] to recognize and use the word genocide in his annual April 24 speech which he never used. His successor President [[Barack Obama]] has expressed his desire to recognize the Armenian Genocide during the electoral campaigns, but after being elected, has not used the word genocide in his first annual April 24 speech in 2009.

Since the independence of Armenia the two countries have been partners within the framework of international organizations (United Nations, OSCE, Council of Europe, BSEC), whilst Greece firmly supports the community programs aimed at further developing relations between the EU and Armenia.

Continuous visits of the highest level have shown that both countries want to continue to improve the levels of friendship and cooperation (Visit by the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian to Greece in 1996, visit by the President of the Hellenic Republic Costis Stephanopoulos in 1999, visit by the President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan to Greece in 2000 and 2005 and visit by Greek president [[Karolos Papoulias]] to Armenia in June 2007).

Greece is, after Russia, the major military partner of Armenia. Armenian officers are trained in Greek military academies, and various technical assistance is supplied by Greece. Since 2003, an Armenian platoon has been deployed in Kosovo as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], where they operate as a part of the Greek battalion of KFOR.

Armenia's most notable recent foreign policy success came with the August 29 treaty with Russia on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, in which Moscow committed itself to the defense of Armenia should it be attacked by a third party. Russia is the key regional security player, and has proved a valuable historical ally for Armenia.  Although it appeared as a response to Aliyev's US trip, the treaty had probably long been under development.  However, it is clear from the wider context of Armenian foreign policy that—while Yerevan welcomes the Russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on Moscow, nor to become part of a confrontation between Russian and US-led alliances in the Transcaucasus.

The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|1918-20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War)]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988-94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War)]], in the past century, with last one ended with provisional [[Bishkek Protocol|cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek]]. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. In 2008, Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] declared that ''“Nagorno Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality”'' and that ''“in 1918, [[Yerevan]] was granted to the [[Armenians]].  It was a great mistake.

The neighboring nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations since 1918.

During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France, and Russia and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, barring a diplomatic passport, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml Azerbaijan Country Page].

In 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;regnum.ru&quot;/&gt;

|{{flag|Georgia }}||&lt;!--start date --&gt; ||See [[Armenia–Georgia relations]]

Armenians and Georgians have a lot in common.  Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets.  Both use the terms &quot;Apostolic&quot; and &quot;Orthodox&quot; in the full titles of their respective churches.  They also use the term &quot;[[Catholicos]]&quot; to refer to their church patriarchs.  Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals).

Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Karabakh conflict]], Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its [[Black Sea]] ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and [[South Caucasus Pipeline|South Caucasus natural gas pipeline]]) have also weighed on the mutual relations and lead to the prevention of the country recognizing the Armenian Genocide. On occasion, however, Georgian politicians have sympathized with the Armenian cause.  For example, on March 20, 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia [[Revaz Gachechiladze]] stated, &quot;We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=16958 PanARMENIAN.Net - &quot;When Time Comes Georgia Will Do Its Best for Armenian Genocide Recognition&quot; - 20 March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve.  On May 10, 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arka.am/en/archive/n05/n1005/100510.html Armenia, Georgia Agree On Greater Part of Border Lines]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samtskhe-Javakheti|Javakheti]] region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as [[United Javakhk]]) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.

Instead, [[Ehude Moshe Eytam]], the Israeli ambassador to Armenia is based in Tbilisi, Georgia, and visits Yerevan twice a month. Israel has recognized 10 Armenians as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for risking their lives to save Jews during [[the Holocaust]], but does not recognize the Armenian Genocide, partly because of its relations with Turkey, which is one of the few countries in the [[Middle East]] that recognizes Israel and partly because of its insistence that the Holocaust was unique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsj.org/Armenia.shtml Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Eurasia: Armenia and Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenian-Lebanese relations are very friendly.

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Armenia announced that it would send humanitarian aid to Lebanon. According to the Armenian government, an unspecified amount of medicines, tents and fire-fighting equipment was allocated to Lebanese authorities on July 27, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/07/EB9E5465-7B17-4A96-B513-03AA0567FAB0.ASP Armenia To Provide Relief To Lebanon], Armenialiberty.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18992&amp;page=1 Armenia Sent Humanitarian Assistance To Lebanon], PanArmenian.Net&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armenia]]-[[Pakistan]] relations are extraordinarily poor owing to numerous disagreements. The main issue is [[Armenia]]'s invasion and occupation of [[Azerbaijan]] territories including [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. [[Pakistan]] has supported territorial integrity of Azerbaijan during and after the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. Pakistan also opposes Armenian [[irredentist]] claims against [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. Pakistan does not recognize the [[Armenian Genocide|1915 Genocide]] and maintains that during the war large number of [[Armenian people|Armenians]] and [[Muslim]]s were killed. Armenia has friendly relations with [[India]], and its recognition of [[Kashmir]] belonging to India has also damaged the relations with Pakistan. Pakistan is also the only country that does not recognize [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairscommittee.org/includes/content_files/Report%2021%20-%20Visit%20to%20Azerbaijan.pdf Pakistan Worldview - Report 21 - Visit to Azerbaijan] Senate of Pakistan - Senate foreign relations committee, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/30102.html Nilufer Bakhtiyar: &quot;For Azerbaijan Pakistan does not recognize Armenia as a country&quot;] 13 September 2006 [14:03] - Today.Az&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]] has cultural, ethnic, historical and religious ties with [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]].

|{{flag|Turkey}}||&lt;!--start date --&gt; ||See [[Armenia–Turkey relations]]

Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991.  Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons.  Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey's holding of historic Armenian lands (ceded to them in the [[Treaty of Kars]], a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper).  At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide.  The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from eastern [[Anatolia]]n lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] orchestrated by the [[Young Turks]] is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey.  Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide.

On June 5, 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to &quot;continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18307 Yerevan Ready to Continue Dialogue with Baku for Karabakh Settlement]&lt;/ref&gt;  Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the [[Armenian SSR]], it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the wake of the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship.  According to ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, 70% of Armenia's imports enter via Georgia.  Because of the apparently belligerent posture of the Russian state, economic ties with Turkey appear especially attractive.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Turkey and Armenia; Friends and Neighbors, rising hopes of better relations between two historic enemies&quot;, ''The Economist'', September 27, 2008, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Armenians migrated to Australia in the 1850s, during the gold rush.
The majority came to Australia in the 1960s, starting with the Armenians of Egypt after Nasser came to power then, in the early 1970s, from Cyprus after the Turkish occupation of the island and from 1975 until 1992, a period of civil unrest in Lebanon.
Person-to-person governmental links are increasing although they are still modest. In September 2003, The Hon Mr Philip Ruddock MP visited Armenia in his former capacity as Australian Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. In October 2005, the Armenian Foreign Minister, H.E. Mr [[Vardan Oskanyan]], visited Australia. In November 2005, The Hon Mr Joe Hockey MP, Minister for Human Services, visited Armenia.
The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia refuses to recognise the mass murder of Armenians in 1915 as Genocide, although the State of N.S.W passed a law recognising this several years earlier. The Australian Government elections of 2007 created an atmosphere in which the Opposition Labor party declared it will push for the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide in Australian Parliament if Labor wins the Elections.

[[American Samoa]], located within the geographical region of [[Oceania]], is one of only two possessions of the [[United States]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the other being [[Jarvis Island]]. Its total land area is 76.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (199&amp;nbsp;km²) -- slightly larger than [[Washington, D.C.]] -- consisting of five rugged, volcanic islands and two [[coral atoll]]s. The five volcanic islands islands are: [[Tutuila]], [[Aunu'u]], [[Ofu-Olosega|Ofu]], [[Ofu-Olosega|Olosega]], [[Tau, American Samoa|Tau]].  The coral atolls are: [[Swains Island|Swains]], and [[Rose Island|Rose Atoll]].  Of the seven islands, Rose Atoll is an uninhabited Marine National Monument.

Due to its positioning in the South Pacific Ocean, it is frequently hit by typhoons between December and March. Rose Atoll is the easternmost point of the territory.  American Samoa is the southernmost part of the United States. American Samoa is home to the [[National Park of American Samoa]].

{{Politics of American Samoa}}
'''Politics of American Samoa''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[List of American Samoa Governors|Governor]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[Wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]]. [[American Samoa]] is an unincorporated and [[unorganized territory]] of the [[United States]], administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]], [[US Department of the Interior]]. Its constitution was ratified 1966 and came into effect 1967. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of the legislature. The party system is a copy of the United States party system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

There is also the traditional village politics of the Samoa Islands, the &quot;[[faamatai]]&quot; and the &quot;[[faasamoa]]&quot;, which continues in American Samoa and in independent Samoa, and which interacts across these current boundaries. The Fa'asamoa is the language and customs, and the Fa'amatai the protocols of the &quot;[[fono]]&quot; (council) and the chiefly system. The Fa'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village, to the region, to national matters. The &quot;matai&quot; (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The matai and the fono (which is itself made of matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are communal. A matai can represent a small family group or a great extended family that reaches across islands, and to both American Samoa and independent [[Samoa]].

==Government==
The [[United States Congress]], in the joint resolution of February 20, 1929, {{USStat|45|1253}}, provided that (until the Congress shall provide for the Government of the islands of American Samoa) all civil, judicial, and military powers shall be vested in such person or persons and exercised in such manner as the [[President of the United States]] shall direct. In {{ExecutiveOrder|10264}}, the President of the United States directed that the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] should take such action as may be necessary and appropriate for the administration of civil government in American Samoa. The Secretary of the Interior promulgated the [[Constitution of American Samoa]] which was approved by a Constitutional Convention of the people of American Samoa and a majority of the voters of American Samoa voting at the 1966 election, and came into effect in 1967.

The government operates under a framework of a [[presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[Governor of American Samoa]] is the [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[American Samoa Fono]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

===Executive branch===
The power of the executive is formally vested
The [[governor]] and the [[lieutenant governor]] are elected on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] by [[popular vote]] for four-year terms.

===Legislative branch===
The Legislature, or ''[[American Samoa Fono|Fono]]'', has two [[bicameralism|chambers]]. The [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has 18 members, elected for a two year term, 17 in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] and one by a public meeting on [[Swain Island]]. The [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] also has 18 members, elected for a four year term by and from the chiefs of the islands.

===Judicial branch===
The [[High Court of American Samoa]] is the highest court below the [[United States Supreme Court]] in American Samoa, with the District Courts below it. The High Court is located in the capital of [[Pago Pago]]. It consists of a Chief Justice and an Associate Justice, appointed by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].

The '''economy of American Samoa''' is a traditional [[Polynesia]]n economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the [[United States]], with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its [[foreign trade]]. [[Tuna]] [[Commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[Fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. [[Tourism]], a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in [[East Asia]].

==Circumstances==
Avicenna created an extensive corpus of works during what is commonly known as [[Islamic Golden Age|Islam's Golden Age]], in which the translations of Greco-Roman, Persian and Indian texts were studied extensively. Greco-Roman ([[Middle Platonism|Mid-]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]) texts by the [[Al-Kindi|Kindi]] school were commented, redacted and developed substantially by Islamic intellectuals, who also built upon Persian and [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematical]] systems, [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]] and [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= |title=Major periods of Muslim education and learning |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-12-16|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samanid dynasty]] in eastern part of [[Persia]], [[Greater Khorasan]] and [[Central Asia]] as well as [[Buyid dynasty]] in the western part of [[Persia]] and [[Iraq]] provided a thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development. Under the Samanids, [[Bukhara]] rivaled [[Baghdad]] as a cultural capital of the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Afary |first=Janet | authorlink=Janet Afary |title=Iran |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-12-16|location=|publisher=|url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=9106324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere. Philosophy, [[Fiqh]] and theology ([[kalam]]) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. [[Al-Razi]] and [[Al-Farabi]] had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of [[Balkh]], [[Khwarezm]], [[Gorgan]], [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Hamadan]]. As various texts, such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar show, he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. As [[Aruzi Samarqandi]] describes in his four articles before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (a famous scientist and astronomer), [[Abu Nasr Mansur|Abu Nasr Iraqi]] (a renowned mathematician), [[Abu Sahl Masihi]] (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Avicenna was born c. 980 in Afshana, near [[Bukhara]], the capital of [[Samanids]], a Persian dynasty in [[Central Asia]] and [[Greater Khorasan]]. His father was from [[Balkh]], in present-day [[Afghanistan]] and his mother from [[Bukhara]], in present-day [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Avicenna&quot;'', in [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], Concise Online Version, 2006 ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011433/Avicenna]); D. Gutas, ''&quot;Avicenna&quot;'', in [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], Online Version 2006, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f1/v3f1a046.html LINK]); Avicenna in (Encyclopedia of Islam: © 1999 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Abdullah, was a respected [[Ismaili]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbin1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbin|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Corbin|coauthors=|title=History of Islamic Philosophy, Translated by Liadain Sherrard, [[Philip Sherrard]] |publisher=London; Kegan Paul International in association with Islamic Publications for The Institute of Ismaili Studies |year=1993 (original French 1964)|isbn=0710304161|pages=167–175|oclc=22109949 221646817 22181827 225287258}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar from [[Balkh]], an important town of the [[Samanid Empire]], in what is today [[Balkh Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. His mother was named Setareh. His father was at the time of his son's birth the governor in one of the [[Samanid]] Nuh ibn Mansur's estates. He had his son very carefully educated at Bukhara. Ibn Sina's independent thought was served by an extraordinary intelligence and memory, which allowed him to overtake his teachers at the age of fourteen. As he said in his autobiography, there was nothing that he had not learned when he reached eighteen.

A number of different theories have been proposed regarding Avicenna's [[madhab]]. Medieval historian Ẓahīr al-dīn al-Baīhaqī considered Avicenna to be a follower of the [[Brethren of Purity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Janssens91&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Leuven University Press| isbn = 9789061864769| last = Janssens| first = Jules L.| title = An annotated bibliography on Ibn Sînâ (1970-1989): including Arabic and Persian publications and Turkish and Russian references | year = 1991 | pages=89–90}} excerpt: &quot;&lt;expand&gt; ...

Ibn Sīnā was put under the charge of a tutor, and his precocity soon made him the marvel of his neighbors; he displayed exceptional [[intellect]]ual behaviour and was a [[child prodigy]] who had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized the Qur'an]] by the age of 10  and a great deal of [[Persian poetry]] as well.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine|title=The Canon of Medicine (work by Avicenna)|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned [[Indian mathematics|Indian arithmetic]] from an [[History of India|Indian]] greengrocer, and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young. He also studied [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) under the Hanafi scholar Ismail al-Zahid.&lt;ref name=Gracia&gt;Jorge J. E. Gracia and Timothy B. Noone (2003), ''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'', p. 196, [[Blackwell Publishing]], ISBN 0631216731.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, he was greatly troubled by the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' of [[Aristotle]], which he could not understand until he read [[al-Farabi]]'s commentary on the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbin1993&quot; /&gt; For the next year and a half, he studied [[philosophy]], in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions ([[wudu]]), then go to the [[mosque]], and continue in prayer ([[salah]]) till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the ''Metaphysics'' of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by [[Farabi]], which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.

He turned to [[medicine]] at 16, and not only learned medical theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment. The teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; and found that &quot;Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like [[mathematics]] and [[metaphysics]], so I soon made great progress; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients, using approved remedies.&quot; The youthful physician's fame spread quickly, and he treated many patients without asking for payment.

===Adulthood===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:Avicenna 1271b.jpg|thumb|An old drawing of Avicenna from 1271]]

His first appointment was that of physician to the [[emir]], who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal [[library]] of the [[Samanids]], well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labours, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.

When Ibn Sina was 22 years old, he lost his father. The [[Samanid dynasty]] came to its end in December 1004. Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Urgench]] in the modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir|Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Dailam]] and central [[Persia]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find an asylum, was about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this season stricken down by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].

Ibn Sina subsequently settled at [[Ray, Iran|Rai]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], (present day capital of Iran), the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in [[Ray, Iran|Rai]]. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamadãn where  Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir consented that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in a [[shaikh|sheikh]] Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.

Meanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the [[prefect]] of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hidden, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamadãn; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped out of the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.

===Later life and death===
[[Image:Hamadan1.jpg|thumb|Avicenna's tomb in [[Hamadan]], [[Iran]].]]

The remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn Sīnā's life were spent in the service of Abu Ja'far 'Ala Addaula, whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.

During these years he began to study [[literature|literary]] matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style.  A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.

His friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately. He refused, however, stating that: ''&quot;I prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with length&quot;''{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and read through the [[Qur'an]] every three days until his death. He died in June 1037, in his fifty-eighth year, in the month of [[Ramadan]] and was buried in Hamadan, Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution Of Modern Medicine|first=William|last=Osler|authorlink=William Osler|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]|year=2004|isbn=1419161539|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 100 treatises were ascribed to Ibn Sina. Some of them are tracts of a few pages. Others are works, extending through several volumes. The best-known amongst them, and that to which Ibn Sina owed his European reputation, is his 14-volume ''The Canon of Medicine'' (Al-Qanoon fi al-Tibb, The Laws of Medicine), which was a standard medical text in Europe and the Islamic world up until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ziauddin Sardar]], [http://www.cgcu.net/imase/islam_science_philosophy.htm Science in Islamic philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The drug must be free from any extraneous accidental quality.
*It must be used on a simple, not a composite, disease.
*The drug must be tested with two contrary types of diseases, because sometimes a drug cures one disease by Its essential qualities and another by its accidental ones.
*The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease. For example, there are some drugs whose heat is less than the coldness of certain diseases, so that they would have no effect on them.
*The time of action must be observed, so that essence and accident are not confused.
*The effect of the drug must be seen to occur constantly or in many cases, for if this did not happen, it was an accidental effect.
*The experimentation must be done with the human body, for testing a drug on a lion or a horse might not prove anything about its effect on man.

An Arabic edition of the ''Canon'' appeared at Rome in 1593, and a Hebrew version at Naples in 1491. Of the Latin version there were about thirty editions, founded on the original translation by [[Gerard de Sabloneta]]. In the 15th century a commentary on the text of the ''Canon'' was composed. Other medical works translated into Latin are the ''Medicamenta Cordialia'', ''Canticum de Medicina'', and the ''Tractatus de Syrupo Acetoso''.

It was mainly accident which determined that from the 12th to the 18th century, Ibn Sīnā should be the guide of medical study in European universities, and eclipse the names of Rhazes, [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi|Ali ibn al-Abbas]] and [[Averroes]]. His work is not essentially different from that of his predecessor Rhazes, because he presented the doctrine of [[Galen]], and through Galen the doctrine of [[Hippocrates]], modified by the system of [[Aristotle]]. But the ''Canon'' of Ibn Sīnā is distinguished from the ''Al-Hawi'' (Continence) or ''Summary'' of Rhazes by its greater method, due perhaps to the logical studies of the former.

The work has been variously appreciated in subsequent ages, some regarding it as a treasury of wisdom, and others, like Averroes, holding it useful only as waste paper. In modern times it has been mainly of historic interest as most of its tenets have been disproved or expanded upon by scientific medicine. The vice of the book is excessive classification of bodily faculties, and over-subtlety in the discrimination of diseases. It includes five books; of which the first and second discuss [[physiology]], [[pathology]] and [[hygiene]], the third and fourth deal with the methods of treating disease, and the fifth describes the composition and preparation of remedies. This last part contains some personal observations.

He is ample in the enumeration of symptoms, and is said to be inferior in practical medicine and [[surgery]]. He introduced into medical theory the ''four causes of the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] system''. Of [[natural history]] and [[botany]] he pretended to no special knowledge. Up to the year 1650, or thereabouts, the ''Canon'' was still used as a textbook in the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Montpellier]].

In the museum at [[Bukhara]], there are displays showing many of his writings, [[surgical instruments]] from the period and paintings of patients undergoing treatment. Ibn Sīnā was interested in the effect of the [[mind]] on the [[body]], and wrote a great deal on [[psychology]], likely influencing [[Ibn Tufayl]] and [[Ibn Bajjah]]. He also introduced medical herbs.

Avicenna extended the theory of temperaments in ''The Canon of Medicine'' to encompass &quot;[[emotion]]al aspects, mental capacity, [[moral]] attitudes, [[self-awareness]], movements and [[dream]]s.&quot; He summarized his version of the [[Humorism|four humours]] and temperaments in a table as follows:&lt;ref name=Lutz&gt;{{Cite book|first=Peter L.|last=Lutz|year=2002|title=The Rise of Experimental Biology: An Illustrated History|page=60|publisher=[[Humana Press]]|isbn=0896038351|oclc=47894348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical Exercise: the Key to Health===
{{Ref improve section|please provide publication information|date=June 2010}}
'''The Canon of Medicine: Volume 1 of 5; Part 4 of 5: The Preservation of Health '''

Ibn Sina's Canon of Medicine which is written in 5 volumes, only the first volume has appeared in the English Language. In the first volume, Ibn Sina divides medicine into two parts as he explains it throughout the first book: the theoretical and the practical. The theoretical part consists of, but is not excluded to, such things as: the causes of health and disease, the temperaments, the humours, the anatomy, general physiology, the breath, psychology, discussion of causes diseases and symptoms, the causes of illness, the classification of diseases, the pulse, the urine etc.

{{quote|As he himself says in the book on pg 353 &quot;In the first part of this book it was stated that medicine comprises two parts, one theoretical, and one practical, though both are really speculative science.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=353}}}}

'''Theoretical and Practical Medicine'''

Ibn Sina goes on to say that you do not get any benefit from just knowing how your body works, but rather the true benefit of medicine itself is in its practical aspect, since medicine is for the preservation of health.

{{quote|&quot;That which is speculative named theory relates to the formation of opinions and the showing of the evidence upon which they are based, without reference to the mode of acting upon them. Thus this part deals with the temperaments, the humors, the drives, and with the forms, the symptoms, and the causes of disease. That which is specially named practical relates to the mode of acting upon this knowledge, and the prescription of a regimen.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=353}}}}

'''The Benefits of Exercise'''

Once the purpose of medicine has been set forth, then from pages 377-455, Ibn Sina divides the way of achieving health as:

{{quote| &quot;Since the regimen of maintaining health consists essentially in the regulation of: (1) exercise (2) food and (3) sleep, we may begin our discourse with the subject of exercise&quot;. {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=377}}}}

Exercise itself is divided into three main parts: The Massage (which is equivalent to massaging your muscles before you start to exercise); The Exercise itself; and lastly the Cold Bath.

Giving one of the greatest benefits of the regimen of exercise, and then explaining the extremely important and necessary need for physical exercise; Ibn Sina states:

{{quote|&quot;Once we direct the attention towards regulating exercise as to amount and time, we shall find there is no need for such medicines as are ordinarily required for remedying diseases dependent on [abnormal] matters, or diseases of temperament consequent upon such. This is true provided the rest of the regimen is appropriate and proper.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=377}}}}

{{quote|The value of exercise includes the following (1) it hardens the organs and renders them fit for their functions (2) it results in a better absorption of food, aids assimilation, and, by increasing the innate heat, improves nutrition (3) it clears the pores of the skin (4) it removes effete substances through the lungs (5) it strengthens the physique. Vigorous exercise invigorates the muscular and nervous system.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=379}}}}

'''In what manner does Ibn Sina uses the word temperament? In saying that exercise cures diseases of temperamant'''

Ibn Sina divides temperament into that which is harmonious and that which is non-uniform. Ibn Sina says on pg 276-277

{{quote|&quot;In addition to the signs of the normal temperament already given, there are: Mental faculties include: vigor of imagination, intellectual power, and memory.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=276}}}}

{{quote|&quot;In brief, there is non-uniformity of temperament among the members; or, perchance, the principal members depart from equability and come to be of contrary temperament, one deviating towards one, amother to its contrary. If the components of the body are out of proportion, it is unfortunate both for talent and reasoning power.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=277}}}}

'''The Purpose of Exercise and the Dangers of its negligence'''

{{quote| Continuing on the proof to why exercise should be so beneficial Ibn Sina says &quot;We know that this must be so when we reflect how in regard to nutriment, our health depends on the nutriment being appropriate for us and regulated in quantity and quality. For not one of the aliments which are capable of nourishing the body is converted into actual nutriment in its entirety. In every case digestion leaves something untouched, and nature takes care to have that evacuated. Nevertheless, the evacuation which nature accomplishes is not a complete one. Hence at the end of each digestion there is some superfluity left over. Should this be a frequent occurrence, repetition would lead to further aggregation until something measurable has accumulated. As a result, harmful effete substances would form and injure various parts of the body. When they undergo decomposition, putrefactive diseases arise [bacterial infections]. Should they be strong in quality, they will give rise to intemperament; and if they should increase in quantity, they would set up the symptoms of plethora which have already been described. Flowing to some member, they will result in an inflammatory mass, and their vapors will destroy the temperament of the substantial basis of the breath.

That is the reason why we must be careful to evacuate these substances. Their evacuation is usually not completely accomplished without the aid of toxic medicines, for these break up the nature of the effate substances. This can be achieved only by toxic agents, although the drinking of them is to a certain extent deleterious to our nature. As Hippocrates says: &quot;Medicine purges and ages.&quot; More than this the discharge of superfluous humor entails the loss of a large part of the natural humidities and of the breath, which is the substance of life. All this is at the expense of the strength of the principal and the auxiliary members, and therefore they are weakened thereby. These and other things account for the difficulties incident to plethora, whether they remain behind in the body or are evacuated by it.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|pp=377–8}}}}

Just before this Ibn Sina explained how accumulation of food in our body, can cause diseases, and one way to rid us of this is strong medicines. However, as he explains; this is not the ideal way, and certainly not the long-term. Thus, to make his point very clear, and show the extreme necessity of daily exercise for health, Ibn Sina states:

{{quote|&quot;Now exercise is that agent which most surely prevents the accumulation of these matters, and prevents plethora. The other forms of regiment assist it. It is this exercise which renews and revives the innate heat, and imparts the necessary lightness to the body, for it causes the subtle heat to be increased and daily disperses whatever effete substances have accumulated; the movements of the body help them to expel them conveying them to those parts of the body whence they can readily leave it. Hence the effete matters are not allowed to collect day after day and besides this, as we have just said, exercise causes the innate heat to flourish and keeps the joints and ligaments firm, so as to be always ready for service, and also free from injury. It renders the members able to receive nutriment, in being free from accumulated effate matters. Hence it renders the members light and the humidities attenuated, and it dilates the pores of the skin.

To forsake exercise would often incur the risk of &quot;hectic&quot;, because the instinctive drives of the members are impaired, inasmuch as the deprivation of movement prevents the access to them of the innate breath. And this last is the real instrument of life for every one of the members.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|pp=378–9}}}}

'''Massage'''

Before you begin to exercise it is important that you massage your muscles; as Ibn Sina says on page 385:

{{quote| &quot;Massage as a preparatory to athletics. The massage begins gently, and then becomes more vigorous as the time approaches for the exercise.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=385}}}}

'''Exercises'''

The exercises themselves are divided into 'strenuous, mild, vigorous and brisk'. On pages 379-381; Ibn Sina states the types of exercises under each type:

{{quote| &quot;Strenuous exercises include: wrestling contests, boxing, quick marching, running, jumping over an object higher than one foot, throwing the javelin, fencing, horsemanship, swimming. Mild exercises include: fishing, sailing, being carried on camels, swinging to and fro. Vigorous exercises include: those performed by soldiers in camp, in military sports; field running, long jumping, high jumping, polo, stone throwing, lifting heavy stones or weights, various forms of wrestling. Brisk exercises include: involves interchanging places with a partner as swiftly as possible, each jumping to and fro, either in time [to music] or irregularly.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|pp=379–81}}}}

There are certain important things to note once you start exercising, one is the amount, the other consistency; Ibn Sina states about the amount:

{{quote| &quot;(1) the color - as long as the skin goes on becoming florid, the exercise may be continued. After it ceases to do so, the exercise must be discontinued.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=384}}}}

On being consistent with exercise Ibn Sina states (on the importance of having a regimen):

{{quote| &quot;At the conclusion of the first day's exercise, you will know the degree of exercise allowable and when you know the amount of nourishment the person can bear, do not make any change in either on the second day. Arrange that the measure of aliment, and the amount of exercise shall not exceed that limit ascertained on the first day.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=385}}}}

On the side note those who think themselves to be elderly, and thus think of shunning exercise, Ibn Sina write a complete chapter titled &quot;Concerning the Elderly&quot; in the Qanun, and states the same regimen for them, as he does for others. He states on page 433

{{quote| &quot;For if, towards the end of life, the body is still equable, it will be right to allow attempered exercises. If one part of the body should not be in a first-rate condition, then that part should not be exercised until the others have been exercised..... On the other hand, if the ailment were in the feet, then the exercise should employ the upper limbs: for instance, rowing, throwing weights, lifting weights.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=433}}}}

'''Bathing in Cold Water'''

Once you have finished exercising; it is often that the person will feel tired and fatigued; to combat this problem Ibn Sina says on page 388:

{{quote| &quot;The beneficial Effects of Baths: The benefits are (1) induction of sleep (2) dilation of pores (3) cleansing of skin (4) dispersal of the undesirable waste matters (5) maturation of abscesses (6) drawing of nutriment towards the surface of the body (7) assistance to the physiological dispersion and excretion of poisonous matters (8) prevention of diarrhea and (9) removal of fatigue effects.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=388}}}}

Most importantly you should remember:

{{quote| &quot;A person should not go into the bath immediately after exercise. He should rest properly first.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=387}}}}

There are two more things that are important to mention on this subject:

{{quote| &quot;Injurious effects include the fact that the heart is weakened if the person stays too long in the bath&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=388}}}}

{{quote| &quot;Cold Bathing should not be done after exercise except in the case of the very robust. Even then the rules which we have given should be followed. To use cold baths in the ways we have named drives the natural heat suddenly into the interior parts, and then invigorates the strength so that the person should leave the bath twice as strong as when he entered.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=390}}}}

'''Diet'''

Once Ibn Sina has laid the foundation of exercise being central to health, he names many exercises as running, swimming, weight lifting, polo, fencing, boxing, wrestling, long jumping, high jumping, etc. He also gives a diet to go along with the exercise:

{{quote|&quot;The meal should include: (1) meat especially kid of goats; veal, and year-old lambs [this means white meat in today`s terms] (2) wheat, which is cleaned of extraneous matter and gathered during a healthy harvest without ever being exposed to injurious influences (3) sweets (fruits) of appropriate temperament.&quot; {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=390}}}}

Lastly, the third thing mentioned is sleep; to make sure that you do not sleep during the days, and do not stay awake during the nights. From the above reading, it is clear that Ibn Sina gave advice in his book which is still the same advice medical doctors give to their patients.Daily Physical Exercise; and to defeat diseases such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, the prescription of a diet which contains high amounts of Whole Grains and little to no amounts of Refined Carbohydrates.

===Psychology===

Avicenna was a pioneer of [[neuropsychiatry]]. He first described numerous neuropsychiatric conditions, including [[hallucination]], [[insomnia]], [[mania]], [[nightmare]], [[melancholia]], [[dementia]], [[epilepsy]], [[paralysis]], [[stroke]], [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and [[tremor]].&lt;ref name=Workman/&gt;

Avicenna was also a pioneer in [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychosomatic medicine]]. He recognized '[[physiological psychology]]' in the treatment of illnesses involving [[emotion]]s, and developed a system for associating changes in the [[pulse]] rate with inner feelings, which is seen as an anticipation of the [[word association]] test attributed to [[Carl Jung]]. Avicenna is reported to have treated a very ill patient by &quot;feeling the patient's pulse and reciting aloud to him the names of provinces, districts, towns, streets, and people.&quot; He noticed how the patient's pulse increased when certain names were mentioned, from which Avicenna deduced that the patient was in love with a girl whose home Avicenna was &quot;able to locate by the digital examination.&quot; Avicenna advised the patient to marry the girl he is in love with, and the patient soon recovered from his illness after his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim B. Syed PhD, &quot;Islamic Medicine: 1000 years ahead of its times&quot;, ''[[The Islamic Medical Association of North America|Journal of the Islamic Medical Association]]'', 2002 (2), p. 2-9 [7].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Canon of Medicine'', Avicenna dealt with neuropsychiatry and described a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including melancholia.&lt;ref&gt;S Safavi-Abbasi, LBC Brasiliense, RK Workman (2007), &quot;The fate of medical knowledge and the neurosciences during the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian Empire&quot;, ''Neurosurgical Focus'' '''23''' (1), E13, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He described melancholia as a [[depression (mood)|depressive]] type of [[mood disorder]] in which the person may become suspicious and develop certain types of [[phobia]]s.&lt;ref name=Amber-366&gt;Amber Haque (2004), &quot;Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists&quot;, ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357-377 [366].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unani medicine===
{{Main|Unani medicine}}
Though the threads which comprise [[Unani]] healing can be traced all the way back to [[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]], who lived in the 2nd century AD, the basic knowledge of Unani medicine as a healing system was developed by Hakim Ibn Sina in his medical encyclopedia ''The Canon of Medicine''. The time of origin is thus dated at ''circa'' 1025 AD, when Avicenna wrote ''The Canon of Medicine'' in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], which remains a text book in the syllabus of Unani medicine in the colleges of India&lt;ref&gt;Indian Studies on Ibn Sina’s Works by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Avicenna (Scientific and Practical International Journal of Ibn Sino International Foundation, Tashkent/Uzbekistan. 1-2; 2003: 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; and Pakistan. While he was primarily influenced by [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek]] and [[Islamic medicine]], he was also influenced by the [[Ayurveda|Indian medical]] teachings of [[Sushruta]] and [[Charaka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;salaam.co.uk&quot;&gt;Hakeem Abdul Hameed, [http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/hakeems.php Exchanges between India and Central Asia in the field of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman, a scholar of Unani medicine works on Ibn Sina.

It would require a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished, during which the mountains themselves might be somewhat diminished in size.|&lt;ref name=Goodfield/&gt;}}

Due to his fundamental contributions to the development of geology, particularly regarding the origins of mountains, Avicenna has been called the 'Father of Geology'.&lt;ref name=Medvei&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Clinical Endocrinology: A Comprehensive Account of Endocrinology from Earliest Times to the Present Day|first=Victor Cornelius|last=Medvei|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1993|isbn=1850704279|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of science===

In the ''Al-Burhan'' (''On Demonstration'') section of ''The Book of Healing'', Avicenna discussed the [[philosophy of science]] and described an early [[scientific method]] of [[inquiry]]. He discusses [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of &quot;How does one acquire the first principles of a science?&quot; He asked how a scientist would arrive at &quot;the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?&quot; He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a &quot;relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty.&quot; Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that &quot;it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.&quot; In its place, he develops a &quot;method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|volume=41|issue=3|date=July 2003|pages=307–327|doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physics===

In [[mechanics]], Ibn Sīnā, in ''The Book of Healing'', developed an elaborate theory of [[motion (physics)|motion]], in which he made a distinction between the inclination (tendency to motion) and [[force]] of a [[projectile]], and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination (''mayl'') transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that [[projectile motion]] in a vacuum would not cease.&lt;ref name=Espinoza&gt;Fernando Espinoza (2005). &quot;An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching&quot;, ''Physics Education'' '''40''' (2), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as [[air resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sayili (1987), &quot;Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile&quot;, ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1), p. 477 – 482:

{{quote|It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His theory of motion is thus reminiscent of the theory of [[inertia]], now known as [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's first law of motion]].&lt;ref name=Espinoza/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayili&gt;[[Aydin Sayili]] (1987), &quot;Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile&quot;, ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1): 477–482 [477]: {{quote|Ibn Sina adopted this idea in its rough outline, but the violent inclination as he conceived it was a non-self-consuming one. It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion. [...] Indeed, self-motion of the type conceived by Ibn Sina is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion of the projectile type, and it is rather reminiscent of the principle of inertia, i.e., Newton's first law of motion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of ''mayl'' also attempted to provide a quantitive relation between the weight and velocity of a moving body, resembling the concept of momentum, a precursor to the concept of momentum in Newton's second law of motion.&lt;ref name=Razavi&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia|author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] &amp; Mehdi Amin Razavi|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0700703144|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Sīnā's theory of ''mayl'' was further developed by [[Jean Buridan]] in his [[theory of impetus]].&lt;ref name=Razavi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Sayili (1987), &quot;Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile&quot;, ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1), pp. 477–482&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optics]], Ibn Sina &quot;observed that if the perception of [[light]] is due to the emission of some sort of [[Subatomic particle|particles]] by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided a wrong explanation of the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] described Avicenna's (&quot;Ibn Sīnā&quot;) theory on the rainbow as follows:

{{quote|Independent observation had demonstrated to him that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer. The cloud, he thought, serves simply as the background of this thin substance, much as a quicksilver lining is placed upon the rear surface of the glass in a mirror. Ibn Sīnā would change the place not only of the bow, but also of the color formation, holding the iridescence to be merely a subjective sensation in the eye.|&lt;ref&gt;Carl Benjamin Boyer (1954).&quot;Robert Grosseteste on the Rainbow&quot;, ''Osiris'' '''11''', p. 247-258 [248].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1253, a [[Latin]] text entitled ''Speculum Tripartitum'' stated the following regarding Avicenna's theory on [[heat]]:

{{quote|Avicenna says in his book of heaven and earth, that heat is generated from motion in external things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Fringes of the Corpus Aristotelicum: the Pseudo-Avicenna Liber Celi Et Mundi|last=Gutman|first=Oliver|journal=Early Science and Medicine|volume=2|issue=2|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|pages=109–28|doi=10.1163/157338297X00087}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Psychology===

Avicenna's legacy in classical [[psychology]] is primarily embodied in the ''Kitab al-nafs'' parts of his ''Kitab al-shifa''' (''The Book of Healing'') and ''Kitab al-najat'' (''The Book of Deliverance''). These were known in Latin under the title ''De Anima'' (treatises &quot;on the soul&quot;). The main thesis of these tracts is represented in his so-called &quot;flying man&quot; argument, which resonates with what was centuries later entailed by [[Descartes]]'s ''cogito'' argument (or what [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] designates as a form of an &quot;''epoche''&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nader El-Bizri 2000 pp. 149-171&quot;&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000), pp. 149-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elbizri67-89&quot;&gt;Nader El-Bizri, &quot;Avicenna's De Anima between Aristotle and Husserl,&quot; in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003), pp. 67-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna’s psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul’s individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality.  Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception.  Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect.  In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses.  This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience.  This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms.  The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna's Psychology.

The soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter.  This process requires a concrete particular (material) to be abstracted into the universal intelligible (immaterial). The material and immaterial interact through the Active Intellect, which is a “divine light” containing the intelligible forms.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna's Psychology.

==Avicennian philosophy==

Ibn Sīnā wrote extensively on [[early Islamic philosophy]], especially the subjects [[logic]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]], including treatises named ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics''. Most of his works were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] - which was the ''de facto'' scientific [[language]] of the time in the Middle East, and some were written in the [[Persian language]]. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn Sīnā's commentaries on Aristotle often corrected the philosopher{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]].

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], due to Avicenna's successful reconciliation between [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] along with [[Kalam]], Avicennism eventually became the leading school of [[Islamic philosophy]] by the 12th century, with Avicenna becoming a central authority on philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), p. 80-81, &quot;Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)&quot;, ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicennism was also influential in [[medieval Europe]], particular his doctrines on the nature of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and his [[existence]]-[[essence]] distinction, along with the debates and censure that they raised in scholastic Europe. This was particularly the case in [[Paris]], where Avicennism was later [[proscribed]] in 1210. Nevertheless, his [[psychology]] and theory of knowledge influenced [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], while his metaphysics had an impact on the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm#H5 |title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980-1037) |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2006-01-06 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical doctrine===
Early Islamic philosophy and [[Islamic metaphysics]], imbued as it is with [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], distinguishes more clearly than [[Aristotelianism]] the difference between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to [[metaphysics]], owes much to [[al-Farabi]]. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.

Following al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam in Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= |title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna’s consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a ‘necessary existent due to what is other than itself’ (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is ‘false in itself’ and ‘true due to something else other than itself’. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa’, Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G. C. Anawati, Ibrahim Madkour, Sa’id Zayed (Cairo, 1975), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], &quot;Avicenna and Essentialism,&quot; ''Review of Metaphysics'', Vol. 54 (2001), pp. 753-778&lt;/ref&gt; The Necessary exists ‘due-to-Its-Self’, and has no quiddity/essence (''mahiyya'') other than existence (''wujud''). Furthermore, It is ‘One’ (''wahid ahad'')&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Metaphysica of Avicenna'', trans. Parviz Morewedge (New York, 1973), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; since there cannot be more than one ‘Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself’ without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails that they exist ‘due-to-themselves’ as well as ‘due to what is other than themselves’; and this is contradictory. However, if no differentia distinguishes them from each other, then there is no sense in which these ‘Existents’ are not one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna adds that the ‘Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself’ has no genus (''jins''), nor a definition (''hadd''), nor a counterpart (''nadd''), nor an opposite (''did''), and is detached (''bari’'') from matter (''madda''), quality (''kayf''), quantity (''kam''), place (''ayn''), situation (''wad’''), and time (''waqt'').&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Kitab al-Hidaya'', ed. Muhammad ‘Abdu (Cairo, 1874), pp. 262-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salem Mashran, ''al-Janib al-ilahi ‘ind Ibn Sina'' (Damascus, 1992), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, &quot;Being and Necessity: A Phenomenological Investigation of Avicenna’s Metaphysics and Cosmology,&quot; in ''Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology on the Perennial Issue of Microcosm and Macrocosm'', ed. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2006), pp. 243-261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural philosophy===
Ibn Sina and [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] engaged in a written debate, with Abu Rayhan Biruni mostly criticizing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[natural philosophy]] and the [[Peripatetic school]], while Avicenna and his student Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Ma'sumi respond to Biruni's criticisms in writing. Abu Rayhan began by asking Avicenna eighteen questions, ten of which were criticisms of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On the Heavens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rafik Berjak and Muzaffar Iqbal, &quot;Ibn Sina—Al-Biruni correspondence&quot;, ''Islam &amp; Science'', June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Ibn Sīnā was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with [[Islamic theology]]. His aim was to prove the existence of God and his creation of the world scientifically and through [[reason]] and [[logic]].&lt;ref name=Goodman-8-9&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 8-9, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0195135806.&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna wrote a number of treatises dealing with Islamic theology. These included treatises on the [[Islamic prophet]]s, whom he viewed as &quot;inspired philosophers&quot;, and on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the [[Qur'an]], such as how Quranic [[cosmology]] corresponds to his own philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Morris (1992), &quot;The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy&quot;, in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic PhIlosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], p. 142-188 [159-161].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Sīnā [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized the Qur'an]] by the age of seven, and as an adult, he wrote five treatises commenting on [[sura]]s from the Qur'an. One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Qur'an in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Janssens (2004), &quot;Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries&quot;, ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p. 177-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thought experiments===
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near [[Hamadhan]], Avicenna wrote his famous &quot;Floating Man&quot; [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. Avicenna believed his &quot;Floating Man&quot; thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input.  The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]].  Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from sense experience, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.  The conceivability of this “Floating Man” indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul’s separateness from the body.  Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human [[mind]] and imparts order and intelligibility to [[nature]]. However, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.  Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect.  The first knowledge of the flying person would be “I am,” affirming his or her essence.  That essence could not be the body, obviously, as the flying person has no sensation.  Thus, the knowledge that “I am” is the core of a human being:  the soul exists and is self-aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasse|first=Dag Nikolaus|title=Avicenna’s De Anima in the Latin West|year=2000|publisher=Warburg Institute|location=London|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]].  The body is unnecessary; in relation to it, the soul is its perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nader El-Bizri 2000 pp. 149-171&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elbizri67-89&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 9780415056670| last = Nasr| first = Seyyed Hossein| coauthors = Oliver Leaman| title = History of Islamic philosophy| year = 1996| pages=315, 1022–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In itself, the soul is an immaterial substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasse|first=Dag Nikolaus|title=Avicenna's De Anima in the Latin West|year=2000|publisher=Warburg Institute|location=London|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contributions==
===Astronomy and astrology===
The [[Muslim views on astrology|study of astrology]] was refuted by Avicenna. His reasons were both due to the methods used by astrologers being [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]] and also due to the views of astrologers conflicting with orthodox [[Islam]]. He also cited passages from the [[Qur'an]] in order to justify his refutation of astrology on both scientific and religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', p. 60, 67-69. [[New York University Press]], ISBN 0814780237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], he criticized [[Aristotle]]'s view of the [[star]]s receiving their light from the [[Sun]]. Ibn Sīnā stated that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the [[planet]]s are also self-luminous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The phases of venus before 1610|first=Roger|last=Ariew|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=18|issue=1|date=March 1987|pages=81–92|doi=10.1016/0039-3681(87)90012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have observed the [[Transit of Venus|transit of Venus across the Sun]] on May 24, 1032.&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt;  However, modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Some Medieval Reports of Venus and Mercury Transits|author=Goldstein, Bernard R.|journal=Centaurus|volume=14|issue=1|year=1969|pages=49–59|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1969.tb00135.x|bibcode=1969Cent...14...49G}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He used his transit observation to demonstrate that [[Venus]] was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in the Ptolemaic cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Sīnā: Abū ʿAlī al‐Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbdallāh ibn Sīnā|author=Sally P.

Soon after, he wrote the ''Compendium of the Almagest'', a commentary on [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''. Avicenna concluded that Venus is closer to the Earth than the Sun.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Theory and Observation in Medieval Astronomy|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=63|issue=1|date=March 1972|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=39–47 [44]|doi=10.1086/350839}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1070, [[Juzjani, Abu Ubaid|Abu Ubayd al-Juzjani]], a pupil of Ibn Sīnā, claimed that his teacher Ibn Sīnā had solved the [[equant]] problem in the [[Ptolemaic model]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. I. Sabra]] (1998). &quot;Configuring the Universe: Aporetic, Problem Solving, and Kinematic Modeling as Themes of Arabic Astronomy&quot;, ''Perspectives on Science'' '''6''' (3), p. 288-330 [305-306].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry ===
In [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|chemistry]], the chemical process of [[steam distillation]] was first described by Ibn Sīnā. The technique was used to produce [[alcohol]] and [[essential oil]]s; the latter was fundamental to [[aromatherapy]].&lt;ref name=Marlene&gt;Marlene Ericksen (2000). ''Healing with Aromatherapy'', p. 9. McGraw-Hill Professional. ISBN 0658003828.&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented the [[Dehumidifier#Mechanical/refrigerative|refrigerated coil]], which condenses the [[aromaticity|aromatic]] vapours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aromatherapy: A Practical Approach|first=Vicki|last=Pitman|publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Nelson Thornes]]|year=2004|isbn=0748773460|page=xi|oclc=56069493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Basics of Chemistry|first=Richard|last=Myers|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2003|isbn=0313316643|page=14|oclc=50164580}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a breakthrough in [[distillation]] technology and he made use of it in his steam distillation process, which requires [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] tubing, to produce essential oils.&lt;ref name=Marlene/&gt;

As a [[chemist]], Avicenna was one of the first to write refutations on [[Alchemy (Islam)|alchemy]], after [[al-Kindi]]. Four of his works on the refutation of alchemy were translated into [[Latin]] as:&lt;ref name=Anawati&gt;Georges C. Anawati (1996), &quot;Arabic alchemy&quot;, in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 3, p. 853-885 [875]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Declaratio Lapis physici Avicennae filio sui Aboali''
*''Avicennae de congelatione et conglutinatione lapifum''
*''Avicennae ad Hasan Regem epistola de Re recta''

In one of these works, Ibn Sīnā discredited the theory of the [[Philosopher's stone|transmutation of substances]] commonly believed by [[alchemy|alchemists]]:

{{quote|Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among his works refuting alchemy, ''Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae'' was the most influential, having influenced later [[medieval]] chemists and alchemists such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]].&lt;ref name=Anawati/&gt;

In another work, translated into Latin as ''De congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum'', Ibn Sina proposed a four-part classification of inorganic bodies, which was a significant improvement over the two-part classification of [[Aristotle]] (into ''orycta'' and [[metal]]s) and three-part classification of [[Galen]] (into ''terrae'', ''lapides'' and metals). The four parts of Ibn Sina's classification were: ''lapides'', [[sulfur]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The origins of geology in Italy: [in memory of Nicoletta Morello, 1946-2006]|first1=Gian Battista|last1=Vai|first2=W.

===Engineering===
In the chapters on [[mechanics]] and [[engineering]] in his encyclopedia ''Mi'yar al-'aql'' (''The Measure of the Mind''), Avicenna writes an analysis on the ''ilm al-hiyal'' (science of ingenious devices) and makes the first successful attempt to classify simple [[machine]]s and their combinations. He first describes and [[illustration|illustrates]] the five constituent simple machines: the [[lever]], [[pulley]], [[screw]], [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]], and [[windlass]]. He then analyzes all the combinations of these simple machines, such as the windlass-screw, windlass-pulley and windlass-lever for example. He is also the first to describe a [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] which is essentially a combination of all of these simple machines (except for the wedge).&lt;ref&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I.

===Poetry===
Almost half of Ibn Sīnā's works are versified.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne|E.G. Browne]], ''Islamic Medicine'' (sometimes also printed under the title ''Arabian medicine''), 2002, Goodword Pub., ISBN 81-87570-19-9, p61&lt;/ref&gt; His poems appear in both Arabic and Persian. As an example, Edward Granville Browne claims that the following [[Persian language|Persian]] verses are incorrectly attributed to [[Omar Khayyám]], and were originally written by Ibn Sīnā:&lt;ref&gt;E.G.

[[George Sarton]], the author of ''The History of Science'', described Ibn Sīnā as &quot;one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history&quot;&lt;ref name=Zahoor/&gt; and called him &quot;the most famous [[Islamic science|scientist of Islam]] and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times.&quot; He was one of the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]]'s leading writers in the field of medicine. He was influenced by the approach of [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]], as well as [[Sushruta]] and [[Charaka]]. Along with [[al-Razi|Rhazes]], [[Abu al-Qasim|Abulcasis]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]], and [[al-Ibadi]], Ibn Sīnā is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in Western [[history of medicine]] as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European [[Renaissance]]. Ibn Sīnā is also considered the father of the fundamental concept of [[momentum]] in [[physics]].&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;[[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], &quot;Islamic Conception Of Intellectual Life&quot;, in Philip P. Wiener (ed.), ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 2, p. 65, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1973-1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], he is considered a national icon, and is often regarded as one of the greatest Persians to have ever lived. Many portraits and statues remain in Iran today. An impressive monument to the life and works of the man who is known as the 'doctor of doctors' still stands outside the Bukhara museum and his portrait hangs in the Hall of the Avicenna Faculty of Medicine in the [[University of Paris]]. There is also a crater on the Moon named [[Avicenna (crater)|Avicenna]]. [[Bu-Ali Sina University]] in [[Hamadan]] (Iran), the ''ibn Sīnā'' Tajik State Medical University in [[Dushanbe]] (The capital of the [[Republic of Tajikistan]]), [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences]] at [[Aligarh]], [[India]], [[Avicenna School]] in [[Karachi]] and [[Avicenna Medical College]] in [[Lahore]]&lt;ref&gt;www.amch.edu.pk&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]], Ibne Sina Balkh Medical School in his native province of [[Balkh]] in [[Afghanistan]], Ibni Sina Faculty Of Medicine of Ankara University [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]  and Ibn Sina Integrated School in Marawi City (Philippines) are all named in his honour.
In 1980, the former [[Soviet Union]], which then ruled his birthplace Bukhara, celebrated the thousandth anniversary of Avicenna's birth by circulating various [[commemorative stamp]]s with artistic illustrations, and by erecting a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Avicenna based on [[anthropological]] research by Soviet scholars.&lt;ref name=Aydin&gt;Professor Dr. İbrahim Hakkı Aydin (2001), &quot;Avicenna And Modern Neurological Sciences&quot;, ''Journal of Academic Researches in Religious Sciences'' '''1''' (2): 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Near his birthplace in Qishlak Afshona, some {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}}. north of Bukhara, a training college for medical staff has been named for him. On the grounds is a museum dedicated to his life, times and work. {{OnGoogleEarth|39.994359N64.382253E}}

In March 2008, it was announced&lt;ref&gt;Educating health professionals: the Avicenna project  ''The Lancet'', Volume 371 pp 966 – 967&lt;/ref&gt; that Avicenna’s name would be used for new Directories of education institutions for health care professionals, worldwide. The [[Avicenna Directories]] will list universities and schools where doctors, public health practitioners, pharmacists and others, are educated. The project team stated “Why Avicenna? Avicenna ... was ... noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west. He has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences. The use of Avicenna’s name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality.”

==Works==
The treatises of Ibn Sīnā influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including [[theology]], [[philology]], [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], and [[music]]. Ibn Sīnā's works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna&quot; /&gt; His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', a vast philosophical and scientific encyclopaedia, and ''The Canon of Medicine'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;

Ibn Sīnā wrote at least one treatise on [[alchemy]], but several others have been falsely attributed to him. His book on animals was translated by [[Michael Scot]]. His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine, though the Metaphysics demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of Neoplatonism known as Aristotelianism in Ibn Sīnā's world; Arabic philosophers have hinted at the idea that Ibn Sīnā was attempting to &quot;re-Aristotelianise&quot; Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.

The ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Two encyclopaedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio''). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a '''حكمت مشرقيه''' (''hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya'', in Latin ''Philosophia Orientalis''), mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], the majority of which is lost in antiquity, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.

In the 13th century, [[Ibn al-Nafis]] wrote his own novel ''Fadil ibn Natiq'', known as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' in the West, as a critical response to ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan''.&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A. G.

===Persian Works===
====Danishnama-i ‘Alai====
Danishnama-i ‘Alai is called &quot;the Book of Knowledge for [Prince] 'Ala ad-Daulah&quot;. One of Avicenna's important [[Persian language|Persian]] work is the Daaneshnaame (literally: the book of knowledge) for Prince 'Ala ad-Daulah (the local [[Buyid]] ruler). The linguist aspects of the Dāneš-nāma and the originality of their Persian vocabulary are of great interest to Iranian philologists. Avicenna created new scientific vocabulary that had not existed before in the modern Persian language. The Dāneš-nāma covers such topics as logic, metaphysics, music theory and other sciences of his time.  This book has translated to English by Parwiz Mowewedge.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, Danish Nama-i 'Alai.  trans. Parviz Morewedge as ''The Metaphysics of Avicenna'' (New York: Columbia University Pres), 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Andar Danesh-e-Rag====
Andar Danesh-e-Rag is called &quot;On the science of the pulse&quot;. This book contains nine chapters on the science of the pulse and is condensed synonpsis.

====Persian Poetry====
Persian poetry from Ibn Sina is recorded in various manuscripts and later anthologies such as [[Nozhat al-Majales]].

'''The Ashes'''                         is a [[Test cricket]] series played between [[England cricket team|England]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. It is one of the most celebrated [[sports rivalry|rivalries]] in international cricket and dates back to 1882. It is currently played biennially, alternately in the United Kingdom and Australia. Cricket being a summer sport, and the venues being in opposite hemispheres, the break between series alternates between 18 and 30 months. A series of &quot;The Ashes&quot; comprises five Test matches, two innings per match, under the regular rules for [[Test match cricket]]. If a series is drawn then the country already holding the Ashes retains them.

The series is named after a [[satire|satirical]] [[obituary]] published in a British newspaper, ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', in 1882 after a match at [[The Oval]] in which Australia beat England on an English ground for the first time. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and ''the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis (Australian Writer) | Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | page=75 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=9781741104929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English media dubbed the next English tour to Australia (1882–83) as ''the quest to regain The Ashes''.

During that tour a small [[terracotta]] urn was presented to [[English national cricket captains|England captain]] [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] by a group of Melbourne women. The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of an item of cricket equipment, a [[bail (cricket)|bail]].

The urn is erroneously believed by some to be the [[trophy]] of the Ashes series, but it has never been formally adopted as such and Bligh always considered it to be a personal gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Ashes History|url=http://www.lords.org/history/the-ashes/ |publisher=Lords: The home of cricket}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Replica]]s of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an Ashes series, but the actual urn has never been presented or displayed as a trophy in this way. Whichever side holds the Ashes, the urn normally remains in the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] Museum at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] since being presented to the MCC by Bligh's widow upon his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6052544.stm | title=Ashes urn heads to Australia | publisher=BBC Sport | date=15 October 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}} In 2006–07 the urn was taken to Australia and exhibited at each of the [[test cricket|Test match]] grounds to coincide with the England tour.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1998–99 Ashes series, a [[Waterford Crystal]] representation of the Ashes urn has been presented to the winners of an Ashes series as the official trophy of that series.

England is the current holder after winning the Ashes in 2009 and again in the 2010/11 series in Australia.

==Legend==
The first [[Test cricket|Test match]] between England and Australia was played in 1877, though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882.

On their tour that year (1882) the Australians played just one Test, at The Oval in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult [[Cricket pitch|wicket]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Spofforth, however, contended that, the fourth innings aside, it played perfectly well.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia made a mere 63 runs in its first [[innings]], and England, led by [[A. N. Hornby]], took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In their second innings, the Australians, boosted by a spectacular run-a-minute 55 from [[Hugh Massie]], managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win.

The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler [[Fred Spofforth]], spurred on by some [[gamesmanship]] by his opponents, refused to give in. &quot;This thing can be done,&quot; he declared. Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory in one of the closest and most nail-biting finishes in the history of cricket.

When [[Ted Peate]], England's last batsman, came to the crease, his side needed just ten runs to win, but Peate managed only two before he was bowled by [[Harry Boyle]]. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony. When it finally sank in, the crowd swarmed onto the field, cheering loudly and chairing Boyle and Spofforth to the pavilion.

When Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner, [[Charles Studd]] (one of the best batsman in England, having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists) to get the runs. Peate humorously replied, &quot;I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The momentous defeat was widely recorded in the British press, which praised the Australians for their plentiful &quot;pluck&quot; and berated the Englishmen for their lack thereof. A celebrated poem appeared in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' on Saturday, 9 September. The first verse, quoted most frequently, reads:

&lt;center&gt;
:''Well done, Cornstalks! Whipt us''
:''Fair and square,''
:''Was it luck that tript us?''
:''Was it scare?''
:''Kangaroo Land's 'Demon'''&lt;ref&gt;Spofforth's nickname.&lt;/ref&gt;'', or our own''
:''Want of 'devil', coolness, nerve, backbone?''
&lt;/center&gt;

On 31 August, in the great [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]]-edited magazine ''Cricket: A Weekly Record of The Game'', there appeared a mock obituary:

&lt;center&gt;
:''SACRED TO THE MEMORY''
:''OF''
:''ENGLAND'S SUPREMACY IN THE''
:''CRICKET-FIELD''
:''WHICH EXPIRED''
:''ON THE 29TH DAY OF AUGUST, AT THE OVAL''

:''&quot;ITS END WAS PEATE&quot;''
&lt;/center&gt;

On 2 September a more celebrated mock obituary, written by [[Reginald Brooks]] under the pseudonym &quot;Bloobs&quot;, appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]''. It read:

&lt;center&gt;
:''In Affectionate Remembrance''
:''of''
:''ENGLISH CRICKET,''
:''which died at the Oval''
:''on''
:''29th&amp;nbsp;AUGUST 1882,''
:''Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing''
:''friends and acquaintances''

:''R.I.P.''

:''N.B.—The body will be cremated and the''
:''ashes taken to Australia.''
&lt;/center&gt;
[[Image:DeathofEnglishCricket.jpg|250px|thumb|The death notice that appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]'']]
[[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Bligh]] promised that on the tour to Australia in 1882–83, which he was to captain, he would regain &quot;the ashes&quot;. He spoke of them several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.

In the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term &quot;The Ashes&quot; largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series, at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when [[George Giffen]], in his memoirs (''With Bat and Ball'', 1899), used the term as if it were well known.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, A., ''Cricket Captains of England'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]] took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain &quot;the ashes&quot;. As had been the case on Bligh's tour 20 years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term, and, this time it stuck. Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled ''How We Recovered The Ashes''. Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend. The first mention of &quot;The Ashes&quot; in [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] occurs in 1905, while ''Wisden'''s first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition.

==Urn==
As it took many years for the name ''&quot;The Ashes&quot;'' to be given to the ongoing series between England and Australia, there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners. As late as 1925 the following verse appeared in ''The Cricketers Annual'':

:''So here's to Chapman, Hendren and Hobbs,
:''Gilligan, Woolley and Hearne:''
:''May they bring back to the Motherland,''
:''The ashes which have no urn!''

Nevertheless, several attempts had been made to embody The Ashes in a physical memorial. Examples include one presented to Warner in 1904, another to Australian Captain M.A. Noble in 1909, and another to Australian Captain W.M. Woodfull in 1934.

The oldest, and the one to enjoy enduring fame, was the one presented to Bligh, later Lord Darnley, during the 1882–83 tour. The precise nature of the origin of this urn is matter of dispute. Based on a statement by Darnley made in 1894, it was believed that a group of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n ladies, including Darnley's later wife Florence Morphy, made the presentation after the victory in the Third Test in 1883. More recent researchers, in particular Ronald Willis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Ronald | last=Willis | title=Cricket's biggest Mystery: The Ashes | isbn=0-7270-1768-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joy Munns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Joy | last=Munns | title=Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The birthplace of the Ashes | isbn=0-646-22153-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over Christmas 1882 when the English team were guests of [[Sir William John Clarke|Sir William Clarke]], at his property &quot;[[Rupertswood]]&quot;, in [[Sunbury, Victoria]]. This was before the matches had started. The prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of Clarke.

The contents of the Darnley urn are also problematic; they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump, bail or the outer casing of a ball, but in 1998 Darnley's 82-year-old daughter-in-law said they were the remains of her mother-in-law's veil, casting a further layer of doubt on the matter. However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now &quot;95% certain&quot; that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail. Speaking on Channel Nine TV on 25 November 2006, he said x-rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked, and repair work had to be carried out. The urn is made of [[terracotta]] and is about six&amp;nbsp;inches (150&amp;nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) tall and may originally have been a perfume jar.

[[Image:Ashes song.jpg|thumb|left|The full version of the song from ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', the fourth verse of which is pasted onto the urn]]
A label containing a six line verse is pasted on the urn. This is the fourth verse of a song-lyric published in Melbourne Punch on 1 February 1883:

:''When [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo]] goes back with the urn, the urn;''
:''[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A G Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;''
:''The [[wikt:make the welkin ring|welkin]] will ring loud,''
:''The great crowd will feel proud,''
:''Seeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;''
:''And the rest coming home with the urn.''

In February 1883, just before the disputed Fourth Test, a velvet bag made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of [[Dublin]], was given to Bligh to contain the urn.

During Darnley’s lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn, and no record of a published photograph exists before 1924. However, when Darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes. MCC first displayed the urn in the Long Room at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] and since 1953 in the MCC Cricket Museum at the ground. MCC’s wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy.

It is in fact a private memento, and for this reason it is never awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match.

Because the urn itself is so delicate, it has been allowed to travel to Australia only twice. The first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations; the second was for the 2006/7 Ashes series. The urn arrived on 17 October 2006, going on display at the [[Museum of Sydney]]. It then toured to other states, with the final appearance at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery on 21 January 2007.

In the 1990s, given Australia's long dominance of the Ashes and the popular acceptance of the Darnley urn as ‘The Ashes’, the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC were reluctant to agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the [[Earl of Darnley|Earldom of Darnley]], argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.

As a compromise, the MCC commissioned a trophy in the form of a larger replica of the urn in Waterford Crystal to award to the winning team of each series from 1998–99. This did little to diminish the status of the Darnley urn as the most important icon in cricket, the symbol of this old and keenly fought contest.

===Quest to &quot;recover those ashes&quot;===
{{See also|History of Test cricket (to 1883)#The Ashes legend|l1=History of Test cricket (to 1883): The Ashes legend}}

Later in 1882, following the famous Australian victory at The Oval, [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Bligh]] led an England team to Australia, as he said, to &quot;recover those ashes&quot;. Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by [[Result (cricket)|nine wickets]], but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have &quot;won back the Ashes&quot; 2–1. A fourth match was played, against a &quot;United Australian XI&quot;, which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 1882–83 series. It ''is'' counted as a Test, but as a standalone.

===1884 to 1896===
After Bligh's victory, there was an extended period of English dominance. The tours generally had fewer Tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, the first five-Test series taking place only in 1894–95. England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.

There was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 1887–88, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking their first series win since 1882 with a 2–1 victory in 1891–92. But England dominated, winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes.

The [[English cricket team in Australia in 1894-95|1894–95]] series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on. Australia had scored a massive 586 ([[Syd Gregory]] 201, [[George Giffen]] 161) and then dismissed England for 325. But England responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed Australia for 166 with [[Bobby Peel]] taking 6 for 67. At the close of the second last day's play, Australia were 113–2, needing only 64 more runs. But heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left-arm bowlers, Peel and [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], were all but unplayable. England went on to win the series 3–2 after it had been all square before the Final Test, which England won by 6 wickets. The English heroes were Peel, with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70, and [[Tom Richardson]], with 32 at 26.53.

In 1896 England under the captaincy of [[W G Grace]] won the series 2–1, and this marked the end of England's longest period of Ashes dominance.

===1897 to 1902===
Australia resoundingly won the 1897–98 series by 4–1 under the captaincy of [[Harry Trott]]. His successor [[Joe Darling]] won the next three series in 1899, 1901–02 and the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|classic 1902 series]], which became one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket.

Five matches were played in 1902 but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather. In the First Test (the first played at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]), after scoring 376 England bowled out Australia for 36 ([[Wilfred Rhodes]] 7/17) and reduced them to 46–2 when they followed on. Australia won the Third and Fourth Tests at [[Bramall Lane]] and [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] respectively. At Old Trafford, Australia won by just 3 runs after [[Victor Trumper]] had scored 104 on a &quot;bad wicket&quot;, reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day. England won the last Test at [[The Oval]] by one wicket. Chasing 263 to win, they slumped to 48–5 before [[Gilbert Jessop|Jessop's]] 104 gave them a chance. He reached his hundred in just 75 minutes. The last wicket pair of [[George Herbert Hirst|George Hirst]] and Rhodes were left with 15 runs to get, and duly got them. When Rhodes joined him, Hirst is famously supposed to have said: &quot;We'll get them in singles, Wilfred.&quot; The story is [[apocrypha]]l and they are believed to have scored at least one two among the singles.

The period of Darling's captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding Australian players such as Trumper, [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[James Kelly (cricketer)|James Kelly]], [[Monty Noble]], [[Clem Hill]], [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[Ernie Jones]].

===Reviving the legend===
After what the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided not to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903–04. England won it against the odds, and [[Plum Warner]], the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book ''How We Recovered The Ashes''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plum Warner]], ''How We Recovered The Ashes'', Longman, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The title of this book revived the Ashes legend and it was after this that England v Australia series were customarily referred to as &quot;The Ashes&quot;.

===1905 to 1912===
[[Image:AustralianCricketTeam1911.jpg|right|thumb|The Australian team from the 1911-12 tour.]]
England and Australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Five more series took place between 1905 and 1912. In 1905 England's captain [[Stanley Jackson]] not only won the series 2–0, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Monty Noble led Australia to victory in both 1907–08 and 1909. Then England won in 1911–12 by four matches to one. [[Jack Hobbs]] establishing himself as England's first-choice opening batsman with three centuries, while [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] (32 wickets at 21.62) and [[Sydney Barnes]] (34 wickets at 22.88) formed a formidable bowling partnership.

England retained the Ashes when they won the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], which also featured [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The Australian touring party had been severely weakened by a [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|dispute]] between the board and players that caused [[Clem Hill]], [[Victor Trumper]], Warwick Armstrong, [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Sammy Carter]] and [[Vernon Ransford]] to be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 251–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920 to 1933===
After the war, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. For the first time, the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]] crippled the English batting on a regular basis. Australia recorded overwhelming victories both in England and on home soil. They won the first eight matches in succession including a 5–0 [[whitewash (sport)|whitewash]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920-21|1920–1921]] at the hands of Warwick Armstrong's team.

The ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.

[[Image:Herbert Sutcliffe 1924.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Herbert Sutcliffe]] sweeps [[Arthur Mailey]] during the first Ashes Test in Sydney, 1924.]]
England won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 274–276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru – Australia – Tests – Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rain-hit series in 1926, England managed to eke out a 1–0 victory with a win in the final Test at The Oval. Because the series was at stake, the match was to be &quot;timeless&quot;, i.e., played to a finish. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22. Jack Hobbs and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] took the score to 49–0 at the end of the second day, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight, and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket. England seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match. In spite of the very difficult batting conditions, however, Hobbs and Sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and England won the game comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 298–301.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian captain [[Herbie Collins]] was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level, and some accused him of throwing the match.

Australia's aging post-war team broke up after 1926, with Collins, [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Warren Bardsley]] all departing, and Gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928–29 series.

Despite the debut of [[Donald Bradman]], the inexperienced Australians, led by [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], were heavily defeated, losing 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 312–316.&lt;/ref&gt; England had a very strong batting side, with [[Wally Hammond]] contributing 905 runs at an average of 113.12, and Hobbs, Sutcliffe and [[Patsy Hendren]] all scoring heavily; the bowling was more than adequate, without being outstanding.

In 1930, [[Bill Woodfull]] led an extremely inexperienced team to England.

Bradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 139.14, which remains a world record Test series aggregate. A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying &quot;I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Don Bradman on australianscreen online&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/1930-australian-xi-ashes/|title=Don Bradman in 'The 1930 Australian XI: Winners of the Ashes' on australianscreen online|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] Test, he made 334, reaching 309* at the end of the first day, including a century before lunch. Bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match, at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]], was a better innings. England managed to stay in contention until the deciding final Test at The Oval, but yet another double hundred by Bradman, and 7/92 by [[Percy Hornibrook]] in England's second innings, enabled Australia to win by an innings and take the series 2–1. [[Clarrie Grimmett]]'s 29 wickets at 31.89 for Australia in this high-scoring series were also important.

Australia had one of the strongest batting line-ups ever in the early 1930s, with Bradman, [[Archie Jackson]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Bill Woodfull]] and [[Bill Ponsford]]. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England's 1932–33 captain [[Douglas Jardine]] to adopt the tactic of fast [[leg theory]], also known as [[Bodyline]].

[[Image:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a ball from [[Harold Larwood]] with [[Bodyline]] field settings.]]

Jardine instructed his [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]], most notably [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked [[leg side|leg-side]] field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it &quot;leg theory&quot; but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it &quot;Bodyline&quot; (from &quot;on the line of the body&quot;). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4–1, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] eventually changed the [[Laws of cricket]] to curtail the number of leg side fielders.

Jardine's comment was: &quot;I've not travelled 6,000 miles to make friends. I'm here to win the Ashes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Top 50 British achievements | first=Patrick | last=Kidd | date=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Australians wanted to use Bodyline in retaliation, but Woodfull flatly refused. He famously told England manager [[Pelham Warner]], &quot;There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket; the other is making no attempt to do so&quot; after the latter had come into the Australian rooms to express sympathy for a Larwood bouncer had struck the Australian skipper in the heart and felled him.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster (1997). ''The A-Z of Australian cricketers'', pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934 to 1953===
On the batting-friendly [[cricket pitch|wickets]] that prevailed in the late 1930s, most Tests up to the Second World War still gave results. It should be borne in mind that Tests in Australia prior to the war were all played to a finish. Many batting records were set in this period.

The 1934 Ashes series began with the notable absence of Larwood, Voce and Jardine. The MCC had made it clear, in light of the revelations of the bodyline series, that these players would not face Australia. It should be noted that the MCC, although it had earlier condoned and encouraged {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} bodyline tactics in the 1932–33 series, laid the blame on Larwood when relations turned sour. Larwood was forced by the MCC to either apologise or be removed from the Test side. He went for the latter.

Australia recovered the Ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953, although no international cricket was possible during the Second World War.

As in 1930, the 1934 series was decided in the final Test at The Oval. Australia, batting first, posted a massive 701 in the first innings. Bradman (244) and Ponsford (266) were in record-breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket. England eventually faced a massive 707 run target for victory and failed, Australia winning the series 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt; This made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes and he retired upon his return to Australia.

In 1936–37 Bradman succeeded Woodfull as Australian captain. He started badly, losing the first two Tests heavily after Australia were caught on [[sticky wicket]]s. However, the Australians fought back and Bradman won his first series in charge 3–2.

The 1938 series was high-scoring affair with many high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1–1 result, Australia retaining the Ashes. After the first two matches ended in stalemate and the Third Test at Old Trafford never started due to rain. Australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low-scoring match at Headingley to retain the urn. In the timeless Fifth Test at The Oval, the highlight was [[Len Hutton]]'s then world record score of 364 as England made 903-7 declared. Bradman and [[Jack Fingleton]] injured themselves during Hutton's marathon effort, and with only nine men, Australia fell to defeat by an innings and 578 runs, the heaviest in Test history.

The Ashes resumed after the war when England toured in 1946–47, and as in 1920–21, found that Australia had made the best post-war recovery. Still captained by Bradman and now featuring the potent new ball partnership of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], Australia were convincing 3–0 winners.

Aged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to [[Jack Ikin]]; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain's favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era.

In 1948 Australia set new standards, completely outplaying their hosts to win 4–0 with one draw. This [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team]], led by Bradman, who turned 40 during his final tour of England, has gone down in history as ''The Invincibles''. Playing 34 matches on tour—three of which were not first-class—including the five Tests, they remained unbeaten, winning 27 and drawing only 7.

Bradman's men were greeted by packed crowds across the country, and records for Test attendances in England were set in the [[Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Second]] and [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Tests]] at Lord's and Headingley respectively; the crowd at Headingley remains a record, and it was there that Australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven-wicket victory.

The 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman played his final innings for Australia in the [[Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fifth Test]] at The Oval, needing to score only four runs to end with a career [[batting average]] of exactly 100. However, Bradman made a second ball duck, bowled by a [[Eric Hollies]] googly that sent him into retirement with a career average of 99.94.

Bradman was succeeded as Australian captain by [[Lindsay Hassett]], who led the team to 4–1 victory in 1950–51. The series was not as one-sided as the number of wins suggest, with several tight matches.

The tide finally turned in 1953 when England won the final Test at The Oval to take the series 1–0, having narrowly evaded defeat in the preceding Test at Headingley. This was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in English cricket history with players such as captain Len Hutton, batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Peter May]], [[Tom Graveney]], [[Colin Cowdrey]], bowlers [[Fred Trueman]], [[Brian Statham]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Tony Lock]] and wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]].

===1954 to 1971===
[[Image:Peter May.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Peter May]] driving [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] on his way to a century at Sydney.]]
In [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|1954–55]], Australia's batsmen had no answer to the pace of [[Frank Tyson]] and Statham. After winning the First Test by an innings after being controversially sent in by Hutton, Australia lost its way and England took a hat-trick of victories to win the series 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 435–437.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dramatic series in 1956 saw a record that will probably never be beaten: off-spinner [[Jim Laker|Jim Laker's]] monumental effort at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take 19 out of 20 possible Australian wickets in the Fourth Test.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 444–446.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Australia's second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer, and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn Tests, in which half the playing time was washed out. Bradman rated the team that won the series 2–1 as England's best ever.

England's dominance was not to last. Australia won 4–0 in 1958–59, having found a high-quality spinner of their own in new skipper [[Richie Benaud]], who took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, and paceman [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]], who took 24 wickets at 19.00. The series was overshadowed by the furore over various Australian bowlers, most notably [[Ian Meckiff]], whom the English management and media accused of [[throwing (cricket)|illegally throwing]] Australia to victory.

Australia consolidated their status as the leading team in world cricket with a hard-fought 2–1 away series. After narrowly winning the Second Test at Lord's, dubbed &quot;The Battle of the Ridge&quot; because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series after a heavy collapse during the English runchase.

The tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962–63, 1964, 1965–66 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing. Of the 20 Tests played during the four series, Australia won four and England three. As they held the Ashes, Australian captains [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] and [[Bill Lawry]] were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. During this period, spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased, but Simpson and Lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction.

It was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. West Indies defeated England twice in the mid-1960s and South Africa, in two series before they were banned for [[apartheid]], completely outplayed Australia 3–1 and 4–0. Australia had lost 2–1 during a tour of the West Indies in 1964–65, the first time they had lost a series to any team other than England.

In 1970–71, [[Ray Illingworth]] led England to a 2–0 win in Australia, mainly due to [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]]'s fast bowling, and the prolific batting of [[Geoffrey Boycott]] and [[John Edrich]]. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 526–530.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972 to 1987===
The 1972 series finished 2–2, with England under Illingworth retaining the Ashes.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 538–540.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1974–75 series, with the England team breaking up and their best batsman Geoff Boycott refusing to play, Australian pace bowlers [[Jeff Thomson]] and [[Dennis Lillee]] wreaked havoc. A 4–1 result was a fair reflection as England were left shell shocked.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 557–559.&lt;/ref&gt; England then lost the 1975 series 0–1, but at least restored some pride under new captain [[Tony Greig]].&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 561–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia won the 1977 Centenary Test&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 580–581.&lt;/ref&gt; which was not an Ashes contest, but then a storm broke as [[Kerry Packer]] announced his intention to form [[World Series Cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 579–590&lt;/ref&gt; WSC affected all Test playing nations but it weakened Australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with Packer; the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would not select WSC-contracted players and an almost completely new Test team had to be formed. WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view. The West Indies would go on to record resounding Test series wins over Australia and England and dominated world cricket until the 1990s.

With Greig having joined WSC, England appointed [[Mike Brearley]] as their captain and he enjoyed great success against Australia. Largely assisted by the return of Boycott, Brearley's men won the 1977 series 3–0 and then completed an overwhelming 5–1 series win against an Australian side missing its WSC players in 1978–79. [[Allan Border]] made his Test debut for Australia in 1978–79.

Brearley retired from Test cricket in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Ian Botham]], who started the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1981|1981 series]] as England captain, by which time the WSC split had ended. After Australia took a 1–0 lead in the first two Tests, Botham was forced to resign or was sacked (depending on the source). Brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the Third Test at Headingley. This was a remarkable match in which Australia looked certain to take a 2–0 series lead after they had forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. England, despite being 135 for 7, produced a second innings total of 356, Botham scoring 149*. Chasing just 130, Australia were sensationally dismissed for 111, [[Bob Willis]] taking 8–43. It was the first time since 1894–95 that a team following on had won a Test match. Under Brearley's leadership, England went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at The Oval.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 627–628.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982–83 Australia had [[Greg Chappell]] back from WSC as captain, while the England team was weakened by the enforced omission of their [[South African rebel tours|South African tour rebels]], particularly [[Graham Gooch]] and [[John Emburey]]. Australia went 2–0 up after three Tests, but England won the Fourth Test by 3 runs (after a 70-run last wicket stand) to set up the final decider, which was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 636–637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[David Gower]]'s England team was strengthened by the return of Gooch and Emburey as well as the emergence at international level of [[Tim Robinson]] and [[Mike Gatting]]. Australia, now captained by [[Allan Border]], had themselves been weakened by a rebel South African tour, the loss of [[Terry Alderman]] being a particular factor. England won 3–1.

Despite suffering heavy defeats against the West Indies during the 1980s, England continued to do well in the Ashes. Mike Gatting was the captain in 1986–87 but his team started badly and attracted some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/268042.html | title=Can't bat, can't bowl, can't field | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | last=Miller | first=Andrew | coauthors=Martin Williamson | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Chris Broad]] scored three hundreds in successive Tests and bowling successes from [[Graham Dilley]] and [[Gladstone Small]] meant England won the series 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 662–664.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989 to 2003===
[[Image:MCG99.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] Boxing Day Test 1998.]]
The Australian team of 1989 was comparable to the great Australian teams of the past, and resoundingly defeated England 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 679–682.&lt;/ref&gt; Well led by [[Allan Border]], the team included the young cricketers [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Merv Hughes]], [[David Boon]], [[Ian Healy]] and [[Steve Waugh]], who were all to prove long-serving and successful Ashes competitors. England, now led once again by [[David Gower]], suffered from injuries and poor form. During the Fourth Test news broke that prominent England players had agreed to take part in a &quot;rebel tour&quot; of South Africa the following winter; three of them (Tim Robinson, [[Neil Foster]] and [[John Emburey]]) were playing in the match, and were subsequently dropped from the England side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/139086.html|title=Rebels take a step too far (English rebel tour to South Africa, 1989)|first=Nick|last=Hoult|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|month=July | year=2004|accessdate=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia reached a cricketing peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, coupled with a general decline in England's fortunes. After re-establishing its credibility in 1989, Australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990–91, 1993, 1994–95, 1997, 1998–99, 2001 and 2002–03 series, all by convincing margins.

Great Australian players in the early years included batsmen Border, Boon, Taylor and Steve Waugh. The captaincy passed from Border to Taylor in the mid-1990s and then to Steve Waugh before the 2001 series. In the latter part of the 1990s Waugh himself, along with his twin brother [[Mark Waugh|Mark]], scored heavily for Australia and fast bowlers [[Glenn McGrath]] and [[Jason Gillespie]] made a serious impact, especially the former. The wicketkeeper-batsman position was held by [[Ian Healy]] for most of the 1990s and by [[Adam Gilchrist]] from 2001 to 2006–07. In the 2000s, batsmen [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] became noted players for Australia. But the most dominant Australian player was leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]], whose first delivery in Ashes cricket in 1993, to dismiss Mike Gatting, became known as the [[Ball of the century]].

Australia's record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 wins for Australia to England's 86, 74 having been drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+1989;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team Cricinfo statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2005 series Australia's wins had increased to 115 whereas England's had increased to only 93 (with 82 draws).&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+2005;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team Cricinfo statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times; Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws. Only a single England victory had come in a match in which the Ashes were still at stake, namely the First Test of the 1997 series. All others were consolation victories when the Ashes had been secured by Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=ENG;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2005-03-29;end=2005-03-29;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=series;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype Statistics obtained from Cricinfo at]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 to present===
[[Image:Trent Bridge, Flintoff century, 26 Aug 2005.jpg|left|thumb|[[Andrew Flintoff|Flintoff]] reaches 100 at [[Trent Bridge]].]]
England began to recover in the early 2000s and were undefeated in Test matches through the 2004 calendar year. This elevated them to second in the [[ICC Test Championship]]. Hopes that the [[2005 Ashes series]] would be closely fought proved well-founded, as the series was more competitive than anyone had predicted and was still undecided as the closing session of the final Test began. Experienced journalists including Richie Benaud rated the series as the most exciting in living memory. It has been compared with the great series of the distant past, such as 1894–95 and 1902.

The First Test at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] was convincingly won by Australia, but in the remaining four matches the teams were evenly matched and England fought back to win the Second Test by 2 runs, the smallest victory by a runs margin in Ashes history, and the second-closest such victory in all Tests. The rain-affected Third Test ended with the last two Australian batsmen holding out for a draw and England won the Fourth Test by three wickets after forcing Australia to [[follow-on]] for the first time in 191 Tests. A draw in the final Test gave England victory in an Ashes series for the first time in 18 years and their first Ashes victory at home since 1985.

With several England players having retired or been injured after the 2005 series, Australia regained The Ashes in the [[2006-07 Ashes series|2006–07 series]] with a convincing 5–0 victory, the second time an Ashes series has been won by that margin. [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Shane Warne]] and [[Justin Langer]] retired from Test cricket after that series, while [[Damien Martyn]] retired during the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6513.html|title=Damien Martyn|publisher=cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashes 2010-11 Sydney Test final wicket.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Chris Tremlett]] bowls [[Michael Beer]] to complete England's 3-1 Ashes victory on 7 January 2011]]

The [[2009 Ashes series|2009 series]] began with a tense draw in the First Test at [[SWALEC Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], with final pair [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Monty Panesar]] surviving 69 balls. England then achieved their first Ashes win at Lord's since 1934 to go 1–0 up. After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, the fourth match at Headingley was convincingly won by Australia by an innings and 80 runs to level the series. Finally, England won the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] by a margin of 197 runs to regain the Ashes. [[Andrew Flintoff]] retired from Test cricket soon afterwards.

The [[2010–11 Ashes series|2010-11 series]] was held in Australia. The First Test at Brisbane ended in a draw, but England won the Second Test, at Adelaide, by an innings and 71 runs. Australia came back with a victory at Perth in the Third Test. In the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, England batting second scored 513 to defeat Australia (98 &amp; 258) by an innings and 157 runs.  This allowed England to take an unbeatable 2–1 lead in the series and so they retained The Ashes. [[Jonathan Trott]] (England) scored 168 not out while [[Peter Siddle]] (Australia) took 6–75. England went on to win the series 3–1, beating Australia by an innings and 83 runs at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia, captained by Michael Clarke, batted first on a cloudy day after winning the toss and were bowled out for 280. England made 644, their highest innings total since 1938.  [[Alastair Cook]] scored 189 and both [[Ian Bell]] and [[Matt Prior]] made centuries.  England bowled Australia out again for 281 and so won a series on Australian soil for the first time in 24 years. The 2010-11 Ashes series is the only one in which a team has won three Tests by innings margins and it was the first time England had scored 500 or more four times in a single series.

==Summary of results and statistics==

:''See also: [[List of Ashes series]] for a full listing of all the Ashes series since 1882.''
{{Ashes summary}}
{{Ashes timeline}}
A team must win a series to gain the right to hold the Ashes. A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes. Sixty-six series have been played, with Australia winning 31 and England 30. The remaining five series were drawn, with Australia retaining the Ashes four times (1938, 1962–63, 1965–66, 1968) and England retaining it once (1972). The win-loss ratio in Ashes Tests&lt;ref&gt;Australia and England have played an additional 16 Tests but the Ashes were not at stake in those games. Including these Tests, the win-loss record stands at 133 Australian wins, 102 English wins, and 91 draws (up to and including the 2011 series). See [http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;team=2;template=results;type=team Cricinfo statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; (up to and including the 2011 series) stands at 123 wins for Australia to 100 wins for England, with 87 draws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team Cricinfo statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four-match series (1938; 1975) and six-match series (1970–71; 1974–75; 1978–79; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997). Australians have made 264 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] in Ashes Tests, 23 of them over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which 10 have been over 200. On 41 occasions Australians have taken 10 [[wicket]]s in a match, Englishmen 38 times.

==Match venues==
The series alternates between the United Kingdom and Australia, and within each country each of the usually five matches is held at a different [[List of Test cricket grounds|cricket ground]].

In '''Australia''', the grounds currently used are [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|&quot;The Gabba&quot;]] in Brisbane (first staged an England–Australia Test in the 1932–33 season), [[Adelaide Oval]] (1884–85), [[WACA Ground|The WACA, Perth]] (1970–71) the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) (1876–77) and the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] (SCG) (1881–82). A single Test was held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] in 1928–29. Traditionally, Melbourne hosts the [[Boxing Day Test]] and Sydney hosts the New Year Test. Cricket Australia proposed that the 2010–11 series consist of six Tests, with the additional game to be played at [[Bellerive Oval]] in Hobart. The England Cricket Board declined and the series was played over five Tests.

In '''England''' the grounds used are [[The Oval]] (since 1880), [[County Ground, Old Trafford|Old Trafford]] (1884), [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] (1884), [[Trent Bridge]] (1899), [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] (1899) and [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] (1902). One Test was held at [[Bramall Lane|Bramall Lane, Sheffield]] in 1902. [[SWALEC Stadium|Sophia Gardens]] in [[Cardiff]] held the First Test in the 2009 Ashes series, the first time England had played a home Test in Wales. In the next series on English soil in 2013, Durham's [[Riverside Ground|Chester-Le-Street]] ground will host its first Ashes Test match.

==Cultural references==
The popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to other sports or games, and/or their followers, using the name &quot;Ashes&quot; for contests between England and Australia. The best-known and longest-running of these events is the [[rugby league]] rivalry between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] (see [[The Ashes (rugby league)|rugby league &quot;Ashes&quot;]]). Use of the name &quot;Ashes&quot; was suggested by the Australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in 1908. Another example is in the television show ''[[Gladiators (TV series)|Gladiators]]'', in which two series were based on contests between teams representing Australia and England. 

The Ashes featured in the film ''[[The Final Test]]'', released in 1953, based on a television play by [[Terence Rattigan]]. It stars [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] as an England cricketer playing the last Test of his career, which is the last of an Ashes series; the film contains cameo appearances from cricketers, including [[Jim Laker]] and [[Denis Compton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045769/|title=The Final Test (1953)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=16 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were part of England's 1953 triumph.

[[Douglas Adams]]'s 1982 science fiction comedy novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' – the third part of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy]]'' series – features the urn containing the Ashes, as a significant element of its plot. The urn is stolen by alien robots, as the burnt stump inside is part of a key needed to unlock the &quot;Wikkit Gate&quot; and release an imprisoned world called Krikkit.

''[[Bodyline (miniseries)|Bodyline]]'', a [[fiction]]alised television [[miniseries]] based on the &quot;[[Bodyline]]&quot; Ashes series of 1932–33, screened in Australia in 1984, to significant public interest and critical acclaim. The cast included [[Gary Sweet]], as [[Donald Bradman]] and [[Hugo Weaving]], as England captain [[Douglas Jardine]].

{{Wiktionary|Analysis|analysis}}
'''Analysis''' is the process of breaking a [[complexity|complex topic]] or substance into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] since before [[Aristotle]] (384–322 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]), though ''analysis'' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/ Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is a transcription of the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀνάλυσις (''analusis'', &quot;a breaking up&quot;, from ''ana-'' &quot;up, throughout&quot; and ''lysis'' &quot;a loosening&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=analysis Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hans Niels Jahangir, &quot;Analysis as an independent subject was created in the 17th century during the [[scientific revolution]]. Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Fermat, Huygens, Newton and Leibniz, to mention but a few important names, contributed to its genesis.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Niels Jahnke (2003). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CVRZEXFVsZkC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of analysis]''&quot;. AMS Bookstore. ISBN 0821826239&lt;/ref&gt; As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to [[Alhazen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] (''[[Discourse on the Method]]'') and [[Galileo Galilei]]. It has also been ascribed to [[Isaac Newton]], in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name or formally describe).

==Use in specific fields==
===Chemistry===
{{See also|Analytical chemistry|List of chemical analysis methods}}
The field of [[chemistry]] uses analysis in at least three ways: to identify the components of a particular [[chemical compound]] (qualitative analysis), to identify the proportions of components in a [[mixture]] (quantitative analysis), and to break down [[chemical process]]es and examine [[chemical reaction]]s between [[chemical element|elements]] of [[chemical matter|matter]]. For an example of its use, analysis of the concentration of elements is important in managing a [[nuclear reactor]], so [[nuclear scientist]]s will analyze [[neutron activation analysis|neutron activation]] to develop discrete measurements within vast samples. A [[matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] can have a considerable effect on the way a chemical analysis is conducted and the quality of its results. Analysis can be done manually or with a [[analyser|device]]. Chemical analysis is an important element of [[national security]] among the [[great power|major world powers]] with [[Materials MASINT|Materials]] [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence|Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT)]] capabilities.

====Isotopes====
{{See also|Isotope analysis|Isotope geochemistry}}
Chemists can use [[isotope]]s to assist analysts with issues in [[anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[food chemistry]], [[forensics]], [[geology]], and a host of other questions of [[physical science]]. Analysts can discern the origins of natural and man-made isotopes in the study of [[environmental radioactivity]].

* [[Principal components analysis]] – a technique that can be used to simplify a dataset

===Engineering===
{{See also|Engineering analysis|Systems analysis}}
Analysts in the field of [[engineering]] look at [[Requirement analysis|requirements]], [[structural analysis|structures]], mechanisms, [[systems analysis|systems]] and [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]]. [[Electrical engineering|Electrical engineers]] analyze [[system analysis|systems]] in [[electronics]]. [[Whole-life cost|Life cycles]] and [[Accident analysis|system failures]] are broken down and studied by engineers. It is also looking at different factors encorporated within the design.

===Intelligence===
{{See also|Intelligence analysis}}
The field of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] employs analysts to break down and understand a wide array of questions. [[Intelligence agency|Intelligence agencies]] may use [[heuristics]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]], [[social network analysis]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[Social network#Social network analysis|link analysis]], and [[brainstorming]] to sort through problems they face. [[Military intelligence]] may explore issues through the use of [[game theory]], [[Red Team]]ing, and [[military simulation|wargaming]]. [[Signals intelligence]] applies [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]] to break [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s. [[Business intelligence]] applies theories of [[competitive intelligence|competitive intelligence analysis]] and [[competitor analysis]] to resolve questions in the [[marketplace]]. [[Police|Law enforcement]] intelligence applies a number of theories in [[crime analysis]].

===Linguistics===
{{See also|Linguistics}}
Linguistics began with the analysis of [[Ashtadhyayi|Sanskrit]] and [[Tolkāppiyam|Tamil]]; today it looks at individual languages and [[language]] in general. It breaks language down and analyzes its component parts: [[theoretical linguistics|theory]], [[phonology|sounds and their meaning]], [[pragmatics|utterance usage]], [[morphology (linguistics)|word origins]], the [[etymology|history of words]], the meaning of [[lexical semantics|words]] and [[phraseology|word combinations]], [[syntax|sentence construction]], [[discourse analysis|basic construction beyond the sentence level]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], and [[conversation analysis|conversation]]. It examines the above using [[computational linguistics|statistics and modeling]], and [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantics]]. It analyzes language in context of [[anthropological linguistics|anthropology]], [[biolinguistics|biology]], [[evolutionary linguistics|evolution]], [[language geography|geography]], [[historical linguistics|history]], [[neurolinguistics|neurology]], [[psycholinguistics|psychology]], and [[sociolinguistics|sociology]]. It also takes the [[applied linguistics|applied]] approach, looking at [[developmental linguistics|individual language development]] and [[clinical linguistics|clinical]] issues.

===Literature===
[[Literary theory]] is the analysis of [[literature]]. Some say that [[literary criticism]] is a subset of literary theory. The focus can be as diverse as the analysis of [[analysis (Homer)|Homer]] or [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|Freud]]. This is mainly to do with the breaking up of a topic to make it easier to understand.

===Mathematics===
[[Mathematical analysis]] can be applied in the study of [[classical mathematics|classical]] concepts of mathematics, such as [[real analysis|real numbers]], [[complex analysis|complex variables]], [[Fourier analysis|trigonometric functions]], and [[numerical analysis|algorithms]], or of [[non-classical analysis|non-classical]] concepts like [[constructivist analysis|constructivism]], [[harmonic analysis|harmonics]], [[non-standard analysis|infinity]], and [[functional analysis|vectors]].

'''Abner Doubleday''' (June 26, 1819 &amp;ndash; January 26, 1893) was a career [[United States Army]] officer and [[Union Army|Union]] general in the [[American Civil War]]. He fired the first shot in defense of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], the opening battle of the war, and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Gettysburg was his finest hour, but his relief by [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]] caused lasting enmity between the two men.

In [[San Francisco]], after the war, he obtained a patent on the [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] railway that still runs there. In his final years in [[New Jersey]], he was a prominent member and later president of the [[Theosophical Society]]. 

Doubleday is often mistakenly credited with [[Origins_of_baseball#The_Abner_Doubleday_myth|having invented baseball]], although he never made such a claim, and there is no evidence to support [[Origins_of_baseball#The_Abner_Doubleday_myth|it]].&lt;ref name=Kirschxiiixiv&gt;Kirsch, pp. xiii-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Doubleday was born in [[Ballston Spa, New York]]. He was born in a small house on the corner of Washington and Fenwick Street. The family all slept in the attic loft of the one-room house. His Doubleday grandfather, also named Abner, had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. His maternal grandfather joined the Army at 14 and was a mounted messenger for [[George Washington]]. His father, [[Ulysses F. Doubleday]], fought in the [[War of 1812]], was a newspaper publisher, a book publisher, and represented [[Auburn, New York]], for four years in the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=Beckenbaugh&gt;Beckenbaugh, pp. 611-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Abner spent his childhood in Auburn and later was sent to [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] to live with his uncle and attend a private preparatory high school. Abner practiced as a surveyor and civil engineer for two years before entering the [[United States Military Academy]]&lt;ref name=Tagg&gt;Tagg, pp. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1838, from which he graduated in 1842, 24th in a class of 56 cadets, and was commissioned a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the 3rd U.S. Artillery.&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the persistent legends of baseball history is that Doubleday invented the game in 1839, although he was in West Point at the time.

==Military career==
===Early commands and Fort Sumter===
[[File:Fort Sumter Medal.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Fort Sumter]] Medal bearing the likeness of [[Robert Anderson (major)|Major Robert Anderson]], and presented to Abner Doubleday.]] 
Doubleday initially served in coastal garrisons and then in the [[Mexican-American War]] from 1846 to 1848 and the [[Seminole Wars]] from 1856 to 1858. In 1852 he married Mary Hewitt of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=TX&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/DD/fdo39.html Texas Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 he was transferred to [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, but by the start of the Civil War, he was a captain and second in command in the garrison at [[Fort Sumter]], under [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]].&lt;ref name=Beckenbaugh/&gt; He aimed the cannon that fired the first return shot in answer to the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] bombardment on April 12, 1861, starting the war. He subsequently referred to himself as the &quot;hero of Sumter&quot; for this role.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt;

===Brigade and division command in Virginia===
Doubleday was promoted to major on May 14, 1861, and commanded the Artillery Department in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] from June to August, and then the artillery for [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Nathaniel Banks]]'s division of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. He was appointed [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers on February 3, 1862, and was assigned to duty in northern Virginia while the Army of the Potomac conducted the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. His first combat assignment was to lead the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] of the [[Army of Virginia]] during the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. In the actions at Brawner's farm, just before the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], he took the initiative to send two of his regiments to reinforce Brig. Gen. [[John Gibbon]]'s brigade against a larger Confederate force, fighting it to a standstill. (Personal initiative was required since his division commander, Brig. Gen. [[Rufus King (Civil War General)|Rufus King]], was incapacitated by an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure at the time. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. [[John P. Hatch]].)&lt;ref&gt;Langellier, pp. 43, 45, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; His men were routed when they encountered Maj. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s corps, but by the following day, August 30, he took command of the division when Hatch was wounded, and he led his men to cover the retreat of the Union Army.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt;

Doubleday again led the division, now assigned to the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] of the Army of the Potomac, after [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]], where Hatch was wounded again. At [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], he led his men into the deadly fighting in the Cornfield and the West Woods, and one colonel described him as a &quot;gallant officer ... remarkably cool and at the very front of battle.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt; He was wounded when an artillery shell exploded near his horse, throwing him to the ground in a violent fall. He received a brevet promotion to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] for his actions at Antietam and was promoted in March 1863 to [[Major General#United States|major general]] of volunteers, to rank from November 29, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] in December 1862, his division mostly sat idle. During the winter, the I Corps was reorganized and Doubleday assumed command of the 3rd Division. At [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, the division was kept in reserve.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt;

===Gettysburg===
[[File:DoubledayBirthplace.jpg|thumb|Birthplace in Ballston Spa]]
[[File:Doubleday and wife (1).jpg|thumb|right|Doubleday and his wife, Mary.]]
At the start of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1, 1863, Doubleday's division was the second infantry division on the field to reinforce the cavalry division of Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]]. When his corps commander, Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]], was killed very early in the fighting, Doubleday found himself in command of the corps. His men fought well in the morning, putting up a stout resistance, but as overwhelming Confederate forces massed against them, their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] to the relative safety of [[Cemetery Hill]] south of town. It was Doubleday's finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000. Seven of those brigades incurred casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent, indicating the ferocity of the Union defense. But on Cemetery Hill, the I Corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle; it would be decommissioned in March 1864, its surviving units combined into other corps.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt;

On July 2, 1863 Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] replaced Doubleday with Maj. Gen. [[John Newton (engineer)|John Newton]], a more junior officer from another corps. The ostensible reason was a report by [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] commander Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]] that Doubleday's corps broke first, causing the entire Union line to collapse, but Meade also had a long history of disdain for Doubleday's combat effectiveness, dating back to South Mountain. Doubleday was humiliated by this snub and held a lasting grudge against Meade, but he returned to division command and fought well for the remainder of the battle.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt; He was wounded in the neck on the second day of Gettysburg and received a brevet promotion to colonel in the regular army for his service.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; He formally requested reinstatement as I Corps commander, but Meade refused, and Doubleday left Gettysburg on July 7 for Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, pp. 690-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubleday's indecision as a commander in the war resulted in his uncomplimentary nickname &quot;Forty-Eight Hours.&quot;&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt;

===Washington===
Doubleday assumed administrative duties in the defenses of [[Washington, D.C.]], where he was in charge of courts martial, which gave him legal experience that he used after the war. His only return to combat was directing a portion of the defenses against the attack by Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Jubal A. Early]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Also while in Washington, Doubleday testified against George Meade at the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], criticizing him harshly over his conduct of the Battle of Gettysburg.&lt;ref name=Beckenbaugh/&gt; While in Washington, Doubleday remained a loyal [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and staunch supporter of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Doubleday rode with Lincoln on the train to Gettysburg for the [[Gettysburg Address]] and Mr. and Mrs. Doubleday attended events with Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln in Washington.

==Postbellum career==
After the Civil War, Doubleday mustered out of the volunteer service on August 24, 1865, reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and became the colonel of the 35th U.S. Infantry in September 1867. He was stationed in [[San Francisco]] from 1869 through 1871 and he took out a patent for the [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] railway that still runs there, receiving a charter for its operation, but signing away his rights when he was reassigned. In 1871 he commanded the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th U.S. Infantry]], an all African-American regiment with headquarters at [[Fort McKavett]] [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=TX/&gt; He retired in 1873.

In the 1870s, he was listed in the New York business directory as lawyer.

==Theosophy==
In the summer of 1878 Doubleday lived in [[Mendham, New Jersey]], and became a prominent member of the [[Theosophical Society]]. When two of the founders of that society, [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], moved to India at the end of that year, he was constituted as the President of the American body. Another prominent member was [[Thomas A. Edison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/40-90-1/th-tsgom.htm Theosophy article]&lt;/ref&gt; Doubleday was active in veterans' reunions and in organizing the management of Gettysburg National Park.

Doubleday spent much of his time writing. Doubleday published two important works on the Civil War: ''Reminiscences of Forts Sumter and Moultrie'' (1876), and ''Chancellorsville and Gettysburg'' (1882), the latter being a volume of the series ''Campaigns of the Civil War''.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Doubleday's Tombstone.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Doubleday's tombstone at Arlington National Cemetery]]
Doubleday died of heart disease&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt; in Mendham, and is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt;

==Baseball==
{{Main|Origins of baseball#The Abner Doubleday myth|l1=Origins of baseball}}

Although Doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles, he is more widely remembered because of stories that he invented the game of baseball, supposedly in [[Elihu Phinney]]'s cow pasture in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839.

The [[Mills Commission]], chaired by [[Abraham G. Mills]], the fourth president of the [[National League]], was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee's final report, on December 30, 1907, stated, in part, that &quot;the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.&quot; It concluded by saying, &quot;in the years to come, in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball, and the millions who will be, Abner Doubleday's fame will rest evenly, if not quite as much, upon the fact that he was its inventor ... as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the Federal Army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, pp. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills commission as a &quot;myth.&quot; He wrote, &quot;Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.&quot; At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball, or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death, apparently because of mental illness, and he was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Kirschxiiixiv/&gt; Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Peter. &quot;But Didn't We Have Fun. Ivan R. Dee Publishing. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesakes and honors==
There is a monument to Doubleday at Gettysburg erected by his men, admirers, and the state of New York. There is a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} obelisk monument at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] where he is buried, located about {{convert|130|ft|m}} behind the Lee Mansion. There is a movement to petition the [[United States Postmaster General|postmaster general]] to issue a U.S. postage stamp for him in 2011, commemorating the 150th anniversary of Fort Sumter. [[Doubleday Field]] is a [[minor league baseball]] [[stadium]] named for Abner Doubleday, located in [[Cooperstown, New York]], near the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]. It hosted the annual [[Doubleday Field#halloffamegame|Hall of Fame Game]], an [[exhibition game]] between two [[Major League Baseball|major league]] teams that was played from 1940 until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-11-18-hall-of-fame-game_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Hall of Fame schedules replacement game for 2009 | date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Auburn Doubledays]] are a [[minor league baseball]] team based in Doubleday's hometown of [[Auburn, New York]].

Doubleday Field at West Point, New York, where the [[Army Black Knights]] play at [[Johnson Stadium at Doubleday Field|Johnson Stadium]], is named in Doubleday's honor.

The Abner Doubleday Little League and Babe Ruth Fields in Ballston Spa, New York, the town of his birth. The house of his birth still stands in the middle of town and there is a monument to him on Front Street. 

Doubleday's purported invention of baseball was such a widely accepted belief in the late 19th century, that the legend was recorded on a Civil War monument in Maryland in 1897. The [[Doubleday Hill Monument]], erected in [[Williamsport, Maryland]] to commemorate Doubleday's occupation of a hill there during the Civil War, claims he invented the game in 1835.

[[Image:Americasnationalgame.jpg|right|thumb]]'''''America's National Game''''' is a book by [[Albert Spalding]], published in [[1911 in literature|1911]] detailing the early history of the sport of [[baseball]]. Much of the story is told first-hand, since Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a player and later an administrator, since the 1850s. In addition to his personal recollections, he had access to the records of [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]], the game's first [[baseball statistics|statistician]] and archivist. Spalding was, however, known to aggrandise his role in the major moments in baseball's history.

{{Modulation techniques}}
'''Amplitude modulation''' ('''AM''') is a technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a [[radio]] [[carrier wave]]. AM works by varying the strength of the transmitted signal in relation to the information being sent. For example, changes in the signal strength can be used to specify the sounds to be reproduced by a [[loudspeaker]], or the light intensity of television pixels. (Contrast this with [[frequency modulation]], also commonly used for sound transmissions, in which the [[frequency]] is varied; and [[phase modulation]], often used in [[remote control]]s, in which the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is varied)

In the mid-1870s, a form of amplitude modulation&amp;mdash;initially called &quot;undulatory currents&quot;&amp;mdash;was the first method to successfully produce quality audio over telephone lines. Beginning with [[Reginald Fessenden]]'s audio demonstrations in 1906, it was also the original method used for audio radio transmissions, and remains in use today by many forms of communication&amp;mdash;&quot;AM&quot; is often used to refer to the [[mediumwave]] broadcast [[band (radio)|band]] (see [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]]).

[[Image:Amfm3-en-de.gif|thumb|right|250px|Fig 1: An audio signal (top) may be carried by an AM or [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio wave.]]

==Forms of amplitude modulation==

In radio communication, a [[continuous wave]] radio-frequency signal (a [[sinusoid]]al [[carrier wave]]) has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before being transmitted. 

In the [[frequency domain]], amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and in two adjacent [[sideband]]s. Each sideband is equal in [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to that of the modulating signal and is a mirror image of the other. Amplitude modulation that results in two sidebands and a carrier is often called ''double-sideband amplitude modulation'' (DSB-AM). Amplitude modulation is inefficient in terms of power usage. At least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal, which carries no useful information (beyond the fact that a signal is present).

To increase transmitter efficiency, the carrier can be removed (suppressed) from the AM signal.  This produces a [[reduced-carrier transmission]] or ''double-sideband suppressed-carrier'' (DSBSC) signal.  A suppressed-carrier amplitude modulation scheme is three times more power-efficient than traditional DSB-AM.  If the carrier is only partially suppressed, a ''double-sideband reduced-carrier'' (DSBRC) signal results.  DSBSC and DSBRC signals need their carrier to be regenerated (by a [[beat frequency oscillator]], for instance) to be demodulated using [[Envelope detector|conventional techniques]].

Improved bandwidth efficiency is achieved&amp;mdash;at the expense of increased transmitter and receiver complexity&amp;mdash;by completely suppressing both the carrier and one of the sidebands.  This is [[single-sideband modulation]], widely used in [[amateur radio]] due to its efficient use of both power and bandwidth.

A simple form of AM often used for [[digital]] communications is ''[[on-off keying]]'', a type of ''[[amplitude-shift keying]]'' by which [[Binary numeral system|binary]] data is represented as the presence or absence of a carrier wave.  This is commonly used at radio frequencies to transmit [[Morse code]], referred to as [[continuous wave]] (CW) operation.

===ITU designations===

In 1982, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) designated the various types of amplitude modulation as follows:

|}

==Example: double-sideband AM==
[[Image:AM spectrum.svg|thumb|400px|Fig 2: The (2-sided) spectrum of an AM signal.]]

A carrier wave is modeled as a simple sine wave, such as:

:&lt;math&gt;c(t) = C\cdot \sin(\omega_c t + \phi_c),\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the radio frequency (in [[Hertz|Hz]]) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_c / (2\pi).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The constants &lt;math&gt;C\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_c\,&lt;/math&gt; represent the carrier amplitude and initial phase, and are introduced for generality.  For simplicity however, their respective values can be set to 1 and 0.

Let ''m''(''t'') represent an arbitrary waveform that is the message to be transmitted. &amp;nbsp;And let the constant ''M'' represent its largest magnitude.  For instance:

:&lt;math&gt;m(t) = M\cdot \cos(\omega_m t + \phi).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the message might be just a simple audio tone of frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_m / (2\pi).\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is generally assumed that &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\omega_m \ll \omega_c\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and that &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\min[ m(t) ] = -M.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then amplitude modulation is created by forming the product:

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;y(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= [A + m(t)]\cdot c(t),\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= [A + M\cdot \cos(\omega_m t + \phi)]\cdot \sin(\omega_c t).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; represents the carrier amplitude which is a constant that we would choose to demonstrate the modulation index.  The values ''A''=1, and ''M''=0.5, produce a ''y''(''t'') depicted by the graph labelled &quot;50% Modulation&quot; in Figure 4.

For this simple example, ''y''(''t'') can be trigonometrically manipulated into the following equivalent form:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = A\cdot \sin(\omega_c t) + \begin{matrix}\frac{M}{2} \end{matrix} \left[\sin((\omega_c + \omega_m) t + \phi) + \sin((\omega_c - \omega_m) t - \phi)\right].\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the modulated signal has three components, a carrier wave and two sinusoidal waves (known as [[sideband]]s) whose frequencies are slightly above and below &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\omega_c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Also notice that the choice A=0 eliminates the carrier component, but leaves the sidebands.  That is the DSBSC transmission mode.  To generate double-sideband full carrier (A3E), we must choose:

&lt;math&gt;A \ge M.\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Spectrum===
For more general forms of ''m''(''t''), trigonometry is not sufficient.  But if the top trace of Figure 2 depicts the frequency spectrum, of ''m''(''t''), then the bottom trace depicts the modulated carrier.  It has two groups of components: one at positive [[frequency|frequencies]] (centered on &lt;math&gt;+\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;) and one at [[negative frequency|negative frequencies]] (centered on &lt;math&gt;-\omega_c&lt;/math&gt;).  Each group contains the two sidebands and a narrow component in between that represents the energy at the carrier frequency.  We need only be concerned with the positive frequencies.  The negative ones are a mathematical artifact that contains no additional information.  Therefore, we see that an AM signal's spectrum consists basically of its original (2-sided) spectrum shifted up to the carrier frequency.

Figure 2 is a result of computing the [[Fourier transform]] of: &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;[A + m(t)]\cdot \sin(\omega_c t),\,&lt;/math&gt; using the following transform pairs:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
                   m(t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp;\quad M(\omega) \\
       \sin(\omega_c t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp;\quad i \pi \cdot [\delta(\omega +\omega_c)-\delta(\omega-\omega_c)] \\
A\cdot \sin(\omega_c t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp;\quad i \pi A \cdot [\delta(\omega +\omega_c)-\delta(\omega-\omega_c)] \\
m(t)\cdot \sin(\omega_c t) \quad \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}&amp; \frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \{M(\omega)\} * \{i \pi \cdot [\delta(\omega +\omega_c)-\delta(\omega-\omega_c)]\} \\
=&amp; \frac{i}{2}\cdot [M(\omega +\omega_c) - M(\omega -\omega_c)]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:AM signal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fig 3:  The [[spectrogram]] of an AM broadcast shows its two sidebands (green) separated by the carrier signal (red).]]

===Power and spectrum efficiency===
In terms of the positive frequencies, the transmission bandwidth of AM is twice the signal's original ([[baseband]]) bandwidth&amp;mdash;since both the positive and negative sidebands are shifted up to the carrier frequency. Thus, double-sideband AM (DSB-AM) is spectrally inefficient, meaning that fewer radio stations can be accommodated in a given broadcast band.  The various suppression methods in [[#Forms of amplitude modulation|Forms of AM]] can be readily understood in terms of the diagram in Figure 2.  With the carrier suppressed there would be no energy at the center of a group. And with a sideband suppressed, the &quot;group&quot; would have the same bandwidth as the positive frequencies of &lt;math&gt;M(\omega).\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; The transmitter power efficiency of DSB-AM is relatively poor (about 33%). The benefit of this system is that receivers are cheaper to produce. The forms of AM with suppressed carriers are found to be 100% power efficient, since no power is wasted on the carrier signal which conveys no information.

==Modulation index==
It can be defined as the measure of extent of amplitude variation about an unmodulated maximum carrier. As with other [[modulation index|modulation indices]], in AM, this quantity, also called ''modulation depth'', indicates by how much the modulated variable varies around its 'original' level. For AM, it relates to the variations in the carrier amplitude and is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{\mathrm{peak\ value\ of\ } m(t)}{A} = \frac{M}{A},&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt;M\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; were introduced above.

So if &lt;math&gt;h=0.5&lt;/math&gt;, the carrier amplitude varies by 50% above and below its unmodulated level, and for &lt;math&gt;h=1.0&lt;/math&gt; it varies by 100%. To avoid distortion in the A3E transmission mode, modulation depth greater than 100% must be avoided.  Practical transmitter systems will usually incorporate some kind of limiter circuit, such as a [[VOGAD]], to ensure this. However, AM demodulators can be designed to detect the inversion (or 180 degree phase reversal) that occurs when modulation exceeds 100% and automatically correct for this effect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Variations of modulated signal with percentage modulation are shown below.  In each image, the maximum amplitude is higher than in the previous image.  Note that the scale changes from one image to the next.

==Amplitude modulator designs==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
{{Generalize|date=October 2009}}

===Circuits===
A wide range of different circuits have been used for AM, but one of the simplest circuits uses anode or collector modulation applied via a [[transformer]]. While it is perfectly possible to create good designs using solid-state electronics, [[thermionic valve|valved]] (vacuum tube) circuits are shown here. In general, valves are able to more easily yield RF powers, in excess of what can be easily achieved using solid-state [[transistor]]s. Many high-power broadcast stations still use valves.

[[Image:ammodstage.png|300px|right|thumb|Anode modulation using a transformer.  The [[tetrode]] is supplied with an anode supply (and screen grid supply) which is modulated via the transformer. The resistor R1 sets the grid bias; both the input and outputs are tuned [[LC circuit]]s which are tapped into by inductive coupling]]

Modulation circuit designs can be broadly divided into low and high level.

===Low level===
Here a small [[Sound|audio]] stage is used to [[modulation|modulate]] a low power stage; the output of this stage is then amplified using a [[Linear amplifier|linear]] RF amplifier. Wideband power amplifiers are used to preserve the sidebands of the modulated waves. In this arrangement, modulation is done at low power. To amplify it we use a wideband power amplifier at the output.

; Advantages

The advantage of using a linear RF amplifier is that the smaller early stages can be modulated, which only requires a small [[audio amplifier]] to drive the modulator.

; Disadvantages

The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifier chain is less [[electrical efficiency|efficient]], because it has to be linear to preserve the modulation. Hence [[Electronic amplifier#Class C|Class C amplifiers]] cannot be employed.

An approach which marries the advantages of low-level modulation with the efficiency of a Class C power amplifier chain is to arrange a feedback system to compensate for the substantial distortion of the AM envelope. A simple detector at the transmitter output (which can be little more than a loosely coupled [[diode]]) recovers the audio signal, and this is used as [[negative feedback]] to the audio modulator stage. The overall chain then acts as a linear amplifier as far as the actual modulation is concerned, though the RF amplifier itself still retains the Class C efficiency. This approach is widely used in practical medium power transmitters, such as AM [[radiotelephone]]s.

===High level===
With high level modulation, the modulation takes place at the final amplifier stage where the carrier signal is at its maximum amplitude.

; Advantages

One advantage of using class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter is that only the final stage needs to be modulated, and that all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. These class C stages will be able to generate the drive for the final stage for a smaller [[Direct current|DC]] power input. However, in many designs in order to obtain better quality AM the penultimate RF stages will need to be subject to modulation as well as the final stage.

; Disadvantages

A large audio amplifier will be needed for the modulation stage, at least equal to the power of the transmitter output itself. Traditionally the modulation is applied using an audio transformer, and this can be bulky. [[Direct coupling]] from the audio amplifier is also possible (known as a [[cascode]] arrangement), though this usually requires quite a high DC supply voltage (say 30 V or more), which is not suitable for mobile units.

==AM demodulation methods==
The simplest form of AM demodulator consists of a diode which is configured to act as [[envelope detector]].  Another type of demodulator, the [[product detector]], can provide better quality demodulation, at the cost of added circuit complexity.

'''Augustin-Jean Fresnel''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|f|r|eɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|l}} {{respell|fray|NEL|'}}, {{IPA-fr|ɔɡystɛ̃ ʒɑ̃ fʁɛnɛl}}; 10 May 1788 &amp;ndash; 14 July 1827), was a [[France|French]] engineer who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of [[wave|wave optics]]. Fresnel studied the behaviour of light both theoretically and experimentally. 

He is perhaps best known as the inventor of the [[Fresnel lens]], first adopted in [[lighthouse]]s while he was a French commissioner of lighthouses, and found in many applications today.

==Biography==

Fresnel was the son of an architect, born at [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] ([[Eure]]). His early progress in learning was slow, and he still could not read when he was eight years old. At thirteen he entered the École Centrale in [[Caen]], and at sixteen and a half the [[École Polytechnique]], where he acquitted himself with distinction. From there he went to the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées|École des Ponts et Chaussées]]. He served as an engineer successively in the departments of [[Vendée]], [[Drôme]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]]; but having supported the [[Bourbon house|Bourbons]] in 1814 he lost his appointment on [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] return to power.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1815 on the second restoration of the monarchy he obtained a post as engineer in [[Paris]], where he spent much of his life from that time onwards.  He appears to have begun his research in optics around 1814 when he prepared a paper on the [[aberration of light]], although it was never published. In 1818 he wrote a memoir on [[diffraction]] for which he received the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]] at Paris in the ensuing year. He was the first to construct a special type of lens, now called a [[Fresnel lens]], as a substitute for mirrors in lighthouses.  In 1819 he was nominated to be a commissioner of lighthouses.  In 1823 he was unanimously elected a member of the academy, and in 1825 he became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]].  In 1827, the time of his last illness, the Royal Society of London awarded him the [[Rumford Medal]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Fresnel died of [[tuberculosis]] at [[Ville-d'Avray]], near Paris.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He received only scant public recognition during his lifetime for his labours in the cause of optical science.  Some of his papers were not printed by the Académie des Sciences until many years after his death. But as he wrote to Young in 1824: in himself &quot;that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory&quot; had been blunted. &quot;All the compliments,&quot; he says, &quot;that I have received from [[François Arago|Arago]], [[Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment&quot;.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Research==

His discoveries and mathematical deductions, building on experimental work by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], extended the [[Huygens' principle|wave theory]] of [[light]] to a large class of [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]]. In 1817, Young had proposed a small transverse component to light, while yet retaining a far larger longitudinal component. Fresnel, by the year 1821, was able to show via mathematical methods that [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] could be explained only if light was ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever. 

He proposed the [[aether drag hypothesis]] to explain a lack of variation in astronomical observations.

His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|F. M. Grimaldi]] on [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. This allowed him to conclusively account for the phenomenon of interference in accordance with the wave theory.

With [[François Arago]] he studied the laws of the interference of polarized rays. He obtained circularly polarized light by means of a rhombus of glass, known as a [[Fresnel rhomb]], having obtuse angles of 126° and acute angles of 54°.

==Bibliography==
Perhaps Fresnel's most widely interpreted written work was his Memoir on the Diffraction of Light, submitted to the Academe of science in 1812. Bellow are translations of his publications into English:

[[Image:Saintdominicofsilos.jpg|thumb|St. [[Dominic of Silos]] enthroned as abbot (Hispano-Flemish Gothic 15th century)]]
The word '''''abbot''''', meaning father, is a [[title]] given to the head of a [[monastery]] in various traditions, including [[Christianity]].  The [[office]] may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is [[abbess]].

==Origins==
The title had its origin in the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], spread through the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery. At first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk, but it was soon restricted by [[canon law]] to certain priestly superiors. At times it was applied to various priests, e.g. at the court of the Frankish monarchy the ''Abbas palatinus'' ('of the palace') and ''Abbas castrensis'' ('of the camp') were chaplains to the Merovingian and Carolingian sovereigns’ court and army respectively. The title &quot;abbot&quot; came into fairly general use in western [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] [[order (religious)|orders]] whose members include priests.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

==Monastic history==
[[Image:StPakhom.jpg|thumb|[[Copt]]ic [[icon]] of St. [[Pachomius]], the founder of [[cenobitic]] [[monasticism]].]]
[[Image:Bendeikt von Nursia in Muensterschwazach.jpg|thumb|Carving of St. [[Benedict of Nursia]], holding an abbot's [[crozier]] and his [[Rule of St. Benedict|Rule for Monasteries]] (Münsterschwarzach, Germany).]]
An abbot (from the Hebrew ''ab'' &quot;אב&quot; or abba &quot;אבא&quot;, &quot;a father&quot;, through Latin ''abbas'' (genitive form, ''abbatis''), Old English ''abbad'', ; German ''Abt''; French ''abbé'') is the head and chief governor of a community of monks, called also in the East ''[[hegumen]]'' or ''[[archimandrite]]''.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} The English version for a female monastic head is abbess.

===Early history===
In [[Egypt]], the first home of monasticism, the jurisdiction of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint [[John Cassian]] speaks of an abbot of the [[Thebaid]] who had 500 monks under him. By the [[Rule of St Benedict]], which, until the [[Cluniac reforms]], was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluniac]] Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognized.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

Monks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. For the reception of the [[sacraments]], and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the [[ordination]] of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher [[spirituality|spiritual]] life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become [[deacon]]s, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils. Thus at the [[first Council of Constantinople]], AD 448, 23 [[archimandrite]]s or abbots sign, with 30 [[bishop]]s.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The [[second Council of Nicaea]], AD 787, recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders{{sfn|Venables|1911}} below the [[deacon|diaconate]], a power usually reserved to bishops.

Abbots were originally subject to [[bishop|episcopal]] jurisdiction, and continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The [[Code of Justinian]] (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an ''imperium in imperio,'' and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his [[diocese]].{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

===Later Middle Ages===
In the 12th century the abbots of [[Fulda]] claimed precedence of the [[archdiocese of Cologne|archbishop of Cologne]]. Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of [[mitre]], ring, gloves and sandals.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

{{main|Mitre#Christian clergy|l1=Mitres}}

It has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, ''Liturgische Gewandung'', p.&amp;nbsp;453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The '''mitred abbots''' in England were those of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], [[St Albans Abbey|St Alban's]], [[Bardney Abbey|Bardney]], [[Battle Abbey|Battle]], [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St Edmunds]], [[St Augustine's Abbey|St Augustine's Canterbury]], [[Colchester Abbey|Colchester]], [[Crowland Abbey|Croyland]], [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], [[Gloucester Abbey|Gloucester]], [[St Benet's Abbey|St Benet's Hulme]], [[Hyde Abbey|Hyde]], [[Malmesbury Abbey|Malmesbury]], [[Peterborough Abbey|Peterborough]], [[Ramsey Abbey|Ramsey]], [[Reading Abbey|Reading]], [[Selby Abbey|Selby]], [[Shrewsbury Abbey|Shrewsbury]], [[Tavistock Abbey|Tavistock]], [[Thorney Abbey|Thorney]], [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]], [[Winchcombe Abbey|Winchcombe]], and [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's York]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.  Of these the precedence was originally yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster. To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their [[crosier|pastoral staff]] should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The adoption of certain episcopal insignia ([[pontificalia]]) by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions, which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the [[First Council of the Lateran|Lateran council]], AD 1123. In the East abbots, if in priests' orders and with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|second Nicene council]], AD 787, to confer the [[tonsure]] and admit to the order of reader; but gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims, until we find them in AD 1489 permitted by [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate.  Of course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

The power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the [[canon law]].  One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. It was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}&lt;!-- but paragraph lower down in EB1911--&gt;

====Appointments====
When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the [[abbey|convent]], but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In [[abbey]]s exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and [[benediction]] had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to [[Rome]]. It was necessary that an abbot should be at least 25 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} 

The ceremony of the formal admission of a [[Benedictine]] abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the [[Consuetudinary (book)|consuetudinary]] of Abingdon.  The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession.  After proceeding up the [[nave]], he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his [[commissary]], and placed in his stall.  The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his [[staff of office]].  He then put on his shoes in the [[vestry]], and a [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

==General information==
Before the late modern era, the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house.  When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed.  His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king.  No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society.  The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table.  In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks.  In the West the [[Rule of St Benedict]] appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers.  This permission opening the door to luxurious living, the [[council of Aachen]], AD 817, decreed that the abbot should dine in the [[refectory]], and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots.  When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his [[chaplain]]s waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[Image:Prepozyt.png|right|thumb|Arms of a Roman Catholic abbot are distinguished by a gold [[crozier]] with a veil attached and a black [[galero]] with twelve tassels (the galero of a [[territorial abbot]] would be green)]]
The ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire.  Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]].  Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of [[Leicester]], c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting.  In magnificence of equipage and [[retinue]] the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm.  They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants.  The bells of the churches were rung as they passed.  They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}  This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially.  For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], judicially murdered by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons.  The [[abbots of Cluny]] and [[Trinity Abbey, Vendôme|Vendôme]] were, by virtue of their office, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s of the Roman church.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

In process of time the title abbot was extended to [[clergy#Catholic clergy|clerics]] who had no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and under the [[Charlemagne|Carolingians]] to the chief chaplain of the king, ''{{lang|la|Abbas Curiae}}'', or military chaplain of the emperor, ''{{lang|la|Abbas Castrensis.}}'' It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials.  Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at [[Genoa]] was called ''{{lang|la|Abbas Populi}}''.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[Lay abbot]]s (M. Lat. ''{{lang|la|defensores}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbacomites}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates laici}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates milites}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates saeculares}}'' or ''{{lang|la|irreligiosi}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbatiarii}}'', or sometimes simply ''{{lang|la|abbates}}'') were the outcome of the growth of the [[Feudalism|feudal]] system from the 8th century onwards.  The practice of [[commendation]], by which—to meet a contemporary emergency—the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection,
early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held ''in [[commendam]].''{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

During the Carolingian epoch the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable [[fiefdom|fiefs]] or [[benefice]]s, and by the 10th century, before the great [[Cluny|Cluniac]] reform, the system was firmly established. Even the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey of St Denis]] was held in commendam by [[Hugh Capet]]. The example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever.  In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the [[council of Cloveshoe]].  These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions.  The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other.  The enfeoffment of abbeys differed in form and degree.  Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as [[dean (religion)|dean]] (decanus), but also as abbot (''abbas legitimas'', ''monasticus'', ''regularis'').{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

When the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families, as late as the 13th century and later, the actual head of the community retaining that of dean.  The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West.  John, [[patriarch of Antioch]], at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, ''bencficiarii,'' for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported (''Itinerary'', ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:
:&quot;for a bad custom has prevailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most powerful people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of their churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain, have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own use the possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy the altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning even these to their sons and relations in the church. Such defenders, or rather destroyers, of the church, have caused themselves to be called abbots, and presumed to attribute to themselves a title, as well as estates, to which they have no just claim.&quot;

In conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a [[prior]].

== Modern practices ==
In the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the [[Carthusians]] for instance, have no abbots, only [[prior]]s). A monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the Pope,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability—a certain number of monks in vows, a certain number of years of establishment, a certain firmness to the foundation in economic, vocational and legal aspects. Prior to this, the monastery would be a mere priory, headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has.
[[Image:Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi.jpg|thumb|300px| Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi (on the left) of [[Monastery of the Holy Spirit]], a [[Trappist]] monastery in Conyers, Georgia, USA. ]]
The abbot is a priest, chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks. Once chosen, he must request blessing: the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or, with his permission, another abbot or bishop. The ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the ordination of a bishop, with the new abbot being presented with the [[miter]], the ring, and the [[crosier]] as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant. Though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority, it does not confer further sacramental authority.

Once he has received this blessing, the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense, but their major superior under canon law, and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector (formerly, he could confer the minor orders, which are not sacraments, that these ministries have replaced). The abbey is a species of &quot;exempt religious&quot; in that it is, for the most part, answerable to the Pope, or to the abbot primate, rather than to the local bishop.

The abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks, though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross.

[[Territorial abbot]]s follow all of the above, but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the Pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible.

==Abbatial hierarchy==
In some monastic families there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots. In some cases, this is the result of an abbey being considered the &quot;mother&quot; of several &quot;daughter&quot; abbeys founded originally as dependent priories of the &quot;mother.&quot; In other cases, abbeys have affiliated in networks known as &quot;congregations.&quot; Some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order.

* The abbot of [[Sant'Anselmo]] di Aventino, in Rome, is styled the &quot;abbot primate,&quot; and is acknowledged the senior abbot for the Order of St. Benedict (O.S.B.)
* An abbot president is the head of a congregation (federation) of abbeys within the Order of St. Benedict (for instance, the English Congregation, The American Cassinese Congregation, etc.), or of the Cistercians (O. Cist.)
* An archabbot is the head of some monasteries which are the motherhouses of other monasteries (for instance, St. Vincent's Archabbey, Latrobe, Pennsylvania)

==Modern abbots not as superior==
The title [[abbé]] (French; Ital. ''abate''), as commonly used in the Catholic Church on the European continent, is the equivalent of the English &quot;Father&quot; (parallel etymology), being loosely applied to all who have received the [[tonsure]].  This use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of France, by the [[concordat]] between [[Pope Leo X]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1516), to appoint ''abbés commendataires'' to most of the abbeys in France.  The expectation of obtaining these [[sinecure]]s drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers, and the class of abbés so formed—''abbés de cour'' they were sometimes called, and sometimes (ironically) ''abbés de sainte espérance'', (abbés of holy hope; or the pun, of St. Hope)—came to hold a recognized position.  The connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind, consisting mainly in adopting the title of abbé, after a remarkably moderate course of theological study, practising [[celibacy]] and wearing a distinctive dress—a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar.  Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abbé. The class did not survive the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]; but the [[courtesy title]] of abbé, having long lost all connection in people's minds with any special ecclesiastical function, remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman.

==Eastern Christian==
{{further|[[Hegumen]], [[Archimandrite]]}}

[[File:Иг Пётр Мещеринов официальный.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] Hegumen, wearing the black [[klobuk]] of a [[monk]] and the gold [[pectoral cross]] bestowed upon Hegumens.]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the Abbot is referred to as the '''[[Hegumen]]'''. The Superior of a Convent of Nuns is called the '''Hēguménē'''. The title of '''[[Archimandrite]]''' (literally the head of the enclosure) used to mean something similar.

In the East, the principle set forth in the ''Code of Justinian'' still applies, whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop. Those monasteries which enjoy the status of being ''stauropegiac'' will be subject only to a [[Primate (religion)|primate]] or his [[Synod of Bishops]] and not the local bishop.

Though the title &quot;abbot&quot; is not given in the Western Church to any but actual abbots of monasteries today, the title archimandrite is given to &quot;monastics&quot; (i.e., celibate) priests in the East, even when not attached to a monastery, as an honor for service, similar to the title of [[monsignor]] in the Western/Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. In the [[Orthodox Church]], only actual monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of [[Archpriest]] or [[Protopresbyter]]. Normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the Orthodox Church, with the exception of married priests who have been [[widow]]ed. Since the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who actually serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.

In the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|German Evangelical Church]] the German title of ''Abt'' (abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French ''abbé'', as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations.
Of these the most noteworthy is [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Hanover]], founded as a [[Cistercian]] house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593. The abbot of Loccum, who still carries a pastoral staff, takes precedence over all the clergy of Hanover, and was ''ex officio'' a member of the [[consistory]] of the kingdom.  The governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot, prior and the &quot;convent&quot; of ''[[Stiftsherr]]en'' (canons).

In the [[Church of England]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]], by royal decree given by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], also holds the honorary title of &quot;Abbot of St. Benet.&quot;  This title hails back to England's separation from the See of Rome, when King Henry, as supreme head of the newly independent church, took over all of the monasteries, mainly for their possessions, except for St. Benet, which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth, and lived like simple beggars, disposing the incumbent Bishop of Norwich and seating the abbot in his place, thus the dual title still held to this day.

Additionally, at the [[enthronement]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], there is a threefold enthronement, once in the throne the chancel as the [[diocesan bishop]] of [[Canterbury]], once in the [[Chair of St. Augustine]] as the [[Primate of All England]], and then once in the chapter-house as Titular Abbot of Canterbury.

There are several Benedictine Abbeys throughout the [[Anglican Communion]]. Most of them have mitred abbots.

==Abbots in art and literature==
[[Image:O abade.JPG|thumb|&quot;The Abbot&quot;, from the ''[[Dance of Death]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] ]]
&quot;The Abbot&quot; is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of [[Dance Macabre]].

The lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to Christian [[hagiography]], one of the most well-known being the ''Life of St. [[Benedict of Nursia]]'' by St. [[Gregory the Great]].

During the years 1106-1107 A.D., a Russian Orthodox Abbot named Daniel made a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]] and recorded his experiences. His diary was much-read throughout Russia, and at least seventy-five manuscript copies survive.

[[Joseph of Volokolamsk|Saint Joseph]], Abbot of [[Volokolamsk]] (1439–1515), wrote a number of influential works against [[heresy]], and about monastic and liturgical discipline, and Christian [[philanthropy]].

In the [[Redwall Abbey|Tales of Redwall]] series the creatures of Redwall are led by an Abbot or Abbess. These &quot;abbots&quot; are appointed by the brothers and sisters of Redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care, much like real abbots.

== ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' ==
[[Image:Map of the fossil sites of the earliest hominids (35.8-3.3M BP).svg|thumb|left|Map showing discovery location]]
''A. ramidus'' was named in September 1994. The first fossil find was dated to 4.4 million years ago based on its interval between two volcanic [[stratum|strata]]: the basal [[Tuff|Gaala Tuff Complex]] (GATC) and the [[basalt|Daam Aatu Basaltic Tuff]] (DABT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1038/371306a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' stems mostly from the [[Afar language]], in which ''Ardi'' means &quot;ground/floor&quot; and ''ramid'' means &quot;root&quot;. The ''pithecus'' portion of the name is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for &quot;ape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=NOVA, Aliens from Earth: Who's who in human evolution | last=Tyson | first=Peter | year=2009 | month=October | publisher=PBS | accessdate=2009-10-08 | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hobbit/tree-nf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinguishing characteristics are [[bipedalism]] incorporating an [[arboreal]] grasping [[hallux]] or big toe, reduced [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] and a smaller brain size comparable to that of the modern [[chimpanzee]].

In 1992–1993 a research team headed by [[Tim D. White|Tim White]] discovered the first ''A. ramidus'' fossils—seventeen fragments including skull, mandible, teeth and arm bones—from the [[Afar Depression]] in the [[Middle Awash]] river valley of [[Ethiopia]]. More fragments were recovered in 1994, amounting to 45% of the total skeleton. This fossil was originally described as a species of ''[[Australopithecus]]'', but White and his colleagues later published a note in the same journal renaming the fossil under a new genus, ''Ardipithecus''. Between 1999 and 2003, a multidisciplinary team led by [[Sileshi Semaw]] discovered bones and teeth of nine ''A. ramidus'' individuals at [[As Duma]] in the [[Gona]] Western Margin of Ethiopia's [[Afar Region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stoneageinstitute.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=New Fossil Hominids of Ardipithecus ramidus from Gona, Afar, Ethiopia |url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/news/gona_nature_paper.shtml#1 |accessdate=2009-01-30 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080624005441/http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/news/gona_nature_paper.shtml |archivedate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossils were dated to between 4.32 and 4.51 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/1822.html | author = Indiana University News Release | title = Anthropologists find 4.5 million-year-old hominid fossils in Ethiopia | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ardipithecus ramidus'' had a small brain, measuring between 300 and 350&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is about the same size as a modern [[bonobo]] or female [[common chimpanzee]] brain, but much smaller than the brain of [[Australopithecus|australopithecines]] like Lucy (~400 to 550&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and roughly 20% the size of the modern ''Homo sapiens'' brain.  Like common chimpanzees, ''A. ramidus'' was much more [[Prognathism|prognathic]] than modern humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suwa_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=The ''Ardipithecus ramidus skull'' and its implications for hominid origins | journal=Science | last=Suwa | first=G et al | date=2 October 2009| volume=326 | issue=5949 | pages=68, 68e1–68e7 | doi=10.1126/science.1175825 | last2=Asfaw | first2=B. | last3=Kono | first3=R. T. | last4=Kubo | first4=D. | last5=Lovejoy | first5=C. O. | last6=White | first6=T. D. | pmid=19810194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teeth of ''A. ramidus'' lacked the specialization of other apes, and suggest that it was a generalized [[omnivore]] and [[frugivore]] (fruit eater) with a diet that did not depend heavily on fibrous plants, ripe fruit or hard or abrasive food. The size of the upper [[canine tooth]] in ''A. ramidus'' males was not distinctly different than that of females. Their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size, as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth. The features of upper canine in ''A. ramidus'' contrast with the [[sexual dimorphism]] observed in common chimpanzees, where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suwa_2009b&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paleobiological implications of the ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' dentition | journal=Science | date=2 October 2009| last=Suwa | first=G et al | volume=326 | issue=5949 | pages=69, 94–99 | doi=10.1126/science.1175824 | last2=Kono | first2=R. T. | last3=Simpson | first3=S. W. | last4=Asfaw | first4=B. | last5=Lovejoy | first5=C. O. | last6=White | first6=T. D. | pmid=19810195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The less pronounced nature of upper canine teeth in ''A. ramidus'' has been used to infer aspects of the [[Primatology#Primatology in sociobiology|social behavior]] of the species and more ancestral hominids.  In particular, it has been used to suggest that the [[last common ancestor]] of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups. This is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees, among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high. Researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition &quot;compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suwa_2009b&quot;/&gt;

''A. ramidus'' existed more recently than the [[most recent common ancestor]] of humans and chimpanzees ([[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|CLCA or ''Pan''-''Homo'' LCA]]), and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; ''A. ramidus'' feet are better suited for walking. The canine teeth of ''A. ramidus'' are smaller, and equal in size between males and females, which suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, increased pair-bonding, and increased parental investment. &quot;Thus, fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools,&quot; the research team concluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndThePaleobiology&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Ardipithecus (finger bones).jpg|thumb|Casts of Ardi's finger bones]]
On October 1, [[2009 in science|2009]], paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete ''A. ramidus'' fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994. The fossil is the remains of a small-brained 50-kilogram (110&amp;nbsp;lb) female, nicknamed &quot;Ardi&quot;, and includes most of the skull and teeth, as well as the pelvis, hands, and feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewKind&quot; /&gt; It was discovered in Ethiopia's harsh [[Afar Region|Afar desert]] at a site called [[Aramis, Ethiopia|Aramis]] in the Middle Awash region. Radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash encasing the deposits suggest that Ardi lived about 4.4 million years ago. This date however has been questioned by others. Beagle and Kappelman suggest that the region in which Ardi was found is difficult to date radiometrically, and they argue that Ardi should be dated at 3.9 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/376558b0 | last1 = Kappelman | first1 =  John| last2 = Beagle | first2 =  John G.| year = 1995 | title = Age of early homonids | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 376 | issue = 6541| pages = 558–559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fossil sheds light on a stage of human evolution about which little was known, more than a million years before [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] (''Australopithecus afarensis''), the iconic early human ancestor candidate who lived 3.2 million years ago, and was discovered in 1974 just 74&amp;nbsp;km (46&amp;nbsp;mi) away from Ardi's discovery site.

Researchers infer from the form of her pelvis and limbs and the presence of her [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abductable]] [[hallux]], that she was a [[facultative biped]]: [[biped]]al when moving on the ground, but [[quadruped]]al when moving about in tree branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndThePaleobiology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Tim D. |authorlink= |coauthors=Asfaw, Berhane; Beyene, Yonas; Haile-Selassie, Yohannes; Lovejoy, C.

An '''assembly line''' is a [[manufacturing]] process in which parts (usually [[interchangeable parts]]) are added to a product in a sequential manner using optimally planned logistics to create a finished product much faster than with handcrafting-type methods. The assembly line developed by [[Ford Motor Company]] between 1908 and 1915 made assembly lines famous in the following decade through the social ramifications of [[mass production]], such as the affordability of the [[Ford Model T]] and the introduction of high wages for Ford workers. [[Henry Ford]] was the first to master the assembly line and was able to improve other aspects of industry by doing so (such as reducing labor hours required to produce a single vehicle, and increased production numbers and parts). However, the various preconditions for the development at Ford stretched far back into the 19th century, from the gradual realization of the dream of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]], to the concept of reinventing workflow and job descriptions using analytical methods (the most famous example being [[scientific management]]). Ford was the first company to build large [[factory|factories]] around the assembly line concept. Mass production via assembly lines is widely considered to be the catalyst which initiated the modern consumer culture by making possible low [[unit cost]] for manufactured goods. It is often said that Ford's production system was ingenious because it turned Ford's own workers into new customers. Put another way, Ford innovated its way to a lower price point and by doing so turned a huge potential market into a reality. Not only did this mean that Ford enjoyed much larger demand, but the resulting larger demand also allowed further [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]] to be exploited, further depressing unit price, which tapped yet another portion of the [[Supply and demand|demand curve]]. This bootstrapping quality of growth made Ford famous and set an example for other industries.

==Concept==
Assembly lines are designed for a sequential organization of workers, tools or machines, and parts.  The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible. All parts or assemblies are handled either by conveyors or motorized vehicles such as fork lifts, or gravity, with no manual trucking. Heavy lifting is done by machines such as [[overhead crane]]s or fork lifts. Each worker typically performs one simple operation.

According to Henry Ford:
:”The principles of assembly are these:

::(1) Place the tools and the men in the sequence of the operation so that each component part shall travel the least possible distance while in the process of finishing.

::(2) Use work slides or some other form of carrier so that when a workman completes his operation, he drops the part always in the same place--which place must always be the most convenient place to his hand--and if possible have gravity carry the part to the next workman for his operation.

::(3) Use sliding assembling lines by which the parts to be assembled are delivered at convenient distances.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}},[http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA81,M1 p. 45 on line version, p80. print version].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Final assembly 3.jpg|thumb|[[Lotus Cars]] assembly line as of 2008]]
===Simple Example===
Consider the assembly of a car: assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine, install the hood, and install the wheels (in that order, with arbitrary interstitial steps); only one of these steps can be done at a time. In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If engine installation takes 20 minutes, hood installation takes 5 minutes, and wheel installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes.

In an assembly line, car assembly is split between several stations, all working simultaneously. When one station is finished with a car, it passes it on to the next. By having three stations, a total of three different cars can be operated on at the same time, each one at a different stage of its assembly.

After finishing its work on the first car, the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car. While the engine installation crew works on the second car, the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood, then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels. After the engine has been installed on the second car, the second car moves to the hood assembly. At the same time, the third car moves to the engine assembly. When the third car’s engine has been mounted, it then can be moved to the hood station; meanwhile, subsequent cars (if any) can be moved to the engine installation station.

Assuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another, the longest stage on the assembly line determines the throughput (20 minutes for the engine installation) so a car can be produced every 20 minutes, once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced.

==History==
[[Image:A-line1913.jpg|thumb|right|1913 Experimenting with mounting body on Model T chassis. Ford tested various assembly methods to optimize the procedures before permanently installing the equipment.  The actual assembly line used an [[overhead crane]] to mount the body.]]

===Before the 20th century===
Before the 20th century, most manufactured products were made individually by hand. A single craftsman or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product. They would use their skills and tools such as [[File (tool)|files]] and knives to create the individual parts. They would then assemble them into the final product, making cut-and-try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together ([[craft production]]).

The assembly line concept was independently redeveloped throughout history and not &quot;invented&quot; at one time by one person. Its exponentially larger development at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th occurred among various people over decades, as other aspects of technology allowed. The development of toolpath control via [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], for [[machine tool]]s (such as the [[screw-cutting lathe]] and [[milling machine]]) during the 19th century provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making [[interchangeable parts]] a practical reality.  The transition to other methods began as manufacturers took advantage of the opportunities that the aforementioned machining developments presented. Thus, before the modern assembly line took shape, there were prototypical forms in various industries, as outlined below.

====Early history====
The [[Terracotta Army]] commissioned by the first Chinese Emperor [[Qin Shi Huangdi]] is a collection of about 8000 life-sized [[ceramic]] soldiers and horses buried with the emperor. The figures had their separate body parts manufactured by different workshops that were later assembled to completion. Notably, each workshop inscribed its name on the part they manufactured to add traceability for quality construction.

At the peak of its efficiency in the early 16th century, the [[Venetian Arsenal]] employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly-built [[galley]] with standardized parts on an assembly-line basis not seen again until the [[Industrial Revolution]].

====Industrial revolution====
The Industrial Revolution in Western Europe and North America, but perhaps most especially in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and in [[New England]], led to a proliferation of manufacturing and invention. Many industries, notably [[textile]]s, [[firearm]]s, [[clockmaking|clocks and watches]],&lt;ref name = &quot;xovodv&quot;&gt;Georgano 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[button]]s, [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, [[railroad car]]s and [[locomotive]]s, [[sewing machine]]s, and [[bicycle]]s, saw expeditious improvement in materials handling, machining, and assembly during the 19th century, although modern concepts such as [[industrial engineering]] and [[logistics]] had not yet been named.

[[Adam Smith]] discusses the [[division of labour]] in the manufacture of [[pins]] at length in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (published in 1776).

Probably the first linear and continuous assembly process of post-Renaissance times were the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] built between 1801 and 1803. [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] (father of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]), with the help of [[Henry Maudslay]] and others, designed 22 types of machine tools to make the parts for the [[Block (sailing)|blocks]] used by the [[Royal Navy]]. This factory was so successful it remained in use until the 1960s, with the workshop still visible at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Dockyard]] in [[Portsmouth]], and still containing some of the original machinery.

[[Eli Whitney]] is sometimes credited{{whom|date=January 2011}} with developing the [[American system of manufacturing|armory system]] of manufacturing in 1801, using the ideas of [[division of labor]], [[Tolerance (engineering)|engineering tolerance]], and interchangeable parts to create assemblies from parts in a repeatable manner. But Whitney's contribution was mostly as a popularizer rather than &quot;the inventor&quot; of repeatability. He was probably{{or|date=January 2011}} inspired by several others (including [[Honoré Blanc]]), or at least by the contemporary zeitgeist that was building around such ideas. [[Thomas Jefferson]] had tried to bring a French mechanic (almost certainly Blanc) and his methods to America in 1785, but the project never went anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Roe|1916|pp=129–130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later Whitney and his American contemporaries succeeded in introducing the relevant concepts (interchangeable parts, tool-path control via machine tools and jigs, transfer of skill to the equipment, allowing use of semi-skilled or unskilled machine operators) to American firearm-manufacture.

====Conveyor systems====
Steam powered conveyor lifts began being used for loading and unloading ships some time in the last quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref name =&quot;Wells1890&quot;&gt;{{Citation

The meatpacking industry of Chicago is believed to be one of the first industrial assembly lines (or dis-assembly lines) to be utilized in the United States starting in 1867. Workers would stand at fixed stations and a pulley system would bring the meat to each worker and they would complete one task. Henry Ford and others have written about the influence of this slaughterhouse practice on the later developments at Ford Motor Company (see below at [[#Ford Motor Company (1908-1915)|Ford Motor Company (1908-1915)]]).

===Olds Motor Vehicle Company (1901)===
[[Ransom E. Olds|Ransom Olds]] patented the assembly line concept, which he put to work in his [[Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] factory in 1901, becoming the first company in America to mass-produce automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/assbline.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This development is often overshadowed by the independent redevelopment of assembly-line work at Ford Motor Company a few years later (see below), which introduced the ramifications of the method to a wider audience.

===Ford Motor Company (1908-1915)===
[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913. The magneto assembly line was the first.]]

The assembly line developed for the [[Ford Model T]] had immense influence on the world. Despite oversimplistic attempts to attribute it to one man or another, it was in fact a composite development based on logic that took 7 years and plenty of intelligent men. The principal leaders are discussed below.

The basic kernel of an assembly line concept was introduced to [[Ford Motor Company]] by William &quot;Pa&quot; Klann upon his return from visiting a Chicago slaughterhouse and viewing what was referred to as the &quot;disassembly line&quot;, where animals were butchered as they moved along a conveyor. The efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over caught his attention. He reported the idea to [[Peter E. Martin]], soon to be head of Ford production, who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed. Others at Ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to [[Henry Ford]], but Pa Klann's slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the Henry Ford Museum{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} and elsewhere, making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept. The process was an evolution by trial and error of a team consisting primarily of [[Peter E. Martin]], the factory superintendent; [[Charles E. Sorensen]], Martin's assistant; [[C. Harold Wills]], draftsman and toolmaker; [[Clarence W. Avery]]; [[Charles Ebender]]; and [[József Galamb]]. Some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of [[machine tool]] placement that [[Walter Flanders]] had been doing at Ford up to 1908.

In 1922 Ford (via his ghostwriter Crowther) said of his 1913 assembly line:

:&quot;I believe that this was the first moving line ever installed. The idea came in a general way from the overhead trolley that the Chicago packers use in dressing beef.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA81,M1 p. 81].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles E. Sorensen]], in his 1956 memoir ''My Forty Years with Ford'', presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual “inventors” as a gradual, logical development of industrial engineering:

:&quot;What was worked out at Ford was the practice of moving the work from one worker to another until it became a complete unit, then arranging the flow of these units at the right time and the right place to a moving final assembly line from which came a finished product. Regardless of earlier uses of some of these principles, the direct line of succession of mass production and its intensification into automation stems directly from what we worked out at Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1913. Henry Ford is generally regarded as the father of mass production. He was not. He was the sponsor of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these developments in method, Ford's cars came off the line in three minute intervals. This was much faster than previous methods, increasing production by eight to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower.&lt;ref name = &quot;xovodv&quot;/&gt; It was so successful, [[paint]] became a bottleneck. Only [[japan black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926.&lt;ref name = &quot;xovodv&quot;/&gt; In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.&lt;ref name = &quot;xovodv&quot;/&gt;

The assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society.  Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to drop within the budget of the American middle class.  In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had dropped to around $575.  This price reduction is comparable to a drop from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000.

Ford's complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called &quot;[[Fordism]]&quot;, and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.

Ford at one point considered suing other car companies because they used the assembly line in their production, but decided against, realizing it was essential to creation and expansion of the industry as a whole. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}


In the [[automotive industry]], its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide. Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, [[Citroen]] was the first native European manufacturer to adopt it. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke by not being able to compete; by 1930, 250 companies which did not had disappeared.&lt;ref name = &quot;xovodv&quot;/&gt;

==Sociological problems==
[[Sociology|Sociological]] work has explored the [[social alienation]] and [[boredom]] that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0040-165X)6%3A3%3C518%3AAAFTFW%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J Alienation and Freedom: The Factory Worker and His Industry], [[Bob Blauner|Robert Blauner]], in ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', Vol. 6, No. 3 (Summer, 1965), pp. 518-519 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because workers have to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day, [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive stress injuries]] are a possible pathology of [[occupational safety]]. [[Industrial noise]] also proved dangerous. When it was not too high, workers were often prohibited from talking. [[Charles Piaget]], a [[skilled worker]] at the [[LIP factory]], recalled that beside being prohibited from speaking, the semi-skilled workers had only 25 centimeters in which to move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouvements.asso.fr/spip.php?article52 Leçons d'autogestion] (Autogestion Lessons), interview with [[Charles Piaget]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial [[ergonomics]] later tried to minimize physical trauma.

==Improved working conditions==
In his autobiography Henry Ford (1922) mentions several benefits of the assembly line including:
*Workers do no heavy lifting
*No stooping or bending over
*No special training required
*There are jobs that almost anyone can do
*Provided employment to immigrants

The gains in productivity allowed Ford to increase worker pay from $2.50 per day to $5.00 per day and to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the Model T price.  These goals appear altruistic, however, it has been argued that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover.

Adelaide is a coastal city situated on the eastern shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]], on the [[Adelaide Plains]], north of the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], between Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying [[Mount Lofty Ranges]]. The suburbs reach roughly {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the foothills but sprawl {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Sellicks Beach, South Australia|Sellicks Beach]] in the south.

Named in honour of [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], the German-born [[Queen consort|consort]] of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], the city was founded in 1836 as the [[new town|planned capital]] for a freely settled British province in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Swan River Colony of Western Australia was founded in 1829 as a free settlement.  Western Australia was, however, later to accept ticket of leave convicts between 1851 and 1869 due to the chronic shortage of labour it faced. Unlike Perth, Adelaide at no time became a penal settlement.

As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the [[Adelaide city centre|city centre]] along the cultural boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]], [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]] and in various districts of the metropolitan area. Today, Adelaide is noted for [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|its many festivals]] and sporting events, its food, wine and culture, its long beachfronts, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors.

==History==
{{Main|History of Adelaide}}

===Prehistory===
Prior to British settlement, the Adelaide area was inhabited by the [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] nation (pronounced &quot;Garner&quot; or &quot;Gowna&quot;). Acknowledged{{by whom|date=January 2011}}{{when|date=January 2011}} Kaurna country comprised the Adelaide Plains and surrounding regions – from [[Cape Jervis]] in the south to [[Port Wakefield, South Australia|Port Wakefield]] in the north.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Among their unique customs were burn-offs (controlled [[bushfires]]) in the [[Adelaide Hills]] which the early Europeans spotted before the Kaurna people were pushed out by settlement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} By 1852, the total population (by census count) of the Kaurna was 650 in the Adelaide region and steadily decreasing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} During the winter months, they moved into the Adelaide Hills for better shelter and firewood.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===19th century===
South Australia was officially settled as a new British province on 28 December 1836, near [[The Old Gum Tree]] in what is now the suburb of [[Glenelg North, South Australia|Glenelg North]]. This day is now commemorated as [[Proclamation Day]] in South Australia. The site of the colony's capital city was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, through the design made by the architect [[George Strickland Kingston]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Langmead, [http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1082509 ''The Adelaide city plan : fiction and fact''], Wakefield Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Light had fondly written of the Sicilian city of [[Catania]]: &quot;The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile long&quot;, and this became the basis for the plan of Adelaide. Light chose, not without opposition, a site on rising ground close to the River Torrens, which became the chief early water supply for the fledgling colony. &quot;[[Light's Vision]]&quot;, as it has been termed, has meant that the initial design of Adelaide required little modification as the city grew and prospered. Usually in an older city it would be necessary to accommodate larger roads and add parks, whereas Adelaide had them from the start.

Adelaide was established as the centre of a [[New town|planned colony]] of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield cites Edward Curr, ''An Account of the Colony of Van Diemen’s Land, principally designed for the use of emigrants'', George Cowie &amp; Co., London, 1824; Henry Widdowson, ''Present State of Van Diemen’s Land; comprising an account of its agricultural capabilities, with observations on the present state of farming, &amp;c. &amp;c. pursued in that colony: and other important matters connected with Emigration'', S. Robinson, W. Joy and J. Cross, London, and J. Birdsall, Northampton, 1829; and James Atkinson, ''An Account of the State of Agriculture &amp; Grazing in New South Wales; Including Observations on the Soils and General Appearance of the Country, and some of its most useful natural productions; with an account of the Various Methods of Clearing and Improving Lands, Breeding and Grazing Live Stock, Erecting Buildings, the System of employing Convicts, and the expense of Labour generally; the Mode of Applying for Grants of Land; with Other Information Important to those who are about to emigrate to that Country: The result of several years’ residence iand practical experience in those matters in the Colony''., J. Cross, London, 1826&lt;/ref&gt; while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress, and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, ''Letter from Sydney'', December 1829, pp. 99–185, written from Newgate prison. Editor Robert Gouger.&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield wrote about this under a pseudonym, purporting to be an Australian settler. His subterfuge was so successful that he confused later writers including [[Karl Marx]], who wrote 'It is the great merit of E.G. Wakefield to have discovered not anything new about the Colonies, but to have discovered in the Colonies the truth of as to the condition of capitalist production in the mother-country.' ''Das Kapital'', Moscow, 1958, p 766&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Funds raised from the sale of land would be used to bring out working class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land.&lt;ref&gt;''Plan of a Company to be Established for the Purpose of Founding a Colony in Southern Australia, Purchasing Land Therein, and Preparing the Land so Purchased for the Reception of Immigrants'', 1832; in Wakefield, Edward Gibbon, Prichard, M. F., (ed.) ''The Collected Works of Edward Gibbon Wakefield'', Collins, London, 1968, p 290.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share [[Convictism in Australia|the convict settlement history]] of other Australian cities like Sydney, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hobart]].

As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. However, by mid-1837 the ''South Australian Register'' was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales, and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought.  Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now named [[South Australia Police]]) in April 1838 under 21-year-old [[Henry Inman (police commander)|Henry Inman]].&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Bull; Early Experiences of Colonial Life in South Australia (Adelaide, 1878) p.67&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Sheriff, Mr Samuel Smart, was wounded during the robbery, and on 2 May 1838 one of the offenders, Michael Magee, became the first person to be hanged in South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Free Settlement |url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/adelaidegaol/free-settlement.html |work=History of Adelaide Gaol |publisher=Environment.sa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Baker Ashton was appointed Governor of the temporary goal in 1839, and in 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design Adelaide's new Gaol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Gaol Founders |url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/adelaidegaol/goal-founders.html |work=History of Adelaide Gaol |publisher=Environment.sa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction of Adelaide Gaol commenced in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/adelaidegaol/lights-vision.html |title=Light's Vision |work=History of Adelaide Gaol |publisher=Environment.sa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and incompetent leadership. The first governor of South Australia, [[John Hindmarsh]], clashed frequently with others, in particular with the Resident Commissioner, [[James Hurtle Fisher]]. The rural area surrounding Adelaide city was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. The wool industry served as an early basis for the South Australian economy. Light's survey was completed in this period, and land was promptly offered to sale to early colonists. Wheat farms ranged from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north by 1860.

[[George Gawler|Governor Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, hospital, customs house and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. In addition, houses for public officials and missionaries, and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler's governorship. Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficient during this period, but at heavy cost: as a result of Gawler's public works the colony was heavily in debt and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey|Governor Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: [[silver]] was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agricultural industries were well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.

[[File:Adelaide town hall 1950.jpg|thumb|left|The General Post Office ''(left)'' and Treasury buildings ''(right)'' on [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]], 1950.]]
Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the [[Murray River]] being successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. [[Secret ballot]]s were introduced, and a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Blair, Robert D.| year=2001| title=Events in South Australian History 1834–1857 | work=Pioneer Association of South Australia | url=http://www.users.on.net/~rdblair/events-sa.htm | accessdate=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the turbid River Torrens. In 1867 gas street lighting was implemented, the [[University of Adelaide]] was founded in 1874, the [[South Australian Art Gallery]] opened in 1881 and the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. [[Drought]] and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.

===20th century===
[[File:Adelaide kingwilliam.jpg|thumb|right|[[King William Street, Adelaide|King William Street]], named in honour of [[King William IV]], looking south from [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] in 2006 before the extension of the tram line.]]
Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom but, with the return of droughts, entered the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, later returning to prosperity under strong government leadership. [[Secondary sector of industry|Secondary industries]] helped reduce the state's dependence on [[primary sector of industry|primary industries]]. The 1933 census recorded the state population at 580,949, less of an increase than other states due to the state's economic limitations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Seventy thousand men and women enlisted&lt;!-- When? To do what? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]].

The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors [[Holden]] and [[Chrysler Australia|Chrysler]]&lt;ref&gt;When Chrysler stopped manufacturing in Adelaide, [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited]] took over the [[Tonsley Park]] factory. After many years of mixed fortunes, Mitsubishi ceased manufacturing at Tonsley Park on 27 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; made use of these factories around Adelaide, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a twentieth-century city. A pipeline from [[Mannum, South Australia|Mannum]] brought [[River Murray]] water to Adelaide in 1954 and [[Adelaide International Airport|an airport]] opened at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]] in 1955. An assisted migration scheme brought 215,000 immigrants of many nationalities, mainly European, to South Australia between 1947 and 1973.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan Governments]] of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival' – establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a centre of the arts, building upon the biennial &quot;[[Adelaide Festival of Arts]]&quot; which commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]] between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands, before losing it to Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;f1-move&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Adelaide Street Circuit | publisher =Formula 1 Database | url =http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Adelaide_Street_Circuit | accessdate = 13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[State Bank of South Australia|State Bank]] collapse plunged both Adelaide and South Australia into economic recession, and its effects lasted until 2004, when ratings agency [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = All-round country | work = [[The Australian]] | page = 14 | date = 29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent years have seen the [[Clipsal 500]] [[V8 Supercars]] race make use of sections of the former Formula One circuit.

==Geography==
[[File:Adelaide metropolitan area map.svg|right|thumb|Adelaide's metropolitan area]]

Adelaide is located north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the foothills, and {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Sellicks Beach, South Australia|Sellicks Beach]] in the south. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], the Adelaide Metropolitan Region has a total land area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and is at an average elevation of {{convert|50|m|ft|}} above sea level. [[Mount Lofty]] is located east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of {{convert|727|m|ft|}}. It is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]].

Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation – swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. However, much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the [[Cleland Conservation Park]] and [[Belair National Park]]. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and [[Onkaparinga River National Park|Onkaparinga]] catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] supplying around 40% and the much larger [[Mount Bold Reservoir]] 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

===Urban layout===
{{Main|Light's Vision}}
[[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb|136px|left|1888 Map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]]

Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, now known as '''Light's Vision''', arranged Adelaide in a grid, with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's design was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first Governor, John Hindmarsh. Light persisted with his design against this initial opposition.

The benefits of Light's design are numerous; Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable grid layout and a beautiful green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring roads]] in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''], 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and &quot;country towns&quot;, and the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway]].
[[File:Adelaide nth tce1.8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The corner of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] (right) and [[Pulteney Street, Adelaide|Pulteney Street]] (left), looking south-west from [[Bonython Hall]].]]
New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways – A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s is possibly an example of well-thought-out urban planning. The newer suburban areas as a whole, however, are not as integrated into the urban layout as much as older areas, and therefore place more stress on Adelaide's transportation system – although not on a level comparable with Melbourne or Sydney.
[[File:Adelaide-NthTce-EastEnd-TerraceHouses-Aug08.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A row of terrace homes on North Terrace.]]
In the 1960s a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while other parts have been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008 the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&amp;nbsp;million as the first of these developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 &quot;Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village&quot;], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

Retrieved 20 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Adelaide}}

Adelaide has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''), where most of the rain falls in the winter months. Of the Australian capital cities, Adelaide is the driest, and it has a [[semi-arid]] climate influence because of its dryness. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&amp;nbsp;mm. Frosts are occasional, with the most notable occurrences having occurred in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. There is usually no appreciable snowfall, except for very light falls at Mount Lofty and some places in the Adelaide Hills.

==Governance==
{{Main|Government of South Australia}}
[[File:Adelaide parliament house.JPG|right|thumb|[[Parliament House, Adelaide]] on North Terrace houses the [[Parliament of South Australia]].]]

Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the [[Government of South Australia]]. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the [[City of Adelaide]]. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the state government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The state parliament's Capital City Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au |title=Capital City Committee |date = October 2008|publisher=Government of South Australia and Adelaide City Council |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.

==== Local governments ====
{{See|Local Government Areas of South Australia}}
The Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between eighteen [[Local Government Areas of South Australia|local government areas]], including, at its centre, the [[City of Adelaide]], which administers the CBD, [[North Adelaide]], and the surrounding [[Adelaide Parklands]]. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, [[James Hurtle Fisher]], was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Adelaide|Lord Mayor]], the current being Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/will-a-change-of-mayor-really-change-anything-about-the-adelaide-city-council/story-e6frea83-1225954026458 |title=Will a change of mayor really change anything about the Adelaide City Council? |publisher=The Advertiser |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006 Census, Adelaide had a metropolitan population of more than 1,105,839, making it Australia's fifth largest city. In the 2002–03 period the population grew by 0.6%, while the national average was 1.2%. Some 70.3% of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states.

Major areas of population growth in recent years were in outer suburbs such as [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Mawson Lakes]] and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 341,227 houses, 54,826 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,327 flats, units or apartments.

High socioeconomic areas include a number of the coastal suburbs, most of the inner north-eastern, eastern, south-eastern and inner southern suburbs, the Adelaide hills and [[North Adelaide]]. Almost a fifth (17.9%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.

Overseas-born Adelaideans composed 23.7% (262,367) of the total population. The north-western suburbs (such as [[Woodville, South Australia|Woodville]] and [[Athol Park, South Australia|Athol Park]]) and suburbs close to the CBD have a higher ratio of overseas-born residents. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (7.3%), Italy (1.9%), Scotland (1.0%), [[Vietnam]] (0.9%), and Greece (0.9%). The most-spoken languages other than [[Australian English|English]] were Italian (3.0%), Greek (2.2%), [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (1.2%), [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] (0.8%), and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] (0.7%).&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS|id=405|name=Adelaide (Statistical Division)|quick=on|accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Over half of the population identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Catholic]] (22.1%), [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] (14.0%), [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]] (8.4%) and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (3.8%). Approximately 24% of the population expressed no religious affiliation, compared with the national average of 18.7%, and although ironically the large number of churches in Adelaide has led people to believe this is the source of the nickname ''The City of Churches''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Finn-Olaf |last=Jones |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/travel/23next.html?scp=5&amp;sq=adelaide&amp;st=cse |title=A ‘City of Churches’ Emerges as a Culinary Hub |date=23 December 2007 |work=Travel section, The New York Times |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age structure===
Overall, Adelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. Just over a quarter (26.7%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55&amp;nbsp;years or older, in comparison to the national average of 24.3%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15 year olds), which composed 17.8% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.8%.

South Australia's largest employment sector is health care and social assistance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyReleaseDate/BDE38EF07F5984D0CA2576F50011FE7D?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/health-now-our-biggest-employer/story-e6frede3-1226046526798&lt;/ref&gt; surpassing manufacturing in SA as the largest employer since 2006-07.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyReleaseDate/BDE38EF07F5984D0CA2576F50011FE7D?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/health-now-our-biggest-employer/story-e6frede3-1226046526798&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009-10, manufacturing in SA had average annual employment of 83,700 persons compared with 103,300 for health care and social assistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyReleaseDate/BDE38EF07F5984D0CA2576F50011FE7D?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt; Health care and social assistance represented nearly 13% of the state average annual employment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1345.4Feature%20Article1Apr%202011?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=1345.4&amp;issue=Apr%202011&amp;num=&amp;view=&lt;/ref&gt;

The retail trade is the second largest employer in SA (2009-10), with 91,900 jobs, and 12 per cent of the state workforce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1345.4Feature%20Article1Apr%202011?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=1345.4&amp;issue=Apr%202011&amp;num=&amp;view=&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturing, defence technology and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide at the [[General Motors Holden]] plant in [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southaustralia.biz/fact_sheets/fact_automotive.biz.pdf ''South Australia Fact Sheet: Automotive''], Business South Australia. {{Dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adelaide has over 40% of Australia's high-tech electronics industry which designs and produces electronic systems that are sold worldwide for applications in medical, communications, defence, automotive, food and wine processing and industrial sectors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The revenue of Adelaide's electronics industry has grown at over 15% per annum since 1990, and in 2010 exceeds A$5 billion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The electronics industry in Adelaide employs over 14,000 people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The global media conglomerate [[News Corporation]] was founded in and until 2004 incorporated in Adelaide and is still considered its 'spiritual' home by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Australia's largest oil company, [[Santos Limited|Santos]], prominent South Australian brewery, [[Coopers Brewery|Coopers]], major national retailer [[Harris Scarfe]] and Australia's second largest listed investment company [[Argo Investments Limited]] call Adelaide their home.

The [[State Bank of South Australia|collapse of the State Bank in 1992]] resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4&amp;nbsp;billion). The collapse had meant that successive governments had enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which had been a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southaustralia.biz/news/sa_creditrating.htm ''South Australia's Credit Rating the Highest''], Business South Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian economy, very closely tied to Adelaide's, still enjoys a trade surplus and has higher per capita growth than Australia as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southaustralia.biz/PDFs/economic_performance_update_dec05.pdf ''South Australia's Economic Performance Update], Dec 2005, Business South Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence industry===
Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1&amp;nbsp;billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. Seventy-two percent of Australian defence companies are located in Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The principal government military research institution, the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]], and other defence technology organisations such as [[BAE Systems Australia]] and Lockheed Martin Australia, are located north of Salisbury and west of Elizabeth in an area now called &quot;Edinburgh Parks&quot;, adjacent to [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].

Others, such as Saab Systems and Raytheon, are located in or near [[Technology Park, Adelaide|Technology Park]]. The [[Australian Submarine Corporation]], based in the industrial suburb of [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]], was charged with constructing Australia's [[Collins class submarine|''Collins'' class submarines]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.gov.au/Collins_Class Collins Class Submarines (SSG)], Royal Australian Navy.{{Failed verification|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- updated exlink to new RAN webpage on subject, but the RAN webpage does not mention where the subs were built --&gt; and more recently the A$6&amp;nbsp;billion contract to construct the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s new [[Hobart class destroyer|air-warfare destroyers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence-sa.com/ ''South Australia: The Defence Industry Choice], Defence SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment statistics===
There are 466,829 employed people in Adelaide, with 62.3% full-time and 35.1% part-time. In recent years there has been a growing trend towards part-time (which includes casual) employment, increasing from 11.6% of the workplace in 1991, to over a third today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The median weekly individual income for people aged 15&amp;nbsp;years and over is $447 per week, compared with $466 nationally. The median family income is $1,137 per week, compared with $1,171 nationally.&lt;ref name=ABS/&gt; Adelaide's housing and living costs are substantially lower than that of other Australian cities, with housing being notably cheaper. The median Adelaide house price is half that of Sydney and two-thirds that of Melbourne. The three month trend unemployment rate to March 2007 was 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workplace.gov.au/lmip/LabourForceData/SouthAustralia/Adelaide/ ''Adelaide''], Labour Market Information Portal.&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern suburbs' unemployment rate is disproportionately higher than the other regions of Adelaide at 8.3%, while the East and South are lower than the Adelaide average at 4.9% and 5.0% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workplace.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/1E5ADA69-1DF0-4680-A16A-F376109E9091/0/SA_6_Regions_2007_04.pdf ''SA Regional Labour Force Data''], April 2007, Australian Bureau of Statistics Labour Force Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

===House prices===

Education forms an increasingly important part of the city's economy, with the South Australian Government and educational institutions attempting to position Adelaide as &quot;Australia's education hub&quot; and marketing it as a &quot;Learning City.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eduhub&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Verity |last=Edwards |title=Education attracts record numbers |work=The Weekend Australian |date=3 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of international students studying in Adelaide has increased rapidly in recent years to 23,300, of which 2,380 are secondary school students.&lt;ref name=&quot;eduhub&quot;/&gt; In addition to the city's existing institutions, foreign institutions have been attracted to set up campuses in order to increase its attractiveness as an education hub.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCL&quot;/&gt;

===Primary and secondary education===
At the level of [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of [[independent school|independent]] and [[Catholic school]]s. All schools provide education under the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]] (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.

===Tertiary education===
There are several South Australian [[TAFE South Australia|TAFE]] (Technical and Further Education) campuses located in the metropolitan area which provide a range of vocational education and training. There are three public universities local to Adelaide, as well as three constituent colleges of three foreign universities. The [[Flinders University of South Australia]], the [[University of Adelaide]] and the [[University of South Australia]] are based in Adelaide and were all ranked within the world's top 400 universities in the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' magazine in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2007/overall_rankings/top_400_universities/ |title=The world's top 400 universities, THES – QS World University Rankings |publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds |accessdate=20 May 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080505054632/http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2007/overall_rankings/top_400_universities |archivedate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic Torrens Building in [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]]&lt;ref&gt;The historic Torrens Building in Victoria Square was beautifully restored at (considerable) taxpayer expense not long before SA Premier [[Mike Rann]] announced that it would be used as the core of Adelaide's international university precinct.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; houses [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Heinz College Australia]], [[Cranfield University]]'s [[Defence College of Management and Technology]], and [[University College London]]'s School of Energy and Resources (Australia), and constitute the city's international university precinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goingtouni.gov.au/Main/CoursesAndProviders/ProvidersAndCourses/HigherEducationProviders/SA/CarnegieMellonUniversity.htm |work=GoingToUni.gov.au |publisher=Government of South Australia |title=Carnegie Mellon University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Adelaide]], with 20,478 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/uni/facts/ |title=Facts &amp; Figures |publisher= University of Adelaide |accessdate=20 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is Australia's third-oldest university, and a member of the leading &quot;[[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]]&quot;. It has five campuses throughout the state, including two in the city-centre, and also has a campus in Singapore. The [[University of South Australia]], with 36,000 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/pas/bai/keystatistics/studentnumbers.asp |title=Key Statistics |publisher= University of South Australia |accessdate=20 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has two North Terrace campuses, three other campuses in the metropolitan area and campuses at [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]] and [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]]. The [[Flinders University of South Australia]], with 16,237 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/about/our-university/our-facts-and-figures.cfm |title=Our facts and figures |publisher= Flinders University |accessdate=20 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in the southern suburb of [[Bedford Park, South Australia|Bedford Park]], alongside the [[Flinders Medical Centre]].

[[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] became the first American university to establish a campus in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu.au/about-heinz-australia/index.aspx |title=About Heinz Australia: Carnegie Mellon Heinz College |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it established two postgraduate campuses in the [[Adelaide city centre]] in 2006: the [[Heinz College Australia]] in Victoria Square and the Entertainment Technology Center &lt;small&gt;''(sic)''&lt;/small&gt; in [[Light Square, Adelaide|Light Square]]. [[Cranfield University]] followed suit in 2007 and established a postgraduate campus in Victoria Square alongside the Heinz College.

===Research===
In addition to the universities, there are a number of organisations involved in research with significant establishments in the metropolitan area. These tend to be geographically clustered:

*Located at the east end of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]: [[Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science|IMVS]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imvs.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/SA+Pathology+Internet+Content/IMVS/About+Us/History/ History], [http://www.imvs.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/SA+Pathology+Internet+Content/IMVS/About+Us/Our+Research/ Our research], Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson Institute;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansoninstitute.sa.gov.au About us], [http://www.hansoninstitute.sa.gov.au/aboutus/history.php History], Hanson Institute&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Adelaide Hospital|RAH]]; [[National Wine Centre of Australia|National Wine Centre]].

==Cultural==
[[File:AGSAfront.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], and part of the [[South Australian Museum]] on North Terrace.]]
While established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early-on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the vine cuttings that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]].

After the Second World War, [[Italians]], [[Greeks]], Dutch, [[Poles]] and many other European nationalities came to make a new start. An influx of Asian immigrants following the [[Vietnam War]], and more recently many African refugees, have added to Adelaide's multicultural mix.

===Arts and entertainment===
Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers of both major political parties. The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] and [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]] were established in 1960 under Thomas Playford. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970, and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]].

Over time, the Adelaide Festival has expanded to include the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]], [[Adelaide Film Festival]], [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]], [[Adelaide Writers' Week]], and [[WOMADelaide]], all held predominately in the autumnal month of March (that month is sometimes jocularly called 'mad March' by locals due to the hectic clustering of these events). Other festivals include [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]] celebration), [[Tasting Australia]] (a biennial food and wine affair), and the [[Royal Adelaide Show]] (an annual [[agricultural show]] and [[state fair]]). There are also many international cultural fairs, most notably the German [[Schützenfest]] and Greek [[Glendi]]. Adelaide is also home to the [[Adelaide Christmas Pageant]], the world's largest [[Santa Claus parade|Christmas parade]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} As the state capital, Adelaide is also home to a great number of cultural institutions with many located along the boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], with around 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection.

Situated adjacent are the [[South Australian Museum]] and [[State Library of South Australia]], while the [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]], [[National Wine Centre]] and [[Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute]] are located nearby in the [[East End, Adelaide|East End]] of the city. The [[Adelaide Festival Centre]], on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]], with other venues including the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] and the city's many smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars. The [[music of Adelaide]] has produced various musical groups and individuals who have achieved both national and international fame. This includes the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Adelaide Youth Orchestra]], rock bands: [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[The Superjesus]], [[Wolf &amp; Cub]], [[Fire! Santa Rosa, Fire!]], roots/blues group [[The Audreys]], internationally acclaimed metal acts [[I Killed The Prom Queen]] and [[Double Dragon (band)|Double Dragon]], popular Australian hip-hop outfit [[Hilltop Hoods]], pop acts, [[Orianthi]], [[Guy Sebastian]], and [[Wes Carr]], as well as internationally successful tribute act The [[Australian Pink Floyd Show]].

Noted rocker [[Jimmy Barnes]] spent most of his youth in the northern suburb of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]]. The first ''[[Australian Idol]]'' winner, [[Guy Sebastian]], hails from the north-eastern suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]]. American musician [[Ben Folds]] used to base himself in Adelaide when he was married to Australian Frally Hynes. Folds recorded a song about Adelaide before he moved away from the city. In addition to its own WOMADelaide, Adelaide attracts several touring music festivals, including [[Big Day Out]], [[Parklife Festival|Parklife]] and [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway]].

====Concert venues====
Adelaide pop-concert venues (past and present) include: [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]]; [[Adelaide Festival Theatre]]; [[Adelaide Oval]]; [[Apollo Stadium]]; [[Memorial Drive Park]]; [[Thebarton Theatre]]. Other concert and live theatre venues include: [[Adelaide Town Hall]]; [[Dunstan Playhouse]]; Her Majesty's Theatre.

===Media===
[[File:Advertiser Building.JPG|right|thumb|[[Keith Murdoch|Sir Keith Murdoch House]], named after the founder of ''[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]'', is the headquarters for the publisher of Adelaide's daily newspaper, ''The Advertiser''.]]

====Newspapers====
Newspapers in Adelaide are dominated by [[News Corporation]] publications—Adelaide being the birthplace of News Corporation itself. The only South Australian daily newspaper is [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|''The Advertiser'']], published by News Corporation six days a week, while the Sunday paper is the [[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|''Sunday Mail'']].

There are eleven suburban community newspapers published weekly, known collectively as the ''[[Messenger Newspapers]]'', also published by a subsidiary of News Corporation. The ''[[The Independent Weekly]]'' was a small independent newspaper providing one alternative view, but abolished its print edition in November 2010 and now exists as a digital daily newsletter only. Two national daily newspapers are circulated in the city: ''[[The Australian]]'' and its weekend publication, ''The Weekend Australian'', also published by News Corporation; and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' published by [[John Fairfax Holdings|Fairfax]]. Interstate dailies, ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', published by Fairfax, are also typically available. ''[[The Adelaide Review]]'' is a free paper published fortnightly, and other independent magazine-style papers are published, but are not as widely available.

====Television====
All of the five Australian national television networks broadcast both [[Analog television|analogue]] [[PAL]] and [[High-definition television|high definition digital]] services in Adelaide. They share three transmission towers on the ridge near the summit of Mount Lofty. The two government-funded stations are run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC1) and the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS One). The [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]] both own their Adelaide stations ([[SAS-7]] and [[ADS-10]] respectively).

Adelaide's [[NWS-9]] is affiliated with the [[Nine Network]] and was owned by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] until the sale to [[WIN Corporation]] in May 2007. New digital-only channels available in addition to ABC1, Seven, Nine, Ten and SBS One include [[One HD]], [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]], [[ABC2]], [[ABC3]], [[ABC News 24]], [[SBS Two]], [[7Two]], [[7mate]], [[GEM HD]] and [[Go! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]]. Adelaide also has a [[Community television in Australia|community television]] station, [[C31 Adelaide]]. The [[Foxtel]] [[pay TV]] service is available as [[cable television]] in a few areas, and as [[satellite television]] to the entire metropolitan area. It is resold by a number of other brands, mostly telephone companies.

As part of a nation-wide phase-out of analog television in Australia, Adelaide's analog TV service is slated to be shut down in the second half of 2013.

====Radio====
There are twenty radio stations that serve the metropolitan area, as well as four community stations that serve only parts of the metropolitan area. Of the twenty full coverage stations, there are six commercial stations, six community stations, six national stations and two narrowcast stations. A complete list can be found at [[List of radio stations in Australia#Adelaide]].

Commercial stations include:
* AM Band: [[Cruise 1323]]; [[FIVEaa|FIVEaa 1395]]
* FM Band: [[Nova 91.9]]; [[Mix 102.3]]; [[Triple M|Triple M 104.7]]; [[SAFM|SAFM 107.1]]

[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] stations include:
* AM Band: [[Radio National|Radio National 729]]; [[891 ABC Adelaide|891 Adelaide (Local Radio)]]; [[ABC NewsRadio|NewsRadio 972]]
* FM Band: [[ABC Classic FM|Classic FM 103.9]]; and [[Triple J|Triple J 105.5]].

==Sport==
[[File:Adelaide Oval 2006-2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adelaide Oval]] during a cricket match in 2006.]]
The main sports played professionally in Adelaide are [[Australian rules football]], [[soccer]], [[cricket]], [[netball]] and [[basketball]]. Adelaide is the home of two [[Australian Football League]] teams: the [[Adelaide Crows]] and  [[Port Adelaide Power]]. A local [[Australian rules football|football]] league, the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]], is made up of nine teams from around Adelaide.

Adelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/01/17/australian-sport-owes-much-to-little-old-adelaide/ Australian sport owes much to little old Adelaide], The Roar, Retrieved on 21 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Most large sporting events take place at either [[AAMI Stadium]] or the historic [[Adelaide Oval]], home of the [[Southern Redbacks]] cricket team. Adelaide hosts an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of [[One Day International]] cricket matches. [[Memorial Drive Park]], adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host the [[Adelaide International]], a major men's tennis tournament in the lead-up to the Australian Open before the tournament was moved to [[Brisbane]] in 2009. Adelaide's professional [[football (soccer)]] team, [[Adelaide United]], play in the [[A-League]]. Founded in 2003, their home ground is [[Hindmarsh Stadium]], which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few purpose-built soccer stadia in Australia. In 2008 the [[Cronulla Sharks]], an Australian [[NRL]] franchise, and the South Australian Government announced a three year contract in which the Sharks will play a single home game each season at Hindmarsh. Unfortunately this only happened for 2009. From 2010 the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury Bulldogs]] signed an agreement to play one home game per season at the Adelaide Oval for three years with the hope of establishing a strong supporter base in Adelaide.

Adelaide has two professional [[basketball]] teams, the mens team being the [[Adelaide 36ers]] who play in the [[National Basketball League Australia|NBL]] and the women's team, the [[Adelaide Lightning]] who play in the [[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]]. The 36ers play their home games at the [[Distinctive Homes Dome|The Dome]] while the Lightning mostly play at the Wayville Sports Centre and occasionally at The Dome. Adelaide has a professional [[netball]] team, the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]] play in the trans-Tasman netball competition, the [[ANZ Championship]], with home games played at [[ETSA Park]]. The Thunderbirds also occasionally play games or finals at The Dome or the Adelaide Entertainment Centre. Adelaide hosts the [[Tour Down Under]] bicycle race, the largest cycling event outside Europe and the first event outside Europe with [[UCI ProTour]] status.

The [[Australian Grand Prix]] for [[Formula One]] racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on a [[Adelaide Street Circuit|street circuit]] in the city's eastern parklands.&lt;ref name=&quot;f1-move&quot;/&gt; The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful [[Adelaide 500|Clipsal 500]] for [[V8 Supercar]] racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a [[rallying|rally]] of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.

The [[World Solar Challenge]] race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide will host the [http://www.worldbowls2012.com 2012 World Bowls Championships] at Lockleys Bowling Club. Adelaide will become the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.

==Infrastructure==
===Health===
Adelaide's first hospital is the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] (RAH). Founded in 1840, it is one of the major hospitals in Adelaide and is a [[teaching hospital]] of the University of Adelaide. It has a capacity of 705 beds. Two other RAH campuses which specialise in specific patient services are located in the suburbs of Adelaide – the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]], and the [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] Campus Mental Health Service. Four other large hospitals in the Adelaide area are: the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Women's and Children's Hospital]] (305 beds), which is located on King William Road in North Adelaide; the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] (340 beds), located in Woodville, the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] (500 beds), located in Bedford Park and in the northern suburbs, and the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] (198 beds) in Elizabeth. These hospitals are also associated with medical schools. The Women's and Children's, the Queen Elizabeth and the Lyell McEwin are affiliated with the [[University of Adelaide]], Flinders Medical Centre is affiliated [[Flinders University]], and the Lyell McEwin is also affiliated with the [[University of South Australia]].

In June 2007 the State Government announced a series of overhauls to the health sector that would see a new hospital constructed on railyards at the west end of the city, to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital located at the east end of the city. Should it go ahead, the new 800 bed hospital would cost A$1.7 bn and be named the &quot;Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital&quot; after the [[Marjorie Jackson|former Governor of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Owen | first = Michael | title =800 beds, helipad and train station: Our 'Marj' hospital | newspaper = [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | page = 5 | date = 7 June 2007 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009, at the former governor's request, the state government chose to drop this name and instead transfer the Royal Adelaide Hospital name to the proposed facility.

In addition, major upgrades would see the Flinders Medical Centre become the primary centre for health care for the southern suburbs, while upgrades for the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] in Elizabeth would see that become the centre for the northern suburbs. The trio of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the [[Modbury Hospital]] and the Noarlunga Hospital would become specialist elective surgery centres. The Repatriation General Hospital would also expand its range of specialty areas beyond veterans' health to incorporate stroke, orthopaedic rehabilitation and aged care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=1712 |title='News: New $1.7 billion hospital spearheads health reform' |publisher=Ministers.sa.gov.au |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the &quot;Global Financial Crisis&quot; of 2008, it remains to be seen if and how these initiatives will proceed.

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}
[[File:GlenelgTramCityWest.jpg|right|thumb|Tram at the former City West terminus, en route to [[Glenelg Tram|Glenelg]], the line has since been extended.]]
Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan-wide [[public transport]] system, which is managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|metropolitan railways]], and the Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]], which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]].

Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a &quot;twenty-minute city&quot;, with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now often considered inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic, and often experience traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metro Malcontent – The Twenty Minute City No More|work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia|format=PDF|year=2005|url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\document_677.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2008}} (1.18MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelaide has one freeway and two expressways; the [[South Eastern Freeway]], connecting the city with the Adelaide Hills and beyond to [[Murray Bridge]], the [[Port River Expressway]] connecting Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to interstate routes, and the [[Southern Expressway]], an [[Reversible lane|interchangeable one-way road]] connecting the southern suburbs with the city proper. The [[Gawler bypass road|Gawler Bypass]] skirting [[Gawler]] is another expressway style, high speed inter-urban corridor. In February 2010, the current state government announced plans to upgrade the Southern Expressway to a dual direction expressway if it was re-elected at the next State election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/17/2822003.htm|title=No more one-way Southern Expressway|date=18 February 2010|work=ABC News Online|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third expressway, the [[Northern Expressway]] (formerly the [[Sturt Highway]] extension), a northern suburbs bypass route—connecting the Gawler Bypass to Port Wakefield Road—started construction in 2008. There are also plans for major upgrades to busy sections of [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]], including road widening and underpasses of [[Anzac Highway]] (completed in 2009), Grange Road, Port Road and the Outer Harbour Railway Line, during the first stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/southroad_upgrade/index.asp South Road Upgrade'']{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Airports====
The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial Airports, [[Adelaide Airport|Adelaide]] and [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]].

[[Adelaide Airport]], located in Adelaide's western suburbs, is designed to serve in excess of 6.3&amp;nbsp;million passengers annually. The dual international/domestic terminal named T1 incorporates glass aerobridges and has the ability to cater for the [[Airbus A380]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Innes | first = Stuart | title = Super airliner cleared to land at our new airport | newspaper = The Advertiser (Adelaide) | date = 10 January 2005 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is designed to handle 27 aircraft simultaneously and is capable of processing 3,000 passengers per hour. Unusually for a major city, it is located only seven kilometres (4.4&amp;nbsp;mi) from the [[Adelaide city centre]]. The airport is serviced by five international airlines in addition to domestic, regional and charter operators, including: [[Air New Zealand]], [[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Pacific Blue Airlines]], [[QantasLink]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adelaide Airport: Operators |url=http://www.aal.com.au/operators/default.aspx |accessdate=27 January 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080718225956/http://www.aal.com.au/operators/default.aspx |archivedate = 18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adelaide airport currently has direct flights servicing Denpasar (Bali, Indonesia), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Nadi (Fiji), Hong Kong, Singapore and Auckland (New Zealand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2009 Northern Winter Timetable |url=http://www.aal.com.au/lib/pdf/09NorthernWinterTimetableFinal2.pdf |accessdate=2 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, Adelaide Airport was rated the world's second best airport in the 5–15&amp;nbsp;million passengers category at the [[Airports Council International]] (ACI) 2006 awards in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World's top customer service airports recognised |publisher=Airports Council International |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2008 |url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-6^12875_666_2__}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parafield Airport]], Adelaide's second airport, located eighteen kilometres (11.2&amp;nbsp;mi) north of the CBD, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes.

===Utilities===
[[File:Happy Valley Reservoir 20070223.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] in early 2007]]

Adelaide's energy requirements are met by a variety of companies who separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Some of the major companies are: [[TRUenergy]], which generates electricity; [[ElectraNet]], which transmits electricity from the generators to the distribution network; [[ETSA Utilities]] (formerly a government-owned company which was privatised by the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] Government in the 1990s), which distributes electricity from transmission companies to end users; and [[AGL Energy]], which retails gas and electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnergySA1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Industry structure | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure | url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&amp;tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050624044124/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&amp;tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial investment has been made in maintenance and reinforcement of the electricity supply network to provide continued reliability of supply.

Adelaide derives most of its electricity from a gas-fired plant operated by [[AGL Energy]] at [[Torrens Island Power Station, South Australia|Torrens Island]], with more coming from power stations at [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and Pelican Point, and from connections to the national grid. Gas is mainly supplied from the [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]] Gas Processing Plant in the [[Cooper Basin]], and is piped to Adelaide and other areas within the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnergySA2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Supply Security | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure | url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&amp;tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050624044821/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&amp;tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small part of supply also comes from wind turbines at [[Sellicks Hill, South Australia|Sellicks Hill]], and a trial of more turbines on city buildings is underway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Premier Rann&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Mini Wind Turbines whirl into city buildings | work=Premier of South Australia | url=http://www.premier.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=624 | accessdate=6 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], [[Myponga Reservoir|Myponga]], [[Millbrook Reservoir|Millbrook]], [[Hope Valley Reservoir|Hope Valley]], [[Little Para Reservoir|Little Para]] and [[South Para Reservoir|South Para]]. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]]. A sea water desalination plant capable of supplying half of Adelaide's water requirements (100GL per annum) is currently being planned, with construction expected to be completed by 2012. The provision of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]].

'''Alan Garner''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born in [[Congleton]], [[Cheshire]],  17 October 1934) is an English writer whose work is firmly rooted in [[Cheshire]].

==Biography==
Alan Garner spent his early childhood in [[Alderley Edge]], Cheshire, England, and he remains associated with the area. Many of his works, including ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'' and ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]'', are drawn from local legends and locations.  

He had long periods of ill health in childhood and was twice declared dead.

:&quot;He spent most of the first eight years of his life in a small, white sickbed....'By day, it amounted to sensory deprivation. I lay in a bedroom that was whitewashed and had cheesecloth stretched across the windows...I was so bored, I would create my own out-of-body experiences....At night, it was worse. When you're lying in the semi-darkness, and the moon is coming up, and half of you is paralysed, there is no end to the terrible things a heap of clothes can change into.'&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Alan Garner, ''Radio Times'' interview, 14 January 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Manchester Grammar School]] (where a library is named after him) and studied Classics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].

His early books were [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Attebery]], &quot;Alan Garner&quot;, in: [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed. 
''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. New York: Scribner's, 1985, pp.1023-1030.&lt;/ref&gt; marketed for [[Children's literature|children]], although he was never comfortable with being labelled simply as a &quot;children's writer&quot;, saying that he had no intention one way or the other about writing specifically for children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/intrvws/garner.htm Garner Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent works, ''Strandloper'' and ''Thursbitch'', are more suited for adult readers. ''[[The Stone Book]]'' (which received the [[Phoenix Award]] in 1996) is poetic in style and inspiration. Garner pays particular attention to language, and strives to render the cadence of the Cheshire tongue in modern English. This he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading &quot;[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]&quot;: the footnotes would not have been needed by his father. This and other aspects of his writing are the subject of [[Neil Philip]]'s ''[[A Fine Anger]], (Collins, 1981)'', which offers a detailed analysis of his work.

His collection of essays and public talks, ''[[The Voice That Thunders]]'', contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with [[bipolar disorder]]), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. Garner is an accomplished public speaker.

Garner here reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought (at the height of the [[neoliberal]] tide) which preceded ''Strandloper'' to 'forsake &quot;literature&quot;, and become instead a &quot;popular&quot; writer, cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Garner, ''The Voice That Thunders'' (London 1997) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Garner feared that 'making series...would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death'&lt;ref&gt;Garner, ''Thunders'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - on analogy perhaps with [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]]'s dictum that 'the ruin of every novelist who has come up has been effected by driving him into a groove'&lt;ref&gt;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, ''The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' (London 2001) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; and felt unable to comply.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic number''' is a number that is a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] (or equivalently, [[integer]]) coefficients. Numbers such as [[pi|π]] that are not algebraic are said to be [[transcendental number|transcendental]]; [[almost all]] real numbers are transcendental. (Here &quot;almost all&quot; has the sense &quot;all but a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero&quot;; see Properties below.)

==Examples==
*The [[rational number]]s, expressed as the quotient of two [[integer]]s ''a'' and ''b'', ''b'' not equal to zero, satisfy the above definition because &lt;math&gt;x = a/b&lt;/math&gt; is the root of &lt;math&gt;bx-a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972:159-160 and pp. 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some [[irrational number]]s are algebraic and some are not:
** The numbers &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt[3]{3}/2&lt;/math&gt; are algebraic since they are the roots of polynomials &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;8x^3 - 3&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
** The [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
** The numbers [[Pi|&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;]] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]]);&lt;ref&gt;Also [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] can be used to &quot;produce as many examples of transcendentals numbers as we please,&quot; cf Hardy and Wright p. 161ff&lt;/ref&gt; hence they are transcendental.

* The [[constructible number]]s (those that, starting with a unit, can be constructed with straightedge and compass, e.g. the square root of 2).

*The [[quadratic surd]]s (roots of a quadratic polynomial &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; with integer coefficients &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic &lt;math&gt;(a = 1)&lt;/math&gt; then the roots are [[quadratic integer]]s.

* [[Gaussian integer]]s: those complex numbers &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt; where both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are integers are also quadratic integers.

* [[Trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; (except when undefined). For example, each of cos(&lt;math&gt;\pi/7&lt;/math&gt;), cos(&lt;math&gt;3\pi/7&lt;/math&gt;), cos(&lt;math&gt;5\pi/7&lt;/math&gt;) satisfies &lt;math&gt;8x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals, and so these three cosines are ''conjugate'' algebraic numbers. Likewise, tan(&lt;math&gt;3\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;), tan(&lt;math&gt;7\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;), tan(&lt;math&gt;11\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;), tan(&lt;math&gt;15\pi/16&lt;/math&gt;) all satisfy the irreducible polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^4 - 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integers]].

==Properties==
[[File:Algebraicszoom.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers coloured by degree. (red=1, green=2, blue=3, yellow=4)]]
* The set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] (enumerable).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright 1972:160&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hence, the set of algebraic numbers has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero (as a subset of the complex numbers), i.e. &quot;[[Almost everywhere|almost all]]&quot; complex numbers are not algebraic.
* Given an algebraic number, there is a unique [[monic polynomial]] (with rational coefficients) of least [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. If its minimal polynomial has degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then the algebraic number is said to be of ''degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''. An algebraic number of degree 1 is a [[rational number]].
* All algebraic numbers are [[computable number|computable]] and therefore [[definable number|definable]].

==The field of algebraic numbers==
The sum, difference, product and quotient of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the [[resultant]]), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], sometimes denoted by '''A''' (which may also denote the [[adele ring]]) or &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/span&gt;. Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are ''algebraic numbers'' is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals.

==Related fields==
===Numbers defined by radicals===
All numbers which can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking ''n''th roots (where ''n'' is a positive integer) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers which cannot be obtained in this manner. All of these numbers are solutions to polynomials of degree ≥&amp;nbsp;5. This is a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). An example of such a number is the unique real root of polynomial {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x'' &amp;minus; 1}} (which is approximately 1.167304).

===Closed-form number===
{{Main|Closed-form number}}
Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to &quot;[[closed-form number]]s&quot;, which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, any number that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – these are called &quot;elementary numbers&quot;, and include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers explicitly defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as ''e'' or log(2).

==Algebraic integers==
{{Main|algebraic integer}}
[[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers coloured by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer).]]
An '''[[algebraic integer]]''' is an algebraic number which is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are {{nowrap|1=5 + 13√2}}, {{nowrap|1=2 &amp;minus; ''6''i}}, and {{nowrap|1=½(1 + ''i''√3).}} (Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{nowrap|1=''x'' &amp;minus; ''k''}} for all {{nowrap|1=''k'' &amp;isin; '''Z'''.)}}

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers which are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If ''K'' is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in ''K'', and is frequently denoted as ''O&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''.
These are the prototypical examples of [[Dedekind domain]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''automorphism''' is an [[isomorphism]] from a [[mathematical object]] to itself. It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''automorphism group'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.

==Definition==
The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of &quot;mathematical object&quot; in question and what, precisely, constitutes an &quot;isomorphism&quot; of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.

In category theory, an automorphism is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e. a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[Category theory#Properties of morphisms|isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word).

This is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.

In the context of [[abstract algebra]], for example, a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An isomorphism is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]]. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example: [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).

The [[identity morphism]] ([[identity mapping]]) is called the '''trivial automorphism''' in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called '''nontrivial automorphisms'''.

==Automorphism group==
If the automorphisms of an object ''X'' form a set (instead of a proper [[class (set theory)|class]]), then they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[Function composition|composition]] of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the '''automorphism group''' of ''X''. That this is indeed a group is simple to see:
* [[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: composition of two endomorphisms is another endomorphism.
* [[Associativity]]: composition of morphisms is ''always'' associative.
* [[Identity element|Identity]]: the identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself which exists by definition.
* [[Inverse element|Inverses]]: by definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.

The automorphism group of an object ''X'' in a category ''C'' is denoted Aut&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), or simply Aut(''X'') if the category is clear from context.

==Examples==
* In [[set theory]], an automorphism of a set ''X'' is an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of ''X''. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.
* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.
* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' → Aut(''G'') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(''G'') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''. Thus, if ''G'' has [[Trivial group|trivial]] center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.&lt;ref name=Pahl&gt;

{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kvoaoWOfqd8C&amp;pg=PA376 |page=376 |chapter=§7.5.5 Automorphisms |title=Mathematical foundations of computational engineering |edition=Felix Pahl translaton |author=PJ Pahl, R Damrath |isbn=3540679952 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] ''V'' → ''V''. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on ''V''. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of ''V'' is the same as the [[general linear group]], GL(''V'').
* A field automorphism is a [[bijection|bijective]] [[ring homomorphism]] from a [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself. In the cases of the [[rational number]]s ('''Q''') and the [[real number]]s ('''R''') there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of '''R''' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of '''R''' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in '''R'''). In the case of the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends '''R''' into '''R''': [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]], but there are infinitely ([[uncountable|uncountably]]) many &quot;wild&quot; automorphisms (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yale | first = Paul B. | journal = Mathematics Magazine | title = Automorphisms of the Complex Numbers | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | month = May | year = 1966 | pages = 135–141 | url = http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Ford/PaulBYale.pdf | doi = 10.2307/2689301 | jstor = 2689301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field automorphisms are important to the theory of [[field extension]]s, in particular [[Galois extension]]s. In the case of a Galois extension ''L''/''K'' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of ''L'' fixing ''K'' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.
* In [[graph theory]] an [[graph automorphism|automorphism of a graph]] is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges. In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.
* For relations, see [[Isomorphism#A relation-preserving isomorphism|relation-preserving automorphism]].
** In [[order theory]], see [[order automorphism]].
* In topology, morphisms between topological spaces are called [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]], and an automorphism of a topological space is a [[homeomorphism]] of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see [[homeomorphism group]]). In this example it is ''not sufficient'' for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.
* An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(''M'').
* In [[Riemannian geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].
* In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a bijective [[biholomorphy|biholomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[Möbius transformation]]s.

==History==
One of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his [[Icosian Calculus]], where he discovered an order two automorphism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

{{quotation|so that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by relations of perfect reciprocity.}}

==Inner and outer automorphisms==
In some categories—notably [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; automorphisms.

In the case of groups, the [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element ''a'' of a group ''G'', conjugation by ''a'' is the operation φ&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''G''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''G'' given by φ&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') = ''aga''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (or ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''ga''; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by ''a'' is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a [[normal subgroup]] of Aut(''G''), denoted by Inn(''G''); this is called [[Goursat's lemma]].

The other automorphisms are called [[outer automorphism]]s. The [[quotient group]] Aut(''G'')&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Inn(''G'') is usually denoted by Out(''G''); the non-trivial elements are the cosets that contain the outer automorphisms.

The same definition holds in any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or [[algebra over a field|algebra]] where ''a'' is any [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]. For [[Lie algebra]]s the definition is slightly different.

The '''accordion''' is a box-shaped [[musical instrument]] of the [[bellows]]-driven [[free reed aerophone|free-reed aerophone]] family, sometimes referred to as a [[squeezebox]]. A person who plays the accordion is called an ''accordionist''.

It is played by compressing or expanding a bellows whilst pressing buttons or [[Musical keyboard|keys]], causing [[valve]]s, called ''pallets'', to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called ''[[reed (instrument)|reeds]]'', that vibrate to produce sound inside the body.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument is sometimes considered a [[one-man-band]] as it needs no accompanying instrument. The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.

The accordion is often used in [[folk music]] in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. It is commonly associated with [[busking]]. [[Accordion#Use in popular music|Some popular music acts]] also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is sometimes used in both solo and orchestra performances of [[classical music]].

The oldest name for this group of instruments is actually ''harmonika'', from the Greek ''harmonikos'', meaning ''harmonic, musical''. Today, native versions of the name ''accordion'' are more common. These names are a reference to the type of accordion [[Accordion#History|patented by Cyrill Demian]], which concerned &quot;automatically coupled chords on the bass side&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dyremose, Jeanette &amp; Lars, ''Det levende bælgspil'' (2003), p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
[[File:Spirk.ogg|thumb|left|A [[diatonic button accordion]] being played.]]
Accordions are made in a large number of different configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:

* Some accordions are ''bisonoric'', meaning they produce different [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es depending on the direction of bellows movement
* Others are ''unisonoric'' and produce the same pitch regardless of the direction of bellows movement
* Some accordions use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual
* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual
* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual
* Some accordions are capable of playing in [[register (music)|register]]s different from others
* Additionally, different accordion craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers in a slightly different manner, essentially &quot;personalizing&quot; the end result, such as an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might [[voicing (music)|voice]] a particular instrument

=== Universal components ===
==== Bellows ====
{{Listen
|filename=AccordionBellowsSounds.ogg
|title=Accordion bellows controlled sounds
|description=A sample of effects that can be achieved with the bellows - 949 KB
|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. It is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reed]]s and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.

The keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows: some bellows effects as illustrated below:
# Bellows used for volume control/fade
# Repeated change of direction (&quot;bellows shake&quot;)
# Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals
# Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance
# Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving, which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions particularly for this instrument

==== Body ====
The accordion's body consists of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals, respectively. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the [[sound]] to better project. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment, however skilled players can reverse these roles.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;[[Guido Deiro]] claimed to be the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May–June 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as  to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.

==== Pallet mechanism ====
The accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende bælgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette &amp; Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|750px|thumb|center|An illustration of the pallet mechanism in Piano Accordions. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. Note that this is a side view of a piano accordion keyboard, so a similar effective mechanical pallet movement is used for buttons, both on button accordions and bass mechanisms, including the Stradella ''machine'']]

=== Variable components ===
There is a wide range of instruments that are called ''accordion''. The different types have varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in Conjunto and [[Tejano music]].

==== Right-hand manual systems ====

[[File:PianoAccordeon.jpg|166px|right|thumb|A piano accordion]]
Different systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody. Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits&lt;ref name=&quot;pianovschromatic&quot;&gt;Dan Lindgren, ''Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion'' [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf]
 wayback machine Online PDF&lt;/ref&gt; by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different &quot;type&quot;:

* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a [[Russia]]n variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two of these systems exist
* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard limited to the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key scale available
* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a [[piano]], at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows
* [[6-plus-6-instruments|6-plus-6]]-accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row. So there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions.

==== Left-hand manual systems ====
[[File:120-button Stradella bass system chart.png|thumb|right|250px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today]]
Different systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:

* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for [[chord (music)|chords]]
* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in [[Belgium|Belgian]] chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has 3 rows of basses, 3 rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers 1 and 5, and more space between the buttons. This system was poorly traded outside of native Belgium
* Various free-bass systems for greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords. These are often chosen for playing [[classical music]]

==== Reed ranks and switches ====
{{main|Accordion reed ranks &amp; switches}}
[[File:reedsinset.jpg|166px|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks &amp; switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]

Inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''ranks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed ranks will be brought into operation, organized from high to low [[register (music)|register]]s. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre. See the [[accordion reed ranks &amp; switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples.

All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches.

==== Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions ====
In describing/pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (3 octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as '''Reeds: 5 + 3''', meaning 5 reeds on the treble side and 3 on the bass, and '''Registers: 13 + M , 7''', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special &quot;master&quot; which activates ALL ranks like the &quot;tutti&quot; on an organ, and 7 register switches on the bass side.

==== Straps ====
The larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder [[straps]] to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing.

Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.

=== Unusual accordions ===
[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|166px|right|thumb|Garmon player]]
Various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities—only a few have remained in use. For example:
*The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[Klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion
*The [[schwyzerörgeli]] or [[Switzerland|Swiss]] organ, which usually has a 3-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement – actually a subset of the Stradella system – that travel parallel to the bellows motion
*The [[Trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]] has a 2-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass
*In [[Scotland]], the favoured diatonic accordion is the instrument known as the [[British Chromatic Accordion]]. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered to be the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]&lt;ref&gt;p.98, Howard, Rob (2003) ''An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments'' Stockport: Robaccord Publications ISBN 0-9546711-0-4&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
The accordion is a free reed instrument and is in the same family as other instruments such as the [[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]] and [[khaen]]. The sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reeds did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as we know it today. Look at [[Free reed aerophone#History| Free reed aerophone History]] for more details.
[[File:8 key accordion.JPG|250px|right|thumb|8-key bisonoric diatonic accordion (c. 1830s)]]

The accordion's basic form is believed to have been invented in [[Berlin]] in 1822 by [[Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]]&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;There is not a single document to back up this belief, Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann was 16 years old at that time and we do have some handwriting of C.F. Buschschmann and his Father, but without any related notice within. First time of mentioned a aeoline was in a writing dated 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;, although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier. Engraved Name F. Löhner &lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;This is the accordion owned by Fredrik Dillner of Sweden which has the name F. Löhner [[Nürnberg]] engraved (stamped) on it. The Instrument was given to Johannes Dillner in the Year of 1830 or earlier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/essays/dillner_interview.html Interview With Fredrik Dillner - The Owner Of What May Be The World's Oldest Accordion] The Free-Reed Journal, 22 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Mette  &amp; Lisbet Torp (red.)

[[File:Dillner-accordion.jpg|thumb|Zitat Dillner Akkordeon]]

The accordion is one of several [[Europe]]an inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows. An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian descent, in [[Vienna]]&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 04 - 19 Jun 09 Using Way Back Machine to Display:
The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.) &lt;/ref&gt;

Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key; one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action).

The piano accordion was played in German speaking regions, then all over Europe. Some early portable Instrument with piano keys had been invented in 1821, but it started to actually be played much later, and built its reputation from there.
At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;German Text: &quot;Mit den Dekel des Balges, läßt sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so daß man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne Töne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, muß ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, würde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.&quot;
Translation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard has to be added, the bellows will be in between this two parts, every hand will be used to push buttons and push and pull the bellow at the same time or alternatively. Trough such a doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new will be invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts will be increased and the Instrument will be heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1831 at least the accordion had appeared in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Thursday, 3 March 1831; pg. 7; Issue 14477; col C :“POPULAR JOURNAL of MUSIC – On the 1st. Of March, price 2s., the third number, for 1831, of the HARMONICON. Contents. Musical Literature: - 1. Memoirs of Dr. Callcott – 2. Rodolphe Kreutzer- 3. On the Accordion and Symphonion...”&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' of that year as one new to British audiences&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, Mr Sedlatzek) &quot;At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : “GREAT CONCERT-ROOM – KING’S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called “a concertina,” an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It had also become popular with New Yorkers by at least the mid-1840s.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': “While we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days&quot;(i.e. mid-1840s) &quot;accordions were the real attraction to the public.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|166px|The first pages in Adolph Müller's accordion book]]
The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book, ''Schule für Accordion''. At the time, [[Vienna]] and [[London]] had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's [[flutina]] resembles Wheatstone's [[concertina]] in internal construction and [[tone color]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to [[diatonic]] button accordions still manufactured today.

Further innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability.

== Use in various music genres ==
{{main|Accordion music genres}}
The accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for &quot;[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,&quot; [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock, pop-rock, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.

=== Use in traditional music ===
{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|Accordion in traditional music}}

Invented in 1829, its popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was spread by Europeans who emigrated around the world. The accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Wagner, &quot;A Brief History of How the Accordion Changed the World,&quot; CD booklet notes for Planet Squeezebox, performed by various artists, (Roslyn, New York: Ellipsis Arts, 1995), 6&lt;/ref&gt; and has been integrated into [[traditional music]] styles all over the world: see the [[list of traditional music styles that incorporate the accordion]].

The accordion appeared in [[popular music]] from the 1900s-1960s. This half century is often called the &quot;Golden Age of the Accordion.&quot; Three players: [[Pietro Frosini]], and the two brothers [[Count]] [[Guido Deiro]] and [[Pietro Deiro]] were major influences at this time.

Most [[Vaudeville]] theaters closed during the [[Great Depression]], but accordionists during 1930s-1950s taught and performed for [[radio]]. During the 1950s through the 1980s the accordion received great exposure on television with performances by [[Myron Floren]] on [[the Lawrence Welk Show]].&lt;ref&gt;Myron Floren and Randee Floren, ''Accordion Man'', with a forward by Lawrence Welk (The Stephen Greene Press, Brattleboro, Vermont: 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accordion declined in popularity.
[[File:Antonia Begonia on Accordion.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A folk accordionist 2009]]

In [[popular music]], it is now generally considered exotic or old-fashioned to include the accordion, especially in music for advertisements. Some popular acts do use the instrument in their distinctive sounds. See the [[list of popular music acts that incorporate the accordion]].

In 1981, Nonesuch Records released the Digital LP, The Tango Project, featuring the accordionist Dr. William Schimmel. It became a number 1 hit on the classical music charts and won the Stereo Review Album of the Year Award and Grammy nominations in various categories. It later was released in CD form with two follow up albums, Two to Tango and Music from the Palm Court. The Tango Project later released a CD, White Rabbit, on the Newport Classic label. The Tango Project appears in the movie Scent of a Woman starring Al Pacino, can be heard in the films True Lies, All the Kings Men, Mr. and Mrs. Smith (trailer), HBO Sex and the City, Real Sex as well as Sesame St. The Tango Project is responsible for ushering in the Tango revival in America.

Dr. William Schimmel is also the featured accordionist on Tom Waits Raindogs (Island Records) and also performs on Tom Waits Frank's Wild Years (Island Records) and also was featured in the 1985 production of Frank's Wild Years at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Dr. Schimmel also appears with Tom Waits in a recording of the music of Kurt Weill (Lost in the Stars - A+M Records).
Schimmel also recorded a remake of As Tears Go By (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards) with Marianne Faithful in 1986 on Island Records.
The album title is Strange Weather - the title of a Tom Waits song on the same album.
 
In 1993, during their [[MTV Unplugged in New York|MTV Unplugged]] performance, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Krist Novoselic]] used accordion while covering [[The Vaselines]] song [[Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam]].

[[Eddie Vedder]] plays the accordion in the song &quot;Better Man&quot;, on [[Pearl Jam]]'s 1994 album ''[[Vitalogy]]''.

The New York band [[They Might Be Giants]] extensively use the accordion in many of their recordings, especially on earlier albums such as ''[[Apollo 18 (album)|Apollo 18]]''.

Perhaps the most famous accordionist in popular music is [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]], who has used the accordion in every album he has recorded, most extensively on his debut album. The accordion also features prominently in the [[folk metal]] genre.

[[Comedienne]] [[Judy Tenuta]] frequently uses an accordion in her act.

[[Julieta Venegas]] is an American-born (but of Mexican ancestry) musician who commonly uses an accordion to produce a unique and special effect on listeners. The unique flair of the accordion is used some of her most popular songs, such as El presente, and Me Voy.
[[Arcade Fire]] features an accordion in a few of their songs, notably in [[Wake Up (Arcade Fire song)|Wake Up]] and [[Neighborhood 2 (Laïka)|Neighborhood #2 (Laïka)]]

[[Panic at the disco]] frontman [[Brendon Urie]] plays the accordion, and the instrument features on their 2011 album [[Vices &amp; Virtues]] in the song &quot;Sarah Smiles&quot;.

[[NOFX]] guitarist [[Eric Melvin]] plays accordion on several songs, most notably on the song &quot;A Theme to a NOFX Album&quot;

=== Use in classical music ===
{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in classical music|Accordion in classical music}}

Although best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is ''{{lang|fr|Thême varié très brillant pour accordéon methode Reisner}}'', written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of [[Paris]]. Other composers, including the Russian [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the Italian [[Umberto Giordano]], and the American [[Charles Ives]] (1915), wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.

The first composer to write specifically for the [[chromatic music|chromatic]] accordion was [[Paul Hindemith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm ''Accordion Composers in German''] Accordion Online&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Austrian [[Alban Berg]] included an accordion in ''[[Wozzeck]]'', Op. 7. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Henry Doktorski, &quot;The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music,&quot; The Classical Free-Reed, Inc. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; American composer [[William P. Perry]] featured the accordion in his orchestral suite ''Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie'' (2008). The experimental composer [[Howard Skempton]] began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. Russian Bayan virtuoso Stas Venglevski has premiered contemporary works by [[Yehuda Yannay]], [[Anthony Galla-Rini]] and [[William Susman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stasv.com/WorldPremierePerformances.pdf WORLD PREMIERE PERFORMANCES] Premiere performances by Stas Venglevski&lt;/ref&gt;


===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The accordion is a traditional instrument in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is the dominant instrument used in [[sevdalinka]], a traditional genre of [[folk music]] from Bosnia-Herzegovina.

=== Brazil ===
The accordion is a traditional instrument in [[Brazil]]. Used in the style known as [[baião]] and [[forró]] in the northeast,in traditional music in the south of the country, a famous accordeonist is Renatto Borghetti, and used in sertanejo and caipira music in the south-east and mid-west regions of Brazil. [[Luiz Gonzaga]] is known as the king of baião, Mario Zan is the king of the accordion. Another famous player is [[Dominguinhos]].

=== Colombia ===
The accordion is also a traditional instrument in [[Colombia]]. Used in the style known as [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] in the Atlantic Coast of Colombia. Recently the Accordion has been used by Tropipop musicians such as Bacilos, Carlos Vives, and Andres Cabas, as well as Rock musicians like Juanes and Shakira. Vallenato has come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia. The legend of the Accordion's arrival in Colombia comes from a story of a ship wreck that was coming from Germany to Argentina. The wreck happened over the Magdalena river in the Atlantic coasts.

=== Use in heavy metal music ===
Accordionists in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] sub-genre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible [[keyboardists]] are usually more accessible for live performances.

Notably, the Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] has always had a full-time accordionist, employing [[classical music|classical]] and [[polka]]-style sensibilities alongside a violinist. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former [[hurdy-gurdy]] player for the Swiss melodic-death/folk metal band [[Eluveitie]], played a [[Helvetic]] accordion known as a zugerörgeli, which could be a distant relative (in one way or another) to the Swiss [[schwyzerörgeli]], as both are indigenous to and very rare outside of Switzerland.

The lead vocalist for the pirate metal band [[Alestorm]] plays a [[keytar]] and often uses it to make accordion sounds.

Also, the Keyboardist of the Quebequan folk-Metal band Vinlanders often uses accordion sounds with his keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Y_s_4ZmyE Vinlanders - Rasputin (Boney M Cover) (Live Montreal 22-04-10)] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing process ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
The best accordions are always fully hand-made, especially in the aspect of reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a far better tonal quality than even the best automatically manufactured reeds. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishdancemaster.com/ Yutaka Usuai], Japanese-born accordion craftsman.&lt;/ref&gt; a Japanese-born craftsman.

The manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081226093126/http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion how-products-encyclopedia_accordion] Old way Back link to: how-products-encyclopedia accordion&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous centres of production are the Italian cities of [[Stradella]] and [[Castelfidardo]], with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. Castelfidardo honours the memory of Paolo Soprani who was one the first large-scale producers. Larger scale production existed in Germany by [[Hohner]] and [[Weltmeister]], but these lost volume by the end of the 20th century.

The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligence—the [[sapience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''—can be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Dartmouth conference|Dartmouth proposal]], under [[#Philosophy|Philosophy]], below.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the [[mind]] and the ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by [[History of AI#AI in myth, fiction and speculation|myth]], [[artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction]] and [[philosophy of AI|philosophy]] since antiquity.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCorduck's thesis&quot;/&gt; Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism,&lt;ref&gt;The optimism referred to includes the predictions of early AI researchers (see [[History of AI#The optimism|optimism in the history of AI]]) as well as the ideas of modern [[transhumanism|transhumanists]] such as [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;/ref&gt; but has also suffered setbacks&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;setbacks&quot; referred to include the [[AI winter#Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966|ALPAC report]] of 1966, the abandonment of [[perceptrons]] in 1970, [[AI winter#The Lighthill report|the Lighthill Report]] of 1973 and the [[AI winter#The collapse of the Lisp machine market in 1987|collapse of the lisp machine market]] in 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI widely used&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- SUMMARIZING PROBLEMS, APPROACHES and TOOLS --&gt;
AI research is highly technical and specialized, and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fragmentation of AI&quot;/&gt; Subfields have grown up around particular institutions, the work of individual researchers, the solution of specific problems, longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Problems of AI&quot;/&gt; General intelligence (or &quot;[[strong AI]]&quot;) is still among the field's long term goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;General intelligence&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- AN ANCIENT DREAM (MCCORDUCK'S THESIS) --&gt;
Thinking machines and artificial beings appear in [[Greek myth]]s, such as [[Talos]] of [[Crete]], the bronze robot of [[Hephaestus]], and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion's]] [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in myth&quot;/&gt; Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization: animated [[cult image]]s were worshipped in [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cult images as artificial intelligence&quot;/&gt; and humanoid [[automaton]]s were built by [[King Mu of Zhou|Yan Shi]], [[Hero of Alexandria]] and [[Al-Jazari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Humanoid automata&quot;/&gt; It was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], [[Judah Loew]] and [[Paracelsus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Artificial beings&quot;/&gt; By the 19th and 20th centuries, artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' or [[Karel Čapek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]''.&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD MORE EXAMPLES. THIS IS ENOUGH. SEE SECTION AT BOTTOM OF ARTICLE ON SPECULATION.--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in early science fiction&quot;/&gt; [[Pamela McCorduck]] argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge, as she describes it, &quot;to forge the gods&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCorduck's thesis&quot;/&gt; Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes, fears and [[ethics of artificial intelligence|ethical concerns]] that are presented by artificial intelligence.

&lt;!-- MAJOR INTELLECTUAL PRECURSORS: LOGIC, THEORY OF COMPUTATION, CYBERNETICS, INFORMATION THEORY, EARLY NEURAL NETS --&gt;
Mechanical or [[formal reasoning|&quot;formal&quot; reasoning]] has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity. The study of logic led directly to the invention of the [[computer|programmable digital electronic computer]], based on the work of [[mathematician]] [[Alan Turing]] and others. Turing's [[theory of computation]] suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.&lt;ref&gt;This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the [[Church-Turing thesis]].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Formal reasoning&quot;/&gt; This, along with concurrent discoveries in [[neurology]], [[information theory]] and [[cybernetic]]s, inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI's immediate precursors&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- THE &quot;GOLDEN YEARS&quot; 1956-1974 --&gt;
The field of AI research was founded at [[Dartmouth Conferences|a conference]] on the campus of [[Dartmouth College]] in the summer of 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth conference&quot;/&gt; The attendees, including [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert Simon]], became the leaders of AI research for many decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hegemony of the Dartmouth conference attendees&quot;/&gt; They and their students wrote programs that were, to most people, simply astonishing:&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Norvig write &quot;it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish.&quot; {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; computers were solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golden years of AI&quot;/&gt; By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the [[DARPA|Department of Defense]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AI funding in the 60s&quot;/&gt; and laboratories had been established around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in England&quot;/&gt; AI's founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field: [[Herbert Simon]] predicted that &quot;machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do&quot; and [[Marvin Minsky]] agreed, writing that &quot;within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Optimism of early AI&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- FIRST AI WINTER --&gt;
They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.&lt;ref&gt;See {{See section|History of artificial intelligence|The problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, in response to the criticism of England's [[Sir James Lighthill]] and ongoing pressure from Congress to fund more productive projects, the U.S. and British governments cut off all undirected, exploratory research in AI. The next few years, when funding for projects was hard to find, would later be called an &quot;[[AI winter]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;First AI winter&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- BOOM OF THE 80's, SECOND AI WINTER --&gt;
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of [[expert systems]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Expert systems&quot;/&gt; a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's [[fifth generation computer]] project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research in the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in the 80s&quot;/&gt; However, beginning with the collapse of the [[Lisp Machine]] market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer lasting [[AI winter]] began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second AI winter&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- TO THE PRESENT --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:Kasparov v Deepblue.gif|thumb|left|Garry Kasparov versus Deep Blue, New York, 1997.]]   --&gt;
In the 1990s and early 21st century, AI achieved its greatest successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence is used for [[logistics]], [[data mining]], [[medical diagnosis]] and many other areas throughout the technology industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI widely used&quot;/&gt;
The success was due to several factors: the increasing computational power of computers (see [[Moore's law]]), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Formal methods in AI&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Watson Jeopardy.jpg|thumb|The artificial intelligence quiz show contestant &quot;Watson&quot;, appearing on ''Jeopardy!'' in 2011.]]
On 11 May 1997, [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=480–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a Stanford robot won the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/ DARPA Grand Challenge -- home page]&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2011, in a [[Jeopardy!]] [[quiz show]] exhibition match, [[IBM]]'s [[question answering system]], [[Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson]], defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, [[Brad Rutter]] and [[Ken Jennings]], by a significant margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Markoff | title=On ‘Jeopardy!' Watson Win Is All but Trivial | date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading-edge definition of artificial intelligence [[research]] is changing over time. One pragmatic definition is: &quot;AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how to do cost-effectively today.&quot; For example, in 1956 [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) was considered AI, but today, sophisticated OCR software with a context-sensitive [[spell checker]] and [[grammar checker]] software comes for free with most [[image scanner]]s. No one would any longer consider already-solved computing science problems like OCR &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; today. 

Low-cost entertaining chess-playing software is commonly available for tablet computers. [[DARPA]] no longer provides significant funding for chess-playing computing system development. The [[XBox 360]] gaming system November 2010 [[Kinect]] 3D-body-motion interface uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/2176-kinects-ai-breakthrough-explained.html Kinect's AI breakthrough explained]&lt;/ref&gt;, but few consumers realize the technology source. 

AI applications are no longer the exclusive domain of [[Department of defense]] R&amp;D, but are now common place consumer items and inexpensive intelligent toys.

In common usage, the term &quot;AI&quot; no longer seems to apply to off-the-shelf solved computing-science problems, which may have originally emerged out of years of AI research.

== Problems ==&lt;!--- This is linked to in the introduction to the article and to the &quot;AI research&quot; section --&gt;
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Problems of AI&quot;/&gt;

===Deduction, reasoning, problem solving ===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
&lt;!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS --&gt;
Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step-by-step reasoning that humans were often assumed to use when they solve puzzles, play board games or make logical deductions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reasoning&quot;/&gt; By the late 1980s and '90s, AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncertain reasoning&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- TWO IMPORTANT UNSOLVED PROBLEMS --&gt;
For difficult problems, most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources — most experience a &quot;[[combinatorial explosion]]&quot;: the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size. The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intractability&quot;/&gt;

Human beings solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments rather than the conscious, step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning&quot;/&gt; AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of &quot;sub-symbolic&quot; problem solving: [[embodied agent]] approaches emphasize the importance of [[sensorimotor]] skills to higher reasoning; [[neural net]] research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that give rise to this skill.

===Knowledge representation===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[Image:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]
{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}

[[Knowledge representation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge representation&quot;/&gt; and [[knowledge engineering]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge engineering&quot;/&gt; are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing categories and relations&quot;/&gt; situations, events, states and time;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing time&quot;/&gt; causes and effects;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing causation&quot;/&gt; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing knowledge about knowledge&quot;/&gt; and many other, less well researched domains. A complete representation of &quot;what exists&quot; is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] (borrowing a word from traditional [[philosophy]]), of which the most general are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ontology&quot;/&gt;

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:

;[[Default reasoning]] and the [[qualification problem]]: Many of the things people know take the form of &quot;working assumptions.&quot; For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969&lt;ref name=&quot;Qualification problem&quot;/&gt; as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic&quot;/&gt;

;The breadth of [[commonsense knowledge]]: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]] — they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breadth of commonsense knowledge&quot;/&gt; A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

;The subsymbolic form of some [[commonsense knowledge]]: Much of what people know is not represented as &quot;facts&quot; or &quot;statements&quot; that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it &quot;feels too exposed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gladwell|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non-consciously and sub-symbolically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intuition&quot;/&gt; Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]] or [[computational intelligence]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intuition&quot;/&gt;

===Planning===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[Image:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]

{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}

Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning&quot;/&gt; They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or &quot;value&quot;) of the available choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Information value theory&quot;/&gt;

In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical planning&quot;/&gt; However, if this is not true, it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Non-deterministic planning&quot;/&gt;

[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and [[competition]] of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Multi-agent planning&quot;/&gt;

===Learning===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Machine learning}}

[[Machine learning]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Machine learning&quot;/&gt; has been central to AI research from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. {{Harv|Turing|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: &quot;An Inductive Inference Machine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.std.com/~rjs/indinf56.pdf (pdf scanned copy of the original)] (version published in 1957, An Inductive Inference Machine,&quot; IRE Convention Record, Section on Information Theory, Part 2, pp. 56-62)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]]. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression takes a set of numerical input/output examples and attempts to discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs. In [[reinforcement learning]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Reinforcement learning&quot;/&gt; the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. These can be analyzed in terms of [[decision theory]], using concepts like [[utility (economics)|utility]]. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Computational learning theory&quot;/&gt;

===Natural language processing===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[File:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A [[parse tree]] represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a sentence according to some [[formal grammar]].]]
{{Main|Natural language processing}}

[[Natural language processing]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural language processing&quot;/&gt; gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak. Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own, by reading the existing text available over the internet. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]] (or [[text mining]]) and [[machine translation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Applications of natural language processing&quot;/&gt;

===Motion and manipulation===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Robotics}}

The field of [[robotics]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Robotics&quot;/&gt; is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation&lt;ref name=&quot;Configuration space&quot;/&gt; and [[motion planning|navigation]], with sub-problems of [[Robot localization|localization]] (knowing where you are), [[robotic mapping|mapping]] (learning what is around you) and [[motion planning]] (figuring out how to get there).&lt;ref name=&quot;Robotic mapping&quot;/&gt;

===Perception===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}

[[Machine perception]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Machine perception&quot;/&gt; is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. [[Computer vision]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Computer vision&quot;/&gt; is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are [[speech recognition]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech recognition&quot;/&gt; [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] and [[object recognition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Object recognition&quot;/&gt;

===Social intelligence===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Affective computing}}
[[File:Kismet robot at MIT Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]], a robot with rudimentary social skills]]

Emotion and social skills&lt;ref name=&quot;Emotion and affective computing&quot;/&gt; play two roles for an intelligent agent. First, it must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of [[game theory]], [[decision theory]], as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) Also, for good [[human-computer interaction]], an intelligent machine also needs to ''display'' emotions. At the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with. At best, it should have normal emotions itself.

===Creativity===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Computational creativity}}

A sub-field of AI addresses [[creativity]] both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative, or systems that identify and assess creativity). A related area of computational research is [[Artificial Intuition]] and [[Artificial Imagination]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===General intelligence===&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Strong AI|AI-complete}}

Most researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with ''general'' intelligence (known as [[strong AI]]), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;General intelligence&quot;/&gt; A few believe that [[anthropomorphic]] features like [[artificial consciousness]] or an [[artificial brain]] may be required for such a project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artificial consciousness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brain simulation&quot;/&gt;

Many of the problems above are considered [[AI-complete]]: to solve one problem, you must solve them all. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like [[machine translation]] requires that the machine follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's intention ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). [[Machine translation]], therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require [[strong AI]] to be done as well as humans can do it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI complete&quot;/&gt;

== Approaches ==
There is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: &quot;Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about&quot; {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence, by studying [[psychology]] or [[neurology]]? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?&lt;ref name=&quot;Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general&quot;&gt;
Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=2–3}}, who make the analogy with [[aeronautical engineering]].
* {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=100–101}}, who writes that there are &quot;two major branches of artificial intelligence: one aimed at producing intelligent behavior regardless of how it was accomplioshed, and the other aimed at modeling intelligent processes found in nature, particularly human ones.&quot;
* {{Harvnb|Kolata|1982}}, a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', which describes [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCathy's]] indifference to biological models. Kolata quotes McCarthy as writing: &quot;This is AI, so we don't care if it's psychologically real&quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PEkqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22we+don't+care+if+it's+psychologically+real%22&amp;dq=%22we+don't+care+if+it's+psychologically+real%22&amp;output=html&amp;pgis=1 ]. McCarthy recently reiterated his position at the [[AI@50]] conference where he said &quot;Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence&quot; {{Harv|Maker|2006}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?&lt;ref name=&quot;Neats vs. scruffies&quot;&gt;
[[Neats vs. scruffies]]:
* {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=421–424, 486–489}}
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=168}}
* {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1983|pp=10–11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require &quot;sub-symbolic&quot; processing?&lt;ref name=&quot;Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic&quot;&gt;
Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic AI:
* {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|p=7}}, who uses the term &quot;sub-symbolic&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
John Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI, also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as [[synthetic intelligence]],{{sfn|Haugeland|1985|p=255}} a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.8384&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf][http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=a_ZR81Z25z0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=related:iCpuTpmGk6gJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=n1-TsvqXGJ&amp;sig=1xthOJ2WQmKtdSt7ISFH2yu2l3Q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false][http://www.imagination-engines.com/]

=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===
[[File:ArtificialFictionBrain.png|thumb|right|There is currently no consensus on how closely the brain should be [[computer simulation|simulated]].]]
{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}
In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI's immediate precursors&quot;/&gt; By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.

=== Symbolic ===
{{Main|GOFAI}}
When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these approaches to AI &quot;good old fashioned AI&quot; or &quot;[[GOFAI]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOFAI&quot;/&gt;

; Cognitive simulation: [[Economist]] [[Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of  [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 80s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at CMU in the 60s&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soar&quot;/&gt;

; Logic-based: Unlike [[Alan Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert Simon|Simon]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general&quot;/&gt; His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at Stanford in the 60s&quot;/&gt; Logic was also focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s&quot;/&gt;

; &quot;Anti-logic&quot; or &quot;scruffy&quot;: Researchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at MIT in the 60s&quot;/&gt; found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions &amp;ndash; they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their &quot;anti-logic&quot; approaches as &quot;[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]&quot; paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and [[Stanford]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Neats vs. scruffies&quot;/&gt; [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of &quot;scruffy&quot; AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyc&quot;/&gt;

; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge revolution&quot;/&gt; This &quot;knowledge revolution&quot; led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.&lt;ref name=&quot;Expert systems&quot;/&gt; The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.

=== Sub-symbolic ===
During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.&lt;ref&gt;The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, however, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into &quot;sub-symbolic&quot; approaches to specific AI problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic&quot;/&gt;

; Bottom-up, [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]] or [[nouvelle AI]]: Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Embodied AI&quot;/&gt; Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as  movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.

; Computational Intelligence: Interest in [[neural networks]] and &quot;[[connectionism]]&quot; was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revival of connectionism&quot;/&gt; These and other sub-symbolic approaches, such as [[fuzzy system]]s and [[evolutionary computation]], are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Computational intelligence&quot;/&gt;

===Statistical===
In the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly [[scientific method|scientific]], in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], [[economics]] or [[operations research]]). [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] describe this movement as nothing less than a &quot;revolution&quot; and &quot;the victory of the [[neats and scruffies|neats]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Formal methods in AI&quot;/&gt;

=== Integrating the approaches ===
;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximizes its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works — some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as [[decision theory]] and [[economics]]—that also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intelligent agents&quot;/&gt;

;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agents]] in a [[multi-agent system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Agent architectures&quot;/&gt; A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a [[hybrid intelligent system]], and the study of such systems is [[artificial intelligence systems integration]]. A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hierarchical control system&quot;/&gt; [[Rodney Brooks]]' [[subsumption architecture]] was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Subsumption architecture&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--
This should also describe [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]] briefly.
---&gt;

== Tools ==
In the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.

=== Search and optimization ===
{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}

Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Search&quot;/&gt; [[:#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusion]]s, where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Logic as search&quot;/&gt; [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning as search&quot;/&gt; [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[configuration space]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Configuration space&quot; /&gt; Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].

Simple exhaustive searches&lt;ref name=&quot;Uninformed search&quot;/&gt; are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[astronomical]] numbers. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use &quot;[[heuristics]]&quot; or &quot;rules of thumb&quot; that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called &quot;[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]&quot;). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a &quot;best guess&quot; for what path the solution lies on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Informed search&quot;/&gt;

A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Optimization search&quot;/&gt;

[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[natural selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of [[evolutionary computation]] include [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms (such as [[ant colony optimization|ant colony]] or [[particle swarm optimization]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Society based learning&quot;/&gt; and [[evolutionary algorithms]] (such as [[genetic algorithms]] and [[genetic programming]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Genetic programming&quot;/&gt;

=== Logic ===
{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}

[[Logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Logic&quot;/&gt; is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Satplan&quot;/&gt; and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Symbolic learning techniques&quot;/&gt;

Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic|Propositional]] or [[sentential logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Propositional logic&quot;/&gt; is the logic of statements which can be true or false. [[First-order logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;First-order logic&quot;/&gt; also allows the use of [[quantifier]]s and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy logic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuzzy logic&quot;/&gt; is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). [[Fuzzy system]]s can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. [[Subjective logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Subjective logic&quot;/&gt; models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a [[Beta distribution]]. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.

[[Default logic]]s, [[non-monotonic logic]]s and [[circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic&quot;/&gt; are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the [[qualification problem]]. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of [[knowledge representation|knowledge]], such as: [[description logic]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing categories and relations&quot;/&gt; [[situation calculus]], [[event calculus]] and [[fluent calculus]] (for representing events and time);&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing time&quot;/&gt; [[Causality#Causal Calculus|causal calculus]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing causation&quot;/&gt; belief calculus; and [[modal logic]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing knowledge about knowledge&quot;/&gt;

===Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning===
{{Main|Bayesian network|Hidden Markov model|Kalman filter|Decision theory|Utility theory}}

Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning&quot;/&gt;

[[Bayesian network]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian networks&quot;/&gt; are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian inference&quot;/&gt; [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian learning&quot;/&gt; [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian decision networks&quot;/&gt; and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic temporal models&quot;/&gt; Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic temporal models&quot;/&gt;

A key concept from the science of [[economic]]s is &quot;[[utility]]&quot;: a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Decisions theory and analysis&quot;/&gt; [[applied information economics|information value theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Information value theory&quot;/&gt; These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,&lt;ref name=&quot;Markov decision process&quot;/&gt; dynamic [[decision network]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic temporal models&quot; /&gt; [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Game theory and mechanism design&quot;/&gt;

=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===
{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (&quot;if shiny then diamond&quot;) and controllers (&quot;if shiny then pick up&quot;). Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classifiers&quot;/&gt;

A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Neural networks&quot; /&gt;
[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernel methods&quot;/&gt;
[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],&lt;ref name=&quot;K-nearest neighbor algorithm&quot;/&gt;
[[Gaussian mixture model]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Guassian mixture model&quot;/&gt;
[[naive Bayes classifier]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Naive Bayes classifier&quot;/&gt;
and [[decision tree learning|decision tree]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Decision tree&quot;/&gt;
The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the &quot;[[No free lunch in search and optimization|no free lunch]]&quot; theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classifier performance&quot;&gt;

=== Neural networks ===
{{Main|Neural network|Connectionism}}
[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]

The study of [[artificial neural network]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Neural networks&quot;/&gt; began in the decade before the field AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullough]]. Other important early researchers were [[Frank Rosenblatt]], who invented the [[perceptron]] and [[Paul Werbos]] who developed the [[backpropagation]] algorithm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backpropagation&quot;/&gt;

The main categories of networks are acyclic or [[feedforward neural network]]s (where the signal passes in only one direction) and [[recurrent neural network]]s (which allow feedback). Among the most popular feedforward networks are [[perceptron]]s, [[multi-layer perceptron]]s and [[radial basis network]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feedforward neural networks&quot;/&gt; Among recurrent networks, the most famous is the [[Hopfield net]], a form of attractor network, which was first described by [[John Hopfield]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recurrent neural networks&quot;/&gt; Neural networks can be applied to the problem of [[intelligent control]] (for robotics) or [[machine learning|learning]], using such techniques as [[Hebbian learning]] and [[competitive learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Learning in neural networks&quot;/&gt;

[[Jeff Hawkins]] argues that research in neural networks has stalled because it has failed to model the essential properties of the [[neocortex]], and has suggested a model ([[Hierarchical Temporal Memory]]) that is loosely based on neurological research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hierarchical temporal memory&quot;/&gt;

=== Control theory ===
{{Main|Intelligent control}}
[[Control theory]], the grandchild of [[cybernetics]], has many important applications, especially in [[robotics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Control theory&quot;/&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main|List of programming languages for artificial intelligence}}

&lt;!-- Not sure where to put this in the article. I think it deserves no more weight than this single sentence. To be improved. --&gt;
AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Lisp&quot;/&gt; and [[Prolog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prolog&quot;/&gt;

==Evaluating progress ==
{{Main|Progress in artificial intelligence}}
In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the [[Turing test]]. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turing test&quot;/&gt;

Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed [[subject matter expert Turing test]]s. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Subject matter expert Turing test&quot;/&gt;

The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are: (1) Optimal: it is not possible to perform better. (2) Strong super-human: performs better than all humans. (3) Super-human: performs better than most humans. (4) Sub-human: performs worse than most humans.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} For example, performance at [[draughts]] is optimal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Game AI&quot;/&gt; performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human (see [[Computer chess#Computers versus humans]]) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.

A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from ''mathematical'' definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and [[data compression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mathematical definitions of intelligence&quot;/&gt; Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.

=== Competitions and prizes ===
{{Main|Competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence}}
There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, driverless cars, robot soccer and games.

=== Platforms ===
A [[platform (computing)|platform]] (or &quot;[[computing platform]]&quot;)is defined as &quot;some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run.&quot; As Rodney Brooks&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, R.A., &quot;How to build complete creatures rather than isolated cognitive simulators,&quot; in K. VanLehn (ed.), Architectures for Intelligence, pp. 225-239, Lawrence Erlbaum Assosiates, Hillsdale, NJ, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out many years ago, it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., we need to be working out AI problems on real world platforms rather than in isolation.

A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from [[expert systems]], albeit PC-based but still an entire real-world system to various robot platforms such as the widely available [[Roomba]] with open interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hackingroomba.com/?s=atmel Hacking Roomba » Search Results » atmel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}

Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human [[mind]], is both a challenge and an inspiration for [[philosophy]]. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]? A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given below.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philosophy of AI&quot;/&gt;

;[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence|Turing's &quot;polite convention&quot;]]: ''If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.'' [[Alan Turing]] theorized that, ultimately, we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on its behavior. This theory forms the basis of the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turing test&quot;/&gt;

;The [[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth proposal]]: ''&quot;Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.&quot;'' This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the [[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth Conference]] of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth proposal&quot;/&gt;

; [[Physical symbol system|Newell and Simon's physical symbol system hypothesis]]: ''&quot;A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.&quot;'' Newell and Simon argue that intelligences consists of formal operations on symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physical symbol system hypothesis&quot;/&gt; [[Hubert Dreyfus]] argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a &quot;feel&quot; for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See [[Dreyfus' critique of AI]].)&lt;ref&gt;
Dreyfus criticized the [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] condition of the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis, which he called the &quot;psychological assumption&quot;: &quot;The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules&quot;. {{Harv|Dreyfus|1992|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreyfus' critique&quot;/&gt;

; [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]: ''A [[formal system]] (such as a computer program) can not prove all true statements.''&lt;ref&gt;This is a paraphrase of the relevant implication of Gödel's theorems.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Penrose]] is among those who claim that Gödel's theorem limits what machines can do. (See ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''.)&lt;ref name=&quot;The mathematical objection&quot;/&gt;

; [[Strong AI hypothesis|Searle's strong AI hypothesis]]: ''&quot;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Searle's strong AI&quot;/&gt; John Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the &quot;mind&quot; might be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese room&quot;/&gt;

; The [[artificial brain]] argument: ''The brain can be simulated.'' [[Hans Moravec]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brain simulation&quot;/&gt;

== Prediction ==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in fiction|Ethics of artificial intelligence|Transhumanism|Technological singularity}}

Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both [[science fiction]] and projections about the future of technology and society. The existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues, and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fears.

&lt;!-- IMPACT ON SOCIETY: FICTION --&gt;
In fiction, Artificial Intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles, including
a servant ([[R2D2]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''),
a law enforcer ([[K.I.T.T.]] &quot;[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]&quot;),
a comrade ([[Data (Star Trek)|Lt. Commander Data]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''),
a conqueror/overlord (''[[The Matrix]]''),
a dictator (''[[With Folded Hands]]''),
an assassin (''[[Terminator (series)|Terminator]]''),
a sentient race (''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]''/[[Transformers]]),
an extension to human abilities (''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'')
and the savior of the human race ([[R. Daneel Olivaw]] in the ''[[Asimov's Robot Series]]'').

&lt;!--ROBOT RIGHTS / THE ABILITY TO SUFFER / SENTIENCE --&gt;
[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' considers a key issue in the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern [[science fiction]], including the films ''[[I Robot (film)|I Robot]]'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[A.I.: Artificial Intelligence]]'', in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions. This issue, now known as &quot;[[robot rights]]&quot;, is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot rights&quot;/&gt; The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug &amp; Pray]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html Independent documentary Plug &amp; Pray, featuring Joseph Weizenbaum and Raymond Kurzweil&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- CONSEQUENCES 1: DECREASED DEMAND FOR HUMAN LABOR --&gt;
Martin Ford and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant [[unemployment]] as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to [[outsource]] knowledge work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Replaced by machines&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- CONSEQUENCES 2: DEVALUATION OF HUMANITY --&gt;
[[Joseph Weizenbaum]] wrote that AI applications can not, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as [[customer service]] or [[psychotherapy]]&lt;ref&gt;In the early 70s, [[Kenneth Colby]] presented a version of Weizenbaum's [[ELIZA]] known as [[DOCTOR]] which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool. {{Harv|Crevier|1993|132−144}}&lt;/ref&gt; was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as [[computationalism]]). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weizenbaum's critique&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- CONSEQUENCES 3: INSTANTANEOUS PROGRESS --&gt;
Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. [[Ray Kurzweil]] has used [[Moore's law]] (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that [[desktop computer]]s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029. He also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve ''itself'' at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past, a scenario that [[science fiction]] writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named the &quot;[[technological singularity|singularity]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Singularity/&gt;

&lt;!-- CONSEQUENCES 4: TRANSHUMANISM --&gt;
Robot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]] and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transhumanism&quot;/&gt; This idea, called [[transhumanism]], which has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]], has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the [[manga]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and the science-fiction series ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.

&lt;!-- AI AS EVOLUTION --&gt;
[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that &quot;artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution,&quot; an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s &quot;[[Darwin among the Machines]]&quot; (1863), and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI as evolution&quot;/&gt;

[[Pamela McCorduck]] writes that all these scenarios are expressions of the ancient human desire to, as she calls it, &quot;forge the gods&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCorduck's thesis&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Definition of AI&quot;&gt;
Definition of AI as the study of [[intelligent agents]]:
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article. Note that they use the term &quot;computational intelligence&quot; as a synonym for artificial intelligence.
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}} (who prefer the term &quot;rational agent&quot;) and write &quot;The whole-agent view is now widely accepted in the field&quot; {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=55}}.
* {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1998}}
&lt;!--These textbooks are the most widely used in academic AI. See [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/Reference#texts Textbooks at AI topics]--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Coining of the term AI&quot;&gt;
Although there is some controversy on this point (see {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=50}}), [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy]] states unequivocally &quot;I came up with the term&quot; in a c|net interview. {{Harv|Skillings|2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy]]'s definition of AI:
* {{Harvnb|McCarthy|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;McCorduck's thesis&quot;&gt;
This is a central idea of [[Pamela McCorduck]]'s ''Machines That Think''. She writes: &quot;I like to think of artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of a venerable cultural tradition.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=34}} &quot;Artificial intelligence in one form or another is an idea that has pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=xviii}} &quot;Our history is full of attempts—nutty, eerie, comical, earnest, legendary and real—to make artificial intelligences, to reproduce what is the essential us—bypassing the ordinary means. Back and forth between myth and reality, our imaginations supplying what our workshops couldn't, we have engaged for a long time in this odd form of self-reproduction.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=3}} She traces the desire back to its [[Hellenistic]] roots and calls it the urge to &quot;forge the Gods.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|pp=340–400}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;AI widely used&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Fragmentation of AI&quot;&gt;
Pamela {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=424}} writes of &quot;the rough shattering of AI in subfields—vision, natural language, decision theory, genetic algorithms, robotics ... and these with own sub-subfield—that would hardly have anything to say to each other.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Problems of AI&quot;&gt;
This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}}

[[Cult image]]s as artificial intelligence:
* {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=1}} (statue of [[Amun]])
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=6–9}}
These were the first machines to be believed to have true intelligence and consciousness. [[Hermes Trismegistus]] expressed the common belief that with these statues, craftsman had reproduced &quot;the true nature of the gods&quot;, their ''sensus'' and ''spiritus''. McCorduck makes the connection between sacred automatons and [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]] (developed around the same time), which expressly forbids the worship of robots {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|pp=6–9}}

&lt;!------ PHILOSOPHY -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Philosophy of AI&quot;&gt;
[[Philosophy of AI]]. All of these positions in this section are mentioned in standard discussions of the subject, such as:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=947–960}}
* {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|pp=38–55}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth proposal&quot;&gt;
[[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth proposal]]:
* {{Harvnb|McCarthy|Minsky|Rochester|Shannon|1955}} (the original proposal)
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=49}} (historical significance)
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Physical symbol system hypothesis&quot;&gt;
The [[physical symbol system]]s hypothesis:
* {{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}
* {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=153}}
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreyfus' critique&quot;&gt;
[[Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence]]:

* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=120–132}}
* {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=211–239}}

&lt;ref name=&quot;Searle's strong AI&quot;&gt;
This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was &quot;The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.&quot;  {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=1}}. Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}: &quot;The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction:
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=190-25}} discusses ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and identifies the key ethical issues as scientific hubris and the suffering of the monster, i.e. [[robot rights]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Afro Celt Sound System''' is a [[band (music)|musical group]] which fuses modern [[electronic dance music|electronic dance rhythms]] ([[trip-hop]], [[techno music|techno]], etc.) with traditional [[Irish traditional music|Irish (Celtic)]] and [[Music of Africa|West African]] music. It was formed by [[Grammy]]-nominated producer-guitarist [[Simon Emmerson]], and is considered to be something of a [[world music]] [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]], often featuring a wide range of guest artists on their albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=afro-celt-sound-system-p200387/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Afro Celt Sound System Biography|last=Harris|first=Graid|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their albums have been released through [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Records]], and they have been cited as the second best-selling band on the label, exceeded in sales only by Gabriel himself.  Their striking live performances have often been the highlights of the [[WOMAD]] concert festivals. They signed a contract with Real World for five albums, of which the 2005 release ''Anatomic'' was the last.&lt;ref name=&quot;jazzmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejazzmann.com/reviews/review/afro-celt-sound-system-capture/|title=Review of Capture|last=Mann|first=Ian|publisher=TheJazzMann.com|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a number of festival dates in 2007, the band went on hiatus. In 2010, they regrouped to play a number of shows (including a return to WOMAD &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realworldrecords.com/news/afro-celt-sound-system-return-to-the-home-where-they-were-launched-in-1995-the-womad-festival Real World Records press release]&lt;/ref&gt;) and announced a new album, Capture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realworldrecords.com/catalogue/capture Real World Records catalogue page for Capture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
The inspiration behind the project dates back to 1991, when Simon Emmerson, a [[Grammy Award]]-nominated British [[Record producer|producer]] who would become the group's guitarist, collaborated with Afro-pop star [[Baaba Maal]]. While making an album with Maal in Senegal, Emmerson was struck by the similarity between one African melody and a traditional Irish air. Back in London, Irish musician [[Davy Spillane]] told Emmerson about a belief that nomadic Celts lived in Africa or India before they migrated to Western Europe. Whether or not the theory was true, Emmerson was intrigued by the two countries' musical affinities.

In an experiment that would prove successful, Emmerson brought members of Baaba Maal's band together with traditional Irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create. Adding a dash of modern sound, Emmerson also brought in English dance mixers for an electronic beat. &quot;People thought I was mad when I touted the idea,&quot; Emmerson told Jim Carroll of ''[[The Irish Times]]''. &quot;At the time, I was out of favour with the London club scene. I was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary&quot;.

Jamming in the studios at Real World, musician Peter Gabriel's recording facilities in [[Wiltshire, England]], the diverse group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week. This album, Volume 1: Sound Magic, was released by Real World Records in 1996, and marked the debut of the Afro Celt Sound System, an energetic global fusion the likes of which the music world had not yet seen.

&quot;Prior to that first album being made, none of us knew if it would work,&quot; musician James McNally told Larry Katz of the Boston Herald. &quot;We were strangers who didn't even speak the same language. But we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language.&quot; McNally, who grew up second-generation Irish in London, played keyboards, piano, [[bodhran]], and bamboo flute.
[[File:NFaly-Kouyate.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[N'Faly Kouyate]] playing the [[Kora (instrument)|Kora]]]]
Despite the group's modest expectations for its first album, Sound Magic sold a respectable 250,000 copies. Performing at festivals, raves, and dance clubs, the band met with enthusiastic audiences. Encouraged by the response, the Afro Celt Sound System prepared for a second album. The band had grown to include two more African musicians, Moussa Sissokho on talking drums and [[N'Faly Kouyate]] on vocals, [[Kora (instrument)|kora]], and [[balafon]].

Just as the second album was getting off the ground, one of the group's core musicians, 27-year-old [[keyboardist]] [[Jo Bruce]] (son of [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bass player [[Jack Bruce]]), died suddenly of an [[asthma]] attack. The band was devastated, and the album was put on hold. Then Irish pop star [[Sinéad O'Connor]] came to the rescue, collaborating with the band and helping them cope with their loss. &quot;[O'Connor] blew into the studio on a windy November night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful,&quot; McNally told Katz. &quot;We had this track we didn't know what to do with. Sinéad scribbled a few lyrics and bang! She left us completely choked up.&quot; So taken was the band with O'Connor's song, &quot;Release,&quot; that they used the name for the title of their album. Volume 2: Release hit the music stores in 1999, and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide.

By then the Afro Celt Sound System was in demand as a live band that not only made people dance but also connected with audiences around the world. In 2000 the group was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best World Music category. The band, composed at the time of eight members from six countries (England, [[Senegal]], Guinea, Ireland, [[France]], and [[Kenya]]), took pride in its ability to bring people together through music. &quot;We can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that we're at home,&quot; McNally told Patrick MacDonald of [[The Seattle Times]]''. &quot;We're breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music. We leave a door open to communicate with each other's traditions. And it's changed our lives&quot;.

In 2001 the group released [[Volume 3: Further in Time]], which climbed to number one on Billboard's Top World Music Albums chart. Featuring guest spots by Peter Gabriel and [[Robert Plant]], the album also incorporated a heightened African sound. &quot;On the first two records, the pendulum swung more toward the Celtic, London club side of the equation,&quot; Emmerson told the Irish Times's Carroll. &quot;For this one, I wanted to have more African vocals and input than we'd done before.&quot; Again the Afro Celt Sound System met with success. Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine praised the album as &quot;a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music.&quot; The single &quot;[[When You're Falling]]&quot;, with vocals by Gabriel, became a radio hit in the United States.

In 2003 they changed their name to the simpler '''Afrocelts''' (this is now viewed by the band as having been a mistake) ; however, two of their latest albums, ''[[Pod (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Pod]]'', a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums, and their fifth studio album ''Anatomic'', used the long and familiar form. Around the world they seem better known as ''Afro Celt Sound System''.

They played a number of shows to promote Anatomic in 2006 and summer 2007, ending with a gig in Korea,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrocelts.org/wst_page9.html Simon Emmerson message on ACSS fan site]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking an extended break to work on side projects. The most notable of these was [[The Imagined Village]] featuring Simon Emmerson and Johnny Kalsi. In summer 2010, the band commenced a series of live shows to tie in with a new 2-CD album CAPTURE : Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010, released on 6 September 2010 on Real World Records. They also announced that further international touring and new recordings would follow in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/afrocelts Announcement on ACSS MySpace page]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Afrocelts began their musical journey in the mid-1990s during the [[Real World Records|Real World]] Recording Week the difference between a guest artist and a band member was virtually non-existent, though as time has passed a following combination of people is most often associated with the name Afro Celt Sound System: ''(Please note that the new release Anatomic only lists Simon, James, Iarla and Martin as regulars)''

# [[Simon Emmerson]] ([[guitar]], production)
# [[N'Faly Kouyate]] ([[kora (instrument)|kora]], [[Balafon|balaphon]], [[ngoma drums]], vocals)
# [[Moussa Sissokho]] ([[djembe]], [[talking drum]])
# [[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]] ([[Bodhrán]], [[accordion]], [[Tin whistle|whistle]])
# [[Johnny Kalsi]] ([[Dhol Foundation]] bandleader; [[Dhol]])
# [[Iarla Ó Lionáird]] (vocals)
# [[Emer Mayock]] ([[tin whistle]], [[flute]], [[uillean pipes]])
