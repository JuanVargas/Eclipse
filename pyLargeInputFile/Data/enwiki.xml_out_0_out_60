emselves from the constant border wars between the British imperial government and the native tribes on the eastern frontier.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[Image:Afrikaner Commandos2.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Boer guerrillas during the [[Second Boer War]].]]
The [[Trekboer]]e, as they were originally known, were mainly of [[Dutchmen|Dutch]] origin and included [[Calvinist]]s, [[Flemings|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] Calvinists, as well as [[French people|French]] [[Huguenot]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091025222633/http://geocities.com/sa_stamouers/huguenots.htm H. C. Viljoen. The Contribution of the Huguenots in South Africa.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German people|German]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[protestant]]s who first arrived in the Cape of Good Hope during the period of its administration (1652 &amp;ndash; 1795) by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or VOC). Lesser migrations of [[Scandinavians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Greeks]], [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Scottish ethnicity|Scots]], [[English people|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants also contributed to this ethnic mix.

=== Great trek ===
{{Main|Great Trek}}
Those Trekboers who trekked into and occupied the eastern Cape were semi-nomadic. A significant number in the eastern Cape frontier later became Grensboere (&quot;border farmers&quot;) who were the direct ancestors of the [[Voortrekkers]]. The Voortrekkers were those Boers (mainly from the eastern Cape) who left the Cape en masse in a series of large scale migrations later called the Great Trek beginning in 1835 as a result of [[British Empire|British]] colonialism and constant border wars. When used in a historical context, the term Boer may refer to an inhabitant of the [[Boer Republics]] as well as those who were cultural Boers.

=== Anglo-Boer wars ===
{{Main|First Boer War|Second Boer War}}
Though the Boers accepted British rule without resistance in 1877, they fought two wars in the late 19th century to defend their internationally recognized independent countries, the republics of the Transvaal (the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]], or ZAR) and the [[Orange Free State]] (OFS), against the threat of annexation by the British Crown.
This led the key figure in organizing the resistance, [[Paul Kruger]], into conflict with the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | firstpoop = Martin | last = Meredith | title = Diamonds, Gold, And War | location = New York | publisher = Public Affairs | year = 2007 | pages = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boer War diaspora ===
{{See also|Afrikaner#Boer War diaspora}}

After the second Anglo-Boer War, a Boer [[diaspora]] occurred. Starting in 1903, the largest group emigrated to the [[Patagonia]] region of [[Argentina]]. Another group emigrated to [[Kenya Colony|British-ruled Kenya]], from where most returned to South Africa during the 1930s, while a third group under the leadership of General [[Ben Viljoen]] emigrated to [[Mexico]] and to [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]] in south-western USA.

=== Boer Revolt ===
{{Main|Maritz Rebellion}}
[[Image:JOPIE FOURIE.png|thumb|right|80px|Jopie Fourie executed by firing squad for treason]]
The Maritz Rebellion or the Boer Revolt or the Five Shilling Rebellion or the Third Boer War, occurred in South Africa in 1914 at the start of [[World War I]], in which men who supported the re-creation of the old [[Boer republics]] rose up against the government of the [[Union of South Africa]] because they did not want to side with the British against Germany so soon after they had had a long bloody war with the British. Many Boers had German ancestry and many members of the government were themselves former Boer military leaders who had fought with the Maritz rebels against the British in the [[Second Boer War]], which had ended only twelve years earlier. The rebellion was put down by [[Louis Botha]] and [[Jan Smuts]], and the ringleaders received heavy fines and terms of imprisonment. A renowned Boer, Jopie Fourie, was executed for treason as he was in 1914 an officer in the Union Defence Force and was convicted as rebel for his refusal to take up arms with the British.

== Characteristics ==

=== Culture ===

The drive to trek (known as the trekgees) was a notable characteristic of the Boers in the past beginning in the late 17th century out of necessity when the Trekboers began to inhabit the northern and eastern Cape frontiers, to the era of the Great Trek when the Voortrekkers left the eastern Cape ''en masse'', as well as later after major republics were established such as during the Thirstland Trek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/ransford/chap13.htm | first = Oliver | last = Ransford | title = The Great Trek | year = 1973 | chapter = 13: Epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rustic characteristic and tradition was developed quite early on as Boer society was born on the frontiers of white settlement and on the outskirts of civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Du Toit 1998 1&quot;/&gt;

The Boers had cut their ties to Europe as they emerged from the Trekboer group. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | url = http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/ransford/chap1.htm | first = Oliver | last = Ransford | title = The Great Trek | year = 1973 | chapter = 1: Trekboers}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Boer quest for independence manifested in a tradition of declaring republics, which predates the arrival of the British; when the British arrived, Boer republics had already been declared and were in rebellion from the VOC. &lt;ref name = &quot;Mills&quot;&gt; {{cite book | url = http://husky1.smu.ca/~wmills/course316/18White_Settlers.html | first = Professor Wallace G | last = Mills | title = White Settlers in South Africa to 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boers of the frontier were known for their independent spirit, resourcefulness, hardiness, and self-sufficiency, whose political notions verged on anarchy but had begun to be influenced by republicanism.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mills&quot; /&gt; Most of the men were also skilled with the use of [[guns]] as they would hunt and also were able to protect their families with them.

=== Nationalism ===

The Boer nation is well-known for their strong nationalistic characteristics.  Their [[nationalism]] was born of hundreds of years of fighting against [[imperialism]], a continuing struggle for [[independence]] battling mainly British expansion into central South Africa, as well as the harsh African climate, a strong sense of nationhood. As with any other ethnic group that has come from troubled land to troubled land, many of them see it as their duty to educate future generations on their people's past. 

=== Calvinism ===
{{Main|Afrikaner Calvinism}}
The Boer nation is mainly descended from Dutch, German and French Huguenots, who migrated to South Africa during the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. The Boer nation has revealed a distinct [[Calvinist]] culture and the majority of Boers today are still members of a [[Reformed Church]]. The Nederduits Hervormde Kerk was the national Church of the [[South African Republic]] (1852–1902). Also note the &quot;Orange&quot; in [[Orange Free State]] (1854–1902) was named after the [[Protestant]] [[House of Orange]] in the Netherlands.

The Calvinist influence remains in that some fundamental Calvinist doctrines such as unconditional [[predestination]] and [[divine providence]] remains present in much of Boer culture, who see their role in society as abiding by the national laws and accepting calamity and hardship as part of their Christian duty. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.calvinistcorner.com/predestination.htm Calvinist Corner.] &lt;/ref&gt; 

A small number of Boers may also be members of [[Baptist]], [[Pentecostal movement|Pentecostal]] or [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Churches]].

== Modern usage ==

During recent times, mainly during the [[apartheid]] reform and post-1994 eras, many more white [[Afrikaans]]-speaking people, mainly with &quot;conservative&quot; political views and of Trekboer and Voortrekker descent, have preferred to be called &quot;Boers&quot; or Boere-Afrikaners, rather than &quot;Afrikaners&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;web. archive. org&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080422063509/http://www.chico.mweb.co.za/art/2007/2007mar/070309-bang.html Yolandi Groenewald. Bang bang – you’re dead. Mail &amp; Guardian Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; They feel that there were many people of [[Voortrekker]] descent who were not co-opted or assimilated into what they see as the [[Cape Province|Cape]]-based Afrikaner identity which began emerging after the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910. Certain Boer nationalists have asserted that they do not consider themselves a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] element of the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20031001202018/rebellie.org/Raaktief/rk_openletter_ISS.htm Dr. Tobias Louw. Open Letter to the Institute for Security Studies.]&lt;/ref&gt;

They contend that the Boers of the [[South African Republic|South African]] (ZAR) and [[Orange Free State]] republics were recognized as a separate people or cultural group under international law by the [[Sand River Convention]] (which created the South African Republic in 1852),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1741482 The Sand River Convention.]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bloemfontein Convention]] (which created the Orange Free State Republic in 1854), the [[Pretoria Convention]] (which re-established the independence of the South African Republic 1881), the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention]] (which granted the full independence to the South African Republic in 1884) and the [[Peace of Vereeniging|Vereeniging Peace Treaty]], which formally ended the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]] on 31 May 1902. Others contend, however, that these treaties dealt only with agreements between governmental entities and do not imply the recognition of a Boer cultural identity ''per se''.

The supporters of these views feel that the Afrikaner designation (or label) was used from the 1930s onwards as a means of unifying (politically at least) the white Afrikaans speakers of the Western Cape with those of Trekboer and Voortrekker descent (whose ancestors began migrating eastward during the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century and later northward during the [[Great Trek]] of the 1830s) in the north of South Africa, where the Boer Republics were established.&lt;ref name=&quot;web. archive. org&quot;/&gt;

Since the Anglo-Boer war the term &quot;Boervolk&quot; was rarely used in the 20th century by the various regimes because of this attempt to assimilate the Boervolk with the Afrikaners. A portion of those who are the descendants of the Boerevolk have reasserted this designation.&lt;ref name=&quot;web. archive. org&quot;/&gt;

The supporters of the &quot;Boer&quot; designation view the term &quot;Afrikaner&quot; as an artificial political label which usurped their history and culture, turning &quot;Boer&quot; achievements into &quot;Afrikaner&quot; achievements. They feel that the Western-Cape based Afrikaners — whose ancestors did not trek eastwards or northwards — took advantage of the republican Boers' destitution following the Anglo-Boer War and later attempted to assimilate the Boers into a new politically based cultural label as &quot;Afrikaners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080422063509/http://www.chico.mweb.co.za/art/2007/2007mar/070309-bang.html Yolandi Groenewald. Bang bang – you're dead. Mail &amp; Guardian Online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oulitnet.co.za/seminarroom/marais_swart.asp Sandra Swart. Journal of Southern African Studies. 30.4, Dec 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Stuijt: former South African journalist. Boer, Afrikaner Or White - Which Are You? 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary South Africa and due to Broederbond propaganda, Boer and Afrikaner have been used interchangeably despite the fact that the Boers are the smaller segment within the Afrikaner designation as the Afrikaners of Cape Dutch origin are larger. Afrikaner directly translated means &quot;African&quot; and subsequently refers to all Afrikaans speaking people in Africa irrespective of colour or nationality. Boer is the specific ethnic group within the larger Afrikaans speaking population.

The '''Bronze Star Medal''' (or BSM) is a [[Military of the United States|United States Armed Forces]] individual [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military decoration]] that may be awarded for [[bravery]], acts of merit, or meritorious service. When awarded for bravery, it is the fourth-highest [[combat]] award of the U.S. Armed Forces and the ninth highest military award (including both combat and non-combat awards) in the order of precedence of U.S. military decorations. Officers from the other [[Uniformed services of the United States|federal uniformed services]] are also eligible to receive the award if they are militarized or detailed to serve with a service branch of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coausphs.org/news.cfm |work=Commissioned Officers Association of the USPHS Inc. |author= |title=PHS Officer Awarded Bronze Star for Year Long Deployment in Afghanistan |date=July 22, 2009 | accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General information==
The Bronze Star Medal was established by Executive Order 9419, 4 February 1944 (superseded by Executive Order 11046, 24 August 1962, as amended by Executive Order 13286, 28 February 2003).

The Bronze Star Medal may be awarded by the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Homeland Security with regard to the Coast Guard when not operating as a service in the Navy, or by such military commanders, or other appropriate officers as the Secretary concerned may designate, to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard of the United States, after December 6, 1941, distinguishes, or has distinguished, himself by heroic or meritorious achievement or service, not involving participation in aerial flight—
:(a) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;
:(b) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or
:(c) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

The acts of heroism are of a lesser degree than required for the award of the [[Silver Star]]. The acts of merit or acts of valor must be less than that required for the [[Legion of Merit]] but must nevertheless have been meritorious and accomplished with distinction. The Bronze Star Medal is awarded only to service members in combat who are receiving imminent danger pay.

The award may be made to each member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, after 6 December 1941, was cited in orders or awarded a certificate for exemplary conduct in ground combat against an armed enemy after 7 December 1941. For this purpose, an award of the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] or [[Combat Medical Badge]] is considered as a citation in orders. Documents executed since 4 August 1944 in connection with recommendations for the award of decorations of higher degree than the Bronze Star Medal cannot be used as the basis for an award under this paragraph.

==History==
The award that eventually became the Bronze Star Medal was conceived by Colonel [[Russell P. “Red” Reeder]] in 1943, who believed it would aid morale if there was a medal which could be awarded by captains of companies or batteries to deserving people serving under them. Reeder felt the medal should be a ground equivalent of the Air Medal, and proposed that the new award be called the “Ground Medal”.&lt;ref&gt;Reeder, Colonel Red. ''Born at Reveille.'' New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce (1966), page 218.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The idea eventually rose through the military bureaucracy and gained supporters. General [[George C. Marshall]], in a memorandum to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] dated 3 February 1944, wrote {{quote|The fact that the ground troops, Infantry in particular, lead miserable lives of extreme discomfort and are the ones who must close in [[personal combat]] with the enemy, makes the maintenance of their morale of great importance. The award of the [[Air Medal]] has had an adverse reaction on the ground troops, particularly the Infantry Riflemen who are now suffering the heaviest losses, air or ground, in the Army, and enduring the greatest hardships.}}

The [[Air Medal]] had been adopted two years earlier to raise airmen's morale. President Roosevelt authorized the Bronze Star Medal by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 9419 dated 4 February 1944, retroactive to 7 December 1941. This authorization was announced in War Department Bulletin No. 3, dated 10 February 1944.

The Executive Order was amended by President [[John F. Kennedy]], per Executive Order 11046 dated 24 August 1962, to expand the authorization to include those serving with friendly forces. This allowed for awards where U.S. service members might be involved in an armed conflict where the United States was not a belligerent. At the time of the Executive Order, for example, the U.S. was not a belligerent in Vietnam, so U.S. advisers serving with the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces would not have been eligible for the award.

Since the award criteria state that the Bronze Star Medal may be awarded to &quot;any person...while serving in any capacity in or with&quot; the U.S. Armed Forces, awards to members of foreign armed services serving with the United States are permitted. Thus, a number of Allied soldiers received the Bronze Star Medal in [[World War II]], as well as U.N. soldiers in the [[Korean War]], Vietnamese and allied forces in the [[Vietnam War]], and coalition forces in recent military operations such as the [[Gulf War]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and the [[Iraq War]]. A number of Bronze Stars with Valor Device were awarded to veterans of the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].

===CIB &amp; CMB Conversion===
As a result of a study conducted in 1947, the policy was implemented that authorized the retroactive award of the Bronze Star Medal to soldiers who had received the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] or the [[Combat Medical Badge]] during [[World War II]]. The basis for doing this was that the badges were awarded only to soldiers who had borne the hardships which resulted in General Marshall's support of the Bronze Star Medal. Both badges required a recommendation by the commander and a citation in orders.

==Appearance==
The Bronze Star Medal was designed by Rudolf Freund (1878–1960) of jewelry firm [[Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle|Bailey, Banks &amp; Biddle]]. (Freund also designed the Silver Star.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omsa.org/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=1765&lt;/ref&gt;)

The Bronze Star is a bronze star 1½ inches (38&amp;nbsp;mm) in circumscribing diameter. In the center thereof is a 3/16&amp;nbsp;inch (4.8&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter superimposed bronze star, the center line of all rays of both stars coinciding. The reverse has the inscription &lt;small&gt;“HEROIC OR MERITORIOUS ACHIEVEMENT”&lt;/small&gt; and a space for the name of the recipient to be engraved. The star is suspended from the ribbon by a rectangular shaped metal loop with the corners rounded. The ribbon is 1 3/8&amp;nbsp;inches (35&amp;nbsp;mm) wide and consists of the following stripes: 1/32&amp;nbsp;inch (1&amp;nbsp;mm) white 67101; 9/16&amp;nbsp;inch (14&amp;nbsp;mm) scarlet 67111; 1/32&amp;nbsp;inch (1&amp;nbsp;mm) white; center stripe 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) ultramarine blue 67118; 1/32&amp;nbsp;inch (1&amp;nbsp;mm) white; 9/16&amp;nbsp;inch (14&amp;nbsp;mm) scarlet; and 1/32&amp;nbsp;inch (1&amp;nbsp;mm) white.

==Devices==
Additional awards of the Bronze Star Medal are denoted in the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] by [[oak leaf clusters]]. The [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] issue [[award star]]s to denote subsequent decorations.

The [[Valor device]] (or “''V'' device”) is authorized by all services and identifies the award as resulting from an act of ''combat heroism'' (as in the case of the Army and Air Force) or signifying that the medal was earned in combat (as in the case of the Navy), thus distinguishing it from meritorious achievement awards. However, an accumulation of minor acts of combat heroism does not justify an award of the Valor device. The Bronze Star Medal is awarded for valor, achievement and service. Combat service deserving a Bronze Star Medal, but not achieved in a particular valorous act, would warrant a meritorious (achievement) Bronze Star. The Valor device does not denote an additional award and only one such device may be worn on any ribbon.

The Bronze Star Medal with the Valor Device is the United States military's fourth highest award for valor.

'''Ballarat''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbæləræt|pron}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballarat.com/history.htm#ORIGINS%20OF%20SOME%20BALLAARAT%20NAMES Retrieved on 19 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a city in the state of [[Victoria, Australia]], approximately {{convert|105|km|mi}} north-west of the state capital Melbourne situated on the lower plains of the [[Great Dividing Range]] and the [[Yarrowee River]] catchment. It is the largest inland centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/federal_elections/2010/profiles/vic/ballarat.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and third most populous city in the state and the fifth most populated inland city in Australia.  The estimated urban area population is 96,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarat-population-nears-100000/2142374.aspx] by Jordan Oliver for The Courier 22 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is the administrative centre for the [[City of Ballarat]], which encompasses both the urban area and outlying towns spanning an area of {{convert|740|km2|sqmi}}. Inhabitants of Ballarat are known as Ballaratians.&lt;ref&gt;K. T. Livingston, Richard Jordan, Gay Sweely (2001) ''Becoming Australians: the movement towards federation in Ballarat and the nation'' p.34. Wakefield Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It was named by Scottish settler Archibald Yuille who established the sheep run called Ballaarat in 1837&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballaratreformleague.org.au/buninyong.htm&lt;/ref&gt; with the name derived from local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] words for the area, ''balla arat'', thought to mean &quot;resting place&quot;. The present spelling was officially adopted in 1996.

Ballarat is one of the most significant [[Victorian era]] [[boomtown]]s in Australia. Gold was discovered at [[Golden Point, Victoria|Poverty Point]] on 18 August 1851, and the district was found to be a rich [[Alluvium|alluvial]] field where gold could easily be extracted.  News of the finds intensified the [[Victorian gold rush]] bringing over 10,000{{fact|date=May 2011}} migrants to the city from around the world within a year and transforming it from a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] to a major settlement in the newly proclaimed Colony of Victoria.  Australia's first gold [[stamp mill]] was established at Ballarat in 1854.{{fact|date=May 2011}} 

It was the site of the [[Eureka Rebellion]], the only armed civil uprising in [[Australian history]], which took place on 3 December 1854 at the Eureka Mining Lead, and the event is controversially identified with the birth of [[democracy]] in Australia.  Many significant Australian cultural icons are also a legacy of Ballarat's gold rush boom.  The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]] has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Ballarat Fine Art Gallery]], Australia's oldest and largest regional gallery.  Other nationally significant heritage structures include the [[Ballarat Botanical Gardens]], established 1857, the best example of a regional botanic gardens in Australia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nattrust.com.au/trust_register/search_the_register/ballarat_botanic_gardens&lt;/ref&gt; with the greatest concentration of public statuary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cometolifeballarat.com/visit/experience-ballarat/lakes,-parks-and-gardens/ballarat-botanical-gardens.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; including the official [[Prime Minister's Avenue]]; the longest running lyric theatre building, Her Majesty's, established 1875;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Her Maj: A History of Her Majesty's Theatre, Ballarat'' by Peter Freund with Val Sarah ISBN 9780975748312.&lt;/ref&gt; the first municipal observatory, established 1886;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observatory.ballarat.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest and longest memorial avenue, the [[Avenue of Honour]], established between 1917 and 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/conflict/ww1&lt;/ref&gt;

Proclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction.  It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]].  It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and the largest city in the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] – a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well preserved Victorian era heritage.

== History ==

=== Prehistory and European settlement ===

Prior to the [[European settlement of Australia]], the Ballarat region was populated by the [[Wathaurong]] people, an [[Indigenous Australian]] people.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballarat’s Indigenous Heritage|url=http://sheducationcom.ascetinteractive.biz/uploads//SovHill%20indigenousheritage%20notes%20ss1.pdf|work=Sovereign Hill Education|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boro gundidj tribe's territory was based along the Yarrowee River.

Scottish settlers the Yuille family, Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|km2|adj=on}} sheep run with William Cross building a hut at Black Swamp in 1838.  Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp.   Archibald Yuille named the area
&quot;Ballaarat&quot; which is thought he derived from local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] words for the area, ''balla arat''.  The meaning of this word is not certain, however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean 'resting place'.  In some dialects, ''balla'' means &quot;bent elbow&quot; which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning &quot;place&quot;.  

=== 1850s: Gold rush ===
[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853–1854 oil painting from an original sketch by [[Eugene von Guerard]].]]
On 19 August 1851, John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces but within days of the announcement prospectors rushed the area. As the Victorian gold rush gathered pace, numerous alluvial and deep mining leads sprang up in the Ballarat district.  The Ballarat goldfields had gained an international reputation as a rich goldfield and a huge influx of immigrants from around the world included many from Ireland and China gathering in a collection of prospecting [[shanty town]]s around the creeks and hills.  Several other notable gold fields were established in the wider area including the Berringa, Clunes, Creswick, Talbot and Enfield but the Ballarat district was the most important settlement in the area and the colony's second largest settlement.

The first Post Office opened on 1 November 1851.&lt;ref name = &quot;a&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;country= | accessdate = 11 April 2008| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parts of the district were first surveyed by [[William Urquhart]] as early as October 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Ken|title=The surveying career of William Swan Urquhart, 1845–1864|url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/provenance/no8/SurveyingCareer1.asp|work=Public Record Office Victoria|publisher=Government of Victoria|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1852 his [[grid plan]] and wide streets for land sales in the new township of West Ballarat&lt;ref&gt;pg 11. Jacobs, Wendy. Ballarat: A Guide to Buildings and Areas 1851–1940 Jacob Lewis Vines Conservation Architects and Planners (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; contrasted markedly with the existing narrow unplanned streets, tents and gullies of the original East Ballarat settlement.

[[File:Eureka stockade battle.jpg|thumb|right|Battle of the Eureka Stockade. J. B. Henderson (1854) Watercolour]]
Civil disobedience in Ballarat led to Australia's first and only armed civil uprising, the [[Eureka Rebellion]] (colloquially referred to as the ''Eureka Stockade'') which took place in Ballarat on 3 December 1854. The event, in which 22 miners died, is considered to be a defining moment in Australian history.

The city earned the nickname &quot;The Golden City&quot; in the 1850s&lt;ref&gt;Perkin, Corrie [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/golden-city-of-ballarat-comes-into-the-picture/story-e6frg8n6-1225768084821 Golden city of Ballarat comes into the picture] The Australian 1 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1860s prospered greatly on gold mining.  Confidence of the city's early citizens in the enduring future of their city is evident in the sheer scale of many of the early public buildings, generous public recreational spaces, and opulence of many of its commercial establishments and private housing. The railway came to the town with the opening of the [[Geelong-Ballarat railway line|Geelong-Ballarat line]] in 1862,&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=23 April 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ballarat grew, the region's original indigenous inhabitants were quickly expelled to the fringe and by 1867 few at all remained.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

=== Victorian city and decline ===
[[File:Sturt and lydiard streets in 1899.jpg|thumb|right|The intersection of Lydiard and Sturt Street in 1899 was the heart of a bustling city of trams, horses and pedestrians.]]
During the period from the 1870s to the early 20th century Ballarat made a successful transition from a gold rush town to industrial age city. 

Ballarat was proclaimed a city in 1871.  Gong Gong reservoir was built in 1877 to alleviate flooding and to provide a permanent water supply.  A [[Serviceton railway line|direct railway to Melbourne]] was completed in December 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsrail-line&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many industries and workshops that had been established as a result of manufacturing and servicing for the [[Underground mining (hard rock)|deep lead mining]] industry.

Local [[boosterism|boosterists]] at the turn of the century adopted the nickname &quot;[[Athens]] of Australia&quot;, first used to describe the city by the prestigious Irish-Australian jurist and politician of the early 20th century [[John Madden (jurist)|Sir John Madden]].&lt;ref&gt;THE ATHENS OF AUSTRALIA, Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XXXVI, Issue 11988, 3 November 1909, p. 7 [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=PBH19091103.2.86&amp;e=-------10--1----2--]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Pike, Geoffrey Serle : Australian dictionary of biography, Vol. 9, Melbourne University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. (Frederic Chambers) Spurr : Five years under the Southern Cross; experiences and impressions [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/frederic-c-frederic-chambers-spurr/five-years-under-the-southern-cross-experiences-and-impressions-ala/page-10-five-years-under-the-southern-cross-experiences-and-impressions-ala.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/10742486 The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1954), Saturday 23 October 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 1901, the Duke of York (later [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]) and his wife, the Duchess of York, travelled by train from Melbourne to Ballarat.&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Visit to Ballarat 1901'', Jack McLean, [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], August 1994, pp211-233&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the turn of the century Ballarat's growth had all but stopped.  World War I dented the city's population further and the general decline led to the gradual loss of first provincial status to Geelong.&lt;ref&gt;Progressive Geelong – Industrial Expansion. Development of the Harbour. [[The Argus, Melbourne]] 14 October 1921 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; In response, local lobbyists continually pushed the Victorian government for [[decentralisation]], the greatest success being the [[Victorian Railways]] opening the [[Ballarat North Workshops]] in April 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee144&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Lee, Robert |title=The Railways of Victoria 1854–2004 |publisher=Melbourne University Publishing Ltd |year=2007 |isbn= 9780522851342 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] proved a further setback for Ballarat, with the closure of many institutions.

=== Since the 20th Century ===
While deep, the depression was also brief, the interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system.  In 1930, [[Ballarat Airport]] was established.  By 1931 Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.&lt;ref&gt;Geelong Ousts Ballarat. Population Surprises. The Argus (Melbourne) Tuesday 28 April 1936, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War II an expanded Ballarat airport was the base of the [[RAAF]] Wireless Air Gunners' School as well as the base for [[USAAF]] Liberator bomber squadrons.

In the [[Post-war]] era, Ballarat's growth continued, expanding significantly to the northwest and an acute housing shortage was eased with the establishment of an extensive [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estate on the former Ballarat Common (today known as [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. Whilst planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 to 1962. During the 1970s a further 300 houses were constructed. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid 1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city.

By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation.  With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination.

The city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th Century and early 21st Century.  In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre and through the redevelopment of inner city housing blocks, and other under-developed inner-city land in the East that is being redeveloped to create a higher-density housing structure.

==Geography==
[[File:Lake wendouree.jpg|thumb|right|Ballarat's skyline hidden from this view of the city looking east across Lake Wendouree to Mount Warrenheip.]]
Ballarat lies at the foothills of the [[Great Dividing Range]] in Central Western Victoria. Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.   These plains are made up of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows, and contain large areas of rich agricultural soils.&lt;ref&gt;City of Ballarat (Maps, Population &amp; Location – http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt;  A large feature of the city is the man-made [[Lake Wendouree]] (formerly Yuille’s Swamp), around which many of the inner suburbs are situated.  The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee catchment and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs.  The reach of the Yarrowee toward Ballarat Central becomes a stormwater drain and is completely covered over as it flows under the CBD.

There are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat and large bodies of water including the White Swan Reservoir and other lakes, rivers and creeks which are used for urban water use and agriculture.

===City and Suburbs===
[[File:Australia Victoria Ballarat City location map.svg|thumb|Map of the urban area (grey) and the extent of the municipal area]]
[[File:Aerialviewgardens.jpg|thumb|right|Looking south over Sturt Street and the CBD toward Bridge Mall from the Town Hall clock tower]]
{{see also|Ballarat Central}}
Ballarat's is a primarily low-rise city though apart from the area around Ballarat Airport there are few established height limits for buildings. There are two principle [[activity centre]]s within the urban area, the Central Business District (CBD) and Wendouree.  The tallest building in urban Ballarat is the seven storey Henry Bolte wing of the Ballarat Base Hospital (1994). 
Beyond the central area urban Ballarat extends into several suburban areas. Settlement patterns around Ballarat consist of small villages and country towns, some with less than a few thousand people. 

The Central Business District (located in [[Ballarat Central]]) is a large mixed use office and retail district.  Ballarat's CBD (along Lydiard, Sturt Streets, Armstrong, Doveton and Dana Streets) along with the historic centre of East Ballarat – Main Street and Bakery Hill has retained stands of commercial and civic buildings of state and national heritage significance. The CBD area is bounded to the north by railway lines, extends to the west to Drummond Street, to the south to Grant street and to the east as far as Princes Street spanning the floodplain of the Yarrowee River.  It includes a major retail area.

The inner established suburbs were initially laid out around the key mining areas and include [[Ballarat East, Victoria|Ballarat East]], [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]], [[Golden Point, Victoria|Golden Point]], [[Soldiers Hill, Victoria|Soldiers Hill]], [[Black Hill, Ballarat|Black Hill]], [[Brown Hill, Victoria|Brown Hill]], [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka]], [[Canadian, Victoria|Canadian]], [[Mount Pleasant, Victoria|Mount Pleasant]], [[Redan, Victoria|Redan]], [[Sebastopol, Victoria|Sebastopol]] and [[Newington, Victoria|Newington]].

The post gold rush era has seen a boom in expansion, extending the [[conurbation]] north, south and west.  To the west, Ballarat has expanded to [[Alfredton, Victoria|Alfredton]], [[Delacombe, Victoria|Delacombe]] and [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] to the north it has expanded to [[Ballarat North, Victoria|Ballarat North]], [[Nerrina, Victoria|Nerrina]], [[Invermay, Victoria|Invermay]] and [[Invermay Park, Victoria|Invermay Park]]; to the east to [[Warrenheip, Victoria|Warrenheip]] and south to [[Sebastopol, Victoria|Sebastopol]], [[Mount Clear, Victoria|Mount Clear]] and [[Mount Helen, Victoria|Mount Helen]] with the urban area encroaching the large town of [[Buninyong, Victoria|Bunninyong]].

Wendouree is currently the only major suburban activity centre with a large indoor [[shopping mall]] – Stockland Shopping Centre (expanded in 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stockland.com.au/assets/shopping-centres_vic/DEV24467_WEN_FlashTower.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) and also has a number of surrounding [[retail park]]s including a strip shopping centre along Howitt Street including the large retail chain [[Harvey Norman]].  Elsewhere are small suburban hubs with supermarkets such as [[IGA (supermarkets)]] and small stretches of shopfronts.

Unlike Melbourne, Ballarat does not have a defined [[urban growth boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/melbourne2030online/content/policies_initiatives/02a_policy21.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This has put continuing pressure on the city council to approve development applications for subdivisions outside of the city fringe.  In response to lobbying by landholders the Ballarat West Growth Area Plan, a major [[Greenfield land]] development plan was prepared and has approved by the city and state government to allow for planned fringe communities consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents effectively doubling the city's urban area by extending the [[urban sprawl]] from Sebastopol, Delacombe and Alfredton west toward [[Bonshaw, Victoria|Bonshaw]], [[Smythes Creek, Victoria|Smythes Creek]] and [[Cardigan, Victoria|Cardigan]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new suburb to be known as [[Lucas, Victoria|Lucas]] to be created.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Fiona [http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarat-west-suburb-to-be-named-lucas/2071841.aspx Ballarat west suburb to be named Lucas] The Courier 10 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  New activity centres are to be developed at Delacombe and Alfredton.

Its elevation, at 435 metres (1,427&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, causes its mean monthly temperatures to tend on average 3 – 4 degrees Celsius below those of Melbourne{{fact|date=May 2011}}. The mean daily maximum temperature for January is 25.0 °C (76.8 °F){{fact|date=May 2011}} whilst the mean minimum is 10.8 °C (51 °F){{fact|date=May 2011}} In July, the mean maximum is 10.0 °C (50 °F), with average July minimum is 3.2 °C (38 °F){{fact|date=May 2011}}.

There are an average of 198 rain-free days per year{{fact|date=May 2011}}.  Like much of Australia, Ballarat experiences cyclical drought and heavy rainfall.  Flooding of the Yarrowee catchment occurs occasionally.  In 1869 a serious flood of the Yarrowee River put most of the lower section of business district including Bridge and Grenville streets underwater and causing the loss of two lives.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Flood of Ballarat. pg 6.

==Environment==
[[File:Mount Buninyong.jpg|thumb|A view toward Mount Buninyong Reserve]]
Ballarat has a healthy environment in comparison to Melbourne, however as a growing regional city there are issues including pollution, waterway health and invasive species.  Air quality is generally good,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epanote2.epa.vic.gov.au/EPA/Publications.NSF/515bc2fde7bf93f44a2565b6001ee896/83b1f49d9d53c2d0ca256dc700218012/$FILE/936.pdf |title=Airbourne particle monitoring at Ballarat, Feb&amp;nbsp;02 to Sept 03 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however woodsmoke from [[fireplace]]s is a issue in the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epanote2.epa.vic.gov.au/EPA/Publications.NSF/PubDocsLU/1111?OpenDocument |title=Air monitoring at Ballarat August 2005 to August 2006 |publisher=Epanote2.epa.vic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballarat's waterways have historically been affected by heavy pollution from both mining and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinlan |first=Kim |url=http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/news-features/yarrowee-dont-call-it-a-creek/526254.aspx |title=Yarrowee: Don't call it a creek. – Local News – News – News Features |publisher=The Courier |date=11 April 2002 |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://epanote2.epa.vic.gov.au/EPA/media.nsf/ad5006bdf5dcd5c84a256695000c4619/fc59cf3423e7e9d04a2566dd0017d972/$FILE/EPA%20Media%20Release.rtf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Feral pigeon]]s are also a problem in Ballarat.

The Ballarat Environment Network formed in 1993 to provide a voice for environmental and [[nature conservation]] issues in Ballarat and surrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ben.org.au |title=Offline |publisher=BEN |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another large lobby group for [[sustainability]] in the city is the Ballarat Renewable Energy And Zero Emissions – BREAZE formed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breaze.org.au/ |title=Welcome to BREAZE |publisher=Breaze.org.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Ballarat released an Environment Sustainability Strategy for the city in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/66766/city%20of%20ballarat%20environment%20sustainability%20strategy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are no national parks in Ballarat's proximity, Ballarat is bordered by extensive bushland to the north, south and south west and sensitive [[wetlands]] to the east.  There are a number of nearby state parks and large reserves including the [[Enfield State Park]], [[Creswick Regional Park]], [[Mount Warrenheip]] Flora Reserve [[Mount Buninyong]] Reserve and [[Lake Burrumbeet]] park.  The region is home to a large [[koala]] population with protected areas established in the city's outer southern and eastern settlements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/vcat-knocks-back-mt-helen-subdivision-due-to-koalas/1902027.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ballarat.vic.gov.au&quot;&gt;http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57443/ballarat%20koala%20plan%20of%20management%20-%20information%20brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many parts of urban Ballarat have been affected by the introduction of exotic species, particularly introduced flora.  [[Common Gorse]] is one such problem which has prompted the formation of an official Ballarat Region Gorse Task Force in 1999 to control.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/biodiversity04-2a.html#cs18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Ballarat's major industries include the service industries, tourism and [[hospitality]], [[manufacturing]], [[education]] and [[information technology]] as well as primary industries including [[agriculture]], mining and renewable energy.

As a major service centre for the populous goldfields region, Ballarat has large sectors of employment in retailing, service industries, state and federal government branch offices and agencies and health care.

===Service industries===
Ballarat is the main retail economy in the region.  Central to the retail district is a [[pedestrian mall]] known as Bridge Mall.  There are [[shopping mall]]s, the largest of which are [[Central Square, Ballarat|Central Square Shopping Centre]] (completed in 1988) opposite the town hall which includes the major department stores of [[Myer]] (located within the 1870s Mitchell building) and [[Target Australia|Target]].  Additionally the city has each of the major supermarkets, specialty stores and branches of the [[Big Four (banks)|big four]] Australian retail banks.

Ballarat has become a major education centre with the formation of the University of Ballarat which exports education through a large international students program and throughout Australia through [[distance education]] programs.

In recent years, a large technology park, the University of Ballarat Technology Park with communications centre has been established, with tenants including [[IBM]] and employing over 1,400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmv.vic.gov.au/NewsIBMexpansionbrings300jobstoBallarat |title=Multimedia Victoria – IBM expansion brings 300 jobs to Ballarat |publisher=Mmv.vic.gov.au |date=4 December 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism and hospitality===
[[File:Ballarat dyliżans.jpg|thumb|Main Street Sovereign Hill, a large open air gold mining museum is Ballarat's most famous attraction.]]
Ballarat attracts 2.2 million visitors a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://tourismexcellence.com.au/images/stories/pdf/module5/BallaratVisitorServices.pdf City of Ballarat Visitor Services]&lt;/ref&gt; and the tourism and hospitality industry is a [[A$]]480 million a year sector which accounts for around 15% of Ballarat's economy and employs around 2,870 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballarattouristassociation.asn.au/ |title=Ballarat Tourist Association |publisher=Ballarat Tourist Association |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant [[heritage tourism]] industry has grown substantially in Ballarat since the 1960s.  Ballarat is most notable for the award-winning [[open-air museum]] known as [[Sovereign Hill]], a recreated 1850s gold mining settlement opened in 1970.  Sovereign Hill is Ballarat's biggest tourism drawcard and is consistently rated amongst one of the best outdoor museums in the world and continues to expand.  Sovereign Hill accounts for over half a million of Ballarat's visitors and $40 million in tourism revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=sovereignhil Business Ballarat – Sovereign Hill]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[tourist trap]]s and spin-offs have capitalised on Sovereign Hill's tourism popularity, most of these have sprung up near the eastern entrance of the Western Freeway between Melbourne and Ballarat.  They include [[Kryal Castle]] (1972), &quot;Gold Rush Mini Golf&quot; (2002) featuring the &quot;Big Miner&quot; (2006) one of [[Australia's big things]] (although the original proposal appeared larger and for the miner to hold the Eureka Flag)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldrushgolf.com.au/uploads/GoldrushEditorial_4_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; at Ballarat's eastern entrance.

Other tourist attractions include the [[Eureka Centre]]; [[The Gold Museum, Ballarat|The Gold Museum]]; Ballarat Botanic gardens and Lake Wendouree; the Tramway museum and [http://www.eerietours.com.au Ballarat Ghost Tours].  A large number of Ballarat hotels, motels and restaurants service the tourism industry.  The Ballarat Tourist Association is an industry based non-profit, membership organisation representing the city's tourism industry.

===Mining and gold===
[[File:Gold-271347.jpg|thumb|upright|Large gold specimen from the Ballarat mines, weight over 150 gms, size 7.4 x 4.4 x 2.3 cm.]]
Gold historically has been one of the main industries of the Ballarat region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lglgold.com/data/portal/00000005/content/35824001175418214937.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Gold mining has continued to the present date with a main mine operating and large deposits remaining deep underground.  There are still thought to be large, undiscovered gold reserves around the Ballarat region, with investigations being made by local and national companies to extract potentially as much gold as the [[Victorian gold rush|Gold Rush]] days in the mid 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Ballarat Goldfields – http://www.lglgold.com/data/portal/00000005/content/68910001181645144108.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lihir Gold]] invested in Ballarat Goldfields in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/10/17/1160850931304.html Lihir Gold to buy Ballarat for $350m] by Jamie Freed for The Age. 18 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; however downscaled its operations in 2009 due to the expense of extraction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/business/200-jobs-lost-as-lihir-gold-quits-ballarat-20090721-ds31.html 200 jobs lost as Lihir Gold quits Ballarat] by Mathew Murphy for The Age. 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; before selling its stake in 2010 to Castlemaine Goldfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topnews.in/lihir-gold-sells-ballarat-mine-castlemaine-2255447 |title=Lihir Gold sells Ballarat mine to Castlemaine &amp;#124; TopNews |publisher=Topnews.in |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lignite]] (coal), [[kaolin]] (clay) and [[iron ore]] have also been mined in the Ballarat region and nearby [[Lal Lal]] however many of the resource deposits have since been exhausted.

===Manufacturing===
According to the 2006 Australian Census, manufacturing is Ballarat's third largest employment sector, accounting for 14.8% of all workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/council/communications-and-publications/media-releases/february/ballarat-city-council-representatives-to-meet-with-federal-minister-for-innovation,-industry,-science-and-research.aspx Ballarat City Council representatives to meet with Federal Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research] Thursday, 18 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballarat attracts investment from several international manufacturers.  The Australian headquarters of [[Mars, Incorporated]] was established in Ballarat in 1979 with the main Ballarat factory producing [[Mars bar]]s for the Australian market.&lt;ref&gt;Sobey, Emily [http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/mars-celebrates-30-years-in-ballarat/1688226.aspx Mars celebrates 30 years in Ballarat] The Courier. 24 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  [[McCain Foods Limited]] Australian headquarters was established in Ballarat in 1970 and the company continues to expand its operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccain.com.au/our-company_about-mccain_company-history.aspx Company History] from mccain.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ballarat North Workshops]] is a major manufacturer of public transportation products with current investment from [[Alstom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tandlnews.com.au/2010/08/31/article/XTrapolis-train-manufacturing-under-way-in-Ballarat/HQBRJFWKRB.html X'trapolis Train Manufacturing Under Way in Ballarat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballarat also has a large number of home grown companies producing textiles, general industrial engineering, food products, brick and tiles, building components, prefabricated housing components and automotive components.

===Renewable energy===
[[File:Waubra wind farm construction DKC1.jpg|thumb|Waubra Wind Farm (now complete) under construction in 2008]]
The Ballarat region has a rapidly growing [[renewable energy]] industry, in particular due to its abundant [[wind energy]], attracting significant investment and generating revenue for local landholders and local councils.  The region is also a source of bountiful [[geothermal energy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;geothermal&quot;&gt;Williams, Erin [http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarat-region-named-a-geothermal-hotspot/1884480.aspx Ballarat region named a geothermal hotspot. 14 Jul 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Television station BTV Channel 6 Ballarat commenced transmission of test patterns on 17 March 1962. Among the many local programs BTV6 produced, the 90 minute live variety program &quot;Six Tonight&quot; (1971–1983) hosted by local Ballarat identity Fred Fargher, was one of the few live Australian programs of this type being presented in Australia.

In his 1999 book ''And Now Here's...'' (Four Decades of Behind the Scenes Fun in Australian Television), Mike McColl Jones fondly remembers local live television variety.
&quot;...and in Ballarat, Victoria, a Tonight show (&quot;Six Tonight&quot;) was carving its name into Australian television history. The show, hosted by Fred Fargher, ran for 13 years, and managed to attract many of the top name entertainers in the world, simply by offering them a limo ride to this beautiful country centre, a no-pressure spot on the show, and then a great dinner afterwards at one of the city's excellent restaurants. The sheer bravado of the offer enticed some of show business' biggest names.&quot;

Today Ballarat is serviced by numerous 'free to air' High Definition and Standard Definition Digital television services. Two television broadcasting stations are located in the city including [[WIN Television|WIN]], [[GEM HD]] and [[Go! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]] (sub-licensees of [[Nine Network]]) and [[Prime Television|PRIME]], [[7Two]] on Prime, [[7mate]] on Prime (a sub-licensee of [[Seven Network]]). These two stations broadcast relayed services throughout regional Victoria. The city also receives [[Southern Cross Ten]], [[One HD]] and [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]] (sub-licensee's of [[Network Ten]]) that is based in [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] but operates a local office. 

Ballarat television maintains a similar schedule to the national television network but maintains local demographic commercials and local/regional news and some other local/regional programming. In addition to commercial television services, Ballarat receives Government [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] (ABC1, ABC2, ABC3, ABC News 24) and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] (SBS One and Two) television services.

On Friday 5th May, 2011, Analog television transmissions ceased in most areas of regional Victoria and some border regions including Ballarat and surrounding areas. All local free-to-air television services are now broadcasting in digital transmission only. This was done as part of the Federal Government`s plan for [[Digital terrestrial television in Australia]], where all analog transmission systems are gradually turned off and replaced with modern [[DVB-T]] transmission systems.

Subscription television services are provided by [[Neighbourhood Cable]], [[Austar]], and [[SelecTV (Australian television)|SelecTV]].

[[File:Reids coffee palace ballarat.jpg|thumb|Distinctive Australian style of Victorian filigree displayed by the facade of Reid's Coffee Palace, Lydiard Street Nth]]

===In popular culture===

Ballarat has inspired many [[visual art]]ists, with several celebrated works depicting the city.  In the Australian Collection of the Ballarat Art Gallery are some of [[Eugene von Guerard]]'s works documenting the city's establishment as a gold digging settlement, [[Albert Henry Fullwood]]'s depictions of boom era streetscapes and [[Knut Bull]]'s View of Ballarat Across Lake Wendouree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balgal.com/?id=collection&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other artists have painted depictions of historic events such as the Eureka Stockade.

Historic Lydiard Street features prominently in national [[television advertisement]] advertisements including the Gold Lion award ([[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarats-big-vb-ad-wins-cannes-gong/1896177.aspx Ballarat's big VB ad wins Cannes gong by Erin Williams for The Courier. 27 Jul 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and Australasian Writers and Art Directors Association award winning &quot;The Regulars&quot; (2009) for [[Victoria Bitter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/business/fosters-hoping-to-strike-vb-gold-in-ballarat-20090513-b3b6.html Foster's hoping to strike VB gold in Ballarat]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[What About Me (song)|What About Me]]&quot; (2010) Safe Driver Rewards campaign for [[Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited|AAMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmballarathepburnandbeyond.com.au/news/index/id/402/year/2010 |title=News :: Film Ballarat Hepburn &amp; Beyond :: An initiative to promote film and television production in regional Victoria, Australia |publisher=Filmballarathepburnandbeyond.com.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ships of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] have been named [[HMAS Ballarat]] after the city, [[HMAS Ballarat (J184)]] and [[HMAS Ballarat (FFH 155)]].

Popular nicknames used by locals for the city include &quot;The 'Rat&quot;, a shortened version of the name derived from the [[brown rat]], the name and symbol was further popularised by Rebellion Brewery's The Rat beer.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Emma [http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/news-features/new-beer-proves-brewery-gives-a-rats-about-city/1756330.aspx  New beer proves brewery gives a rats about city] The Courier 19 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Another enduring nickname is Golden City which dates back to the gold rush and appears in several names including Golden City Hotel (1856) and the Golden City paddlesteamer (1885) and in numerous non-fiction works.

==Infrastructure==
===Health===
[[File:BAllarat Hospital.jpg|thumb|Ballarat Base Hospital's Henry Bolte wing (completed in 1994) Drummond St Nth]]
Ballarat has major hospitals in [[Ballarat Base Hospital]] which services the entire region and the Queen Elizabeth Centre.  [[Private hospital]]s include a [[St John of God Health Care]] centre, established in 1915 and is currently the largest private hospital in regional Victoria.

===Utilities===
[[Central Highlands Water]] supplies Ballarat with water.  The main reservoir is the White Swan reservoir which is topped up through the [[Goldfields Superpipe]] sourced from the Goulburn-Murray waterway system.  Secondary supplies include the Gong Gong Reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarat-population-growth-water-supply-critical/1814779.aspx Ballarat population growth: water supply critical] by Kim Quinlan for The Courier 28 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballarat's data communications services now come from several providers, however for a long time the city went without [[broadband]] services.  An extensive private broadband network was built by Neighbourhood Cable, now [[Telstra]] and [[Optus]] also provide broadband services.  No announcement of Ballarat's rollout of the [[National Broadband Network]] has yet been made however it is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry.&lt;ref&gt;Power, Marcus [http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/broadband-revolution-coming-to-ballarat/1512825.aspx Broadband revolution coming to Ballarat 13 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballaratict.com/resources/Issues-MinisterConroy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballarat's electricity supply is provided and maintained by Victorian electricity distributor [[Powercor]].

===Transport===
====Road====
The main mode of transport in Ballarat is the [[road]] network and the [[automobile]].  The [[Western Freeway (Victoria)|Western Freeway]] is [[dual carriageway]] in Ballarat providing a connection to Melbourne (approximately 90 minutes) and bypassing the central city on its way westward to [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] (approximately 75 minutes) and [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]].  A network of state highways from Ballarat.  The [[Midland Highway (Victoria)|Midland Highway]] is a dual carriageway which runs north along Creswick Road to the Western Freeway interchange but becomes a single carriageway north of Ballarat to [[Creswick]] (approximately 25 minutes) and runs south as the dual carriageway of Skipton Road to Magpie before becoming a single carriageway to [[Geelong]] (approximately 87 minutes).  The [[Glenelg Highway]] connects directly to [[Mount Gambier]] and the [[Sunraysia Highway]] west of Ballarat which connects directly to [[Mildura]].  Sturt Street and Victoria Street, both dual carriageways carry the bulk of the east-west CBD traffic, while Mair Street is planned to become dual carriageway to relieve pressure on these main streets.  Other dual carriageway main roads in the west include Howitt Street and Gillies Street.  The remainder of Ballarat's roads are mainly secondary single carriageways or service lanes to the inner suburbs.

Ballarat is also served by an extensive public bus service branded as '''Ballarat Transit''' which is currently operated mainly by Ballarat Coachlines and Davis Bus Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busvic.asn.au/links/content.aspx?id=11 |title=Bus Association Victoria |publisher=Busvic.asn.au |date= |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The taxi system operates in all suburbs and is currently operated by Ballarat Taxis Co-op Ltd.

Regional coaches operated by [[V/Line]] connect Ballarat with other regional centres such as [[Warrnambool]], [[Bendigo]], Mildura and [[Maryborough, Victoria|Maryborough]].  There is also a direct bus service to Melbourne's [[Tullamarine Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airportshuttlebus.com.au/ Airport Shuttlebus]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rail====
{{Seealso|Trams in Ballarat}}
[[File:Vlocity railcars ballarat.jpg|thumb|right|Modern fleet of VLocity railcars inside the [[train shed]] of [[Ballarat railway station, Victoria|Ballarat railway station]]]]
Ballarat has historically been a major railway hub in Victoria, situated at the junction of the [[Serviceton railway line|Ballarat line]], [[Serviceton railway line|Ararat line]] and [[Mildura railway line|Mildura line]]s it currently has several connections for both passenger services and freight.

Ballarat has two passenger railway stations, the hub of [[Ballarat railway station, Victoria|Ballarat railway station]] and suburban [[Wendouree railway station, Victoria|Wendouree railway station]]&lt;ref&gt;Victorian Transport Plan – Ballarat:Wendouree Station http://www4.transport.vic.gov.au/vtp/projects/wendouree.html&lt;/ref&gt; out of which [[V/Line]] operates [[VLocity]] trains running at up to {{convert|160|km/h|0|abbr=on}} east to Melbourne, west and [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] and north to [[Maryborough railway station, Victoria|Maryborough]].  The busiest service is the peak hour express (64 minutes) to Melbourne which has become highly popular with commuters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/regional-rail-travel-booming-despite-delays-20090605-byld.html Regional rail travel booming, despite delays] from The Age&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Regional Rail Link]] project is underway to separate Ballarat's trains from Melbourne's suburban rail network for more regular services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/06/3183515.htm Regional rail link seen as Ballarat work boost] from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. 6 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Interurban services (Ballarat-Melbourne) now run half hourly during weekday peak and hourly on weekends from Ballarat station.  A twice daily (53 minute) service connects  Ballarat to [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] while there is a (57 minute) service to and from [[Maryborough railway station, Victoria|Maryborough]] (stopping at [[Creswick, Victoria|Creswick]]) once a day each way.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, David [http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballaratmaryborough-day-trip-a-no-go/1905960.aspx Ballarat-Maryborough day trip a no go], The Courier, 6 Aug 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ballarat to Geelong (the [[Geelong-Ballarat railway line]]) currently operates as a freight line only (passenger services were withdrawn in 1978) and the city has several disused railway corridors and stations along the [[Skipton railway line|Skipton railway]], [[Buninyong railway line|Buninyong railway]] and the Ballarat Cattle Yards railway.

Ballarat once operated an extensive tramway network which began in 1887, however it was closed in 1971 and replaced by buses.  A small section of track remains used as a tourist and museum tramway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btm.org.au/ Ballarat Tramway Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been proposals to extend the network, particularly to connect it to the railways and return it as a viable component of the Ballarat public transport system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/tram-plans-on-track/304990.aspx Tram plans on track] by Mariza Fiamengo for The Courier. 1 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air====
[[File:YBLT.jpg|thumb|left|Ballarat Aerodrome from above]]
[[Ballarat Airport]] located {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} North-West of the CBD consists of two sealed runways (each approximately 1,400&amp;nbsp;m/4,600&amp;nbsp;ft length and 30&amp;nbsp;m/100&amp;nbsp;ft wide) as well as extensive sealed aprons, night lighting and NDB Navaid. In 2005 the City of Ballarat commissioned a Master Plan 2004–2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Files/BallaratAerodromeMasterPlan2004-2014.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that outlined future development and growth of the Airport. The report made a series of recommendations and forecasts that included eventual lengthening, widening and strengthening of the existing main runway up to 1800 metres (5,900&amp;nbsp;ft), consideration for expansion of the passenger terminal and recommendations for future use of aprons and development of future structures supporting larger aircraft and increased frequent usage. It is forecast that by 2012–15 regular domestic passenger services using 40–50 seat commuter aircraft may feasibly commence.

====Cycling====
Ballarat has a long history of cycling as a form of transport and recreation.  The current cycling network continues to grow and consists of several marked on-road routes and 50 kilometres of [[segregated bicycle facilities]] including several main routes :[[Ballarat–Skipton Rail Trail]], Yarrowee River Trail with connections to the [[Gong Gong Reservoir]], Buningyong Trail, Sebastopol Trail, and the Lake Wendouree shared path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/191988/ballarat%20bicycle%20strategy%202008.pdf Ballarat City Council Bicycle Strategy 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ballarat Bicycle Users Group provides advocacy for the growing number of cyclists in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balbug.net Ballarat Bicycle Users Group]&lt;/ref&gt;  The popularity of cycling in Ballarat is also demonstrated by the large number of spectators and participants drawn to cycling sporting events held in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/sport/general/cycling-boon-for-ballarat-region/1826064.aspx Cycling boon for Ballarat region] David Brehaut for The Courier. 10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Abritus''',&lt;ref&gt;This seems to be the correct spelling. See ''Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World'', map 22. Also see title in Ivanov and Stojanov 1985&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Battle of Forum Terebronii''',&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled  ''Trebonii''. The uncertainty of the spelling comes from the imperfect transcribing of the Latin place-name into the Greek text (&quot;τῷ λεγομένῳ φόρῳ Θεμβρωνίῳ&quot;) of George Syncellus&lt;/ref&gt; occurred in the Roman province of [[Moesia Inferior]] (modern [[Razgrad]], [[Bulgaria]]) probably in July, 251, between the [[Roman Empire]] and a federation of [[Scythians#Migration_period|Scythian]] tribesmen under the [[Goths|Goth]] king [[Cniva]]. The Romans were soundly defeated, and [[Roman emperor]]s [[Decius]] and his son [[Herennius Etruscus]] were both killed during battle. They became the first Roman emperors killed in a battle with a foreign enemy.

The battle typically marks the starting of a period of increased military and political instability in the Roman Empire, although the symptoms of the crisis had already appeared in the preceding decades.

== Background ==
[[Image:GothicInvasions250-251.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Map of the invasions and the location of the battle. Click on it to enlarge]]Soon after Decius ascended to the throne in 249, barbarian tribes invaded the Roman provinces of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], [[Moesia Superior]] and [[Moesia Inferior]]. Two factors had contributed to growing unrest in the area north of Danube. First, Decius' predecessor [[Philip the Arab]] had refused to continue payments, initiated by Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 238, of annual subsidies to the aggressive tribes of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Southern 2001, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; Second and more important, there were continuous movements of new peoples since the time of Emperor [[Severus Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; Decius may also have taken with him troops from the Danube frontier, in order to depose Philip in 249.  The resultant military vacuum would inevitably attract invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Southern 2001, p.222. Wolfram 1988, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

The course of events is not clear. It seems that in 250 the [[Carpians|Carpi]] invaded Dacia, eastern [[Moesia Superior]] and western Moesia Inferior.&lt;ref name = CAH/&gt; At the same time, a tribal coalition under Cniva crossed the Roman frontier, probably advancing in two columns. Whether these were consisted only of Goths is rather unlikely so the name &quot;Scythians&quot; by which the Greek sources called them (a geographical definition) seems more appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Potter prefers to call them &quot;Scythians&quot;, since the 4th century &quot;Goths&quot; cannot be easily connected with their supposed ancestors 100 years above. See Potter 2004, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite possible that other people of Germanic and Sarmatian origin (like [[Bastarnae]], [[Taifals]] and [[Hasdingi|Hasdingian Vandals]]), perhaps Roman deserters as well, had joined the invaders.&lt;ref name = Wolfram1/&gt; However, the name of the king is indeed Gothic and probably genuine.&lt;ref name=Potter1&gt;Potter 2004, p.245. He suggest that, since the name Cniva doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings by Jordanes, the latter found it in a genuine 3rd century source.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first column of Cniva's army, a detachment likely led by the chieftains Argaith and Gunteric, besieged [[Marcianopolis]], without success it seems.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 2004, p.46 and, in more detail, Wolfram 1988, pp.45,397. Although Jordanes (''Getica'', 91) places these chieftains under the command of Cniva's predecessor (a certain Ostrogotha), Wolfram and other scholars argue that it is plausible to regard their campaign as part of Cniva's invasion&lt;/ref&gt; Then they probably headed south to besiege Philippopolis (now [[Plovdiv]] in Bulgaria). Cniva's main column under the King himself crossed Danube at [[Oescus]] then headed eastwards to [[Novae]], where he was repelled by the provincial governor (and future emperor) [[Trebonianus Gallus]].&lt;ref name=CAH&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History'', vol XII, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Then the invaders headed south to plunder [[Nicopolis ad Istrum]] where Decius defeated them but not decisively.&lt;ref&gt;Bird 1994, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; After these initial setbacks, the barbarians moved southwards through [[Balkan Mountains|Haemus mountain]] and Decius pursued them (likely through the [[Shipka_Pass#Shipka_Pass|Shipka Pass]]) to save Philippopolis.&lt;ref name = Wolfram2/&gt; This time Decius' army was taken by surprise while resting at [[Beroe]]/Augusta Traiana. The Romans were heavily defeated in the ensuing battle. Decius was forced to withdrew his wrecked army to the north at Oescus, leaving Cniva ample time to ravage Moesia and finally capture Philippopolis in the summer of 251, in part with the help of its commander, a certain [[Titus Julius Priscus]] who had proclaimed himself Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram 1988, p.46, suggests summer of 250 as the date of the fall of Philippopolis and spring of 251 as the earliest date for the beginning of Cniva's returning to his base&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Priscus, after receiving the news of the defeat at Beroe, thought that the Goths would spare him and the city. He was wrong and was probably killed when the city fell.&lt;ref  name=Southern1&gt;Southern 2001, p.222. Bird 1994, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Scythians began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.&lt;ref name = Wolfram2/&gt;

In the meantime, Decius had returned with his re-organized army, accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and the general [[Trebonianus Gallus]], intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty.

==Battle==
Probably in July&lt;ref&gt;Herwig Wolfram, ''Die Goten und ihre Geschichte'', C. H. Beck Verlag, München, 2001, p.33. ISBN 3-406-44779-1&lt;/ref&gt; or August&lt;ref&gt;Southern 2001, p.308. She conjectures August as the date of Herennius Etruscus proclamation to the rank of Augustus, then the battle could not take place before that point&lt;/ref&gt; of 251, the Roman army engaged the Scythians under Cniva near Abritus. The strengths of the bellingerent forces are unknown, but we know that Cniva divided his forces into three units, with one of these parts concealed behind a swamp.&lt;ref name = Potter2/&gt; It seems that Cniva was a skilled tactician and that he was very familiar with the surrounding terrain.&lt;ref name=Wolfram1&gt;Wolfram 1988, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanes and Aurelius Victor claim that&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes, par.103. Aurelius Victor, par.29&lt;/ref&gt; Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow during a skirmish before the outset of the battle and that his father addressed his soldiers as if the loss of his son did not matter. He allegedly said, &quot;Let no one mourn. The death of one soldier is not a great loss to the Republic&quot;. However, other sources state that Herennius died with his father.&lt;ref name=Potter3&gt;Potter 2004, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abritus Razgrad Kaladan 1.jpg|right|thumb|Roman ruins at Abritus, site of the battle]]
The manoeuvre of the Scythians was ultimately successful. Decius' forces defeated their opponents in the front line, but made the fatal mistake of pursuing their fleeing enemy into the swamp, where they were ambushed and routed. The immense slaughter marked one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of the Roman Empire and resulted in the death of Decius himself.&lt;ref name=Potter2&gt;Potter 2004, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]]&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12.20, a free translation of the following Greek text: &quot;καὶ αὐτός τε σὺν τῷ υἱῷ καὶ πλῆθος τῶν ̔Ρωμαίων ἐνεπεπτώκει τῷ τέλματι, καὶ πάντες ἐκεῖσε ἀπώλοντο, ὡς μηδὲ τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν εὑρεθῆναι, καταχωσθέντα τῇ ἰλύϊ τοῦ τέλματος&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; vividly narrates how &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;he and his son and a large number of Romans fell into the marshland; all of them perished there, none of their bodies to be found, as they were covered by the mud.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lactantius]], a Christian apologist of the early 4th century (deeply hating Decius for the [[Decius_%28emperor%29#Persecution_of_Christians|persecution of Christians]] resulted from his edict on sacrifices) described the emperor's demise as following :&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;he was suddenly surrounded by the barbarians, and slain, together with great part of his army; nor could he be honoured with the rites of sepulture, but, stripped and naked, he lay to be devoured by wild beasts and birds, a fit end for the enemy of God.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The supposedly treacherous behavior of Treboniannus Gallus who, according to Zosimus,&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1.25&lt;/ref&gt; signalled the final Gothic assault is not accepted today. It seems impossible that the shattered Roman legions proclaimed emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks. Another strong point against Gallus' treason is the fact that he adopted [[Hostilian]], the younger son of Decius, after returning to Rome.&lt;ref name=Potter3&gt;Potter 2004, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Southern2&gt;Southern 2001, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-debated location of Abritus was finally established (1&amp;nbsp;km east of the city of Razgrad) after the excavations published by T. Ivanov in 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov and Stojanof 1985, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Gallus, who became emperor upon Decius' death, negotiated a treaty with the Goths under duress, which allowed them to keep their booty and return to their homes on the other side of the Danube. It is also possible that he agreed to pay  an annual tribute in return for the Goths' promise to respect Roman territory.&lt;ref&gt;Southern 2001, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; This humiliating treaty, the contemporary spread of plague with its devastating effects and the chaotic situation in the East with the Sassanian invasions left Gallus with a very bad reputation amongst the latter Roman historians. However, D. S. Potter suggests that, before the defeat at Abritus, the situation was not so serious that the available Roman forces would not be able to manage the invasions. Therefore, it is Decius' bad conduct which was responsible for the disastrous turn of the events.&lt;ref name=Potter1&gt;Potter 2004, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Gallus had no choice but to get rid of the Goths as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Wolfram2&gt;Wolfram 1988, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] rated this reverse with the most serious military disasters of the [[Roman Empire]] to his time: [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus']] defeat at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], the incursions of the [[Marcomanni]] during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], and the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]].&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''History (Res Gestae)'', 31.12.13, in ''Loeb Classical Library'', Harvard University Press, 1939&amp;ndash;2001, 479&lt;/ref&gt;

In 271, the Emperor [[Aurelian]] conclusively defeated the Goths and killed their king Cannobaudes in battle. Based on the similarity of the names, that king might coincide with the king Cniva who defeated Decius in Abritus.&lt;ref&gt;Southern 2001, p.116, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Beresteczko 1651.PNG|thumb|366px|right|Battle of Beresteczko 1651, relief at [[Abbaye de Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in Paris]]

The '''Battle of Berestechko''' ({{lang-pl|Bitwa pod Beresteczkiem}}; {{lang-uk|Берестецька битва}}) was fought between rebellious [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], led by [[Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], aided by their [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] allies, and a [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] army under King [[John II of Poland|John II Casimir]]. It was the largest land battle of 17th century.

Lasting from June 28 to June 30, 1651, it took place in [[Volhynia]]. The number of Polish troops is uncertain. Duke [[Bogusław Radziwiłł]] (one of the Polish commanders) wrote that the Polish army had had 80,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Widacki, ''Kniaź Jarema'' p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians [[Zbigniew Wójcik]], [[Józef Gierowski]], and [[Władysław Czapliński]] estimate that the Polish army had 60,000-63,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew Wójcik, ''Jan Kazimierz Waza'', p. 75; Władysław Czapliński, ''Glosa do Trylogii'', p.45; Józef Gierowski, ''Historia Polski'', p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cossacks had around 100,000 plus 40,000 Crimean Tatar cavalry and a few thousand [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Vlachs]]. Both sides had about 40,000 cavalry each. Fighting was close, with the core of excellent Cossack infantry making up for the weakness of their cavalry; much of the decisive fighting was by the infantry and dismounted dragoons of each side.

==The Armies==
On June 19, the Polish Army totaled 14,844 Polish cavalry, 2,250 German type cavalry, 11,900 German-type infantry and dragoons, 2,950 Hungarian-type foot soldiers, 1,550 Lithuanian volunteers, 960 Tatars&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Wasilewski, ''Ostatni Waza na polskim tronie.'' p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; and 30,000 [[pospolite ruszenie|levée en masse]].
Polish commanders were hoping to break the Cossack ranks with an impetous charge of the famous Polish Winged Hussars - a tactic proven effective in many previous battles, including the decisive battles of [[Battle of Kircholm|Kircholm]], and [[Battle of Kluszyn|Kłuszyn]]. (Such a tactic would also prove successful in the later 1683 [[Battle of Vienna]] against the Turks). 
The Cossack army knew the Polish art of war well, having great experience with both fighting along Poles and against them. Their tactic was to avoid an open field battle, while defending in a fortified camp. 

Before the battle, the Cossack army totaled 80,000 men; 28,000-33,000 Tatars and uncertain numbers of Ukrainian peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Wasilewski, ''Ostatni Waza na polskim tronie.'' p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First day of battle==
2000 Polish cavalry (one regiment under the command of [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander Koniecpolski]], supported by [[Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski|Jerzy Lubomirski]], six [[Towarzysz pancerny|pancerni]] cavalry companies of [[Jeremi Wiśniowiecki]] and [[Winged Hussars]] under the command of [[Stefan Czarniecki]] ) repulsed the Tatars, who suffered heavy losses.
During the first day of the battle, the Poles were victorious.

==Second day of battle==
The Poles, encouraged by their victory in the first day, deployed all available cavalry. Polish infantry and artillery stayed in the camp and didn't support the cavalry. But, this time, the tide turned. The Tatar cavalry won against its Polish counterpart. The Tatars came near to the Polish camp but were repulsed by heavy fire from the Polish infantry.
The Poles lost 300 soldiers, including many officers.
During the second day of the battle, the rebels were victorious.

==Third day of battle==
At 3 p.m. Duke [[Jeremi Wiśniowiecki]] led a successful charge of 18 cavalry companies against the right wing of the Cossack-Tatar Army.
The Polish centre, under the command of John Casimir, moved forward. The Tatars tried to attack it, but were repulsed. During the fight, a Polish nobleman called Otwinowski noticed a banner of the Tatar Khan. Polish artillery started to fire in that direction. A Tatar standing next to the Khan fell dead. Panicked, the Khan escaped and the Tatars retreated, kidnapping Khmelnytsky. Only the Cossack wagons remained at the field of battle.

==The siege of the Cossack wagons==
Polish forces laid siege to the Cossack wagons. Initially, the wagons were commanded by colonel Filon Dzhalalii, but after some days he was replaced by [[Ivan Bogun|Ivan Bohun]]. On July 10, the Cossacks got into a panic, believing that their commanders had escaped. The Polish forces attacked the panicked Cossacks and the battle turned into a slaughter. There were 30,000 dead in the camp, including some women and children.

==Results of the battle==
As a result, Khmelnytsky was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]] with the Poles.  As the battle ended, King Kazimierz committed an error by not pursuing the fleeing and disoriented Cossacks.  Later, Khmelnytsky, who was released by the Khan, and the Zaporozhians would continue the revolt.

'''Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky''' ({{lang-uk|Богдан Зиновій Михайлович Хмельницький}}, commonly transliterated as ''Khmelnytsky''; {{lang-pl|'''Bohdan Zenobi Chmielnicki'''}}; {{lang-rus|Богдан Хмельницкий|r=Bogdan Khmelnitsky}}) (c. 1595 – 6 August 1657) was a [[hetman]] of the [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporozhian]] [[Cossack Hetmanate]] of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (now [[Ukraine]]). He led an [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|uprising]] against the Commonwealth and its [[magnate]]s (1648&amp;ndash;1654) which resulted in the creation of a Cossack state. In 1654, he concluded the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] with the [[Tsardom of Russia]], which led to the eventual loss of independence to the [[Russian Empire]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[Image:Alex K Chmelnitskyi.svg|thumb|left|157px| a variant of [[Syrokomla Coat of Arms|Clan Syrokomla arms]], self used by Khmelnytsky as a noble.]]
Although there is no definite proof of the date of his birth, it has been suggested by Ukrainian historian [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]] that his date of birth was likely 27 December 1595 ([[St. Theodore, 9th century anti-iconoclast|St. Theodore]]'s &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Житие и страдание святого преподобномученика и исповедника Феодора и брата его преподобного Феофана1 начертанных&quot; [http://www.pravoslavie.uz/Jitiya/12/27FeodorNachertanniy.htm pravoslavie.uz] and [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=736 catholic.org]&lt;/ref&gt; day). As it was the custom in the [[Orthodox Church]], he was baptized with one of his middle names - Theodor, transformed into [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as Bohdan.

The latest biography of Khmelnytsky by Smoliy and Stepankov, however, challenges the 27 December date and suggests that it is more likely that he was born on 9 November (feast day of St Zenoby,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pravoslavie.name/index.php?download/saints/Oct/30/life01.html Страдание святого священномученика Зиновия епископа Эгейского, и сестры его Зиновии &amp;#8224 Православные имена - pravoslavie.name&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 30 October in [[Julian Calendar]]) and was baptised on 11 November (feast day of [[St. Theodore, 9th century anti-iconoclast|St. Theodore]] in the Catholic Church)&lt;ref&gt;Смолій В.А., Степанков В.С. &quot;Богдан Хмельницький&quot;, Альтернативи, ISBN 966-7217-76-0, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmelnytsky was probably&lt;ref&gt;While [[Subotiv]] or [[Chyhyryn]] are the most common places cited is the most common given as a reference to his place of birth, some other historians, like [[Stanisław Barącz]], support the view that he was born in [[Zhovkva]] (''Żółkiew'')&lt;/ref&gt; born in the village of [[Subotiv]], near [[Chyhyryn]] in [[Ukraine]] at the estate of his father [[Mykhailo Khmelnytsky]]. Even though his father, Mykhailo Khmelnytsky, a [[courtier]] of [[Great Crown Hetman]] [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]], was of noble birth himself, and belonged to the Clan [[Massalski coat of arms|Massalski]], [[Abdank coat of arms|Abdank]] or [[Syrokomla coat of arms|Syrokomla]], there was and is still controversy as to whether Bohdan belonged to the szlachta himself.&lt;ref&gt;Whether Khmelnytsky was or wasn't a noble is uncertain to this day. Certainly he himself claimed nobility when it suited him, and it wasn't often disputed by his contemporaries. Chmielnicki himself once wrote in the letter to king [[Jan Kazimierz]] that he was 'born Chmielnicki' - however that surname was never associated with the [[Abdank Coat of Arms]] he used. His father, a noble himself, was married to a [[Cossack]] woman and according to the [[Polish Statute of 1505]] that might have put Bohdan's szlachta status under scrutiny. There are other theories; that his father or grandfather were stripped of their noble status, or perhaps most controversial, the theory of 19th century Polish historian [[Tomasz Padura]], who based on unknown sources claimed that Chmielnicki's father was a [[Jewish]] convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that in 1590 his father, Mykhailo, was appointed as a [[sotnyk]] for the Korsun-Chyhyryn starosta [[Jan Mikołaj Daniłowicz|Jan Daniłowicz]] who continued to colonize the new Ukrainian lands near [[Dnieper river]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogdan Khmelnitsky&quot;&gt;[http://kraevid.org/lviv/history/personalities/hetmans/bohdan_khmelnytsky/ru/ Bogdan Khmelnitsky] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the above mentioned source Mykhailo, himself, established [[Chyhyryn]] and later his own family estates of Subotiv (5 miles from Chyhyryn) and [[Novoseltsi]]. This however didn't prevent Khmelnytsky from considering himself a noble and his father's status as a deputy [[Starosta]] ([[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]) of Chyhyryn helped him to be considered as such by others. Later on, however, during the Uprising he would stress his mother's [[Cossack]] roots and his father's exploits with the Cossacks of the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Sich]].

There is also no concrete evidence in regard to Khmelnytsky's early education. Several historians believe he received his elementary schooling from a church clerk until he was sent to one of [[Kiev]]'s Orthodox fraternity schools. He continued his education in [[Polish language|Polish]] at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college, possibly in [[Jarosław]], but more likely in [[Lviv]], in the school founded by hetman Żółkiewski. He completed his schooling by 1617 and acquired a broad knowledge of world history and learned Polish and [[Latin language|Latin]]. Later in addition to these languages he learned [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]], and [[French language|French]]. Unlike many of the other Jesuit students, he did not embrace [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] but remained [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]].

===Service with the Cossacks===
{{Cossacks}}

Upon completion of his studies in 1617, Bohdan entered into service with the Cossacks. As early as 1619 he was sent along with his father to [[Moldavia]], as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth entered into war with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His first military engagement was a tragic one. During the [[Battle of Ţuţora (1620)|battle of Cecora]] (Ţuţora) on 17 September 1620, his father was killed, and young Khmelnytsky among many others, including future hetman [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]], was captured by the Turks. He spent the next two years in captivity in [[Constantinople]], as a prisoner of an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]]&lt;ref&gt;Commonly the citizens of [[Ottoman Empire]] were associated with Turkey, but the empire encompassed far greater territory housing such [[ethnic groups]] as [[Armenians]], [[Albanians]], [[Arabs]], [[Slavs]], and many others that do not relate to [[Turkic ethnicity]]. The leaders of the [[Ottoman Empire]] also were not always [[Turkish people|Turkish]] such as [[Skanderbeg|İskender Bey]] and [[Hürrem Sultan]] among only few.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kaptan Pasha]] (presumably [[Parlak Mustafa Pasha]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;SS51&quot;&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret. page 51. Lebid. Kiev. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim that he spent his slavery in [[Ottoman Navy]] on [[galley]]s as a rowing [[oarsman]] where he picked the knowledge of [[Turkic languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogdan Khmelnitsky&quot;/&gt;

While there is no concrete evidence as to how he returned to Ukraine, most historians believe he either escaped or his ransom was paid. Sources vary as to by whom &amp;mdash; his mother, friends, the Polish king &amp;mdash; but perhaps by [[Krzysztof Zbaraski]], ambassador of the Rzeczpospolita to the [[Ottomans]], who in 1622 paid 30,000 [[thaler]]s in ransom for all [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] captured at the Battle of Cecora. Upon return to Subotiv, Khmelnytsky took over the running of his father's estate and became a [[Registered Cossacks|registered Cossack]] in the Chyhyryn Regiment where he later became a [[pysar]] (a historical officer title among cossacks). Since 1625 he participated in several sea raids together with [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] onto [[Constantinople]]. In those raids he earned his title of a [[sotnyk]] (a leader of a hundred). In the meantime, his widowed mother married again, to [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] noble Vasyl Stavetsky, and moved to his estate, leaving Bohdan in charge of Subotiv. In a year she had another son, Hryhoriy, who curiously enough later preferred to take his mother's name and was known as Hryhoriy Khmelnytsky. For a short time he also served as a [[koniuszy]] to hetman [[Mikołaj Potocki]], but relatively quickly they parted their ways after a personal conflict. Bohdan Khmelnytsky later married Hanna Somkivna, a daughter of a rich [[Pereyaslavl]] Cossack and they settled in Subotiv. By the second half of the 1620s they already had three daughters: Stepanida, Olena, and Kateryna. His first son [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymish (Tymofiy)]] was born in 1632, and another son [[Yuriy Khmelnytsky|Yuriy]] was born in 1640.

During this time Bohdan Khmelnytsky was running his estate and advanced in his service in the Regiment. He first became a [[sotnyk]] and later advanced to the rank of a regiment scribe. He certainly had significant negotiation skills and commanded respect of his fellow Cossacks as on 30 August 1637 he was included in a delegation to [[Warsaw]] to plead the Cossacks' case before the Polish King [[Władysław IV]]. Serving in the army of a Polish magnate and great commander, hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, he participated in a rather successful campaign as the Commonwealth army, part of which was Bohdan's regiment, scored a decisive victory over the [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] in 1644. During this time, as some archival documents show, he also had a meeting in Warsaw with the French ambassador Count De Bregie, during which he discussed the possibility of Cossack participation in war in France. Sources vary as to whether in April 1645 he traveled to France (to [[Fontainebleau]]) to discuss further details of Cossack service in France; this claim is supported by Ukrainian historiography but disputed by Polish scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS70&quot;&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret. page 70, Lebid, Kiev. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1644 around two thousand Polish infantry soldiers (some scholars think they were Cossacks, but the French sources do not actually name them as such) went to France by sea via [[Gdańsk]] and [[Calais]], where they participated in the siege and capture of [[Dunkerque]].

===The Czapliński Affair===
In the meantime another trouble was brewing at home. Upon the death of magnate Stanisław Koniecpolski, an advocate of fair treatment of [[Cossacks]], his successor [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander]] redrew the maps of his possessions and laid claim to Khmelnytsky's estate, which he claimed was his. In his attempt to find protection from the powerful magnate, Khmelnytsky wrote numerous appeals and letters to different representatives of the Polish crown &amp;mdash; but to no avail. At the end of 1645 the Chyhyryn starost (elder) [[Daniel Czapliński]] officially received authority from Koniecpolski to seize the Subotiv estate. In summer of 1646 Khmelnytsky, using his favorable standing at the Polish court, arranged an audience with King Władysław IV to plead his case. Władysław, who wanted Cossacks on his side in the wars he planned, gave him a royal charter, which protected his rights to the estate. However, such was the structure of the Commonwealth at that time, and the lawlessness of its eastern realms, that even the King was not able to avert the confrontation with the local magnates. In the beginning of 1647 Daniel Czapliński openly started to harass Khmelnytsky in an attempt to force him off the land. On two occasions Subotiv was raided: considerable property damage was done and Khmelnytsky's son Yuriy was badly beaten. Finally, in April 1647, Czapliński succeeded in evicting Khmelnytsky from the land, causing Khmelnytsky to move with his large family to a relative's house in Chyhyryn.

In May 1647 Khmelnytsky arranged a second audience with the King to plead his case, but found the King unwilling to go into an open confrontation with a powerful magnate. In addition to the loss of the estate, his first wife Hanna died, leaving him alone with the children. While he promptly remarried to Motrona, his second wife, he was still unsuccessful in all of his attempts to find justice in regard to his estate. During this time, he met several higher Polish officials to discuss the Cossacks' issue of the war with the Tatars and used this occasion again to plead his case with Czapliński, still unsuccessfully.

While Khmelnytsky found no support from the Polish officials, he found it in his Cossack friends and subordinates. The case of a Cossack being unfairly treated by the Poles found a lot of support not only in his Chyhyryn regiment, but also with others including the [[Sich]]. All through the autumn of 1647 Khmelnytsky traveled from one regiment to another, and had numerous consultations with Cossack leaders throughout Ukraine. His activity raised suspicion among the Polish authorities already used to Cossack revolts; he was promptly arrested. Koniecpolski issued an order for his execution, but the Chyhyryn Cossack [[polkovnyk]] who held Khmelnytsky was persuaded to release him. Not willing to tempt fate any further, Khmelnytsky headed for the [[Zaporozhian Sich]] with a group of his supporters.

===The Uprising===

{{Main|Khmelnytsky Uprising}}

While it might appear that the Czapliński Affair was the immediate cause of the Uprising, it was only an impetus that brought a successful and talented Cossack to the forefront of popular discontent among the people of what is now Ukraine. Religion, ethnicity, and economics factored into this discontent. While the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] remained [[Union of Lublin|a union]] of two nations: of [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], a sizable population of Orthodox [[Ruthenians]] remained ignored. That left them oppressed by the Polish magnates and their wrath was directed at the Poles' Jewish traders, who often ran their estates for them. The advent of the [[Counter-Reformation]] further worsened relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. Many Orthodox Ukrainians saw the [[Union of Brest]] as a threat to their Orthodox faith, and coupled with the frequent abuse of the Orthodox clergy this added a religious dimension to the conflict. This could have been one of the many other frequent Cossack revolts that had been put down by the authorities, but the stature and skill of, and respect for, the seasoned 50-year-old negotiator and warrior Khmelnytsky perhaps made all the difference.

====Initial successes====
[[Image:Alex K Bohdan Chmelnickyi prapor.svg|thumb|150px|left|Flag of Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Bohdan (Б) Khmelnytsky (Х), hetman (Г) of Army (В) of Zaporozhia (З) and of his (Е) king's (К) majesty (МЛС) of Rzech Pospolita.]]
At the end of the year Khmelnytsky finally made his way to the south, to the [[estuary]] of the [[Dnieper]] river. On December 7, 1648 his small (300–500-man) detachment, with the help of registered Cossacks who went to his side, disarmed the small Polish detachment guarding the area and took over the Zaporozhian Sich &amp;mdash; much to the jubilation of many of the Cossacks. An attempt to retake the Sich by the [[Poles]] was decisively fought off as more registered Cossacks joined his forces. At the end of January 1648 a [[Cossack Rada]] was called and Khmelnytsky was unanimously elected a [[hetman]]. A feverish activity followed. Cossacks were sent with hetman's letters to many regions of Ukraine calling on Cossacks and Orthodox peasants to join the rebellion, the defence of [[Khortytsia]] was improved, arrangements were made to acquire and make weapons and anmunition, and emissaries were sent to the [[Crimean Khanate|Khan of Crimea]], [[İslâm III Giray]].

{{History of Ukraine}}

Initially, Polish authorities took the news of Khmelnytsky's arrival at the Sich and reports about the rebellion quite lightly. The two sides exchanged lists of demands: the Poles asked for Cossacks to surrender the mutinous leader and disband, while Khmelnytsky and the Rada demanded that the Commonwealth restore the Cossacks' ancient rights, stop the advance of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], yield the right to appoint Orthodox leaders of the Sich and of the Registered Cossack regiments, and remove the Commonwealth troops from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret. page 91, Lebid, Kiev. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; These demands of Khmelnytsky were taken as an affront by the Polish magnates and an army headed by Stefan Potocki moved in the direction of the Sich. Had the Cossacks stayed at [[Khortytsia]] they might have been defeated as in many other rebellions. But this time, instead of waiting for the Poles, Khmelnytsky marched against them. The two armies met on 16 May 1648 at [[Battle of Zhovti Vody|Zhovti Vody]], where, aided by the Tatars of [[Tugay Bey]], the Cossacks inflicted their first crushing defeat on the Commonwealth. This was repeated soon after, with the same success, at the [[Battle of Korsuń]] on 26 May 1648. What made these Cossack successess different was the diplomatic and military skill of Khmelnytsky: under his leadership, the Cossack army moved to battle positions following his plans, Cossacks were proactive and decisive in their maneuver and attacks, and most importantly, he not only managed to persuade large contingents of registered Cossacks to switch to his side, but also got the support of the [[Giray dynasty|Crimean Khan]] &amp;mdash; his crucial ally for the many battles to come.

====Establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate====
[[Image:Herb Viyska Zaporozkogo (Alex K).svg|thumb|left|150px|Coat of arms of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]].]]

At Christmas 1648, Khmelnytsky made a triumphant entry into Kiev, where he was hailed as &quot;the Moses, savior, redeemer, and liberator of the people from Polish captivity ... the illustrious ruler of Rus&quot;. The [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarchs of Jerusalem]] Paiseus who was visiting Kiev at this time referred to Khmelnytsky as the Prince of Rus, the head of independent Ukrainian state, according to the contemporaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hrushevsky,M 2003&quot;&gt;[[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Hrushevsky,M.]] ''History of Ukraine-Rus''. New ed. Bao. Donetsk, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1649, during negotiations in [[Pereiaslav]] with a Polish delegation headed by senator [[Adam Kysil]], Khmelnytsky declared that he was &quot;the sole autocrat of Rus&quot; and that he had &quot;enough power in Ukraine, [[Podilia]], and [[Volhynia]] ... in his land and principality stretching as far as Lviv, [[Chełm]], and [[Halych]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret. page 203, Lebid, Kiev. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|I already did more than was thinking before, now I will obtain what I revised recently. I will liberate out of the Polish woe all of the Ruthenian people! Before I was fighting for the insults and injustice caused to me, now I will fight for our Orthodox faith. And all people will help me in that all the way to Lublin and Krakow, and I won't back off from the people as they are our right hand. And for the purpose lest you won't attack cossacks by conquering peasants, I will have two, three hundred thousands of them.|''(Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Prince of Ruthenia)''&lt;ref name=&quot;Hrushevsky,M 2003&quot;/&gt;}}
It became clear to the Polish envoys that Khmelnytsky had positioned himself not just as a leader of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], but of Ukraine, and stated his claims to the heritage of the Rus. A [[Vilnius]] [[panegyric]] in Khmelnytsky's honor (1650&amp;ndash;1651) explained it this way: &quot;While in Poland it is King [[Jan II Casimir Vasa]], in Rus it is Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\K\H\KhmelnytskyBohdan.htm Display Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the period of initial military successes the [[state-building]] process began. His leadership was demonstrated in all areas of state-building: in the military, administration, finance, economics, and culture. With political acumen he made the [[Zaporozhian Host]] under the leadership of its hetman the supreme power in the new Ukrainian state, and unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority. Khmelnytsky built a new government system and developed military and civilian administration.

During this time a new generation of statesmen and military leaders came to the forefront: [[Ivan Vyhovsky]], [[Pavlo Teteria]], [[Danylo Nechai]] and [[Ivan Nechai]], [[Ivan Bohun]], [[Hryhoriy Hulyanytsky]]. From Cossack polkovnyks, officers, and military commanders, a new elite within the Cossack Hetman state was born. Throughout the years, this elite preserved and maintained the autonomy of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] in the face of Russia's attempt to curb it. But it was also instrumental in the onset of the period of [[Ruin (period of history)|Ruin]] that followed and eventually destroyed most of the achievements of the Khmelnytsky era.

[[Image:Bohdan-banner.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bohdan Khmelnytsky's banner that was taken at the  [[battle of Berestechko]]. It was later taken by the Swedes in Warsaw 1655 and is now to be seen at Armémuseum, Stockholm, Sweden.]]

====Complications====
Khmelnytsky's initial successes were followed by a series of setbacks as neither Khmelnytsky nor the Commonwealth had had enough strength to stabilize the situation or to inflict a defeat on the enemy. What followed was the period of intermittent warfare and several peace treaties, which neither side put much faith in or cared to abide by. From the spring of 1649 on, the situation turned for the worse for the Cossacks, as the frequency of Polish attacks increased and they were becoming more and more successful. The resulting [[Treaty of Zboriv]] on 18 August 1649 was unfavourable for the Cossacks. This was followed by another defeat at the [[battle of Berestechko]] on 18 June 1651, where the Tatars betrayed him again and even held the hetman captive. The result was a crushing defeat for the Cossacks and a high number of casualties (estimated to be around 30,000 Cossacks), along with the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]], which favoured the Polish-Lithuanians. That treaty was soon violated, and in the years that followed the two sides were almost in the perpetual state of [[Conventional warfare|warfare]]. In this situation the [[Crimean Tatars]] played a decisive role — not allowing either side to prevail. It was in their interests to keep both Ukraine and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from getting too strong and becoming an effective power in the region.&lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot;&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]]. Ukraine. A history. University of Toronto press. p. 133. 1994. ISBN 0-8020-0591-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the circumstances, Khmelnytsky started looking for another foreign ally. Even though the Cossacks established their ''[[de facto]]'' independence from Poland, the new state needed legitimacy that was essential in 17th century Europe, and this legitimacy could be provided by a foreign monarch. In search of a protectorate, Khmelnytsky approached the [[Ottoman sultan]] in 1651 and formal embassies were exchanged. The Turks offered vassalship similar to their other arrangements with contemporary [[Crimea]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Walachia]]. However, the idea of a union with the [[Muslim]] monarch didn't rest well with the general populace and the Cossacks from whom Khmelnytsky drew his support.

The other possible ally was Orthodox [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]. They, however, remained quite cautious and stayed away from the hostilities in Ukraine. In spite of numerous envoys and calls for help from Khmelnytsky in the name of the shared Orthodox faith, the Tsar preferred to wait until the threat of a Cossack-Ottoman union in 1653 finally forced him to action.&lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot; /&gt; The idea that the Tsar might be favourable to taking Ukraine under his hand was communicated to the hetman and the diplomatic activity intensified.

===Treaty with Moscovy===
{{Main|Treaty of Pereyaslav}}

After a series of negotiations, it was agreed that the Cossacks would accept the tsar's overlordship. To finalize the treaty, a Muscovite embassy led by [[boyar]] [[Vasili Buturlin]] came to [[Pereyaslav]], where on 18 January 1654 the Cossack Rada was called and the treaty concluded. There is still no unanimity among historians as to the true intentions of both [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovy]] and Khmelnytsky in signing this agreement. For Tsar [[Alexei Mikhailovich]] the treaty legitimized Moscow's claims to the territory of [[Kievan Rus']] and strengthened his influence in the region. For Khmelnytsky the Treaty of Pereyaslav offered first and foremost a legitimate monarch's protection and support from a friendly Orthodox power. There have been a number of conflicting opinions as to what kind of union Khmelnytsky had in mind, whether it was to be a military union, a [[suzerainty]] or a complete incorporation of Ukraine into the [[Tsardom of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\P\E\PereiaslavTreatyof1654.htm Display Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sides had somewhat different ideas of the treaty and the union, as exemplified by an incident during the oath of allegiance to the Tsar: the treaty was almost broken when the Moscovite envoy refused to reciprocate with an oath from the ruler to his subjects, as was the custom with the Polish king. At one point, for this reason, Khmelnytsky stormed out of the church and threatened to cancel the entire treaty. It was only after some consideration that this demand on the part of the Cossacks was rescinded and the treaty stayed. Due to both sides having different goals in Ukraine, the liberties that were allowed to Khmelnytsky due to his stature were denied to his successors. That, in the end, eventually led to the complete incorporation of Ukraine into the Tsardom of Moscovy and later into the [[Russian Empire]].

===Final years===
[[Image:Subotiv Ukraine.png|thumb|left|200px|Church of Subotiv ([[Ukraine]]) where Khmelnytsky was buried.]]

As a result of the Treaty of Pereyaslav the geopolitical map of the region had changed — a new player, [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], entered the scene, and the Cossacks' former allies, the Tatars, went to the Polish side. That intensified the conflict, as the Tatars were now unrestrained in their warfare against Khmelnytsky. [[Tatar invasions|Tatar raids]] depopulated whole areas of Ukraine. Cossacks, aided by the Tsar's army, took revenge on Polish possessions in [[Belarus]], and in the spring of 1654, the Cossacks drove the Polish from much of the country. To complicate the situation even further, another power joined the melee — [[Sweden]]. They were the old adversaries of both Poland and Russia, but did not attack Russia, instead being quick to occupy their share of Lithuania before the Russians could get there. That put Khmelnytsky into a delicate situation in regard to the Tsar, as he {{Who|date=August 2008}} had been negotiating with the Swedes for some time, coordinating their attacks on the Commonwealth. Besides being hostile to Sweden in general, this also displeased Russia because Russia had its eyes on the Swedish Baltic provinces. In 1656 with the Commonwealth increasingly war-torn but also increasingly hostile and successful against the Swedes, the ruler of [[Transylvania]], [[George II Rákóczi]], also joined in - a last straw effort of Charles X of Sweden to save the war effort due to the massive Polish popular opposition against the Swedes. Under blows from all sides the Commonwealth only survived thanks to its steely unity in the face of destruction.

Russia attacked Sweden in July 1656 when Sweden was deeply involved with its situation in Poland. That war ended in status quo two years later, but it complicated matters even further for Khmelnytsky, as his ally was now fighting his overlord. In addition to diplomatic tensions between the Tsar and Khmelnytsky, a number of other disagreements between the two surfaced, notably in regard to Russian officials' interference in the finances of the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] and in the newly liberated Belarus. One thing that infuriated the hetman the most was the separate treaty the Tsar concluded with the Poles in [[Vilnius]] in 1656. The Hetman's emissaries were not even allowed to attend the negotiations. That prompted Khmelnytsky to write an irate letter to the Tsar accusing him of breaking the Pereyaslav agreement. In his anger, Khmelnytsky compared Swedes to the Tsar, claiming that the Swedes were more honourable and trustworthy than the Russians.&lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot; /&gt;

In addition to diplomatic tensions with Russia, the Cossack army with their Transylvanian allies in Poland suffered a number of setbacks. As a result, Khmelnytsky had to deal with a Cossack rebellion on the home front. Troubling news also came from Crimea, as Tatars, in alliance with Poland, were preparing for a new [[invasion]] of Ukraine. Though already ill, Khmelnytsky continued to conduct diplomatic activity, at one point even receiving the Tsar's envoys in his bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS51&quot;&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret. page 591. Lebid. Kiev. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July he suffered [[cerebral hemorrhage]], became paralyzed after his audience with the Kiev Colonel Zhdanovich whose expedition to [[Halychyna]] failed due to mutiny within his army.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Hrushevsky, M.]] ''Illustrated History of Ukraine''. &quot;BAO&quot;. Donetsk, 2003. ISBN 966-548-571-7 page 330&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week later, Bohdan Khmelnytsky died at 5 A.M. on 27 July 1657. His funeral was held on 23 August, and his body was taken from his capital Chyhyryn to his estate at Subotiv for burial in his ancestral church. In 1664 a Polish noble [[Stefan Czarniecki]] captured Subotiv and ordered the bodies of the hetman and his son [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymish]] to be exhumed and desecrated.&lt;ref&gt;Some Ukrainian historians dispute the fact of his grave being desecrated. In 1973 an expedition investigated the site of the church and discovered remains of people that had not been found before.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khmelnytsky remembered==
[[Image:Chmielnicki ukraine banknote 5 new.gif|thumb|right|300px|A five [[Ukrainian hryvnia]] [[banknote]] depicting Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky.]]

It is hard to overestimate Khmelnytsky's contribution and role in the history of Eastern Europe. He not only shaped the future of Ukraine but significantly changed the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Eastern Europe. As with any other prominent personality his role in the events and his actions were viewed differently by his various contemporaries, and even now different people sometimes have quite opposing views on his legacy.

===Khmelnytsky in Ukrainian history===
In Ukraine, Khmelnytsky is generally regarded as a national hero and a [[father of the nation]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} A [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|city]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20073/28]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast|region]] of the country bear his name. His image is prominently displayed on Ukrainian [[banknotes]] and his monument in the centre of Kiev is the focal point of the Ukrainian capital. There have also been several issues of the [[Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky (Ukraine)|Order of Bohdan Khmelnitsky]] — one of the highest decorations in Ukraine and in the former Soviet Union. With all this positive appreciation of his legacy, even in [[Ukraine]] it is far from being unanimous. He is mostly criticised for his union with Russia, which in the view of some, proved to be disastrous for the future of the country. This particular view, among others, was expressed by a prominent Ukrainian [[poet]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], who was one of Khmelnytsky's very vocal and harsh critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universum.org.ua/journal/2002/konovo_7.html Олексій КОНОВАЛ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore his local reputation was damaged by his alliance with the Crimean Tatars, which permitted the latter to take a large number of Ukrainian peasants as slaves (this may be interpreted as an illustration of the relative indifference of the cossacks as a military caste toward the 'kholopy', the lowest stratum of the Ukrainian people). The traces of this are still found in folk songs. On the balance, the view of his legacy in present-day [[Ukraine]] is more positive than negative, with some critics admitting that the union with Russia was dictated by necessity and an attempt to survive in those difficult times.

===Khmelnytsky in Polish history===
Khmelnytsky's role in the history of the Polish State has been viewed mostly in a negative light. The rebellion of 1648 proved to be the end of the [[Golden Age]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] and the beginning of its demise. Even though it would survive the rebellion and the period of [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] that followed, within a hundred years it would be no more — its remains would be divided between Russia, [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]] in the [[partitions of Poland]]. Many blamed Khmelnytsky for the decline of the Commonwealth. This view is contrasted with a far more comprehensive appreciation of Khmelnytsky's legacy by Polish historians, like [[Ludwik Kubala]], who in his works compared him with [[Oliver Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://litopys.org.ua/holob/hol13.htm Розділ XI. Володимир Голобуцький. Запорозьке козацтво&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A more balanced appreciation prevails — that the fundamental ills of the Commonwealth resulted in the rebellion that Khmelnytsky led.

===Khmelnytsky in Russian and Soviet history===
[[Image:Mikeshin Khmelnitsky.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Original model of [[Mikhail Mikeshin]]'s Khmelnytsky Monument]]

In their assessment of Khmelnytsky's legacy the official Russian [[historiography]] stressed the fact that Khmelnytsky entered into union with Moscow's Tsar [[Alexei Mikhailovich]] with an expressed desire to &quot;re-unify&quot; Ukraine with Russia. This view corresponded with the official theory of Moscow being an heir of the [[Kievan Rus']] and thus a gatherer of its former territories.

In this light Khmelnytsky was viewed as a national hero of Russia for bringing Ukraine into the &quot;eternal union&quot; of all Russias — Great, Little and White Russia. As such, he was much respected and venerated in Imperial Russia. His role was presented as a model for all Ukrainians to follow — to aspire for closer ties with Great Russia. This view was expressed in a monument commissioned by the Russian nationalist [[Mikhail Yuzefovich]], which was installed in the center of [[Kiev]] in 1888&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/E/M/EmsUkase.htm Ems Ukase&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Yuzefovich was also known for his contribution to the [[Ems Ukase]], which further restricted the use of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] in [[Ukraine]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The original variant of the monument (created by Russian sculptor [[Mikhail Mikeshin]]) appeared too [[xenophobic]] even for the Russian authorities, as it was to depict a vanquished Pole, [[Jew]], and a [[Catholic priesthood|Catholic priest]] under the hoofs of the horse. A more moderate version was installed, but the inscription on the monument read &quot;To Bogdan Khmelnitsky from one and indivisible Russia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldkiev.info/pamyatniki_kieva/pamyatnik_Bogdanu_Xmelnickomu.html &quot;Вашъ Кіевъ&quot; :: Старый Киев :: история Киева&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of Khmelnytsky as a prominent, positive figure in the Russian history is further displayed in Mikeshin's Monument to the Millennium of Russia in [[Novgorod]], where Khmelnytsky is shown as one of Russia's prominent figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novgorod.ru/eng/hist/archit/arc_65.htm The Monument to the Millennium of Russia / «Velikiy Novgorod» - City portal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soviet historiography]] followed in many ways the Imperial Russian theory of &quot;re-unification&quot; while adding the [[class struggle]] dimension to the story. Thus, Khmelnytsky was not only praised for &quot;re-unifying&quot; Ukraine with Russia, but also for organizing the class struggle of oppressed Ukrainian peasants against Polish exploiters.

===Khmelnytsky in Jewish history===

During the period 1648-1656, many Jews were murdered by rebels led by Bogdan Khmelnitsky as one of his goals was eradication of Jews from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=chmielnicki+massacres+1648&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YplsG-vMFk&amp;sig=QoGPHmoYtUuZfIGWGo_cQlrVAD8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HMn4SoqHFYO1tgeEtsi2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=chmielnicki%20massacres%201648&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of reliable data, an accurate figure cannot be established.  Modern sources place it around 20,000.

'''Benjamin William Bova''' (born November 8, 1932) is an American [[science fiction author|science-fiction author]] and editor.

==Personal life==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

Ben Bova was born on November 8, 1932 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. In 1953, while attending [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia, he married Rosa Cucinotta; they had a son and a daughter. He would later divorce Rosa in 1974. In that same year he married Barbara Berson Rose.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. James&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Bova was an avid [[fencing (sport)|fencer]] in his younger days, and organized Avco Everett's fencing club.

==Professional career==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

Bova worked as a [[technical writer]] for [[Project Vanguard]] in the 1950s and later for [[Avco Everett]] in the 1960s when they did research in [[lasers]] and [[fluid dynamics]]. At Avco Everett he met [[Arthur R. Kantrowitz]] (later of the [[Foresight Institute]]). 

In 1972 Bova became editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction]]'' after [[John W. Campbell|John W. Campbell's]] death in 1971. After leaving ''Analog'' in 1978, he went on to edit ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' during 1978-1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;ws791020&quot;/&gt;

In 1974 he wrote the [[screenplay]] for an episode of the children's [[science fiction|science-fiction]] television series ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]'' entitled &quot;The Search&quot;.

Bova served as the science advisor for the failed television series ''[[The Starlost]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;ws791020&quot;/&gt; leaving in disgust after the airing of the first episode (1973). His novel ''The Starcrossed'', loosely based on his experiences, featured a thinly veiled characterization of his friend and colleague [[Harlan Ellison]]. Bova dedicated the novel to &quot;Cordwainer Bird&quot;, the pen name Harlan Ellison uses when he does not want to be associated with a television or film project.

Bova holds the position of President Emeritus of the [[National Space Society]] and served as President of [[Science-fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) from 1990 to 1992.

Bova went back to school in the 1980s, earning an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in communications in 1987 and a [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]] (from [[California Coast University]]) in 1996.

Bova has drawn on his experiences to create fact and fiction writings rich with references to [[spaceflight]], [[laser]]s, [[artificial heart]]s, [[nanotechnology]], [[environmentalism]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] and [[martial arts]], [[photography]] and [[artist]]s.

{{As of | 2010}} Bova has written over 115 books - non-fiction as well as science fiction. In 2000, he attended the [[58th World Science Fiction Convention]] (Chicon 2000) as the Author Guest of Honor.

Recently, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] has taken an interest in Bova's works due to his wealth of knowledge about science and about what the future may look like. In 2007 [[Mary Parent|Stuber/Parent Productions]] hired him as a consultant to provide insight into what the world may look like in the near future for their film &quot;[[Repo Men]]&quot; (2010) starring Jude Law and Forest Whitaker; also in 2007 he provided consulting services to [[Silver Pictures]] on the feature adaptation of [[Richard Morgan (author)|Richard Morgan]]'s novel &quot;[[Altered Carbon]]&quot;. In 2007, [http://www.velocity-la.com Velocity Management] became Ben Bova's literary manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966057.html | work=Variety | title=Ben Bova | first=Stacy | last=Dodd | date=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Grand Tour''===
Bova's ''[[Grand Tour (novel series)|Grand Tour]]'' series of novels presents a fictional treatment of human colonization of the [[Solar System]] in the late 21st century. Bova addresses the issue of chronology in this series on his website: 
{{bquote|Such a chronology is difficult to compose, because many of the novels overlap one another in time. ''Mars'' and ''Moonrise'', for example, overlap considerably. Given that caveat, here is an approximate time sequence for the Grand Tour novels. Remember, however, that any of these novels can be read completely independently of the others. There is no need to read the novels in any particular order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bova-GrandTour&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.benbova.com/gradtourlist.html
  | title = Grand Tour Chronology
  | accessdate = 2008-06-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The internal chronology of the series lacks complete consistency. 

* ''Powersat'' (2005) - CEO Dan Randolph of Astro Corp. has a dream of providing a desperate world with tons of energy; provided by solar satellites located in geosync orbit around the Earth, and wirelessly transferred. However, stubborn politicians, and oil companies make the way hard; but Dan has built a space plane that will drastically reduce transportation costs, making way for cheaper and easier constructed Powersats. But when the space plane blows up upon re-entering the atmosphere, Randolph is convinced that it may not be an accident; as a shadowy terrorist group threatens to bankrupt him, and even kill him.
* ''Privateers'' (1985; immediately precedes ''Empire Builders'', with most of the same cast of characters, but with an alternate history including a still-extant [[Soviet Union]], because Bova wrote it before the U.S.S.R. collapsed.)
* ''Empire Builders'' (1993)
* ''Mars'' (1992) - Navajo geologist Jamie Waterman is surprised to find that he will be going on the first mission to Mars, as part of the landing crew. They will only have a few months to explore the Red Planet; a few months to prove that this world is worth another mission, as this one took decades to put together. With limited supplies, the six men and women set out to explore the top of Mt. Olympus and the bottom of Valles Marineris; having only each other to rely on. As the book draws to an end Waterman makes one of the biggest discoveries in the System, and finds a clue of even a bigger one.
* ''Moonrise'' (1996; The Moonbase Saga, v. 1) - Moonbase is an old lunar outpost, maintained by Masterson Corporation; it bleeds money, and most members of the Board disprove of it. However, old astronaut, and new husband to Joanna (née Masterson) and CEO of the Board, has a dream of creating a sustainable colony on the Moon; but not everyone agrees with him, or his marriage.
* ''[[Return to Mars]]'' (1999)
* ''Moonwar'' (1998; The Moonbase Saga, v. 2) - the fanatical group &quot;New Morality&quot;, along with their sister organizations the &quot;Holy Disciples&quot; and &quot;Sword of Islam&quot; have gained global support and power; and are dead set against anything to do with nanotechnology, which they call the &quot;Devil's work&quot;. So when the last nations on Earth ban the practice, Moonbase is all that is left of a technology that could potentially save the entire Earth; granting asylum for a few runaways. But when the UN starts to send troops over, Director Douglas Stavenger declares independence; and begins a war that will see no one dead or all of them.
* ''[[The Precipice]]'' (2001; The Asteroid Wars, v. 1)- when Billionaire Martin Humphries comes to CEO of Astro Corp, Dan Randolph, and freely offers him a fusion space propulsion design, Dan is at the very least curious; but with his company near bankruptcy, the &quot;bold astronaut&quot; has no choice. However, Dan realizes that he may have gone too far this time.
* ''[[Jupiter (novel)|Jupiter]]'' (2001)
* ''The Rock Rats'' (2002; The Asteroid Wars, v. 2) - Martin Humphries returns to complete his conquest of the Asteroid Belt, along with it riches of water and metal ores; but first, two rivals stand in his way. The first being Pancho Lane, new member on the Board of Astro Corp. The second being Lars Fuchs, an independent miner who has a dream of building a space habitat in orbit above Ceres. Each begins to raise the ante, and none are willing to back down.
* ''The Silent War'' (2004; The Asteroid Wars, v. 3)
* ''Saturn'' (2002) - the space habitat Goddard is launched from Earth, on a two-year journey to Saturn; twice as far from the Sun as anyone has gone or lived before. The habitat is made up of ten thousand people; most of whom are exiles from Earth, thrown out by the New Morality, Holy Disciples or Sword of Islam. As the habitat goes further into deep space, some begin to plot and scheme; to create a new society in their eyes. However, most don't realize that they are all part of an experiment.
* ''[[Titan (2006 novel)|Titan]]'' (2006, [[Campbell award (best novel)|John W. Campbell Memorial Award]])
* ''The Aftermath'' (2007; The Asteroid Wars, v. 4) - The novel begins at the destruction of the original Chrysalis habitat at Ceres; but with the view from the family aboard the Syracuse. As the family's ship is attacked, Victor the father separates the command module from the rest of the ship to draw the attackers away; but leaves his family no way of getting home, as they drift on a 5-year orbital journey. After life-altering changes, Dorn and Elverda travel the Asteroid Belt searching for the bodies of the dead who perished in the Asteroid Wars; but Martin Humphries is bent on destroying both of them. Kao Yuan is the captain of the spacecraft &quot;Viking&quot;, which is on the mission to kill Dorn &amp; Elverda; however, Humphries' former lover, Tamara is the real commander, and she begins to have plans of her own. Eventually, Fate brings all these people together at the right moments in order to restore Humanity, and bring justice.
* ''Mars Life'' (2008) - Jamie Waterman is back as Director of the Mars Program; along with his wife Vijay, the beautiful Indian-Aussie, and Dex Trumball, the Director of the Board in charge of Mars financing. The death of his son bring Waterman and his wife back to Earth, and puts them both in a slump. Over the years, the New Morality has slowly been taking over the American government, and gaining power; the NM restricts and censors anything that is a threat to them, and hide behind religion. One of their biggest concerns is the Mars program, which is taking money away from projects that would benefit the dystopian-style Earth. As money is slowly cut off from Mars, Dex &amp; Jamie rush to find a solution to keeps the exploration of Mars open; however both have different views. Waterman wants to preserve the Martian life and culture, while Dex is willing to open Mars up to wealthy tourists. The Navajo scientist and Vijay return to Mars in time of great discovering; a Martian village and relics have been found, as well as what might be a graveyard, holding remains of an ancient, intelligent Martian race. Jamie struggles to find the balance of things, as time and money begin to run out; and the answer could be found in his dreams.
* ''[[Venus (novel)|Venus]]'' (2000) - Van Humphries is the younger of the two sons of Martin Humphries; a man who ultimately despises him, and regards him as a weakling. Van's older brother, Alex, was always there to protect him, until his death on the first crewed mission sent to touch down on Venus. Now three years later, Martin Humphries is offering a 10-billion dollar reward to anyone who can bring his elder son's body home...from the hellish surface of Earth's sister. Van is bent on proving his father view of him wrong, while rescuing his beloved brother's body; and 10-billion dollars, which he desperately needs, as his father has cut off his &quot;allowance&quot;. But as Van and his crew near Venus, Lars Fuchs comes racing out of the belt; determined to find Alex's body, and receive the reward from his nemesis M. Humphries. Unpredicted problems, and grand discoveries are made and prove disastrous, as the two crews are brought together..somewhat.

After a long campaign of [[Leapfrogging (military)|island hopping]], the Allies were approaching Japan, and planned to use Okinawa, a large island only {{convert|340|mi|km|abbr=on}} away from mainland Japan, as a [[Kadena Air Base|base for air operations]] on the planned invasion of Japanese mainland (coded [[Operation Downfall]]). Five divisions of the [[U.S. Tenth Army]], the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th]], [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]], [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]], [[81st Infantry Division (United States)|81st]], and [[96th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|96th]], and two Marine Divisions, the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]] and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th]], fought on the island while the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] remained as an amphibious reserve and was never brought ashore. The invasion was supported by naval, amphibious, and tactical air forces.

The battle has been referred to as the &quot;'''Typhoon of Steel'''&quot; in English, and ''tetsu no ame'' (&quot;rain of steel&quot;) or ''tetsu no bōfū'' (&quot;violent wind of steel&quot;) in Japanese. The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of [[Kamikaze#Final phase|''kamikaze'' suicide attacks]] from the Japanese defenders, and to the sheer numbers of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle resulted in the highest number of casualties in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Japan lost over 100,000 troops killed or captured, and the Allies suffered more than 50,000 casualties of all kinds. Simultaneously, tens of thousands of local civilians were killed, wounded, or committed suicide. The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] caused [[Surrender of Japan|Japan to surrender]] just weeks after the end of the fighting at Okinawa.

==Order of battle==
===Land===
The U.S. land forces involved included the [[Tenth United States Army|Tenth Army]], commanded by Lieutenant General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]] The army had two [[corps]] under its command, [[III Marine Expeditionary Force|III Amphibious Corps]] under Major General [[Roy Geiger]], consisting of 1st and 6th Marine Divisions, and [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]] under Major General [[John R. Hodge]], consisting of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th]] and [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th]] Infantry Divisions. The [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] was an afloat reserve, and Tenth Army also controlled the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]], earmarked as a [[garrison]], and [[77th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|77th]] Infantry Divisions. In all, the [[Tenth United States Army|Tenth Army]] contained 102,000 [[United States Army|Army]] and 81,000 [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] personnel.
[[File:Japanese Commanders on Okinawa.jpg|left|thumb|Commanders of the [[Thirty-Second Army (Japan)|Japanese 32nd Army]], February 1945]]

The Japanese land [[Military campaign|campaign]] (mainly [[defense (military)|defensive]]) was conducted by the 67,000-strong (77,000 according to some sources) [[regular]] [[Thirty-Second Army (Japan)|Thirty-Second Army]] and some 9,000 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base (only a few hundred of whom had been trained and equipped for ground combat), supported by 39,000 [[Conscription|draft]]ed local [[Ryukyuan people]] (including 24,000 hastily-drafted [[Rear (military)|rear]] [[militia]] called ''Boeitai'' and 15,000 non-uniformed laborers). In addition, 1,500 [[middle school]] senior boys organized into [[front line|front-line]]-service &quot;Iron and Blood Volunteer Units&quot;, while 600 [[Himeyuri Students]] were organized into a [[nurse|nursing]] unit.&lt;ref name=command&gt;Huber, Thomas M. [http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp Japan's Battle of Okinawa, April–June 1945], [[Command and General Staff College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 32nd Army initially consisted of the [[9th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|9th]], [[24th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|24th]], and [[62nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|62nd]] Divisions, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. The 9th Division was moved to [[Taiwan]] prior to the [[invasion]], resulting in shuffling of Japanese defensive plans. Primary resistance was to be led in the south by Lieutenant General [[Mitsuru Ushijima]], his [[chief of staff]], Lieutenant General [[Isamu Chō]] and his chief of operations, Colonel [[Hiromichi Yahara]]. Yahara advocated a defensive [[Military strategy|strategy]], whilst Chō advocated an [[offensive (military)|offensive]] one. In the north, Colonel Takehido Udo was in command. The IJN troops were led by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Minoru Ota]]. They expected the Americans to land 6–10 [[division (military)|division]]s against the Japanese garrison of two and a half divisions. The staff calculated that superior quality and numbers of weapons gave each U.S. division five or six times the [[firepower]] of a Japanese division; to this would be added the Americans' abundant naval and air firepower.

===Sea===
====U.S. Navy====
Most of the air-to-air [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s and the small [[dive bomber]]s and [[Ground-attack aircraft|strike aircraft]] were U.S. Navy [[aircraft carrier|carrier-based]] airplanes. The Japanese had used ''[[kamikaze]]'' tactics since the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], but for the first time, they became a major part of the defense. Between the American landing on April 1 and May 25, seven major ''kamikaze'' attacks were attempted, involving more than 1,500 planes. The U.S. Navy sustained greater casualties in this operation than in any other battle of the war.

====British Commonwealth====
Although Allied land forces were entirely composed of U.S. units, the [[British Pacific Fleet]] (BPF; known to the U.S. Navy as Task Force 57) provided about ¼ of Allied naval air power (450 planes). It comprised many ships, including 50 warships of which 17 were aircraft carriers, but while the British [[Comparison of armoured to unarmoured flight deck designs|armored flight deck]]s meant that fewer planes could be carried in a single aircraft carrier, they were more resistant to ''kamikaze'' strikes. Although all the aircraft carriers were provided by Britain, the carrier group was a combined [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] fleet with British, [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]], [[Royal New Zealand Navy|New Zealand]] and [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] ships and personnel{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Their mission was to neutralize Japanese [[Military airbase|airfield]]s in the [[Sakishima Islands]] and provide air cover against Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks.

==Naval battle==
[[File:USS Bunker Hill hit by two Kamikazes.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|6}} burns after being hit by two ''[[kamikaze]]s'' within 30 seconds.]]

The BPF was assigned the task of neutralizing the Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands, which it did successfully from March 26- April 10. On April 10, its attention was shifted to airfields on northern [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. The force withdrew to San Pedro Bay on April 23. On May 1, the British Pacific Fleet returned to action, subduing the airfields as before, this time with naval [[bombardment]] as well as aircraft. Several ''kamikaze'' attacks caused significant damage, but since the British used armored [[flight deck]]s on their aircraft carriers, they only experienced a brief interruption to their force's objective.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings (2007), p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |align=left |width=35% |quote=There was a hypnotic fascination to the sight so alien to our Western philosophy. We watched each plunging ''kamikaze'' with the detached horror of one witnessing a terrible spectacle rather than as the intended victim. We forgot self for the moment as we groped hopelessly for the thought of that other man up there. |source=Vice Admiral C.R. Brown&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945'', Random House, 1970, p. 711.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Between April 6 and June 22, the Japanese flew 1,465 ''kamikaze'' aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, 185 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from Kyushu, and 250 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from Formosa. When U.S. intelligence estimated 89 planes on Formosa, the Japanese had approximately 700 dismantled or well camouflaged and dispersed into scattered villages and towns; the U.S. [[Fifth Air Force]] disputed Navy claims of ''kamikaze'' coming from Formosa.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Hanson W. ''Sea Fights and Shipwrecks'' Hanover House 1956 page 309&lt;/ref&gt; The ships lost were smaller vessels, particularly the destroyers of the [[radar picket]]s, as well as [[destroyer escort]]s and landing ships. While no major Allied warship was lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based [[motorboat]]s were also used in the Japanese [[suicide attack]]s.

The protracted length of the campaign under stressful conditions forced Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] to take the unprecedented step of relieving the principal naval commanders to rest and recuperate. Following the practice of changing the fleet designation with the change of commanders, U.S. naval forces began the campaign as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|U.S. 5th Fleet]] under Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]], but ended it as the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] under Admiral [[William Halsey]].

===Operation Ten-Go===
{{Main|Ten-gō sakusen}}
[[File:Yamato battleship explosion.jpg|thumb|The Japanese battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} explodes after persistent attacks from U.S. aircraft.]]

Operation ''Ten-Go'' (''Ten-gō sakusen'') was the attempted attack by a strike force of Japanese surface vessels, led by the battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and commanded by Admiral [[Seiichi Itō]]. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach themselves and fight from shore using their guns as [[coastal artillery]] and crewmen as [[naval infantry]]. The ''Ten-Go'' force was spotted by [[submarine]]s shortly after it left the Japanese home waters, and was attacked by U.S. carrier aircraft.

Under attack from more than 300 aircraft over a two-hour span, the world's largest battleship sank on April 7, 1945, long before she could reach Okinawa. U.S. [[torpedo bomber]]s were instructed to only aim for one side to prevent effective counter flooding by the battleship's crew, and hitting preferably the bow or stern, where armor was believed to be the thinnest. Of ''Yamato''{{'}}s screening force, the [[light cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yahagi|1942|2}}, and four out of the eight destroyers were also sunk. In all, the Imperial Japanese Navy lost some 3,700 sailors, including Itō, at the relatively low cost of just 10 U.S. aircraft and 12 airmen.

==Land battle==
[[File:Battle of Okinawa.svg|thumb|left|A map of U.S. operations during the battle]]

The land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on April 1, 1945.

The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed in the Kerama Islands ([[Kerama Retto]]), {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Okinawa on March 26. Subsidiary landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. In these preliminary operations, the 77th Infantry Division suffered 27 dead and 81 wounded, while Japanese dead and captured numbered over 650. The operation provided a protected anchorage for the fleet and eliminated the threat from suicide boats.

On March 31, Marines of the [[Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion]] landed without opposition on Keise Shima, four islets just {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Okinawan capital of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]]. [[155 mm Long Tom|{{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} &quot;Long Tom&quot;]]s went ashore on the islets to cover operations on Okinawa.

===Northern Okinawa===

[[File:Marines land on Okinawa shores.jpg|thumb|United States Marine Corps|[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] reinforcements wade ashore to support the [[beachhead]] on Okinawa, March 31, 1945]]

The main landing was made by [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps]] on the Hagushi beaches on the western coast of Okinawa on '''[[L-Day]]''', April 1, which was both Easter Sunday and [[April Fools' Day]] in 1945. The 2nd Marine Division conducted a [[demonstration (military)|demonstration]] off the Minatoga beaches on the southeastern coast to confuse the Japanese about American intentions and delay movement of [[Military reserve|reserves]] from there.

Tenth Army swept across&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Okinawa/USMC-M-Okinawa-6.html |title=Action in the North, Chp 6 of Okinawa: Victory in the Pacific by Major Chas. S. Nichols, Jr., USMC and Henry I. Shaw, Jr. |publisher=Historical Section, Division of Public Information, U.S. Marine Corps |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the south-central part of the island with relative ease by World War II standards, capturing the [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena]] and the [[Yomitan, Okinawa|Yomitan]] airbases. In light of the weak opposition, General Buckner decided to proceed immediately with Phase II of his plan—the seizure of northern Okinawa. The [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]] headed up the Ishikawa Isthmus. The land was mountainous and wooded, with the Japanese defenses concentrated on Yae-Take, a twisted mass of rocky ridges and ravines on the [[Motobu, Okinawa|Motobu Peninsula]]. There was heavy fighting before the Marines finally cleared the peninsula on April 18, 1945.

Meanwhile, the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] assaulted [[Ie Shima]]—a small island off the western end of the peninsula—on April 16. In addition to conventional hazards, the 77th Infantry Division encountered kamikaze attacks, and even Japanese women armed with spears. There was heavy fighting before Ie Shima was declared secured on April 21 and became another air base for operations against Japan.

===Southern Okinawa===
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2010}}
[[File:Corsair fighter firing on Okinawa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]] fighter firing [[rocket]]s in support of the troops on Okinawa]]

While the 6th Marine Division cleared northern Okinawa, the U.S. Army 96th Infantry division and 7th Infantry Division wheeled south across the narrow waist of Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division began to encounter fierce resistance in west-central Okinawa from Japanese troops holding fortified positions east of Highway No. 1 and about five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of Shuri, from what came to be known as [[Cactus Ridge]]. The 7th Infantry Division encountered similarly fierce Japanese opposition from a rocky pinnacle located about 1,000 yards southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed &quot;[[The Pinnacle, Battle of Okinawa|The Pinnacle]]&quot;).&lt;!--Former edit specified that the 6th Marine Division was heading south after the XXIV corps was done clearing the north (wrong). 2nd Marine Division were not introduced until later in the campaign--&gt;

By the night of April 8, U.S. troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese, yet the battle had only just begun, for it was now realized they were merely outposts guarding the Shuri Line.

The next American objective was Kakazu Ridge, two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. Fighting was fierce, as the Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves, and the U.S. forces often lost many men before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese would send the Okinawans at gunpoint out to acquire water and supplies for them, which induced casualties among civilians. The American advance was inexorable but resulted in massive casualties sustained by both sides.
[[File:OkinawaMarinesDeadJapanese.jpg|thumb|Marines pass through a destroyed small village where a Japanese soldier lies dead, April 1945]]

As the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, General Ushijima—influenced by General Chō—decided to take the offensive. On the evening of April 12, the 32nd Army attacked U.S. positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce [[close combat]] the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on April 14 was again repulsed. The entire effort led 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night [[infiltration tactics]], but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.

The 27th Infantry Division, which had landed on April 9, took over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa. General Hodge now had three divisions in the line, with the 96th in the middle, and the 7th on the east, with each division holding a front of only about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}.

Hodge launched a new offensive of April 19 with a barrage of 324 guns, the largest ever in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean Theater]]. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers joined the bombardment, which was followed by 650 Navy and Marine planes attacking the enemy positions with [[napalm]], rockets, bombs, and machine guns. The Japanese defenses were sited on [[reverse slope defence|reverse slope]]s, where the defenders waited out the artillery barrage and aerial attack in relative safety, emerging from the caves to rain [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds and grenades upon the Americans advancing up the forward slope.
[[File:OkinawaMarineCaveDemolition.jpg|thumb|left|A 6th Division Marine demolition crew watches explosive charges detonate and destroy a Japanese cave, May 1945]]

A tank assault to achieve [[breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] by outflanking Kakazu Ridge, failed to link up with its infantry support attempting to cross the ridge and failed with the loss of 22 tanks. Although [[flame tank]]s cleared many cave defenses, there was no breakthrough, and the XXIV Corps lost 720 men [[killed in action|KIA]], [[wounded in action|WIA]] and [[missing in action|MIA]]. The losses might have been greater, except for the fact that the Japanese had practically all of their infantry reserves tied up farther south, held there by another feint off the Minatoga beaches by the 2nd Marine Division that coincided with the attack.

At the end of April, after the Army forces had pushed through the Machinato defensive line and airfield,&lt;ref&gt;West Point Atlas of American Wars&lt;/ref&gt; the 1st Marine Division relieved the 27th Infantry Division, and the 77th Infantry Division relieved the 7th. When the 6th Marine Division arrived, III Amphibious Corps took over the right flank and Tenth Army assumed control of the battle.

On May 4, the 32nd Army launched another [[counteroffensive]]. This time, Ushijima attempted to make [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assaults]] on the coasts behind American lines. To support his offensive, the Japanese artillery moved into the open. By doing so, they were able to fire 13,000 rounds in support but an effective U.S. [[counter-battery fire]] destroyed dozens of Japanese artillery pieces. The attack was a complete failure.
[[File:Americans on Okinawa hear of victory in Europe.jpg|thumb||American soldiers of the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Division]] listen impassively to radio reports of [[Victory in Europe Day]] on May 8, 1945.]]

Buckner launched another American attack on May 11. Ten days of fierce fighting followed. On May 13, troops of the 96th Infantry Division and 763d Tank Battalion captured Conical Hill. Rising {{convert|476|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the Yonabaru coastal plain, this feature was the eastern anchor of the main Japanese defenses and was defended by about 1,000 Japanese. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the 6th Marine Division fought for &quot;Sugar Loaf Hill&quot;. The capture of these two key positions exposed the Japanese around Shuri on both sides. Buckner hoped to envelop Shuri and trap the main Japanese defending force.
[[File:Nippon Okinawa Naha Asato52 02.jpg|thumb | Sugar Loaf Hill (2010)]]

By the end of May, monsoon rains which turned contested hills and roads into a morass exacerbated both the [[Military tactics|tactical]] and medical situations. The ground advance began to resemble a [[World War I]] battlefield as troops became mired in mud and flooded roads greatly inhibited evacuation of wounded to the rear. Troops lived on a field sodden by rain, part garbage dump and part graveyard. Unburied Japanese bodies decayed, sank in the mud, and became part of a noxious stew. Anyone sliding down the greasy slopes could easily find their pockets full of maggots at the end of the journey.&lt;ref name=gso&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/okinawa-battle.htm Battle of Okinawa], [[GlobalSecurity.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This flag was first raised over [[Operation Cartwheel|Cape Gloucester]] and then [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]].]]

On May 29, Major General [[Pedro del Valle]]—commanding the 1st Marine Division—ordered Company A, [[1st Battalion 5th Marines|1st Battalion]], [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marines]] to capture [[Shuri Castle]]. Seizure of the castle represented both strategic and psychological blows for the Japanese and was a milestone in the campaign. Del Valle was awarded a [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]] for his leadership in the fight and the subsequent occupation and reorganization of Okinawa. Shuri Castle had been shelled by the battleship {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|6}} for three days prior to this advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;wonder-okinawa.jp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/001/002-e/004_03.html |title=The Ordeals of Shuri Castle |publisher=Wonder-okinawa.jp |date=August 15, 1945 |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the 32nd Army withdrew to the south and thus the marines had an easy task of securing Shuri Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;wonder-okinawa.jp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/usmc/pcn-190-003135-00/sec5a.htm |title=The Final Campaign: Marines in the Victory on Okinawa (Assault on Shuri) |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle, however, was outside the 1st Marine Division's assigned zone and only frantic efforts by the commander and staff of the 77th Infantry Division prevented an American [[air strike]] and artillery bombardment which would have resulted in many casualties due to [[friendly fire]].

The Japanese retreat—although harassed by artillery fires—was conducted with great skill at night and aided by the monsoon storms. The 32nd Army was able to move nearly 30,000 men into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula, which ultimately led to the greatest slaughter on Okinawa in the latter stages of the battle, including the deaths of thousands of civilians. In addition, there were 9,000 IJN troops supported by 1,100 militia holed up at the fortified area of the Okinawa Naval Base Force in the Oroku Peninsula. Later that day, the Americans launched an amphibious assault on the Oroku Peninsula in order to secure their western flank. After several days of bitter fighting, the Japanese were pushed to the far south of the island.

On June 18, General Buckner was killed by enemy artillery fire while monitoring the progress of his troops. Buckner was replaced by [[Roy Geiger]]. Upon assuming command, Geiger became the only U.S. Marine to command a numbered army of the U.S. Army in combat. He was relieved five days later by [[Joseph Stilwell]].

The island fell on June 21, although some Japanese continued hiding, including the future governor of [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Masahide Ota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanfocus.org/-Norimatsu-Satoko/3415 &quot;The World is beginning to know Okinawa&quot;: Ota Masahide reflects on his life from the Battle of Okinawa to the Struggle for Okinawa]&lt;/ref&gt; Ushijima and Chō committed suicide by ''[[seppuku]]'' in their command headquarters on Hill 89 in the closing hours of the battle. Colonel Yahara had asked Ushijima for permission to commit suicide, but the general refused his request, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If you die there will be no one left who knows the truth about the battle of Okinawa. Bear the temporary shame but endure it. This is an order from your army Commander.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''ibid'', p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Yahara was the most senior officer to have survived the battle on the island, and he later authored a book titled ''The Battle for Okinawa''.

[[File:Last picture of LtGen. Buckner at Okinawa.jpg|thumb|The last picture of Lieutenant General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]], right, the day before he was killed by Japanese artillery on June 19, 1945]]

U.S. losses were over 62,000 casualties of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing. This made the battle the bloodiest that U.S. forces experienced in the Pacific war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-okinawa-the-bloodiest-battle-of-the-pacific-war.htm |title= Battle of Okinawa: The Bloodiest Battle of the Pacific War |publisher=HistoryNet |accessdate =April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/14/magazine/the-bloodiest-battle-of-all.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Bloodiest Battle Of All | first=William | last=Manchester | date=June 14, 1987 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/okinawa-battle.htm |title=Battle of Okinawa |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand servicemen who died indirectly (from wounds and other causes) at a later date are not included in the total. One of the most famous U.S. casualties was the [[Journalist|war correspondent]] [[Ernie Pyle]], who was killed by Japanese machine gun fire on Ie Shima.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Chip. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5130777/ &quot;Ernie Pyle, trail-blazing war correspondent—Brought home the tragedy of D-Day and the rest of WWII&quot;], ''NBC News'', June 7, 2004. Retrieved April 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. forces suffered their highest-ever casualty rate for [[combat stress reaction]] during the entire war, at 48%, with some 14,000 soldiers retired due to nervous breakdown.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

General Buckner's decision to attack the Japanese defenses head-on, although extremely costly in U.S. lives, was ultimately successful. Just four days from the closing of the campaign, General Buckner was killed by Japanese artillery fire, which blew lethal slivers of coral into his body, while inspecting his troops at the front line. He was the highest-ranking U.S. officer to be killed by enemy fire during the war. The day after, a second general—[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Claudius M. Easley—was killed by machine gun fire.

Aircraft losses over the three-month period were 768 U.S. planes, including those bombing the Kyushu airfields launching ''kamikazes''. Combat losses were 458, and the other 310 were operational accidents. Japanese aircraft losses were 7,830 over the same period, including 2,655 to operational accidents. Navy and Marine Corps fighters downed 3,047, while shipboard anti-aircraft fire felled 409, and B-29s destroyed 558 on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;baldwin&quot;&gt;Baldwin, Hanson W. ''Sea Fights and Shipwrecks'' Hanover House 1956 page 308&lt;/ref&gt;

At sea, 368 Allied ships—including 120 amphibious craft—were damaged while another 28—including 15 amphibious ships and 12 destroyers—were sunk during the Okinawa campaign. The U.S. Navy's dead exceeded its wounded with 4,907 killed and 4,874 wounded, primarily from ''kamikaze'' attacks.&lt;ref name=ACtC&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ACTC/actc-24.html The Amphibians Came to Conquer] from [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ Hyperwar].&lt;/ref&gt; Among United States casualties, neither the Army nor the Marine death toll exceeded the Navy death toll in the battle for Okinawa.&lt;ref name= &quot;baldwin&quot;/&gt; The Japanese lost 16 ships sunk, including the giant battleship ''Yamato''.

On land the U.S. forces lost at least 225 tanks and many [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT]]s destroyed while eliminating 27 Japanese tanks and 743 artillery pieces (including mortars, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns), some of them knocked-out by the naval and air bombardments but most of them knocked-out by American counter-battery fire. Casualties of American ground artillery are unknown.

By one count, there were about 107,000 Japanese combatants killed and 7,400 captured. Some of the soldiers committed ''seppuku'' or simply blew themselves up with [[hand grenade]]s. In addition, thousands were sealed in their caves alive by the U.S. combat engineers.

This was also the first battle in the war in which surrendering Japanese were made into POWs by the thousands. Many of the Japanese prisoners were native Okinawans who had been impressed into the Army shortly before the battle and were less imbued with the Japanese Army's no-surrender doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Huber | first = Thomas M. | year = 1990 | month = May | url = http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp | title = Japan's Battle of Okinawa, April–June 1945 | work=Leavenworth Papers | publisher=[[United States Army]] Command and General Staff College | accessdate =May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the American forces occupied the island, the Japanese took Okinawan clothing to avoid capture and the Okinawans came to the Americans' aid by offering a simple way to detect Japanese in hiding. The [[Okinawan language]] differs greatly from the Japanese language; with Americans at their sides, Okinawans would give directions to people in the local language, and those who did not understand were considered Japanese in hiding who were then captured.

===Civilian losses===
[[File:OkinawaCivilians.jpg|thumb|upright|Okinawan civilians in 1945]]
[[File:OkinawaMarineOrphan.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Marines share a [[foxhole]] with an Okinawan war orphan in April 1945]]

At some battles, such as at [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], there had been no civilians involved, but Okinawa had a large [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] civilian population and, according to various estimates, somewhere between {{frac|1|10}} and ⅓ of them died during the battle.&lt;ref name=gso/&gt; Okinawan civilian losses in the campaign were estimated to be between 42,000 and 150,000 dead (more than 100,000 according to Okinawa Prefecture&lt;ref name=&quot;museum&quot;/&gt;). The U.S. Army figures for the campaign showed a total figure of 142,058 civilian casualties, including those who were [[Impressment|pressed into service]] by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]].&lt;ref name=gso/&gt;

During the battle, U.S. soldiers found it difficult to distinguish civilians from soldiers. It became routine for U.S. soldiers to shoot at Okinawan houses, as one infantryman wrote, &quot;There was some return fire from a few of the houses, but the others were probably occupied by civilians – and we didn't care. It was a terrible thing not to distinguish between the enemy and women and children. Americans always had great compassion, especially for children. Now we fired indiscriminately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Feifer, George, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', The Lyons Press (2001), p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

In its history of the war, the [[Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum]]&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.peace-museum.pref.okinawa.jp/english/index.html The Basic Concept of the Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum].&lt;/ref&gt; presents Okinawa as being caught in the fighting between America and Japan. During the 1945 battle, the Japanese Army showed indifference to Okinawa's defense and safety, and the Japanese soldiers used civilians as [[human shield]]s against the Americans. Japanese military [[confiscation|confiscate]]d food from the Okinawans and executed those who hid it, leading to a mass [[starvation]] among the population, and forced civilians out of their shelters. Japanese soldiers also killed about 1,000 Okinawans who spoke in a different local [[dialect]] in order to suppress spying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/20/news/oki.php 1945 suicide order still a trauma on Okinawa], ''IHT'', June 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum writes that &quot;some were blown apart by [[shell (projectile)|shells]], some finding themselves in a hopeless situation were driven to suicide, some died of starvation, some succumbed to [[malaria]], while others fell victim to the retreating Japanese troops.&quot;&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

====Mass suicides====
With the impending victory of American troops, civilians often committed [[mass suicide]], urged on by the Japanese soldiers who told locals that victorious American soldiers would go on a rampage of killing and [[rape|raping]]. ''[[Ryukyu Shimpo]]'', one of the two major Okinawan newspapers, wrote in 2007: &quot;There are many Okinawans who have testified that the Japanese Army directed them to commit suicide. There are also people who have testified that they were handed grenades by Japanese soldiers&quot; to blow themselves up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/world/asia/01japan.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title = Japan’s Textbooks Reflect Revised History |work=New York Times | first=Norimitsu | last=Onishi | date=April 1, 2007 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the civilians, having been induced by Japanese propaganda to believe that U.S. soldiers were [[barbarian]]s who committed horrible atrocities, killed their families and themselves to avoid capture. Some of them threw themselves and their family members from the cliffs where the Peace Museum now resides.

However, despite being told by the Japanese military that they would suffer rape, [[torture]] and murder at the hands of the Americans, Okinawans &quot;were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=RMDt86cokDUC&amp;pg=PA16 | title = The American Occupation of Japan and Okinawa: Literature and Memory | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | page = 16 | isbn=9780415191944 | year=1999 | publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=6xMuWmEsAcMC&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | first2 = Steve | last2 = Rabson | page = 22 | isbn=9780824823009 | year=2000 | publisher=University of Hawaii Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power'' by [[Mark Selden]], the Americans &quot;did not pursue a policy of torture, rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power | first = Susan D | last = Sheehan | first2 = Laura | last2 = Elizabeth | first3 = Hein Mark | last3 = Selden | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njahs.org/misnorcal/campaigns/campaigns_centralpacific.htm#okinawa Military Intelligence Service Research Center: Okinawa].&lt;/ref&gt; combat translator [[Teruto Tsubota]], a U.S. Marine born in Hawaii, convinced hundreds of civilians not to kill themselves and thus saved their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=27219&amp;archive=true Defiant soldier saved lives of hundreds of civilians during Okinawa battle], ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', April 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rape allegations====
Civilians and historians report that soldiers on both sides had raped Okinawan civilians during the battle. Rape by Japanese troops &quot;became common&quot; in June, after it became clear that the Japanese Army had been defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;command&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appleman|first=Roy E.|title= Okinawa: The Last Battle|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|location= Washington DC|year=1948|series=United States Army in World War II|page=462|url= http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Okinawan historian has estimated there were more than 10,000 rapes of Okinawan women by American troops during the three month campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;iiatou&quot;&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=114661059720058 H-Net review of The GI War against Japan: American Soldiers in Asia and the Pacific during World War II]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported in 2000 that in the village of Katsuyama, civilians formed a vigilante group to [[Cave of the Negroes incident|ambush and kill]] a group of black American soldiers whom they claimed frequently raped the local girls there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lisa Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,170085-2,00.html|title= Okinawa Nights |work=TIME |date=August 13, 2001 |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine Corps officials in Okinawa and Washington have stated that they &quot;knew of no rapes by American servicemen in Okinawa at the end of the war, and their records do not list war crimes committed by Marines in Okinawa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-3dead&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sims |first=Calvin |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html?pagewanted=1 |title=3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |work=The New York Times  |date=June 1, 2000 |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian George Feifer, however, writes that rape in Okinawa was &quot;another dirty secret of the campaign&quot; in which &quot;American military chronicles ignore [the] crimes.&quot; Few Okinawans revealed their pregnancies, as &quot;stress and bad diet ... rendered most Okinawan women infertile. Many who did become pregnant managed to abort before their husbands and fathers returned. A smaller number of newborn infants fathered by Americans were suffocated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Feifer, George, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', The Lyons Press (2001), p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide order controversy===
[[File:Overcoming the last resistance.jpg|thumb|Overcoming the civilian resistance on Okinawa was aided by U.S. [[propaganda]] [[Pamphlet|leaflet]]s, one of which is being read by a prisoner awaiting transport]]

There is ongoing major disagreement between Okinawa's local government and Japan's national government over the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides during the battle. In March 2007, the national [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) advised textbook publishers to reword descriptions that the embattled Imperial Japanese Army forced civilians to kill themselves in the war so they would not be taken prisoner by the U.S. military. MEXT preferred descriptions that just say that civilians received hand grenades from the Japanese military.

This move sparked widespread protests among the Okinawans. In June 2007, the Okinawa Prefectoral Assembly adopted a resolution stating, &quot;We strongly call on the (national) government to retract the instruction and to immediately restore the description in the textbooks so the truth of the Battle of Okinawa will be handed down correctly and a tragic war will never happen again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html Okinawa slams history text rewrite], ''Japan Times'', June 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2007, about 110,000 people held the biggest [[political rally]] in the history of Okinawa to demand that MEXT retract its order to textbook publishers on revising the account of the civilian suicides. The resolution stated: &quot;It is an undeniable fact that the 'multiple suicides' would not have occurred without the involvement of the Japanese military and any deletion of or [[Historical revisionism|revision]] to (the descriptions) is a denial and distortion of the many testimonies by those people who survived the incidents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070930a2.html &quot;110,000 protest history text revision order&quot;], ''The Japan Times'', September 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 26, 2007, MEXT partially admitted the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/26/asia/japan.php Japan to amend textbook accounts of Okinawa suicides] ''[[International Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]'', December 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry's Textbook Authorization Council allowed the publishers to reinstate the reference that civilians &quot;were forced into mass suicides by the Japanese military,&quot; on condition it is placed in sufficient context. The council report stated: &quot;It can be said that from the viewpoint of the Okinawa residents, they were forced into the mass suicides.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071227a1.html Texts reinstate army's role in mass suicides: Okinawa prevails in history row] ''[[Japan Times]]'', December 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; That was, however, not enough for the survivors who said it is important for children today to know what really happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7098876.stm Okinawa's war time wounds reopened] BBC News, November 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nobel Prize]] winning author [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] has written a booklet which states that the mass suicide order was given by the military during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Times, September 12, 2007, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070912a3.html Witness: Military ordered mass suicides]&lt;/ref&gt; He was sued by the revisionists, including a wartime commander during the battle, who disputed this and wanted to stop publication of the booklet. At a court hearing on November 9, 2007, Ōe testified: &quot;Mass suicides were forced on Okinawa islanders under Japan's [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] social structure that ran through the state of Japan, the Japanese armed forces and local garrisons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071110a3.html Oe testifies military behind Okinawa mass suicides], ''Japan Times'', November 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2008, the [[Osaka Prefecture]] Court ruled in favor of Ōe stating, &quot;It can be said the military was deeply involved in the mass suicides.&quot; The court recognized the military's involvement in the mass suicides and [[murder–suicide]]s, citing the testimony about the distribution of grenades for suicide by soldiers and the fact that mass suicides were not recorded on islands where the military was not stationed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080329a1.html Court sides with Oe over mass suicides], ''Japan Times'', March 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Attack on bloody ridge.jpg|thumb|American [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] knocked out by Japanese artillery Bloody Ridge April 20, 1945]]

Ninety percent of the buildings on the island were completely destroyed, and the lush tropical landscape was turned into &quot;a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc-shorinryu.com/okinawa.html Okinawan History and Karate-do]&lt;/ref&gt;

The military value of Okinawa &quot;exceeded all hope.&quot; Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in close proximity to Japan. After the battle, the U.S. cleared the surrounding waters of mines in [[Operation Zebra]], occupied Okinawa, and set up the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]], a form of military government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Military Government In The Ryukyu Islands, 1945–1950|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1410218791 |accessdate =February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant U.S. forces remain garrisoned there, and Kadena remains the largest U.S. air base in Asia.

Some military historians believe that the Okinawa campaign led directly to the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], as a means of avoiding the [[Operation Downfall|planned ground invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. [[Victor Davis Hanson]] explains his view in ''Ripples of Battle'':

{{bquote|...because the Japanese on Okinawa... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace [unconditionally], without American casualties. Ironically, the American conventional [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|fire-bombing]] of major Japanese cities (which had been going on for months before Okinawa) was far more effective at killing civilians than the atomic bombs and, had the Americans simply continued, or expanded this, the Japanese would likely have surrendered anyway.}}
[[File:Cornerstone of Peace.jpg|thumb|[[Cornerstone of Peace]] Memorial with names of all military and civilians from all countries who died in the Battle of Okinawa]]

In 1945, [[Winston Churchill]] called the battle &quot;among the most intense and famous in military history.&quot;

In 1995, the Okinawa government erected a memorial named [[Cornerstone of Peace]] in Mabuni, the site of the last fighting in southeastern Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/summit/a_la/peace/ishiji/index2.htm The Cornerstone of Peace]&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial lists all the known names of those who died in the battle, civilian and military, Japanese and foreign. As of June 2008, it contains 240,734 names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080624a6.html Okinawa is promised reduced base burden], ''[[The Japan Times]]'', June 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Brezhnev Doctrine''' was a [[Soviet Union]] [[foreign policy]], first and most clearly outlined by S. Kovalev in a September 26, 1968 ''[[Pravda]]'' article, entitled “Sovereignty and the International Obligations of Socialist Countries.” [[Leonid Ilych Brezhnev|Leonid Brezhnev]] reiterated it in a speech at the Fifth Congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] on November 13, 1968, which stated: 

:&quot;''When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards [[capitalism]], it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.''&quot;

This doctrine was announced to retroactively justify the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968 that ended the [[Prague Spring]], along with earlier [[Soviet military]] interventions, such as the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956|invasion of Hungary in 1956]]. These interventions were meant to put an end to democratic liberalization efforts and uprisings that had the potential to compromise Soviet hegemony inside the [[Eastern bloc]], which was considered by the Soviets to be an essential defensive and strategic buffer in case hostilities with [[NATO]] were to break out.   

In practice, the policy meant that limited independence of communist parties was allowed. However, no country would be allowed to leave the [[Warsaw Pact]], disturb a nation's [[communist party]]'s monopoly on power, or in any way compromise the cohesiveness of the Eastern bloc. Implicit in this doctrine was that the leadership of the Soviet Union reserved, for itself, the right to define &quot;[[socialism]]&quot; and &quot;[[capitalism]]&quot;. Following the announcement of the Brezhnev Doctrine, numerous treaties were signed between the Soviet Union and its satellite states to reassert these points and to further ensure inter-state cooperation. The principles of the doctrine were so broad that the Soviets even used it to justify their military intervention in the non-Warsaw Pact nation of [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan in 1979]]. The Brezhnev Doctrine stayed in effect until it was finally ended with the [[Soviet non-invasion of Poland]] during the 1980-1981 crisis&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried Loth. Moscow, Prague and Warsaw: Overcoming the Brezhnev Doctrine. ''[[Cold War History]]'' 1, no. 2 (2001): 103-118.&lt;/ref&gt; and later refusal of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to use military force when [[Poland]] held free elections in 1989 and Solidarity defeated the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 945&lt;/ref&gt;  It was superseded by the facetiously named [[Sinatra Doctrine]] in 1989.

[[Image:Bain-marie.jpg|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;A bain-marie on a stovetop&lt;/center&gt;]]

A '''bain-marie''' (also known as a '''water bath''') is a [[French language|French]] term for a piece of equipment used in [[science]], [[industry]], and [[cooking]] to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures, or to keep materials warm over a period of time.

== Description ==
The bain-marie comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts:  a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working liquid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath.  Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source.

Typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid.

The smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container, filled with the working liquid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed.  The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching.

When the working liquid is water and the bain-marie is used at [[sea level]], the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees [[Celsius]] (the boiling point of water at sea level).  Using different working liquids (oils, salt solutions, etc.)  in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures.

== Alternatives ==
A contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric &quot;dry-heat&quot; bain-marie, [[heating element|heated by element]] below both pots.  The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions.  They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Electric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or &quot;bath&quot;), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam.

== Culinary applications ==
[[Image:Bain-marie.JPG|thumb|300px|An improvised bain-marie being used to melt chocolate]]
* [[Chocolate]] can be melted in a bain-marie to avoid splitting and caking onto the pot. Special [[dessert]] bain-maries have a thermally insulated container and are used as a chocolate [[fondue]]. 
* [[Cheesecake]] is often baked in a bain-marie to prevent the top from cracking in the centre.
* [[Custard]] may be cooked in a bain-marie to keep a crust from forming on the outside of the custard before the interior is fully cooked.
* Classic warm sauces, such as [[Hollandaise]] and [[beurre blanc]], requiring heat to emulsify the mixture but not enough to [[curdle]] or &quot;split&quot; the sauce, are often cooked using a bain-marie.
* Some [[charcuterie]] such as [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s and [[pâtés]] are cooked in an &quot;oven-type&quot; bain-marie.
* [[reduction (cooking)|Thickening]] of [[condensed milk]], such as in [[confection]]-making, is done easily in a bain-marie.
* Controlled-temperature bains-marie can be used to heat frozen [[breast milk]] before feedings.
* Bains-marie can be used in place of [[chafing dish]]es for keeping foods warm for long periods of time, where stovetops or [[hot plate]]s are inconvenient or too powerful.

== Origin ==
Bains-marie were originally developed for use in the practice of [[alchemy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gastronomique&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently. In that early form of chemical science, it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes, occurring in the Earth's core, by which [[precious metal]]s were believed to be [[germination|germinated]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The name comes from the medieval-[[Latin]] term ''balneum'' (or ''balineum'') ''Mariae''—literally, ''Mary's bath''—from which the [[French language|French]] ''bain de Marie'', or ''bain-marie'', is derived.  There are many theories as to how the name ''Marie'' came to be associated with this equipment:

* According to culinary writer Giuliano Bugialli, the term comes from the Italian ''bagno maria'', named after Maria de'Cleofa, who developed the technique in [[Florence]] in the [[cinquecento|sixteenth century]].&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano Bugialli, ''The Fine Art of Italian Cooking'', p.33.  New York: Gramercy 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alternatively, the device's invention has been popularly attributed to [[Mary the Jewess]], an ancient alchemist traditionally supposed to have been [[Miriam]], a sister of [[Moses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gastronomique&quot;/&gt;  However, according to ''The Jewish Alchemists,''&lt;ref&gt;Patai, Raphael, ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book'', Princeton University Press: Princeton, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Maria the Jewess was an ancient alchemist who lived in [[Alexandria]], which would seem to contradict the tradition that she was Moses' sister:  Alexandria was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 334 BC, while Moses is thought to have lived around 1450-1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses|Date_of_the_Exodus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Finally, some consider the name a reference to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], whose proverbial gentleness can be likened to the gentleness of this cooking technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gastronomique&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Festa redentore 2009 081.JPG|250px|thumb| Ballu tundu]]

'''Ballu tundu''' or '''Ballu Sardu''' is a traditional [[Italian folk dance]] from the island of [[Sardinia]] which is typically danced in a closed or open circle. The dance was described as early as 1805 by Mameli and by [[Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora|La Marmora]] in 1825. In northern and central Sardinia, the dance is lively and animated with leaps and agile movements and usually accompanied by a choir of three or more singers in the center of the circle. In other areas, the dance is done to ''[[launeddas]]'' and the shepherd's ''sulittu'' but the accordion had also made its appearance by the 19th century. The Introduction is in 2/4 time but the dance itself is done in 6/8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dances of Italy|last=Galanti|first=Bianca M.|location=New York|publisher=Chanticleer Press|year=1950|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ond&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Costumi, musica, danze e feste popolari italiane|last=Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro|location=Roma|publisher=Edizione O.N.D.|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least in the past, the manner of holding hands was very important and followed strict rules. Married or engaged couples could hold hands palm to palm with fingers entwined, but a man could not do this with a young girl or another man's wife. If a stranger entered the circle, he had to do so to the woman's right so as not to come between her and her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;ond&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Rifugi Monte Ortobene 018.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nuoro]], the main urban center in Barbagia]]
'''Barbagia''' ({{lang-sc|Barbàgia}} or {{lang|sc|''Barbaza''}}) is an mountain area of inner [[Sardinia]], western [[Italy]]. It is mostly comprised in the [[province of Nuoro]] and located alongside the [[Gennargentu]] massif.

The name comes from [[Cicero]], who described it as a land of ''[[Barbarians]]''. This word derives from the Greek Βάρβαρος-ου, which means stuttering. The inhabitants were also known, by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], with the pejorative term  ''latrones mastrucati'', which means &quot;thieves with a rough garment in wool&quot;. Roman domination in this area of Sardinia was never more than nominal.

The area is usually divided into four Barbagias: the Barbagia di [[Ollolai]], the [[Barbagia di Seulo]], the [[Barbagia di Belvì]] and the [[Mandrolisai]]. The latter is named after a sub-region, and the others after their main villages.

The area is full of hard hills, and there is little human presence. In fact, Barbagia is one of the least populated areas in Europe. These facts have allowed Barbagia to preserve its cultural and natural treasures. The language spoken is [[Sardo logudorese]].

One of the most important towns is [[Gavoi]]. [[Orgosolo]] was famous for its bandits and kidnappers. [[Oliena]] is well known for its [[wine]]s (especially the Nepente, a  wine made with [[Cannonau]] grapes). Another well known town is [[Fonni]], being the highest town in Sardinia, More than 1000 meters above sea level. Fonni is also the gateway to the Gennargentu mountain system

Economy: agriculture, sheep breeding, art and tradition related business, tourism and light industry.

Founded in 1960 by two Australians, driver [[Jack Brabham]] and designer [[Ron Tauranac]], the team won four [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|drivers']] and two [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|constructors']] world championships in its 30-year Formula One history. Jack Brabham's 1966 drivers' championship remains the only such achievement using a car bearing the driver's own name.

In the 1960s, Brabham was the world's largest manufacturer of [[open wheel car|open wheel racing cars]] for sale to customer teams, and had built more than 500 cars by 1970. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in [[Formula Two]] and [[Formula Three]] and competed in the [[Indianapolis 500]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced innovations such as the &quot;[[fan car]]&quot;—which won its only race before being withdrawn—in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and [[hydropneumatic suspension]]. The team won two more Formula One drivers' championships in the 1980s with Brazilian [[Nelson Piquet]], and became the first to win a drivers' championship with a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] car.

British businessman [[Bernie Ecclestone]] owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the [[1992 Formula One season|1992 season]], the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]]. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the [[2010 Formula One season]] using the Brabham name.

==Origins==
[[File:BrabhamJack1966B.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jack Brabham]] was 40 when he won the F1 drivers' title in a Brabham car.]]
The Brabham team was founded by [[Jack Brabham]] and [[Ron Tauranac]], who met in 1951 while both were successfully building and racing cars in their native Australia. Brabham was the more successful driver and went to the United Kingdom in 1955 to further his racing career. There he started driving for the [[Cooper Car Company]] works team and by 1958 had progressed with them to Formula One, the highest category of [[open wheel racing]] defined by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), motor sport's world governing body.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;FIA&quot; has been used throughout this article to refer to the motor sports governing body. Until 1978 motor sport was governed directly by the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) and from 1978 by the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), both subsidiary bodies of the FIA. In 1992 the FIA subsumed FISA and its governing role.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1959 Formula One season|1959]] and [[1960 Formula One season|1960]], Brabham won the Formula One world drivers' championship in Cooper's revolutionary [[mid-engine]]d cars.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their innovation of putting the engine behind the driver, the Coopers and their Chief Designer Owen Maddock were generally resistant to developing their cars. Brabham pushed for further advances, and played a significant role in developing Cooper's highly successful 1960 T53 &quot;lowline&quot; car, with input from his friend Tauranac.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) pp. 18, 22. Brabham had consulted Tauranac by letter on technical matters since arriving in the UK. He used a gear cluster designed by Tauranac for several years and Tauranac also advised on the suspension geometry of the Cooper T53 &quot;lowline&quot; car.&lt;/ref&gt; Brabham was confident he could do better than Cooper, and in late 1959 he asked Tauranac to come to the UK and work with him, initially producing upgrade kits for [[Sunbeam Rapier]] and [[Triumph Herald]] road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 22–4. Jack had already tried to buy Cooper in association with fellow-driver [[Roy Salvadori]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brabham describes Tauranac as &quot;absolutely the only bloke I'd have gone into partnership with&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet that aim, Brabham and Tauranac set up Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), deliberately avoiding the use of either man’s name. The new company would compete with Cooper in the market for customer racing cars; as Brabham was still employed by Cooper, Tauranac produced the first MRD car, for the entry level [[Formula Junior]] class, in secrecy. Unveiled in the summer of 1961, the &quot;MRD&quot; was soon renamed. Motoring journalist [[Gérard Crombac|Jabby Crombac]] pointed out that &quot;[the] way a Frenchman pronounces those initials—written phonetically, 'em air day'—sounded perilously like the French word... ''[[Wiktionary:Merde|merde]].''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scarlett (May 2006) p. 43. Although compare pronunciation with the related verb [[wiktionary:emmerder|emmerder]]. This is the story as recalled by both Ron Tauranac and Brabham mechanic Michael Scarlett. The British journalist Alan Brinton has also been credited with pointing out this unfortunate fact to Brabham. See Drackett (1985) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The cars were subsequently known as Brabhams, with type numbers starting with BT for &quot;Brabham Tauranac&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Drackett (1985) p. 21. The first prototype FJunior car therefore became the BT1 and its production version the BT2.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[1961 Formula One season]], the [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] teams had developed the mid-engined approach further than Cooper. Brabham had a poor season, scoring only four points, and—having run his own private Coopers in non-championship events during 1961—left the company in 1962 to drive for his own team: the Brabham Racing Organisation, using cars built by Motor Racing Developments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Law31&quot;&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brabham, Nye (2004) pp. 14, 145–9. Brabham's and Tauranac's (Lawrence 1999 p. 32) accounts differ on whether the BRO was formed for the purpose of F1, or was already in existence.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing history—Formula One==
===Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac (1961–1970)===
[[File:Brabham racing organisation logo.png|thumb|right|The Brabham Racing Organisation entered the &quot;works&quot; cars until 1968]]
Motor Racing Developments initially concentrated on making money by building cars for sale to customers in lower formulae, so the new car for the Formula One team was not ready until partway through the [[1962 Formula One season]]. The Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) started the year fielding customer [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] chassis, in which Brabham took two points finishes, before the turquoise-[[livery|liveried]] Brabham BT3 car made its debut at the [[1962 German Grand Prix]]. It retired with a [[throttle]] problem after 9 of the 15 laps, but went on to take a pair of fourth places at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 21–22. Brabham bought a new spaceframe Lotus 24, but had to use a 1961-vintage Lotus 21 in the early races after a workshop fire. Team Lotus reserved the monocoque Lotus 25 for their own use that season.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brabham BT3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Brabham BT3]], the first Brabham Formula One design.]]
From the [[1963 Formula One season|1963 season]], Brabham was partnered by American driver [[Dan Gurney]], the pair now running in Australia's [[List of international auto racing colors|racing colours]] of green and gold.&lt;ref&gt;Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Brabham took the team's first win at the non-championship [[Solituderennen|Solitude Grand Prix]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Gurney took the [[marque]]'s first two wins in the world championship, at the 1964 [[1964 French Grand Prix|French]] and [[1964 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican]] Grands Prix. Brabham works and customer cars took another three non-championship wins during the [[1964 Formula One season|1964 season]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 35–41&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1965 Formula One season|1965 season]] was less successful, with no championship wins. Brabham finished third or fourth in the constructors' championship for three years running, but poor reliability marred promising performances on several occasions. Motor sport authors Mike Lawrence and David Hodges have said that a lack of resources may have cost the team results, a view echoed by Ron Tauranac.&lt;ref&gt;Tauranac says (Lawrence (1999) p. 48) that he feels a third mechanic would have reduced the reliability problems. Lawrence himself notes (Lawrence (1999) p. 71) that &quot;If only Jack had been prepared to spend a little more money, the results could have been so much better.&quot; Hodges (1990) p. 32 notes &quot;Economy was a watchword. (...) It was this attitude, perhaps, which cost [Brabham] some races.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIA doubled the Formula One engine capacity limit to 3&amp;nbsp;litres for the [[1966 Formula One season|1966 season]] and suitable engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm [[Repco]], which had never produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 [[engine block]]s from the defunct American [[Oldsmobile]] F85 road car project, and other off the shelf parts.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Consulting and design engineer [[Phil Irving]] (of [[Vincent Motorcycle]] fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive,&lt;ref&gt;Unique p. 43. The team was the only one not contracted by [[John Frankenheimer]] for the shooting of the film ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' at world championship races that year.&lt;/ref&gt; but the light and reliable cars ran at the front from the start of the season. At the [[1966 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] at [[Reims-Gueux]], Jack Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former team mate, [[Bruce McLaren]], has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Jack Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name (''cf'' [[Surtees]], [[Hill (constructor)|Hill]] and [[Fittipaldi Automotive]]). In [[1967 Formula One season|1967]], the title went to Brabham's team mate, New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]]. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Jack Brabham's desire to try new parts first.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 92. Hulme, Tauranac and Frank Hallam, Repco-Brabham's chief engineer, all shared this view.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brabham team took the constructors' world championship in both years.&lt;ref&gt;Fearnley (May 2006) pp. 34–40&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[1968 Formula One season|1968]] Austrian [[Jochen Rindt]] replaced Hulme, who had left to join [[McLaren]]. Repco produced a more powerful version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new [[Cosworth DFV]], but it proved very unreliable. Slow communications between the UK and Australia had always made identifying and correcting problems very difficult. The car was fast—Rindt set [[pole position]] twice during the season—but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.&lt;ref&gt;Fearnley (May 2006) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1970 Brands Hatch Race of Champions Jack Brabham BT33.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Brabham BT33. Technically conservative, Brabham did not produce a [[monocoque]] car until 1970.]]
Although Brabham bought Cosworth DFV engines for the [[1969 Formula One season|1969 season]], Rindt left to join Lotus. His replacement, [[Jacky Ickx]], had a strong second half to the season, winning in [[1969 German Grand Prix|Germany]] and [[1969 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], after Jack Brabham was sidelined by a testing accident.&lt;ref&gt;Henry p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Ickx finished second in the drivers' championship, with 37&amp;nbsp;points to [[Jackie Stewart]]'s 63. Brabham himself took a couple of pole positions and two top three finishes, but did not finish half the races. The team were second in the constructors' championship, aided by second places at [[1969 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and [[1969 United States Grand Prix|Watkins Glen]] scored by [[Piers Courage]], driving a Brabham for the [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]] privateer squad.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Brabham intended to retire at the end of the 1969 season and sold his share in the team to Tauranac. However, Rindt's late decision to remain with Lotus meant that Brabham drove for another year.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 109 &amp; Brabham, Nye (2004) pp. 230–231. He was therefore technically a team employee in his final season.&lt;/ref&gt; He took his last win in the opening race of the [[1970 Formula One season|1970 season]] and was competitive throughout the year, although mechanical failures blunted his challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by number two driver [[Rolf Stommelen]], the team came fourth in the constructors' championship.

===Ron Tauranac (1971)===
[[File:1971 Race of Champions G Hill Brabham BT34.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Brabham BT34]]. [[Graham Hill]] took his final Formula One win in the unique &quot;lobster claw&quot;.]]Tauranac signed double world champion [[Graham Hill]] and young Australian [[Tim Schenken]] to drive for the [[1971 Formula One season|1971 season]]. Tauranac designed the unusual ‘lobster claw’ BT34, featuring twin [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]]s mounted ahead of the front wheels, a single example of which was built for Hill. Although Hill, no longer a front-runner since his 1969 accident, took his final Formula One win in the non-championship [[BRDC International Trophy]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]],&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 114–17&lt;/ref&gt; the team scored only seven&amp;nbsp;championship points.

Tauranac, an engineer at heart, started to feel his Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble he could not afford to take on his own and began to look around for an experienced business partner.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman [[Bernie Ecclestone]], Jochen Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the [[Connaught Engineering|Connaught]] team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernie Ecclestone (1972–1987)===
[[File:Brabham BT44 front.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Brabham BT44]] on display in 2003.  The car was used in the {{F1|1974}} and {{F1|1975}} seasons.]]

Tauranac left Brabham early in the [[1972 Formula One season|1972 season]] after Ecclestone changed the way the company was organised without consulting him. Ecclestone has since said &quot;In retrospect, the relationship was never going to work&quot;, noting that &quot;[Tauranac and I] both take the view: 'Please be reasonable, do it my way'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence. pp. 116–118&lt;/ref&gt; The highlights of an aimless year, during which the team ran three different models, were pole position for Argentinian driver [[Carlos Reutemann]] at his home race at [[Buenos Aires]] and a victory in the non-championship Interlagos Grand Prix. For the [[1973 Formula One season|1973 season]], Ecclestone promoted the young South African engineer [[Gordon Murray]] to chief designer and moved Herbie Blash from the Formula Two programme to become the Formula One team manager. Both would remain with the team for the next 15 years. For 1973, Murray produced the triangular cross-section BT42, with which Reutemann scored two podium finishes and finished seventh in the drivers' championship. 

In the [[1974 Formula One season|1974 season]], Reutemann took the first three victories of his Formula One career, and Brabham's first since 1970. The team finished a close fifth in the constructors' championship, fielding the much more competitive [[Brabham BT44|BT44s]]. After a strong finish to the 1974 season, many observers felt the team were favourites to win the [[1975 Formula One season|1975 title]]. The year started well, with a first win for Brazilian driver [[José Carlos Pace|Carlos Pace]] at the [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] circuit in his native [[São Paulo]]. However, as the season progressed, tyre wear frequently slowed the cars in races.&lt;ref&gt;Gill (ed.) (1976) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Pace took another two podiums and finished sixth in the championship; while Carlos Reutemann had five podium finishes, including a dominant win in the [[1975 German Grand Prix]], and finished third in the drivers' championship. The team likewise ranked third in the constructors' table at the end of the year.

While rival teams Lotus and McLaren relied on the Cosworth DFV engine from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Ecclestone sought a competitive advantage by investigating other options. Despite the success of Murray’s Cosworth-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with Italian motor manufacturer [[Alfa Romeo]] to use their large and powerful [[flat-12]] engine from the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]]. The engines were free, but they rendered the new BT45s, now in red [[Martini Racing]] livery, unreliable and overweight.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 159–161&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 and [[1977 Formula One season|1977 seasons]] saw Brabham fall toward the back of the field again. Reutemann negotiated a release from his contract before the end of the 1976 season and signed with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Ulsterman [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] replaced him at Brabham for 1977. The team lost Carlos Pace early in the 1977 season when he died in a [[light aircraft]] accident.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 164, 167&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[1978 Formula One season|1978 season]], Murray’s [[Brabham BT46|BT46]] featured several new technologies to overcome the weight and packaging difficulties caused by the Alfa engines. Ecclestone signed then two-time Formula One world champion [[Niki Lauda]] from Ferrari through a deal with Italian dairy products company [[Parmalat]] which met the cost of Lauda ending his Ferrari contract and made up his salary to the £200,000 Ferrari was offering. 1978 was the year of the dominant [[Lotus 79]] &quot;wing car&quot;, which used [[aerodynamic]] [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] to stick to the track when cornering, but Lauda won two races in the BT46, one with the controversial &quot;B&quot; or &quot;[[Brabham_BT46#Brabham_BT46B_.E2.80.93_the_.22Fan_car.22|fan car]]&quot; version.&lt;ref&gt;Details of BT46 and 1978 season: Henry (1985) p. 171, pp. 179–189
* Lauda's move and salary: Lovell (2004) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership with Alfa Romeo ended during the [[1979 Formula One season|1979 season]], the team's first with young Brazilian driver [[Nelson Piquet]]. Murray designed the full-ground effect BT48 around a rapidly developed new Alfa Romeo V12 engine and incorporated an effective &quot;carbon-carbon braking&quot; system—[[#Technical innovation|a technology Brabham pioneered in 1976]]. However, unexpected movement of the car's aerodynamic [[center of pressure|centre of pressure]] made its handling unpredictable and the new engine was unreliable. The team dropped to eighth in the constructors' table by the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Alfa Romeo started testing their own Formula One car during the season, prompting Ecclestone to revert to Cosworth DFV engines, a move Murray described as being &quot;like having a holiday&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 213, 215&lt;/ref&gt; The new, lighter, Cosworth-powered [[Brabham BT49|BT49]] was introduced before the end of the year at the [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]]; where after practice Lauda announced his immediate retirement from driving, later saying that he &quot;was no longer getting any pleasure from driving round and round in circles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2005 Brands Hatch A1GP 25 Sept Christian Glaesel Brabham BT49D.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The [[Brabham BT49]] competed over four seasons, winning one championship.]]

The team used the BT49 over four seasons. In the [[1980 Formula One season|1980 season]] Piquet scored three wins and the team took 3rd in the constructors' championship with Piquet second in the Drivers Championship. This season saw the introduction of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the [[1981 Formula One season|1981 season]], incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid [[ride height]] limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray,&lt;ref name=&quot;RoePiq&quot;&gt;Roebuck (1986) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit [[#Controversy|amid accusations of cheating]]. The team finished second in the constructors championship, behind the [[WilliamsF1|Williams team]].

[[Renault F1|Renault]] had introduced [[turbocharged]] engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a [[BMW]] 4-cylinder [[BMW M12|M12]] turbocharged engine in the summer of 1981. For the [[1982 Formula One season|1982 season]] the team designed a new car, the BT50, around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years previously, was based on a road car engine block, the [[BMW M10]]. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D in the early part of the season while reliability and driveability issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]]. In the constructors championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers [[Riccardo Patrese]], who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the [[1982 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the drivers championship. In the [[1983 Formula One season|1983 season]], Piquet took the championship lead from [[Renault F1|Renault's]] [[Alain Prost]] at the last race of the year, the [[1983 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]] to become the first driver to win the Formula One drivers' world championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the constructor's championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. [[Riccardo Patrese]] was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished 9th in the drivers championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the constructors championship.

[[File:Piquet - Brabham-BMW BT 54 1985-08-02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nelson Piquet]] and his BT54 were hampered by [[Pirelli]] tyres in {{F1|1985}}.]]

Piquet took the team’s last wins: two in 1984 with winning the 7th and 8th race of that season, the [[1984 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] and the [[1984 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]] and one in 1985 with winning the [[1985 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] before reluctantly leaving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team at the end of the season. After seven years and two world championships, he felt he was worth more than Ecclestone's salary offer for 1986. Piquet finished 5th in 1984 and a mere 8th in 1985 in the respective drivers championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoePiq&quot; /&gt; The [[1986 Formula One season|1986 season]] was a disaster. Murray's radical long and low [[Brabham BT55|BT55]], with its BMW M12 engine tilted over to improve its aerodynamics and lower its centre of gravity, scored only two points. Driver [[Elio de Angelis]] became the Formula One team's only fatality when he died in a testing accident at the [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] circuit. [[Derek Warwick]], who replaced de Angelis, was close to scoring two points for fifth in the [[1986 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], but a problem on the last lap dropped him out of the points. In August, BMW after considering running their own in-house team, announced their departure from Formula One at the end of the season. Murray, who had largely taken over the running of the team as Ecclestone became more involved with his role at the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], felt that &quot;the way the team had operated for 15 years broke down&quot;. He left Brabham in November to join [[McLaren]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BGEnd&quot;&gt;Lovell (2004) pp. 161–164&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecclestone held BMW to their contract for the [[1987 Formula One season|1987 season]], but the German company would only supply the laydown engine. The upright units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold for use by the [[Arrows]] team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. 1987 was only slightly more successful than the previous year—Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third places at the [[1987 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] and the [[1987 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]]. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. He sold MRD to [[Alfa Romeo]] for an unknown price.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGEnd&quot; /&gt; &lt;!--for £2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (11 Nov 1987) p. 4 The article does not specify to whom the team was sold.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Joachim Luhti (1989)===
The Brabham team missed the 1988 season during the change of ownership. Alfa Romeo soon sold it on, this time to Swiss financier Joachim Luhti, who brought it back into Formula One for the [[1989 Formula One season|1989 season]]. The new BT58, powered by an engine from [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] (originally another of Jack Brabham's companies), was produced for the [[1989 Formula One season|1989 season]].&lt;ref&gt;Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 254. Engine Developments, the company which builds Judd engines, was a company Jack Brabham set up in partnership with John Judd after his retirement from driving in 1970. Judd had previously worked for Brabham on the Repco project.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian driver [[Stefano Modena]] drove alongside the more experienced [[Martin Brundle]]. The team finished in eighth place, and Modena took the team's last podium: a third place at the [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]]. The team also failed to make the grid sometimes: Brundle failed to prequalify at the [[1989 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] and the [[1989 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]]. The team finished 9th in the constructors' championship at the end of the season.

===Middlebridge Racing (1989–1992)===
After Luhti's arrest on tax fraud charges in mid-1989,&lt;ref&gt;Slevin, Gary (2008) [http://www.f1rejects.com/centrale/submitted/brabham/index.html The Decline of Brabham]. Formula One Rejects. Retrieved 10 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; several parties disputed the ownership of the team. Middlebridge Group Limited, a Japanese engineering firm owned by billionaire Koji Nakauchi, was already involved with established [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]] team Middlebridge Racing and gained control of Brabham for the [[1990 Formula One season|1990 season]]. Blash returned to run the team. Middlebridge paid for its purchase using £1&amp;nbsp;million loaned to them by finance company Landhurst Leasing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Landhurst&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Formula One obsession led to pounds 50m Landhurst fraud|author= John Willcock|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/formula-one-obsession-led-to-pounds-50m-landhurst-fraud-1236602.html|newspaper=[[Independent_(newspaper)|The Independent]] |date= 18 October 1997|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the team remained underfunded and would only score a few more points finishes in its last three seasons. Jack Brabham's youngest son, [[David Brabham|David]], raced for the Formula One team for a short time in 1990, a disastrous year, with Modena's fifth place in the season opening [[1990 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] being the only top six finish. The team finished ninth in the Constructors' Championship. Brundle and fellow Briton [[Mark Blundell]], scored only three points during the [[1991 Formula One season|1991 season]]. Due to poor results in the first half of 1991, they had to prequalify in the second half of the season, Blundell failed to do so in Japan, as did Brundle in Australia. The team finished 10th in the Constructors Championship, behind another struggling British team, Lotus. In 1992, [[Damon Hill]], the son of another former Brabham driver and World Champion, debuted in the team after [[Giovanna Amati]], the last woman to attempt to race in Formula One, was dropped when her sponsorship failed to materialise.

Argentine [[Sergio Rinland]] designed the team's final cars around Judd engines, except for 1991 when [[Yamaha Motor Company Ltd.|Yamaha]] powered the cars. In the [[1992 Formula One season|1992 season]] the cars (which were updated versions of the 1991 car) rarely qualified for races. Hill gave the team its final finish, at the [[1992 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]], where he crossed the finish line 11th and last, four laps behind the winner. After the end of that race the team ran out of funds and collapsed. Middlebridge Group Limited had been unable to continue making repayments against the £6&amp;nbsp;million ultimately provided by Landhurst Leasing, which went into [[Administration order|administration]]. The [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]] investigated the case. Landhurst's managing directors were found guilty of corruption and imprisoned, having accepted bribes for further loans to Middlebridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landhurst&quot; /&gt; It was one of four teams to leave Formula One that year. (''cf'' [[March Engineering]], [[Fondmetal]] and [[Andrea Moda Formula]]). Although there was talk of reviving the team for the following year, its assets passed to Landhurst Leasing and were auctioned by the company's [[Administrative receivership|receivers]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (10 October 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the team's old factory in Chessington, which was acquired by Yamaha Motor Sports and used to house Activa Technology Limited, a company manufacturing composite components for race and road cars run by Herbie Blash. The factory was bought by the [[Carlin DPR]] [[GP2 Series|GP2]] motor racing team in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/55796|title= Carlin to enter GP2 in 2007|author= Glenn Freeman|date= 27 November 2006|work= Autosport.com|publisher= |accessdate=8 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential F1 revival (2010)===
On 4 June 2009, [[Franz Hilmer]] confirmed that he had used the name to lodge an entry for the 2010 Formula One season as a cost capped team under the new budget cap regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75798|title= Brabham name owner submits F1 entry|author= Jonathan Noble|date= 4 June 2009|work= Autosport.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brabham family was not involved and announced that it was seeking legal advice over the use of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75806|title= Brabham family seeking legal advice|author= Edd Straw|date= 4 June 2009|work= Autosport.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's entry was not accepted.

==Motor Racing Developments==

Brabham cars were also widely used by other teams, and not just in Formula One. Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac called the company they set up in 1961 to design and build [[formula racing]] cars to customer teams Motor Racing Developments (MRD), and this company had a large portfolio of other activities. Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50&amp;nbsp;percent of the shares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Law31&quot; /&gt; Tauranac was responsible for design and running the business, while Brabham was the test driver and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply and the use of the MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas to the design process and often machined parts and helped build the cars.&lt;ref&gt;Tauranac referred to this as Brabham's trade; they had first met at the small [[machine shop]] Brabham ran in Sydney in the early 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not directly involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry.&lt;ref&gt;To confuse the relationship between the two companies further, MRD was renamed Brabham Racing Developments between 1962 and 1964. Henry (1985) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car,&lt;ref&gt;Fearnley (May 2006) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested that he was no longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.

Despite only building its first car in 1961, by the mid-1960s MRD had overtaken established constructors like Cooper to become the largest manufacturer of single-seat racing cars in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Unique p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1970 had built over 500 cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;car numbers&quot;&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other Formula One teams which used Brabhams, [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]] and the [[Rob Walker Racing Team]] were the most successful. The [[1965 British Grand Prix]] saw seven Brabhams compete, only two of them from the works team, and there were usually four or five at championship Grands Prix throughout that season. The firm built scores of cars for the lower formulae each year, peaking with 89 cars in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;car numbers&quot; /&gt; Brabham had the reputation of providing customers with cars of a standard equal to those used by the works team, which worked &quot;[[wiktionary:out of the box|out of the box]]&quot;. The company provided a high degree of support to its customers—including Jack Brabham helping customers set up their cars. During this period the cars were usually known as &quot;Repco Brabhams&quot;, not because of the Repco engines used in Formula One between 1966 and 1968, but because of a smaller-scale sponsorship deal through which the Australian company had been providing parts to Jack Brabham since his Cooper days.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brabham BT40 of Tim Kuchel.jpg|thumb|left|The BT40 was the last [[Formula Two]] model from Brabham]]
At the end of 1971 Bernie Ecclestone bought MRD. He retained the Brabham brand, as did subsequent owners. Although the production of customer cars continued briefly under Bernie Ecclestone’s ownership, he believed the company needed to focus on Formula One to succeed. The last production customer Brabhams were the Formula Two BT40 and the Formula Three BT41 of 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Hodges (1990) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; although Ecclestone sold ex-works Formula One BT44Bs to [[RAM Racing]] as late as 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 156. Henry claims Ecclestone did this to ensure the team would focus on its troublesome new Alfa Romeo powered BT45s.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Ecclestone sold Motor Racing Developments to Alfa Romeo. The Formula One team did not compete that year, but Alfa Romeo put the company to use designing and building a prototype &quot;Procar&quot;—a racing car with the silhouette of a large saloon (the [[Alfa Romeo 164]]) covering a composite racing car chassis and mid mounted race engine. This was intended for a racing series for major manufacturers to support Formula One Grands Prix, and was designated the Brabham BT57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-mcdall.html|title= People: Allen McDonald|author= |date= |work= grandprix.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indycar===
Brabham cars competed at the [[Indianapolis 500]] from the mid 1960s to the early 1970s. After an abortive project in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; MRD was commissioned in 1964 to build an Indycar chassis powered by an American [[Offenhauser]] engine. The resultant BT12 chassis was raced by Jack Brabham as the &quot;Zink-Urschel Trackburner&quot; at the [[1964 Indianapolis 500|1964 event]] and retired with a fuel tank problem. The car was entered again in [[1966 Indianapolis 500|1966]], taking a third place for [[Jim McElreath]]. From 1968 to 1970, Brabham returned to Indianapolis, at first with a 4.2&amp;nbsp;litre version of the Repco V8 the team used in Formula One—with which [[Peter Revson]] finished fifth in 1969—before reverting to the Offenhauser engine for 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Brabham, Nye (2004) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The Brabham-Offenhauser combination was entered again in 1971 by [[Christopher J.C. Agajanian|J.C. Agajanian]], finishing fifth in the hands of [[Bill Vukovich II]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Although a Brabham car never won at Indianapolis, McElreath won four [[United States Automobile Club]] (USAC) races over 1965 and 1966 in the BT12. The &quot;Dean Van Lines Special&quot; in which [[Mario Andretti]] won the 1965 USAC national championship was a direct copy of this car, made with permission from Brabham by Andretti's crew chief Clint Brawner.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 57. Brawner repaired BT12 after a crash in 1964. As part of the deal he was allowed to make a copy of the then still unusual mid-engined design.&lt;/ref&gt; Revson took Brabham's final USAC race win in a BT25 in 1969, using the Repco engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrabIndy&quot;&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula Two===
In the 1960s and early 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often continued to compete in [[Formula Two]]. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a [[Honda]] engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races in the hands of the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.&lt;ref&gt;Unique p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula Three===
The first [[Formula Three]] Brabham, the BT9, won only four major races in 1964. The BT15 which followed in 1965 was a highly successful design. 58 cars were sold, which won 42 major races. Further developments of the same concept, including wings by the end of the decade, were highly competitive up until 1971. The BT38C of 1972 was Brabham's first production monocoque and the first not designed by Tauranac. Although 40 were ordered, it was less successful than its predecessors. The angular BT41 was the final Formula Three Brabham.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges (1998) pp. 34–39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports cars===
Tauranac did not enjoy designing sports cars and could only spare a small amount of his time from MRD's very successful single-seater business. Only 14 sports car models were built between 1961 and 1972, out of a total production of almost 600 chassis.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) pp. 205–207&lt;/ref&gt; The BT8A was the only one built in any numbers, and was quite successful in national level racing in the UK in 1964 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The design was &quot;stretched&quot; in 1966 to become the one-off BT17, originally fitted with the 4.3&amp;nbsp;litre version of the Repco engine for [[Can-Am]] racing. It was quickly abandoned by MRD after engine reliability problems became evident.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical innovation==
[[File:Brabham bt45.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Brabham BT45]] driven by [[José Carlos Pace]].]]
[[File:2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed Brabham BT46B Fan car.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The 1978 [[Brabham BT46|BT46B &quot;Fan car&quot;]] won its only race before being banned.]]
Brabham was considered a technically conservative team in the 1960s, chiefly because it persevered with traditional &quot;[[spaceframe]]&quot; cars long after Lotus introduced lighter, stiffer &quot;[[monocoque]]&quot; chassis to Formula One in 1962. Chief designer Tauranac reasoned that monocoques of the time were not usefully stiffer than well designed spaceframe chassis, and were harder to repair and less suitable for MRD’s customers.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; His &quot;old fashioned&quot; cars won the Brabham team the 1966 and 1967 championships, and were competitive in Formula One until rule changes forced a move to monocoques in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Nye (1986) p. 60. Brabham’s BT26As and Matra’s experimental four wheel drive MS84 of 1969 were the last cars with spaceframe chassis cars in F1. For 1970 the FIA mandated the use of &quot;bag tanks&quot; for fuel, which were to be carried inside box structures. This effectively forced the team to design a monocoque structure. From 1968 Brabham's Indycars were monocoques for the same reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the perceived conservatism, in 1963 Brabham was the first Formula One team to use a [[wind tunnel]] to hone their designs to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]] and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 39. The initial tests were carried out at the [[Motor Industry Research Association]] wind tunnel under the auspices of Malcolm Sayer, who had been responsible for the aerodynamics of the [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] [[Jaguar D-type|D-type]] Le Mans winning car.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly the most important factor in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic [[downforce]] to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the [[1968 Belgian Grand Prix]], Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's most fertile period of technical innovation came in the 1970s and 1980s when [[Gordon Murray]] became technical director. During 1976, the team introduced &quot;carbon-carbon [[Disc brake|brakes]]&quot; to Formula One, which promised reduced &quot;[[unsprung weight]]&quot; and better stopping performance due to carbon's greater [[coefficient of friction]]. The initial versions used [[reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon composite]] [[brake pads]] and a [[steel]] disc faced with carbon &quot;pucks&quot;. The technology was not reliable at first; in 1976, Carlos Pace crashed at {{convert|180|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at the [[Österreichring]] circuit after heat build-up in the brakes boiled the [[brake fluid]], leaving him with no way of stopping the car.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979, Brabham had developed an effective carbon-carbon braking system, combining structural carbon discs with carbon brake pads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carbon Fibre&quot;&gt;Howard (June 2006) p. 52. Interview with Gordon Murray and [[John Barnard]] on the early uses of Carbon Fibre in Formula One for brakes and chassis structure.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, carbon brakes were used by all competitors in almost all top level motor sports.

Although Brabham experimented with airdams and underbody skirts in the mid 1970s, the team, like the rest of the field, did not immediately understand Lotus' development of a [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] car in 1977. The [[Brabham BT46|Brabham BT46B]] &quot;Fan car&quot; of 1978, generated enormous downforce with a fan, which sucked air from beneath the car, although its claimed use was for engine cooling. The car only raced once in the Formula One World Championship—[[Niki Lauda]] winning the [[1978 Swedish Grand Prix]]—before a [[wiktionary:loophole|loophole]] in the regulations was closed by the FIA.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 186–187. It is often claimed that the car was never banned, but rather withdrawn by Ecclestone. Ecclestone did agree to withdraw it after three races, but the FIA changed the regulations to render &quot;fan cars&quot; in general, not the BT46B in particular, illegal before it could race again.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in 1979 Murray was the first to use lightweight &quot;[[Carbon fibre reinforced plastic|carbon fibre composite]]&quot; panels to stiffen Brabham's [[aluminium|aluminium alloy]] monocoques, he echoed his predecessor Tauranac in being the last to switch to the new fully composite monocoques. Murray was reluctant to build the entire chassis from composite materials until he understood their behaviour in a crash, an understanding achieved in part through an instrumented [[crash test]] of a BT49 chassis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carbon Fibre&quot; /&gt; The team did not follow McLaren's 1981 MP4/1 with their own fully composite chassis until the &quot;lowline&quot; BT55 in 1986,&lt;ref name=&quot;AZBrabham&quot;&gt;Hodges (1998) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; the last team to do so. This technology is now used in all top level single seater racing cars.

For the 1981 season the FIA introduced a {{convert|6|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} minimum [[ride height]] for the cars, intended to slow them in corners by limiting the downforce created by aerodynamic ground effect. Gordon Murray devised a &quot;[[hydropneumatic suspension]]&quot; system for the BT49C, which allowed the car to settle to a much lower ride height at speed. Brabham were accused of cheating by other teams, although Murray believes that the system met the letter of the regulations. No action was taken against the team and others soon produced systems with similar effects.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) pp. 223–225&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1982 British Grand Prix]], Brabham reintroduced the idea of re-fuelling and changing the car's tyres during the race, unseen since the [[1957 Formula One season]], to allow their drivers to sprint away at the start of races on a light fuel load and soft tyres. After studying techniques used at the [[Indianapolis 500]] and in [[NASCAR]] racing in the United States, the team were able to refuel and re-tyre the car in 14 seconds in tests ahead of the race. In 1982 Murray felt the tactic did little more than &quot;get our sponsors noticed at races we had no chance of winning&quot;, but in 1983 the team made good use of the tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (ed.) (1983) pp. 63–72 ''Pitstops: A split-second spectacle'' feature by [[Denis Jenkinson]].&lt;/ref&gt; Refuelling was banned for 1984, and did not reappear until the [[1994 Formula One season|1994 season]] (until it was banned again in [[2010 Formula One season|2010]] as a part of cost cutting measures), but tyre changes have remained part of Formula One. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Maurice|title=Ayrton Senna would applaud formula one's 2010 rebirth|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2009/may/03/formula-one-2010-refuelling-ayrton-senna|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The fan car and hydropneumatic suspension exploited loopholes in the sporting regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham was accused of going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver [[Jacques Laffite]] was among those to claim that the cars were fitted with heavily ballasted [[Coachwork|bodywork]] before being weighed at [[scrutineer]]ing. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978, Ecclestone was president of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]] (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months.&lt;ref&gt;Henry (1985) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the drivers' championship by Piquet, protested that the [[Octane rating|Research Octane Number]] (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.&lt;ref&gt;Drackett (1985) p. 133. Although &quot;protested&quot;, as used by Drackett, implies a formal protest, he does not specify this, and Henry (1985) p. 267 says &quot;no action was ever taken&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress''' was a four-engine [[heavy bomber]] aircraft developed in the 1930s for the then-[[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC). Competing against [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] for a contract to build 200 bombers, the [[Boeing]] entry outperformed both competitors and more than met the Air Corps' expectations. Although Boeing lost the contract because the prototype crashed, the Air Corps was so impressed with Boeing's design that they ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation. From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous [[B-17 Flying Fortress variants|design advances]].  

The B-17 was primarily employed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) in the daylight precision [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign of World War&amp;nbsp;II]] against German industrial and military targets. The United States [[Eighth Air Force]] based at Thorpe Abbotts airfield in England and the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] based in Italy complemented the [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s nighttime area bombing in [[Operation Pointblank]] to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Pointblank&quot;/&gt; The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|War in the Pacific]] where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields.

From its pre-war inception, the USAAC (later USAAF) touted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a potent, high-flying, long-range bomber that was able to defend itself, and to return home despite extensive battle damage&lt;!--might need some links--&gt;. It quickly took on mythic proportions,&lt;ref name=&quot;Manual&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The B-17's incredible capacity to take it, to come flying home on three, two, even one engine, sieve-like with flak and bullet holes, with large sections of wing or tail surfaces shot away-has been so widely publicized that U. S. fighting men could afford to [http://www.stelzriede.com/ms/photos/joke.jpg joke about it]&quot; and &quot;one important fact stands clear-cut now. The Flying Fortress is a [http://www.stelzriede.com/ms/photos/joke2.jpg rugged airplane].|group=N}}&lt;ref name=&quot;browne&quot;/&gt; and widely circulated stories and photos of B-17s surviving battle damage increased its iconic status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot;/&gt; With a [[service ceiling]] greater than any of its Allied contemporaries, the B-17 established itself as an effective weapons system, dropping more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War&amp;nbsp;II. Of the {{Nowrap|1.5 million [[metric ton]]s}} of bombs dropped on Germany by U.S. aircraft, 640,000&amp;nbsp;tons were dropped from B-17s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p46&quot;/&gt;

==Development==

[[File:Boeing XB-17 (Model 299) nose turret with gun.jpg|right|thumb|Nose turret with gun fitted to the prototype]]

On 8 August 1934, the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) tendered a proposal for a multi-engined bomber to replace the [[Martin B-10]]. The Air Corps were looking for a bomber capable of reinforcing the air forces in Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate.p164&quot;/&gt; Requirements were that it would carry a &quot;useful bombload&quot; at an altitude of {{convert|10000|ft|km|0}} for 10 hours with a top speed of at least {{convert|200|mph|km/h|-1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Mil p74&quot;/&gt; They also desired, but did not require, a range of {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} and a speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h}}. The competition for the Air Corps contract would be decided by a &quot;fly-off&quot; between Boeing's design, the [[Douglas B-18 Bolo|Douglas DB-1]] and the [[Martin Model 146]] at [[Wright Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]].

The prototype B-17, designated Model 299, was designed by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and [[Edward Curtis Wells]] and built at [[Boeing]]'s own expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p41&quot;/&gt; It combined features of the experimental [[Boeing XB-15]] bomber with the [[Boeing 247]] transport airplane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Mil p74&quot;/&gt; The B-17's armament consisted of up to {{convert|4800|lb|kg}} of bombs on two racks in the bomb bay behind the cockpit, and five {{convert|0.30|in|mm|2}} [[machine gun]]s, and it was powered by four [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690]] &quot;Hornet&quot; radial engines each producing {{convert|750|hp|kW|-2}} at {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p291-2&quot;/&gt; The first flight of the Model 299 was on {{Nowrap|28 July}} 1935, with Boeing chief test-pilot Leslie Tower at the controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;first flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sal.p46&quot;/&gt; Richard Williams, a reporter for the [[The Seattle Times|''Seattle Times'']] coined the name &quot;Flying Fortress&quot; when the Model 299 was rolled out, bristling with multiple machine gun installations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p12&quot;/&gt; Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use. On {{Nowrap|20 August 1935}}, the prototype flew from [[Seattle]] to Wright Field in nine hours and three minutes at an average cruising speed of {{convert|252|mph|km/h}}, much faster than the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes.299Record&quot;/&gt;

At the fly-off, the four-engine Boeing's performance was superior to those of the twin-engine DB-1 and Model 146. Then-[[Major General]] [[Frank Maxwell Andrews]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps#GHQ Air Force|GHQ Air Force]] believed that the long-range capabilities of four-engine large aircraft were more efficient than shorter-ranged twin-engined airplanes, and that the B-17 was better suited to their doctrine.&lt;ref name =&quot;Zamzow.33&quot;/&gt; His opinions were shared by the Air Corps procurement officers, and even before the competition had finished they suggested buying 65 B-17s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate 165&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Zamzow.34&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Boeing Model 299 crash.jpg|thumb|left|Crashed Model 299]]

Development continued on the Boeing Model 299, and on {{Nowrap|30 October}} 1935, Army Air Corps test-pilot Major [[Ployer Peter Hill]] and Boeing employee Les Tower took the Model 299 on a second evaluation flight; however, the crew forgot to disengage the airplane's &quot;gust lock,&quot; a device that held the bomber's movable control surfaces in place while the aircraft was parked on the ground. Having taken off, the aircraft entered a steep climb, stalled, nosed over and crashed, killing Hill and Tower (other observers survived with injuries).&lt;ref name=&quot;Museum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Checks&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|On board the plane were pilots [[Major]] Ployer P.

Regardless, the USAAC had been impressed by the prototype's performance, and on {{Nowrap|17 January}} 1936, through a legal loophole,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger&quot;/&gt; the Air Corps ordered 13 YB-17s (designated Y1B-17 after November 1936 to denote its special F-1 funding) for service testing.&lt;ref name =&quot;Zamzow.34&quot;/&gt; The YB-17 incorporated a number of significant changes from the Model 299, including more powerful [[Wright R-1820]]-39 Cyclone engines replacing the original Pratt &amp; Whitneys. Although the prototype was company-owned and never received a military serial (the B-17 designation itself did not appear officially until January 1936, nearly three months after the prototype crashed),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers1976.p12&quot;/&gt; the term &quot;XB-17&quot; was retroactively applied to the airframe and has entered the lexicon to describe the first Flying Fortress.

Between 1 March and 4 August 1937, 12 of the 13 Y1B-17s were delivered to the 2nd Bombardment Group at [[Langley Field]] in Virginia for operational development and flight tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Mil p75&quot;/&gt; One suggestion adopted was the use of a [[checklist]] to avoid accidents such as that which befell the Model 299.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Checks2&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The idea of a pilot's checklist spread to other crew members, other Air Corps aircraft types, and eventually throughout the aviation world.|group=N}} In one of their first missions, three B-17s, directed by lead navigator [[Lieutenant]] [[Curtis LeMay]], were sent by General Andrews to [[Interception of the Rex|&quot;intercept&quot; and photograph the Italian ocean liner ''Rex'']] {{convert|610|mi|km}} off the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name =&quot;Zamzow.47&quot;/&gt; The mission was successful and widely publicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USAF Rex&quot;/&gt; The 13th Y1B-17 was delivered to the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio, to be used for flight testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y1B-17&quot;/&gt;

A 14th Y1B-17 (''37-369''), originally constructed for ground testing of the airframe's strength, was upgraded and fitted with exhaust-driven turbochargers. Scheduled to fly in 1937, it encountered problems with the turbochargers, and its first flight was delayed until {{Nowrap|29 April}} 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald&quot;/&gt; The aircraft was delivered to the Army on {{Nowrap|31 January}} 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p293-4&quot;/&gt; Once service testing was complete, the Y1B-17s and Y1B-17A were redesignated B-17 and B-17A respectively to signify the change to operational status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wixley p23&quot;/&gt;

Opposition to the Air Corps' ambitions for the acquisition of more B-17s faded, and in late 1937, 10 more aircraft designated B-17B were ordered to equip two bombardment groups, one on each U.S. coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-17B&quot;/&gt; Improved with larger flaps, rudder and [[Acrylic glass|Plexiglas]] nose, the B-17Bs were delivered in five small batches between July 1939 and March 1940. In July 1940, a significant order for 512 B-17s was issued;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop1&quot;/&gt; however, prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], fewer than 200 B-17s were in service with the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger&quot;/&gt; A total of 155 B-17s of all variants were delivered between {{Nowrap|11 January}} 1937 and {{Nowrap|30 November}} 1941, but production quickly accelerated with the B-17 eventually setting the record for achieving the highest production rate for large aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling.p55&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;At the peak of production, Boeing was rolling out as many as 363 B-17s a month, averaging between 14 and 16 Forts a day, the most incredible production rate for large aircraft in aviation history.&quot; |group=N}}The aircraft went on to serve in every [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] combat zone, and by the time production ended in May 1945, 12,731 aircraft had been built by Boeing, [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], and [[Vega Aircraft Corporation|Vega]] (a subsidiary of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p6&quot;/&gt;

The B-17 went through several alterations in each of its design stages and variants. Of the 13 YB-17s ordered for service testing, 12 were used by the 2nd Bomb Group of Langley Field, Virginia, to develop heavy bombing techniques, and the 13th was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y1B-17&quot;/&gt; Experiments on this aircraft led to the use of a turbo-supercharger which would become standard on the B-17 line. A 14th aircraft, the YB-17A, originally destined for ground testing only and upgraded with the turbocharger,&lt;ref name =&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt; was re-designated B-17A after testing had finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p293-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wixley p23&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Boeing XB-17 blister turret.jpg|thumb|left|Blister turret of Model 299, not adopted for production]]

As the production line developed, Boeing engineers continued to improve upon the basic design. To enhance performance at slower speeds, the B-17B was altered to include larger [[rudder]] and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers boeing p294&quot;/&gt; The B-17C changed from gun blisters to flush, oval-shaped windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p295&quot;/&gt; Models ''A'' through ''D'' of the B-17 were designed defensively, while the B-17E was the first model primarily focused on offensive warfare.&lt;ref name =&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt; The B-17E was an extensive revision of the design; the fuselage was extended by {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a much larger vertical fin and rudder were incorporated into the original design, and a gunner's position in the tail as well as an improved nose were added, resulting in a 20% increase in aircraft weight.&lt;ref name =&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt; The engines were upgraded to more powerful versions multiple times throughout its production, and similarly, the gun stations were altered on numerous occasions to enhance their effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p56-7&quot;/&gt;

[[File:B-17G Nose in Detail.jpg|upright|thumb|left|B-17G nose detail]]

By the time the definitive B-17G appeared, the number of guns had been increased from seven to 13, the designs of the gun stations were finalized, and other adjustments were complete. The B-17G was the final version of the B-17, incorporating all changes made to its predecessor, the B-17F,&lt;ref name =&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt; and in total 8,680 were built,&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p63-4&quot;/&gt; the last one (by Lockheed) on {{Nowrap|July 28}} 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon Lock p211&quot;/&gt; Many B-17Gs were converted for other missions such as cargo hauling, engine testing and [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p286-7&quot;/&gt; Initially designated SB-17G, a number of B-17Gs were also converted for search-and-rescue duties, later to be redesignated B-17H.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p303-4&quot;/&gt;

Two versions of the B-17 were flown under different designations, the [[XB-38 Flying Fortress]] and the [[YB-40 Flying Fortress]]. The XB-38 was an engine test-bed for [[Allison V-1710]] liquid-cooled engines, should the Wright engines normally used on the B-17 become unavailable. The only prototype XB-38 to fly crashed on its ninth flight and the type was abandoned, the V-1710 being kept for fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon Lock p213-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p66&quot;/&gt; The YB-40 was a heavily armed modification of the standard B-17 used before the [[P-51 Mustang]], an effective long-range fighter, became available to act as escort. Additional armament included an additional dorsal turret in the radio room, a chin turret (which became standard with the B-17G) and twin {{convert|.50|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} guns in the waist positions. The ammunition load was over 11,000 rounds, making the YB-40 well over {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than a fully loaded B-17F. The YB-40s with their numerous heavy modifications had trouble keeping up with the lighter bombers once they had dropped their bombs, and so the project was abandoned and finally phased out in July 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF 62-3,5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon Lock p212&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p307-8&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Boeing SB-17G.jpg|thumb|SB-17G-95DL ''44-83722''&lt;br /&gt; assigned to the 2nd ERS as a Search and Rescue aircraft]]

Late in World War&amp;nbsp;II, at least 25 B-17s were fitted with radio controls and television cameras, loaded with {{convert|20000|lb|abbr=on}} of high-explosives and dubbed BQ-7 &quot;Aphrodite missiles&quot; for [[Operation Aphrodite]]. The operation, which involved remotely flying Aphrodite drones onto their targets by accompanying CQ-17 &quot;mothership&quot; control aircraft, was approved on {{nowrap|June 26}}, 1944, and assigned the [[388th Bombardment Group]] stationed at [[RAF Fersfield]], a satellite of [[RAF Knettishall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsey&quot;/&gt; The first four drones were sent to [[Mimoyecques]], [[Siracourt]], [[Watten, Nord|Watten]] and [[Wizernes]] on August 4, causing little damage. The project came to a sudden end with the unexplained mid-air explosion over the [[River Blyth, Suffolk|Blyth]] estuary of a [[B-24 Liberator]], part of the [[United States Navy]]'s contribution as &quot;Project Anvil&quot;, en route for [[Heligoland]] piloted by Lieutenant [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]], future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]'s elder brother. Blast damage was caused over a radius of {{convert|5|mi}}. British authorities were anxious that no similar accidents should again occur, and the Aphrodite project was scrapped in early 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsey&quot;&gt;Ramsey, Winston G. ''The V-Weapons''. London, United Kingdom: ''After the Battle'', Number 6, 1974, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The B-17 began operations in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] with the RAF in 1941, and the USAAF [[Eighth Air Force]] and [[Fifteenth Air Force]] units in 1942. It was primarily involved in the daylight precision [[strategic bombing]] campaign against German industrial targets. In [[Operation Pointblank|the campaign against German aircraft forces]] in preparation for the invasion of France, B-17 (and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]]) raids were directed against German aircraft production while their presence drew the ''Luftwaffe'' fighters into battle with Allied fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Pointblank&quot;/&gt;

Early models proved to be unsuitable for combat use over Europe and it was the  B-17E that was first successfully used by the USAAF. The defense expected from bombers operating in close formation alone did not prove effective and the bombers needed fighter escorts to operate successfully.

During World War II, the B-17 equipped 32 overseas combat groups, inventory peaking in August 1944 at 4,574 USAAF aircraft worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher Squads&quot;/&gt; B-17s dropped {{convert|640036|short ton|metric ton|lk=in}} of bombs on European targets (compared to {{convert|452508|short ton|metric ton|abbr=on}} dropped by the Liberator and {{convert|463544|short ton|metric ton|abbr=on}} dropped by all other U.S. aircraft).{{Clarify|is this a summary of data further on in this section? should it have a reference here?|date=June 2010}} The British heavy bombers, the [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]], dropped 608,612 and 224,207&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafbramptonwytonhenlow/aboutus/handleypagehalifax.cfm |work=The Pathfinder Museum |title=Handley Page Halifax |publisher=raf.mod.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; long tons respectively.

===The RAF===
[[File:B-17C with RAF colors.jpg|right|thumb|RAF Fortress B.I ''AN529''.]]
The [[Royal Air Force]] entered World War&amp;nbsp;II with no heavy bomber of its own in service; the biggest available were long-range medium bombers such as the [[Vickers Wellington]] which could carry up to 4,500&amp;nbsp;lb of bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews &amp; Morgan p340&quot;/&gt; While the [[Short Stirling]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]] would become its primary bombers by 1941, in early 1940 the RAF entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army Air Corps to be provided with 20 B-17Cs, which were [[British military aircraft designation systems|given the service name]] Fortress I. Their first operation, against [[Wilhelmshaven]] on {{Nowrap|8 July}} 1941 was unsuccessful;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chant&quot;/&gt; on {{Nowrap|24 July}}, the target was [[Brest, France]], but again the bombers missed completely.

By September, after the RAF had lost eight B-17Cs in combat or to accidents and many instances of aborts due to mechanical problems, [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] abandoned daylight bombing raids because of the Fortress I's poor performance. The experience showed both the RAF and USAAF that the B-17C was not ready for combat, and that improved defenses, larger bomb loads and more accurate bombing methods were required. However the USAAF continued using the B-17 as a &quot;day&quot; bomber, despite pleas from the RAF that attempted daylight bombing would be ineffective.&lt;ref name =&quot;Weigley.338&quot;/&gt;

As usage by Bomber Command had been curtailed, the RAF transferred its remaining Fortress&amp;nbsp;I aircraft to [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] for use as a long-range maritime patrol aircraft instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stitt 1&quot;/&gt; These were later augmented in August 1942 by 19 Fortress Mk II (B-17F) and 45 Fortress Mk IIA (B-17E). A Fortress from [[No. 206 Squadron RAF]] sank [[U-627]] on {{Nowrap|27 October}} 1942, the first of 11 U-boat kills credited to RAF Fortress bombers during the war.&lt;ref name =&quot;Wynn.93&quot;/&gt; [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|No. 223 Squadron]], as part of [[No. 100 Group RAF|100 Group]] operated a small number of Fortresses in support of the bombing offensive for jamming German radar.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF&quot;/&gt;

===Initial USAAF operations over Europe===
The Air Corps (renamed [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on June 20, 1941), using the B-17 and other bombers, bombed from high altitudes using the then-secret [[Norden bombsight]], which was an optical electro-mechanical gyro-stabilized [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Paul. ''Ludington Daily News''. 16 April 1994, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The device was able to determine, from variables input by the bombardier, the point at which the aircraft's bombs should be released to hit the target. The bombardier essentially took over flight control of the aircraft during the bomb run, maintaining a level altitude during the final moments before release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher B-17B&quot;/&gt;

The USAAF began building up its air forces in Europe using B-17Es soon after entering the war. The first [[Eighth Air Force]] units arrived in [[High Wycombe, England]], on {{Nowrap|12 May}} 1942, to form the 97th Bomb Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northstar&quot;/&gt; On {{Nowrap|17 August}} 1942, 12 B-17Es of the 97th, with the lead aircraft piloted by Major [[Paul Tibbets]] and carrying [[Brigadier General]] [[Ira Eaker]] as an observer, were escorted by RAF [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] on the first USAAF raid over Europe, against railroad [[Classification yard|marshalling yards]] at [[Rouen]]-Sotteville in France, while a further six aircraft flew a diversionary raid along the French coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p59-0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAF combat&quot;/&gt; The operation was a success, with only minor damage to two aircraft.

As the raids of the American bombing campaign grew in numbers and frequency, German interception efforts arose to respond to the bombers (such as during the attempted bombing of Kiel on 13 June 1943&lt;ref name =&quot;Bowman.7&quot;/&gt;) to the level where unescorted bombing missions became discouraged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley 339&quot;/&gt;

===Combined offensive===
[[File:B-17F Radar Bombing over Germany 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Boeing B-17F [[radar]] bombing through clouds: [[Bremen]], Germany, on {{Nowrap|13 November}} 1943.]]

The two different strategies of the American and British bomber commands were organized at the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943. The resulting &quot;[[Combined Bomber Offensive]]&quot; would weaken the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', destroy German morale and establish air superiority through [[Operation Pointblank]]'s destruction of German fighter strength in preparation of a ground offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Pointblank&quot;/&gt; The USAAF bombers would attack by day, with British operations – chiefly against industrial cities – by night.

Operation Pointblank opened with attacks on targets in Western Europe. General [[Ira C. Eaker]] and the Eighth Air Force placed highest priority on attacks on the German aircraft industry, especially fighter assembly plants, engine factories and ball-bearing manufacturers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Pointblank&quot;/&gt; Attacks began in April 1943 on heavily fortified key industrial plants in [[Bremen]] and [[Recklinghausen]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Bowman.8&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:B-17F formation over Schweinfurt, Germany, August 17, 1943.jpg|right|thumb|B-17F formation over [[Schweinfurt]], Germany, {{Nowrap|17 August}} 1943]]

Since the airfield bombings were not appreciably reducing German fighter strength, additional B-17 groups were formed, and Eaker ordered major missions deeper into Germany against important industrial targets. The 8th Air Force then targeted the ball-bearing factories in [[Schweinfurt]], hoping to cripple the war effort there. The [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission|first raid]] on {{Nowrap|17 August}} 1943 did not result in critical damage to the factories, with the 230 attacking B-17s being intercepted by an estimated 300 ''Luftwaffe'' fighters. The Germans shot down 36 aircraft with the loss of 200 men, and coupled with a raid earlier in the day against [[Regensburg]], a total of 60 B-17s were lost that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.pp59-60&quot;/&gt;

A second attempt on Schweinfurt on 14 October 1943 would later come to be known as &quot;[[Second Raid on Schweinfurt|Black Thursday]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hess.pp65-67/&gt; While the attack was successful at disrupting the entire works, severely curtailing work there for the remainder of the war, it was at an extreme cost.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bowman.22&quot;/&gt; Of the 291 attacking Fortresses, 60 were shot down over Germany, five crashed on approach to Britain, and 12 more were scrapped due to damage&amp;nbsp;– a total loss of 77 B-17s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; One hundred and twenty-two bombers were damaged and needed repairs before their next flight. Out of 2,900 men in the crews, about 650 men did not return, although some survived as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Only 33 bombers landed without damage. These losses were a result of concentrated attacks by over 300 German fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.p64&quot;/&gt;

[[File:B-17G formation on bomb run.jpg|left|thumb|B-17G of the 384th Bomb Group on the bomb run]]

Such high losses of air crews could not be sustained, and the USAAF, recognizing the vulnerability of heavy bombers to interceptors when operating alone, suspended daylight bomber raids deep into Germany until the development of an escort fighter that could protect the bombers all the way from the United Kingdom to Germany and back. At the same time, the German night fighting ability noticeably improved to counter the nighttime strikes, challenging the conventional faith in the cover of darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.341&quot;/&gt; The [[Eighth Air Force]] alone lost 176 bombers in October 1943,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.p67&quot;/&gt; and was to suffer similar casualties on {{Nowrap|11 January}} 1944 on missions to [[Oschersleben]], [[Halberstadt]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]. [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], commander of the Eighth, had ordered the second Schweinfurt mission to be cancelled as the weather deteriorated, but the lead units had already entered hostile air space and continued with the mission. Most of the escorts turned back or missed the rendezvous, and as a result 60 B-17s were destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.69-71&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;W.151&quot;/&gt; A third raid on Schweinfurt on {{Nowrap|24 February}} 1944 highlighted what came to be known as &quot;[[Big Week]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.340-1&quot;/&gt; during which the bombing missions were directed against German aircraft production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.341&quot;/&gt; German fighters would have to respond, and the [[North American P-51 Mustang]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighters (equipped with improved [[drop tank]]s to extend their range) accompanying the American heavies all the way to and from the targets would engage them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.342&quot;/&gt; The escort fighters reduced the loss rate to below seven percent, with only 247 B-17s lost in 3,500 [[sortie]]s while taking part in the Big Week raids.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;W.162&quot;/&gt;

By September 1944, 27 of the 40 bomb groups of the Eighth Air Force and six of the 21 groups of the Fifteenth Air Force used B-17s. Losses to [[flak]] continued to take a high toll of heavy bombers through 1944, but by {{Nowrap|27 April}} 1945 (two days after the last heavy bombing mission in Europe), the rate of aircraft loss was so low that replacement aircraft were no longer arriving and the number of bombers per bomb group was reduced. The Combined Bomber Offensive was effectively complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAAF.04-45&quot;/&gt;

Richards' B-17C, AAF S/N ''40-2049'', reported that he thought the U.S. Navy was giving the flight a 21-gun salute to celebrate the arrival of the bombers, after which he realized that Pearl Harbor was under attack. The Fortress came under fire from Japanese fighter aircraft, though the crew was unharmed with the exception of one member who suffered an abrasion on his hand. Enemy activity forced an abort from [[Hickam Field]] to [[Bellows Field]], where the aircraft overran the runway and into a ditch where it was then strafed. Although initially deemed repairable, ''40-2049'' (11th BG / 38th RS) received more than 200 bullet holes and never flew again. Ten of the 12 Fortresses survived the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&amp;K.2&quot;/&gt;

By 1941, the [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF) based at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] in the Philippines had 35 B-17s, with the War Department eventually planning to raise that to 165.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody p55-6&quot;/&gt; When the FEAF received word of the attack on Pearl Harbor, [[General]] [[Lewis H. Brereton]] sent his bombers and fighters on various patrol missions to prevent them from being caught on the ground. Brereton planned B-17 raids on Japanese air fields in [[Taiwan|Formosa]], in accordance with [[Rainbow 5]] war plan directives, but this was overruled by General [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloody p163&quot;/&gt; A series of [[Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)#Far East Air Force controversy|disputed discussions and decisions]], followed by several confusing and false reports of air attacks, delayed the authorization of the sortie. By the time the B-17s and escorting [[Curtiss P-40]] fighters were about to get airborne, they were destroyed by Japanese bombers of the [[11th Air Fleet (Japan)|11th Air Fleet]]. The FEAF lost half its aircraft during the first strike,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloody p166-7&quot;/&gt; and was all but destroyed over the next few days.

Another early World War II Pacific engagement on {{Nowrap|10 December}} 1941 involved [[Colin Kelly]] who reportedly crashed his B-17 into the [[Japanese battleship Haruna|Japanese battleship ''Haruna'']], which was later acknowledged as a near bomb miss on the [[Japanese cruiser Ashigara|heavy cruiser ''Ashigara'']]. Nonetheless, this deed made him a celebrated [[war hero]]. Kelly's B-17C AAF S/N ''40-2045'' (19th BG / 30th BS) crashed about {{convert|6|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} from Clark Field after he held the burning Fortress steady long enough for the surviving crew to bail out. Kelly was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sal.p64&quot;/&gt;
Noted Japanese ace [[Saburo Sakai]] is credited with this kill, and in the process, gained respect for the ability of the Fortress to absorb punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakai&quot;/&gt;

[[File:B17jp.jpg|right|thumb|B-17D captured by Japanese army, with marks of Hinomaru]]

B-17s were used in early battles of the Pacific with little success, notably the [[Battle of Coral Sea]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p96&quot;/&gt; and [[Battle of Midway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sword p180,329&quot;/&gt; While there, the [[Fifth Air Force]] B-17s were tasked with disrupting the Japanese sea lanes. Air Corps doctrine dictated bombing runs from high altitude, but it was soon discovered that only one percent of their bombs hit targets. However, B-17s were operating at heights too great for most [[A6M Zero]] fighters to reach, and the B-17's heavy gun armament was easily more than a match for lightly protected Japanese planes.

On March 2, 1943, six B-17s of the 64th Squadron attacked a major Japanese troop convoy from {{convert|10000|ft|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} during the early stages of the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], off [[New Guinea]], using [[skip bombing]] to sink three merchant ships including the ''Kyokusei Maru''. A B-17 was shot down by a [[New Britain]]-based [[A6M Zero]], whose pilot then machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members as they descended in parachutes and attacked others in the water after they landed.&lt;ref name=&quot;awm&quot;/&gt; Later, 13 B-17s bombed the convoy from medium altitude, causing the ships to disperse and prolonging the journey. The convoy was subsequently all but destroyed by a combination of low level strafing runs by [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighters]], and skip bombing by USAAF [[North American B-25 Mitchell]]s at {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}}, while B-17s claimed five hits from higher altitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisbee&quot;/&gt;

A peak of 168 B-17 bombers were in the Pacific theater in September 1942, with all groups converting to other types by mid-1943.

===Bomber defense===
[[File:Bomber stream.jpg|thumb|right|Part of a USAAF stream of over 1,000 B-17s]]
[[File:B-17 Schweinfurt.jpg|thumb|right|Formation flying through dense [[flak]] over [[Merseburg]], Germany]]

Before the advent of long-range [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] escorts, B-17s had only their [[.50 BMG|{{convert|.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}]] [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s to rely on for defense during the bombing runs over Europe. As the war intensified, Boeing used feedback from aircrews to improve each new variant with increased armament and armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boeing&quot;/&gt; The number of defensive guns increased from four {{convert|0.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns and one {{convert|0.30|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} nose machine gun in the B-17C, to thirteen {{convert|0.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns in the B-17G. But because the bombers could not [[air combat manoeuvring|maneuver]] when attacked by fighters, and during their final bomb run they needed to be flown straight and level, individual aircraft struggled to fend off a direct attack.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-657-6304-24, Luftwaffe, Modelle eines Bombers und Jägers.jpg|thumb|left|German training model on how to attack a ''fliegendes Stachelschwein'']]

A 1943 survey by the Air Corps found that over half the bombers shot down by the Germans had left the protection of the main formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-17.de 2&quot;/&gt; To address this problem, the United States developed the bomb-group formation, which evolved into the staggered [[combat box]] formation where all the B-17s could safely cover any others in their formation with their machine guns, making a formation of the bombers a dangerous target to engage by enemy fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manual 2&quot;/&gt; ''Luftwaffe'' &quot;''jagdflieger''&quot; (fighter pilots) likened attacking a B-17 combat box formation to encountering a ''fliegendes stachelschwein'', or &quot;flying porcupine&quot;. However, the use of this rigid formation meant that individual aircraft could not engage in evasive maneuvers: they had to always fly in a straight line, which made them vulnerable to the German [[flak]]. Additionally, German fighter aircraft later used the tactic of high-speed strafing passes rather than engaging with individual aircraft to inflict damage with minimum risk.

As a result, the B-17s' loss rate was up to 25% on some early missions (60 of 291 B-17s were lost in combat on the second [[Raid on Schweinfurt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Caidin&quot;/&gt;), and it was not until the advent of long-range fighter escorts (particularly the [[North American P-51 Mustang]]) resulting in the degradation of the ''Luftwaffe'' as an effective interceptor force between February and June 1944, that the B-17 became strategically potent.

The B-17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage, still reach its target and bring its crew home safely. Wally Hoffman, a B-17 pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War&amp;nbsp;II, said, &quot;The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; [[Martin Caidin]] reported one instance in which a B-17 suffered a mid-air collision with a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], losing an engine and suffering serious damage to both the starboard horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, and being knocked out of formation by the impact. The airplane was reported as shot down by observers, but it survived and brought its crew home without injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caidin.p86&quot;/&gt; Its toughness more than compensated for its shorter range and lighter bomb load when compared to the Consolidated [[B-24 Liberator]] or the British [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers.{{Clarify|is this statement backed by the ref for the following sentence?|date=June 2010}} Stories abound of B-17s returning to base with tails having been destroyed, with only a single engine functioning or even with large portions of wings having been damaged by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DurableB-17Colorado&quot;/&gt; This durability, together with the large operational numbers in the [[Eighth Air Force]] and the fame achieved by the &quot;[[Memphis Belle (B-17)|Memphis Belle]]&quot;, made the B-17 a significant bomber aircraft of the war. Other factors such as combat effectiveness and political issues also contributed to the B-17's success.&lt;ref name=&quot;B17vB24&quot;/&gt;

The B-17 design went through eight major changes over the course of its production, culminating in the B-17G, differing from its immediate predecessor by the addition of a chin [[gun turret|turret]] with two {{convert|.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} caliber [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s under the nose. This eliminated the B-17's main defensive weakness in head-on attacks.

===The Luftwaffe===
[[File:B-17-battle-casualty1.gif|right|thumb|A severely damaged B-17 continues to fly after an attacking [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109 fighter]] collided with the aircraft.]]

After examining wrecked B-17s and B-24s, ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' officers discovered that on average it took around 20 hits with [[MG 151 cannon|{{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] shells fired from the rear to bring them down.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; Pilots of average ability hit the bombers with only about two percent of the rounds they fired, so to obtain 20 hits, the average pilot had to fire one thousand {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} rounds at a bomber.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; Early versions of the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]], one of the best German interceptor fighters, were equipped with two {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]] cannons, which carried only 500 rounds, and later with the better [[MG 151 cannon|Mauser MG 151/20]] cannons, which had a longer effective range than the MG FF weapon. The German fighters found that when attacking from the front, where fewer defensive guns were pointed, it only took four or five hits to bring a bomber down.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; To address the Fw 190's shortcomings, the number of cannons fitted was doubled to four with a corresponding increase in the amount of ammunition carried, and in 1944, a further upgrade to [[Rheinmetall]]-[[Borsig]]'s {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[MK 108 cannon]]s was made, which could bring a bomber down in just a few hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt;

[[File:B-17F Destroyed by Me-262.jpg|thumb|left|B-17G-15-BO &quot;Wee Willie&quot;, 322d BS, 91st BG, after direct flak hit on her 128th mission.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1976, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

The adoption of the [[Nebelwerfer#Air-to-air adaptation (Werfer-Granate 21 rocket)|''Werfer-Granate 21'']] (Wfr. Gr. 21) rocket mortar by the ''Luftwaffe'' in mid-August 1943 promised the introduction of a major &quot;stand-off&quot; style of offensive weapon&amp;nbsp;– one strut-mounted tubular launcher was fixed under each wing panel on the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s single-engined fighters, and two under each wing panel of a few twin-engined [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] daylight ''Zerstörer'' aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; However, due to the [[Bullet drop|ballistic drop]] of the fired rocket (despite the usual mounting of the launcher at about 15° upward orientation), and the small number of fighters fitted with the weapons, the Wfr. Gr. 21 never had a major effect on the combat box formations of Fortresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; Also, the attempts of the ''Luftwaffe'' to fit heavy-calibre ''Bordkanone''-series 37, 50 and even {{convert|75|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} cannon as anti-bomber weapons on twin-engined aircraft such as the special [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88P]] fighters, as well as one model of the [[Messerschmitt Me 410|Me 410]] ''Hornisse'', did not have much effect on the American strategic bomber offensive. The [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] had moderate success against the B-17 late in the war however. With its usual nose-mounted armament of four [[MK 108 cannon]]s, and with some examples later equipped with the [[R4M rocket]], launched from underwing racks, it could fire from outside the range of the bombers' {{convert|.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} defensive guns and bring an aircraft down with one hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schollars&quot;/&gt;

During World War II, after crash-landing or being forced down, approximately 40 B-17s were captured and refurbished by the ''Luftwaffe'' with about a dozen put back into the air. Given German markings, the captured B-17s were used to determine the airplane's vulnerabilities and to train German interceptor pilots in tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89&quot;/&gt; Others, with the cover designations Dornier Do 200 and Do 288, were used as long-range transports by the [[Kampfgeschwader 200|''Kampfgeschwader'' 200]] special duties unit, carrying out agent drops and supplying secret airstrips in the Middle East and North Africa.  They were chosen for these missions as being more suitable for the role than available German aircraft and not in an attempt to deceive the Allies, being operated in full ''Luftwaffe'' markings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald Am p23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wixley p30&quot;/&gt; One of the B-17s of KG200, bearing ''Luftwaffe'' markings ''A3+FB'', was interned by Spain when it landed at [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] airfield, {{Nowrap|27 June}} 1944, and remained there for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northstar&quot;/&gt; Some B-17s kept their Allied markings and were used in attempts to infiltrate B-17 formations and report on their position and altitude. The practice was initially successful, but the Army Air Forces combat aircrews quickly developed and established standard procedures to first warn off, and then fire upon any &quot;stranger&quot; trying to join a group's formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northstar&quot;/&gt;{{Verify source|date=June 2010}}

===Soviet use===
The U.S. did not offer B-17s to the Soviet Union, however, at least 73 were used by the [[Soviet Air Force]]. These were aircraft that landed with mechanical trouble during the [[shuttle bombing]] raids over Germany, or had been damaged by a ''Luftwaffe'' raid in [[Poltava]]. The Soviets restored 23 to flying condition and concentrated them in the 890th bomber regiment of the 45th bomber division but they never saw combat. In 1946 the regiment was assigned to the [[Kazan]] factory to aid in the Soviet effort to reproduce the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|Boeing B-29]] as the [[Tupolev Tu-4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon p. 479&quot;&gt;Gordon 2008, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The B-17 could hardly reveal much of value to the Soviet engineer bent on copying a B-29, when a B-29 is sitting in front of him. Why is this bit important? Does any writer say the B-17 was crucial to the copying of the B-29? &quot;Yefim Gordon says it ... is it not enough?&quot; No! &quot;The regiment may have been of help, but I doubt much gleaned from the B-17 proved useful. TV&quot;--&gt;

===Postwar history===
====U.S. Air Force====
[[File:B-17 waist and tail-20060603.jpg|thumb|left|Rear interior of late production B-17G, with staggered waist gun positions]]
Following the end of World War II, the B-17 was quickly phased out of use as a bomber and the Army Air Forces retired most of its fleet. Flight crews ferried the bombers back across the Atlantic to the United States where the majority were sold for scrap and melted down, although significant numbers remained in use in second-line roles such as VIP transports, air-sea rescue and photo-reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan mil p80&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p290&quot;/&gt; [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), established in 1946, used reconnaissance B-17s (at first called F-9 [''F'' for ''Fotorecon''], later RB-17) until 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knaack bomber p465&quot;/&gt;  With the disestablishment of the US Army Air Forces and the establishment of an independent [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1947, most extant B-17s were transferred to USAF.  

The USAF [[Air Rescue Service]] of the [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) operated B-17s as so-called [[Dumbo (air-sea rescue)|&quot;Dumbo&quot;]] [[air-sea rescue]] aircraft. Work on using B-17s to carry [[airborne lifeboat]]s had begun in 1943, but they only entered service in the European theater in February 1945, also being used to provide search and rescue support for [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] raids against Japan. About 130 B-17s were converted to the air-sea rescue role, at first designated B-17H and later SB-17G. Some SB-17s had their defensive guns removed, while others retained their guns to allow use close to combat areas. The SB-17 served through the [[Korean War]], remaining in service with USAF until the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p303-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p86&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt;

In 1946, surplus B-17s were chosen as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone aircraft]] for atmospheric sampling during the [[Operation Crossroads]] atomic bomb tests, being able to fly close to or even though the [[mushroom cloud]]s without endangering a crew. This led to more widespread conversion of B-17s as drones and drone control aircraft, both for further use in atomic testing and as targets for testing [[surface-to-air missile|surface-to-air]] and [[air-to-air missile]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p91&quot;/&gt; {{nowrap|One hundred and seven B-17s}} were converted to drones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight Sperry&quot;/&gt; The last operational mission flown by a USAF Fortress was conducted on {{Nowrap|6 August}} 1959, when DB-17P, AF Ser. No. ''44-83684'' directed a QB-17G, AF Ser. No. ''44-83717'', out of [[Holloman Air Force Base]], New Mexico, as a target for an [[AIM-4 Falcon]] air-to-air missile fired from an [[F-101 Voodoo]]. A retirement ceremony was held several days later at Holloman AFB, after which ''44-83684'' was retired to the [[AMARC|Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center]] (MASDC) at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Arizona.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Perhaps the most famous B-17, the ''[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]'', is currently being fastidiously restored to its World War II wartime appearance by the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAF Memphis&quot;/&gt;

====U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard====
[[File:US Navy PB-1W.jpg|right|thumb|Under '''[[Cadillac&amp;nbsp;II]]''', the AN/APS-20 radar was fitted onto the B-17G, designated PB-1W.]]
During the last year of World War II and shortly thereafter, the [[United States Navy]] acquired 48 ex-USAAF B-17s for patrol and air-sea rescue work. The first two ex-USAAF B-17s, a B-17F (later modified to B-17G standard) and a B-17G were obtained by the Navy for various development programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt; At first, these aircraft operated under their original USAAF designations but on July 31, 1945, they were assigned the naval aircraft designation PB-1, a designation which had originally been used in 1925 for the [[Boeing Model 50]] experimental flying boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Navy&quot;/&gt; 

Thirty-two B-17Gs&lt;ref name=&quot;DABASv2 p661&quot;/&gt; were used by the Navy under the designation PB-1W, the suffix -W standing for antisubmarine warfare. A large radome for an [[S-band]] [[List of radars|AN/APS-20]] search radar was fitted underneath the fuselage and additional internal fuel tanks were added for longer range, with the provision for additional underwing fuel tanks, while no armament was fitted. These aircraft were painted dark blue, a standard Navy paint scheme which had been adopted in late 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Navy&quot;/&gt; The PB-1W eventually evolved into an early warning aircraft by virtue of its APS-20 search radar.&lt;ref name=&quot;DABASv2 p661&quot;/&gt; PB-1Ws continued in USN service until 1955, gradually being phased out in favor of the Lockheed WV-2 (known in the USAF as the [[EC-121]], a designation adopted by USN in 1962), a military version of the [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed 1049 Constellation]] commercial airliner.

In July 1945, 16 B-17s were transferred to the Coast Guard via the Navy; these aircraft were initially assigned U.S. Navy Bureau Numbers (BuNo), but were delivered to the Coast Guard designated as PB-1Gs beginning in July 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt; Coast Guard PB-1Gs were stationed at a number of bases in the U.S. and Newfoundland, with five at [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City]], North Carolina, two at [[San Francisco International Airport|CGAS San Francisco]], two at [[NAS Argentia]], Newfoundland, one at [[CGAS Kodiak]], Alaska, and one in Washington state.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt; They were used primarily for air-sea rescue, but were also used for iceberg patrol duties and for photo mapping. Air-sea rescue PB-1Gs usually carried a droppable lifeboat underneath the fuselage and the chin turret was often replaced by a radome.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot;/&gt; The Coast Guard PB-1Gs served throughout the 1950s, the last example not being withdrawn from service until October 14, 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot;/&gt;

Its main use was in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], where its shorter range and smaller bombload relative to other aircraft available did not hamper it as much as in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]].

The B-17 Flying Fortress has become, for many reasons, an icon of American power and a symbol of its Air Force. During the 1930s, the USAAC, as articulated by then-Major General [[Frank Maxwell Andrews]] and the [[Air Corps Tactical School]], touted the bomber as a strategic weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate.149&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;The Howell Commission's report&amp;nbsp;... stated '... an adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army&amp;nbsp;...{{'&quot;}} |group=N}}General [[Henry H. Arnold]], Chief of the Air Corps, recommended the development of bigger aircraft with better performance and the Tactical School agreed completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate.161&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;To them it seemed that the bomber was well-nigh invincible. They argued that pursuit was obsolete and attack an expensive luxury, since aviation was more effective when used for interdiction behind enemy lines and strategic bombardment to destroy the enemy's means and will to fight.&quot;|group=N}}

When the Model 299 was rolled out on {{Nowrap|28 July}} 1935, bristling with multiple [[machine gun]] installations, Richard Williams, a reporter for the ''[[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]]'' coined the name &quot;Flying Fortress&quot; with his comment &quot;Why, it's a flying fortress!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger 87&quot;/&gt; Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use. In 1943, [[Consolidated Aircraft]] commissioned a poll to see &quot;to what degree the public is familiar with the names of the Liberator and the Flying Fortress.&quot; Of 2,500 men in cities where Consolidated adverts had been run in newspapers, 73% had heard of the [[B-24 Liberator]], while 90% knew of the B-17.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot;/&gt;

After the initial B-17s were delivered to the Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group, they were used on promotional flights emphasizing its great range and navigational precision. In January 1938, group commander [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Robert Olds]] flew a YB-17 from the east to west coast, setting a transcontinental record of 13 hours 27 minutes. He also broke the west-to-east coast record on the return trip, averaging {{convert|245|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 11 hours 1 minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamzow&quot;/&gt; Six bombers of the 2nd Bombardment group took off from [[Langley Field]] on {{Nowrap|15 February}} 1938 as part of a goodwill flight to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]. Covering {{convert|12000|mi|km}} they returned on {{Nowrap|27 February}}, with seven aircraft setting off on a flight to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, three days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p46-7&quot;/&gt; In a well-publicized mission on May 12 of the same year, three B-17s &quot;intercepted&quot; and took photographs of the Italian ocean liner [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] {{convert|610|mi|km}} off the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.91-12&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|This is a common error. The ''Rex'' was 725 miles offshore on her last position report as the B-17s were taxiing for takeoff from Mitchel Field, four hours before interception.|group=N}}


During the war, the largest offensive bombing force, the [[Eighth Air Force]], had an open preference for the B-17. [[Lieutenant General]] [[Jimmy Doolittle]] wrote about his preference for equipping the Eighth with B-17s, citing the logistical advantage in keeping fielded forces down to a minimum number of aircraft types with their unique servicing and spares. For this reason, he wanted B-17 bombers and P-51 fighters for the Eighth. His views were supported by Eighth Air Force statisticians, whose studies purportedly showed that Fortresses had utility and survivability much greater than that of the B-24.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot;/&gt; Making it back to base on multiple occasions despite extensive battle damage, its durability took on mythical proportions;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manual&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=browne/&gt; stories and photos of B-17s surviving battle damage were widely circulated during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot;/&gt; Despite an inferior performance and bombload compared to the more numerous [[B-24 Liberator]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Birdsall 3&quot;/&gt; a survey of [[Eighth Air Force]] crews showed a much higher rate of satisfaction in the B-17.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-17.de&quot;/&gt;

[[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] featured the airplane in its movies, such as ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' starring [[Gregory Peck]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb1&quot;/&gt; This film was made with the full cooperation of the [[United States Air Force]] and made use of actual combat footage. In 1964, the movie was made into a [[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|television show of the same name]] and ran for three years. Footage from ''Twelve O' Clock High'' was also used, along with three restored B-17s, in the 1962 film ''[[The War Lover]]''.  The B-17 also appeared in the 1938 movie ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Spencer Tracy]], with Clark Gable in [[Command Decision (film)|''Command Decision'']] in 1948, in ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' in 1970, and in [[Memphis Belle (film)|''Memphis Belle'']] with [[Matthew Modine]], [[Eric Stoltz]], [[Billy Zane]], and [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] in 1990. The most famous B-17, the [[Memphis Belle (B-17)|''Memphis Belle'']], toured the U.S. with its crew to reinforce national morale (and to sell [[War Bonds]]), and starred in a USAAF documentary, ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb2&quot;/&gt;

The '''''Trieste''''' was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-designed, [[Italy|Italian]]-built deep-diving research [[bathyscaphe]] (&quot;deep boat&quot;) with a crew of two, which reached a record maximum depth of about {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}}, in the deepest known part of the [[Earth]]'s oceans, the [[Challenger Deep]], in the [[Mariana Trench]] near [[Guam]], on January 23, 1960. 

''Trieste'' remains the only manned vessel to have reached the bottom of Challenger Deep. The vessel is currently on display at the [[U.S. Navy Museum]].

==Design==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
The ''Trieste'' was designed by the Swiss scientist [[Auguste Piccard]] and built in [[Italy]]. His pressure sphere, composed of two sections, was built by the company Acciaierie [[Terni]], and the upper part was manufactured by the company Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico, in the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] (on the border between Italy and [[Yugoslavia]]); hence that name was chosen for the bathyscaphe. The installation of the pressure sphere was done in the Cantiere navale di [[Castellammare di Stabia]], near [[Naples]]. The ''Trieste'' was launched on 26 August 1953 into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near the [[Capri|Isle of Capri]]. The design was based on previous experience with the bathyscaphe [[FNRS-2]], also designed by the Piccards. 
(It was built in Belgium). ''Trieste'' was operated by the [[French Navy]]. After several years of operation in the Mediterranean Sea, the ''Trieste'' was purchased by the [[United States Navy]] in 1958 for $250,000.

The ''Trieste'' consisted of a float chamber filled with [[gasoline]] for [[buoyancy]], with a separate pressure sphere. This configuration (dubbed a ''[[bathyscaphe]]'' by the Piccards), allowed for a free dive, rather than the previous [[bathysphere]] designs in which a sphere was lowered to depth and raised from a ship by cable.

At the time of ''[[Project Nekton]]'', the ''Trieste'' was more than 15&amp;nbsp;m (50&amp;nbsp;ft) long. The majority of this was a series of floats filled with 85,000 liters (22,500 [[gallon]]s) of gasoline, and water ballast tanks were included at either end of the vessel, as well as releasable iron ballast in two conical hoppers along the bottom, fore and aft of the crew sphere. The crew occupied the 2.16 m (7.09 ft) pressure sphere, attached to the underside of the float and accessed from the deck of the vessel by a vertical shaft that penetrated the float and continued down to the sphere hatch. 

In the ''Trieste'' the pressure sphere provided just enough room for two people. It provided completely independent life support, with a closed-circuit [[rebreather]] system similar to that used in modern spacecraft and spacesuits: oxygen was provided from pressure cylinders, and carbon dioxide was scrubbed from breathing air by being passed through canisters of [[Soda lime|soda-lime]]. Power was provided by batteries.

The ''Trieste'' was later fitted with a new pressure sphere, manufactured by the [[Krupp]] Steel Works of [[Essen, Germany]], in three finely-machined sections (an equatorial ring and two caps). 
To withstand the great pressure of 1.25 [[tonne|metric tons]] per cm² (110 [[MPa]]) at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the sphere's walls were {{convert|12.7|cm|in}} thick (it was [[Factor of safety|overdesigned]] to withstand considerably more than the rated pressure). The sphere weighed 13 [[metric tons]] in air and eight metric tons in water (giving it an average specific gravity of 13/(13-8) = 2.6 times that of sea water). The float was necessary because of the sphere's density: it was not possible to design a sphere large enough to hold a person that would withstand the necessary pressures, yet also have metal walls thin enough for the sphere to be neutrally-buoyant. [[Gasoline]] (petrol) was chosen as the float fluid because it is less dense than water, yet relatively incompressible even at extreme pressure, thus retaining its buoyant properties and negating the need for thick, heavy walls for the float chamber.
[[Image:Trieste nh96807.svg|thumb|300px|left|General arrangement drawing, showing the main features]]
[[Image:Bathyscaphe Trieste sphere.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Close-up of pressure sphere, with forward ballast silo at left]]
Observation of the sea outside the craft was conducted directly by eye, via a single, very tapered, cone-shaped block of [[acrylic glass]] ([[Plexiglas]]), the only transparent substance identified which would withstand the pressures needed, at the design hull thickness. Outside illumination for the craft was provided by quartz [[arc lamp|arc-light]] bulbs, which proved to be able to withstand the over-1000 atmosphere pressure without any modification.

Nine tons of magnetic iron pellets were placed on the craft as ballast, both to speed the descent and allow ascent, since the extreme water pressures would not have permitted compressed air ballast-expulsion tanks to be utilized at great depths. This additional weight was held in place actively at the throats of two hopper-like ballast silos by electromagnets, so that in case of an electrical failure the bathyscaphe would rise automatically to the surface.

Transported to the [[Naval Electronics Laboratory]]'s facility in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the ''Trieste'' was modified extensively by the Americans, and then used in a series of deep-submergence tests in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the next few years, culminating in the dive to the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]] in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean, during January 1960.

==The Mariana Trench dives==
[[Image:Trieste (23 Jan 1960).jpeg|300 px|left|thumb| January 23, 1960: ''Trieste'' just before the record dive]]   
[[Image:Bathyscaphe Trieste Piccard-Walsh.jpg|thumb|Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard inside ''Trieste'']]
''Trieste'' departed San Diego on October 5, 1959 for [[Guam]] aboard the freighter ''Santa Maria'' to participate in ''[[Project Nekton]]'', a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench. 
On January 23, 1960, ''Trieste''[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm] reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of Auguste) and U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]]. This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest known point of the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of {{convert|11521|m|ft|0}}, although this was revised later to {{convert|10916|m|ft|0}} and more accurate measurements made during 1995 have found the Challenger Deep to be slightly shallower, at {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}}.

The descent to the ocean floor occupied 4 hours and 48 minutes at a descent rate of {{convert|0.9|m/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;NGC: On the sea floor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocean.udel.edu/extreme2004/geology/trieste.html To the Depths in ''Trieste''], University of Delaware College of Marine Studies&lt;/ref&gt; After passing 9,000 metres one of the outer Plexiglas window panes cracked, shaking the entire vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste.], ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', Written January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men spent barely twenty minutes at the ocean floor, eating chocolate bars for sustenance. The temperature in the cabin was a mere 7°C (45°F) at the time. While on the bottom at maximum depth, Piccard and Walsh unexpectedly regained the ability to communicate with the surface ship, USS ''Wandank'' II (ATA-204), using a [[sonar]]/[[hydrophone]] voice communications system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historycentral.com/navy/Tug/Wanduck%20II.html | title=Wanduck II ATA-204 | publisher=historycentral.com | accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a speed of almost a mile per second (about five times the speed of sound in air), it took about seven seconds for a voice message to travel from the craft to the surface ship and another seven seconds for answers to return. 

While on the bottom, Piccard and Walsh observed a number of small [[sole (fish)|sole]] and [[flounder]] swimming away, proving that at least some vertebrate life can withstand the extremes of pressure in the Earth's oceans. They noted that the floor of the Challenger Deep consisted of &quot;[[diatom]]aceous ooze&quot;.  The ascent to surface took 3 hours, 15 minutes.

Since then, no manned craft has ever returned to the Challenger Deep. A Japanese robotic craft ''[[Kaikō]]'' reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep in 1995. The ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) reached the bottom on May 31, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nereus Mission&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8080324.stm |title=Robot sub reaches deepest ocean |date=3 June 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other deep dives by ''Trieste'' ==

The '''Battle of Bouvines,''' 27 July 1214, was a conclusive medieval battle ending the twelve year old [[War of Bouvines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; that was important to the early development of both the [[France in the Middle Ages|French state]] by confirming the French crown's sovereignty over the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin lands]] of [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]].

In the alliances, orchestrated by [[Pope Innocent III]], [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] of France defeated [[Otto IV of Germany]] and count [[Ferdinand, Prince of Portugal|Ferrand of Flanders]] so decisively that Otto was deposed and replaced by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]]. Ferrand was captured and imprisoned.

Additionally, the defeat led to their ally [[John of England|King John of England]] being forced to seal the [[Magna Carta]] by his discontented barons.

Philip was himself able to take undisputed control of the territories of [[Anjou]], [[Brittany]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]], [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], and the [[Touraine]], which he had recently seized from Otto's kinsman and ally [[John of England]].

[[Bouvines]] is located between [[Lille]] and [[Tournai]] which belonged to the [[count of Flanders]], a [[vassal]] of the king of France, in the 13th century.

==Prelude==
The campaign plan seems to have been designed by John, who was the fulcrum of the alliances; his general idea was to draw the French king away from Paris southward against himself and keep him occupied, while the main army, under  emperor Otto IV, with the counts of the low countries, should march on Paris from the north. John's part in the general strategy was carried out at first, but the allies in the north moved slowly. John, after two encounters with his mortal enemy the king of France, turned back to his possessions in Aquitaine on 3 July, however, perhaps in one of his fits of despondency. When, three weeks later, the emperor finally concentrated his forces at [[Valenciennes]], John was out of the picture, and in the interval Philip Augustus had counter marched northward and regrouped. Philip now took the offensive himself, and in maneuvering to get a good cavalry ground upon which to fight he offered battle (27 July), on the plain east of Bouvines and the river Marque. The imperial army drew up facing south-westward towards Bouvines, the heavy cavalry on the wings, the infantry in one great mass in the center, supported by the cavalry corps under the emperor himself. The total force is estimated at 25,000 men; a much larger proportion of foot soldiers and slightly less cavalry than the French.&lt;ref name = &quot;Army&quot;/&gt; The French army of 15,000 men&lt;ref name=&quot;Army&quot;&gt;See [http://xenophongroup.com/montjoie/bouvines.htm#analysis xenophongroup - Bouvines]&lt;/ref&gt; took ground exactly opposite in a similar formation, cavalry on the wings, infantry, including the townsmen (''milice des communes'') in the center, Philip with the cavalry reserve and the royal standard, the [[Oriflamme]], in rear of the men on foot. Philip's army contained about 2,000 knights (750 were from the royal demesne) and 2,000 mounted sergeants with the rest being infantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradbury283&quot;&gt;J. Bradbury, ''Philip Augustus: King of France 1180-1223'', 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==

Detail of ''[[:File:Bataille de Bouvines gagnee par Philippe Auguste.jpg|La Bataille de Bouvines]]'' by [[Horace Vernet]]. [[Château de Versailles]].]]
The battle opened with a confused cavalry fight on the French right, in which individual feats of knightly gallantry were more noticeable (and better recorded in the chronicles) than any attempt at combined action. The serious fighting was between the two centers; the infantry of the Low Countries, who were at this time almost the best in existence, drove back the French. Philip led the cavalry reserve of nobles and knights to retrieve the day, and after a long and doubtful fight, in which he himself was unhorsed and narrowly escaped death, began to drive back the Flemings.

In the meanwhile the French feudatories on the left wing had thoroughly defeated the imperial forces opposed to them, and [[William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury]], the leader of this corps, was unhorsed and taken prisoner by [[Philip of Dreux]], the fighting [[bishop of Beauvais]]. On the other wing the French at last routed the Flemish cavalry and captured Ferrand, Count of Flanders, one of the leaders of the coalition.

In the center the battle was now a mêlée between the two mounted reserves led by the king and the emperor in person. Here too the imperial forces suffered defeat, Otto himself being saved only by the devotion of a handful of Saxon knights. The Imperial Eagle Standard was captured by the French.

The day was already decided in favor of the French when their wings began to close inwards to cut off the retreat of the imperial center.  The battle closed with the celebrated stand of [[Reginald of Boulogne]], a former vassal of King Philip, who formed a ring of seven hundred [[Brabant (duchy)|Brabançon]] pikemen, and not only defied every attack of the French cavalry, but himself made repeated charges or sorties with his small force of knights. Eventually, and long after the imperial army had begun its retreat, the gallant [[Schiltron]] was ridden down and annihilated by a charge of three thousand men-at-arms. Reginald was taken prisoner in the mêlée; and the prisoners also included two other counts, Ferrand and William Longsword, twenty-five barons and over a hundred knights. The killed amounted to about 170 knights of the defeated party, and many thousands of foot on either side.

John returned to England to face the barons whose possessions in Normandy he had lost.

The '''Battle of Actium''' was the decisive confrontation of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]]. It was fought between the forces of [[Augustus|Octavian]] and the combined forces of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII]]. The battle took place on 2 September 31 BC, on the [[Ionian Sea]] near the Roman colony of [[Actium]] in [[Greece]]. Octavian's fleet was commanded by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], while Antony's fleet was supported by the ships of Queen Cleopatra of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].

Octavian's victory enabled him to consolidate his power over Rome and its dominions. To that end, he adopted the title of [[Princeps]] (&quot;first citizen&quot;) and some years after the victory was awarded the title of [[Augustus#First settlement|Augustus]] by the Roman Senate. This became the name by which he was known in later times. As Augustus, he would retain the trappings of a restored Republican leader; however, historians generally view this consolidation of power and the adoption of these honorifics as the end of the [[Roman Republic]] and the beginning of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Davis, ''100 Decisive Battles from Ancient Times to the Present: The World’s Major Battles and How They Shaped History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
The alliance commonly known as the [[Second Triumvirate]], renewed for a five-year term in 38 BC, broke down when Octavian came to perceive [[Caesarion]], the son of [[Julius Caesar]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and the Egyptian [[Queen Cleopatra]], as a major threat to his power.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} That occurred when [[Mark Antony]], the other most influential member of the Triumvirate, abandoned his wife, Octavian's sister [[Octavia Minor]], and moved to Egypt to start a long-term romance with Cleopatra, thus becoming de facto stepfather to Caesarion. Such a love affair was doomed to become a political scandal.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Antony was inevitably perceived by Octavian and the majority of the Roman Senate as the leader of a separatist movement that threatened to break the unity of the Roman Republic.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Octavian's prestige and, more importantly, the loyalty of his legions, had been initially boosted by Julius Caesar's legacy of 44 BC, by which the then nineteen-year-old Octavian had been officially adopted as the only son of the great Roman general and also established as the sole legitimate heir of his enormous wealth. Mark Antony had been the most important and most successful senior officer in Julius Caesar's army (''[[Master_of_the_Horse#Magister_Equitum_.28ancient_Rome.29|magister equitum]]'') and, thanks to his military record, could claim a substantial share of the political support of the Caesar's soldiers and veterans. Both Octavian and Mark Antony had fought against their common enemies in the civil war that followed the assassination of Julius Caesar.

After years of loyal cooperation with Octavian, Mark Antony started to act independently, eventually raising the suspicion that he was vying to become the sole master of Rome. When he openly left Octavian's sister, Octavia Minor, and moved to [[Alexandria]] to become Cleopatra's official partner, he led many Roman politicians to believe that he was trying to become the unchecked ruler of Egypt and of other eastern kingdoms, while still maintaining his command over the many Roman legions in the East.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} As a personal challenge to Octavian's prestige, Antony tried to get Caesarion accepted as a true heir of Julius Caesar, even though the legacy did not mention him at all. In fact, Antony and Cleopatra formally elevated to power Caesarion, then thirteen years of age, in 34 BC, giving him the vague but alarming title of [[King of Kings|&quot;King of the Kings&quot;]] ([[Donations of Alexandria]]). Being a son of Julius Caesar, such an entitlement was obviously felt as a threat to Roman republican traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In fact, according to a widespread belief, Mark Antony had once offered a crown to Julius Caesar.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Thereafter, Octavian started a propaganda war, denouncing Antony as an enemy of Rome, asserting that he was seeking to establish a personal monarchy over the entire Roman Empire on the behalf of Caesarion, completely circumventing the Roman Senate.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} It was also said that Antony intended to move the capital of the empire to Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

As the Second Triumvirate formally expired on the last day of 33 BC, Antony wrote to the Senate that he did not wish to be reappointed. He hoped that he might be regarded by them as their champion against the ambition of Octavian, who he presumed would not be willing to abandon his position in a similar manner.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The causes of mutual dissatisfaction between the two had been continually accumulating. Antony complained that Octavian had exceeded his powers in deposing [[Marcus Lepidus|Lepidus]], in taking over the countries held by [[Sextus Pompeius]], in enlisting soldiers for himself without sending half to him. Octavian complained that Antony had no authority for being in Egypt; that his execution of Sextus Pompeius was illegal; that his treachery to the [[king of Armenia]] disgraced the Roman name; that he had not sent half the proceeds of the spoils to Rome according to his agreement; that his connection with Cleopatra and the acknowledgment of Caesarion as a legitimate son of Julius Caesar were a degradation of his office and a menace to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh779&quot;&gt;Shuckburgh, 1917; Page 775 - 779.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 32 BC, a third of the Senate and both [[consul]]s allied with Antony. The consuls of that year had determined to conceal the extent of Antony's demands. [[Ahenobarbus]] seems to have wished to keep quiet; but [[Gaius Sosius|G. Sosius]] on 1 January made an elaborate speech in favor of Antony, and would have proposed the confirmation of his acta had it not been vetoed by a tribune. Octavian was not present, but at the next meeting made a reply of such a nature that the consuls both left Rome to join Antony; and Antony, when he heard of it, after publicly divorcing Octavia, came at once to [[Ephesus]] with Cleopatra, where a vast fleet was gathered from all parts of the East, of which Cleopatra furnished a large proportion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh779&quot; /&gt; After staying a time with his allies at Samos, Antony removed to Athens. His land forces which had been in Armenia were brought down to the coast of Asia, and embarked under L. Canidius Crassus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot;&gt;Shuckburgh, 1917; Page 780 - 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian was not behind in his strategic preparations. Indeed, military operations began in 31 BC, when Octavian's general [[Agrippa]] captured [[Methone]], a Greek town allied to Antony. But, by the publication of Antony's will, which had been put into his hands by the traitor [[Plancus]], and by carefully letting it be known at Rome what preparations were going on at [[Samos]], and how entirely Antony was acting as the agent of Cleopatra, Octavian produced such a violent outburst of feeling that he easily obtained his deposition from the consulship of 31, for which he was designated, and a vote for a proclamation of war against Cleopatra, well understood to mean against Antony, though he was not named.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt; In doing this, the Senate issued a war declaration and deprived Antony of any legal authority.

==The battle==
[[File:Battle of Actium en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Order of battle]]
Antony meant to anticipate an attack by a descent upon Italy towards the end of 32, and went as far as [[Corcyra]]. But finding the sea guarded by a squadron of Octavian's ships, he retired to winter at [[Patrae]], while his fleet for the most part lay in the [[Ambracian Gulf]], and his land forces encamped near the promontory of Actium, while the opposite side of the narrow strait into the Ambracian Gulf was also protected by a tower and a body of troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt;

After Octavian's proposals for a conference with Antony had been scornfully rejected, both sides prepared for the final struggle next year. The early months passed without notable event, beyond some successes of Agrippa on the coasts of Greece, meant to divert Antony's attention. It was not until the latter part of August that troops were brought by land into the neighbourhood of Antony's camp on the north side of the strait. Still Antony could not be tempted out. It would take some months for his full strength to arrive from the various places in which his allies or his ships had wintered. But during these months not only was Agrippa continuing his descent upon Greek towns and coasts, but in various cavalry skirmishes, Octavian had so far prevailed that Antony abandoned the north side of the strait and confined his soldiers to the southern camp. Cleopatra now earnestly advised that garrisons should be put into strong towns, and that the main fleet should return to Alexandria. The large contingent furnished by Egypt gave her advice as much weight as her personal influence over Antony; and it appears that this movement was really resolved upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt;

Octavian learned of this and debated how to prevent it. At first of a mind to let Anthony sail and then attack him, he was prevailed upon by [[Agrippa]] to give battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 50:31 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#31]&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day of September, he issued an address to his fleet, preparing them for battle. The next day was wet and the sea was rough. When the trumpet signal for the start rang out, Antony's fleet began issuing from the straits, and the ships moved into line and remained quiet. Octavian, after a short hesitation, ordered his vessels to steer to the right and pass the enemy's ships. Then for fear of being surrounded, Antony was forced to give the word to attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt;

===Order of battle===
The two fleets met outside the [[Gulf of Actium]], on the morning of 2 September 31 BC. Antony's fleet numbered 500,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt; of which were 230 large [[warship|wargalleys]] furnished with towers full of armed men. He led these through the straits towards the open sea. Octavian had about 250 warships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt; Octavian's fleet was waiting beyond the straits, led by the experienced admiral Agrippa, commanding from the left wing of the fleet, [[Lucius Arruntius]] commanding the centre&lt;ref name=&quot;65-66&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Antony'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#65 65-66;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcus Lurius]] commanding from the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;ii.85&quot;&gt;[[Velleius Paterculus]], ''History of Rome'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#85 ii.85.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Statilius Taurus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ii.85&quot;/&gt; commanded Octavian's armies, who observed the battle from shore to the north of the straits. Mark Antony and [[Lucius Gellius Publicola (consul 36 BC)|Gellius Publicola]] commanded the right wing of the Antonian fleet, while Marcus Octavius and Marcus Insteius commanded the centre,&lt;ref name=&quot;65-66&quot;/&gt; with Cleopatra's squadron positioned behind them. [[Gaius Sosius]] launched the initial attack from the left wing of the fleet, while Antony's chief lieutenant [[Publius Canidius Crassus]] was in command of the triumvir's land forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ii.85&quot;/&gt;

===Combat===
The battle raged all afternoon without decisive result. The majority of Mark Antony's warships were [[quinquereme]]s, huge galleys with massive rams, that could weigh up to three hundred tons. Antony's ships were often furnished with grappling irons, which were effective if hurled successfully; but, if they failed, were apt to damage the ship, or to cause so much delay as to expose the men on board to the darts from the smaller vessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt; The bows of the galleys were armoured with [[bronze]] plates and square-cut timbers, making a successful ramming attack with similar equipment difficult.

Unfortunately for Antony, many of his ships were undermanned; there had been a severe malaria outbreak while they were waiting for Octavian's fleet to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 50:13 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#13]&lt;/ref&gt; Making the best of the situation, he burned those ships he could no longer man, while clustering the remainder tightly together. With many oarsmen dead or unfit to serve, the powerful, head-on ramming tactic for which the quinqueremes had been designed failed.

[[Image:Ballistae on roman ship.JPG|thumb|right|275px|[[Ballista]]e on a Roman ship.]]
Octavian's fleet was largely made up of smaller, fully manned [[Liburnians|Liburnian]] vessels, armed with better-trained, fresher crews. Octavian's ships were generally smaller, but more manageable in the heavy surf, capable of reversing their course on short notice and returning to the charge or, after pouring in a volley of darts on some huge adversary, able to retreat out of shot with speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt; They were lighter and could out-maneuver the quinqueremes, where one objective was to ram the enemy ship and at the same time attack the above-deck crew with a shower of arrows and catapult-launched stones, which were large enough to decapitate a man.

Before the battle, one of Mark Antony's generals, [[Quintus Dellius]], had defected to Octavian, bringing with him Mark Antony's battle plans.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/50*.html#23 50.23.1-3]&lt;/ref&gt; Antony had hoped to use his biggest ships to drive back Agrippa's wing on the north end of his line, but Octavian's entire fleet, aware of this strategy, stayed out of range. Shortly after midday, Antony was forced to extend his line from the protection of the shore and finally engage the enemy. Cleopatra, in the rear, could not bear the suspense, and in an agony of anxiety, gave the signal for retreat. Cleopatra's fleet retreated to open sea without engaging. A breeze sprang up in the right direction, and the Egyptian ships were soon hurrying out of sight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt;

Antony had not observed the signal, and believing that it was mere panic and that all was lost, followed the flying squadron. The contagion spread fast; everywhere sails were seen unfurling, and towers and other heavy fighting gear going by the board. Yet some still fought on; and it was not until long after nightfall, when many a ship was blazing from the firebrands thrown upon them, that the work was done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt; Mark Antony transferred to a smaller vessel with his flag and managed to escape, taking a few ships with him as an escort to help break through Octavian's lines. Those that remained left behind, however, were captured or sunk by Octavian's forces.

J.M. Carter argues in ''The Battle of Actium: The Rise and Triumph of Augustus Caesar'' that Antony knew he was surrounded and had nowhere to run. To try to turn this to his advantage, Antony gathered his ships around him in a quasi-horseshoe formation, staying close to the shore for safety. Then, should Octavian's ships approach Antony's, the sea would push them into the shore. Antony foresaw that he would not be able to defeat Octavian's forces, so he and Cleopatra stayed in the rear of the formation. Eventually, Antony sent the ships on the northern part of the formation to attack. He had them move out to the north, spreading out Octavian's ships which up until now were tightly arranged. He sent [[Gaius Sosius]] down to the south to spread the remaining ships out to the south. This left a hole in the middle of Octavian's formation. Antony seized the opportunity and with Cleopatra on her ship and him on a different ship, sped through the gap and escaped, abandoning his entire force.

With the end of the battle, Octavian exerted himself to save the crews of the burning vessels, and had to spend the whole night on board. Next day, such of the land army as had not escaped to their own lands submitted or were followed in their retreat to Macedonia and forced to surrender, and Antony's camp was occupied. It was all over, and the Empire had a single master.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The political consequences of this battle were far-reaching. Under cover of darkness some 19 legions and 12,000 [[cavalry]] fled before Antony was able to engage Octavian in a land battle. After Mark Antony lost his fleet, his army, which had been equal to that of Octavian, deserted in large numbers. Antony, though he had not laid down his imperium, was a fugitive and a rebel, without that shadow of a legal position which the presence of the consuls and senators had given him in the previous year. Some of the victorious fleet went in pursuit of him; but Octavian himself visited Greece and Asia, and spent the winter at Samos; though he was obliged to go for a short time to Brundisium to settle a mutiny and arrange for assignations of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt;

At Samos, Octavian received a message from Cleopatra with the present of a gold crown and throne, offering to abdicate in favour of her sons. The queen was allowed to believe that she would be well treated, for Octavian was anxious to secure her for his triumph. Antony, who had found himself generally deserted, after vainly attempting to secure the army stationed near Paraetonium under Pinarius, and sending his eldest son Antyllus with money to Octavian and an offer to live at Athens as a private citizen, found himself in the spring attacked on two sides. [[Cornelius Gallus|C. Cornelius Gallus]] was advancing from Paraetonium; and Octavian himself landed at Pelusium, with the connivance it was believed of Cleopatra. Antony was defeated by Gallus, and returning to Egypt, advanced on Pelusium.

Despite a victory at Alexandria on 31 July 30 BC, more of Mark Antony's men deserted, leaving him with insufficient forces to fight Octavian. A slight success over Octavian's tired soldiers encouraged him to make a general attack, in which he was decisively beaten. Mark Antony then tried to flee from the battle, and as a result of a communication breakdown, came to believe that Cleopatra had been captured, and hence committed [[suicide]]. Failing to escape on board a ship, he stabbed himself; and, as he did not die at once, insisted on being taken to the mausoleum in which Cleopatra was shut up, and there died in her arms. The queen was shortly afterwards brought from this place to the palace and vainly attempted to move Octavian to pity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt;

After Mark Antony's death, Cleopatra eluded the vigilance of her guard [[Epaphroditus (freedman of Augustus)|Epaphroditus]] and committed suicide, on 12 August 30 BC. In one account, she put an end to her life, as it was believed, by the bite of a snake (an [[asp]]) conveyed to her in a basket of figs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuckburgh784&quot; /&gt; Octavian had [[Caesarion]] killed later that year, finally securing his legacy as Julius Caesar's only 'son'.

Thus, Octavian's victory at the Battle of Actium gave him sole and uncontested control of &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (Our Sea i.e. the Roman Mediterannean) and he became &quot;Augustus Caesar&quot; and the &quot;first citizen&quot; of Rome. This victory, consolidating his power over every Roman institution, marked the transition of Rome from Republic to Empire. Egypt's final surrender following Cleopatra's death also marks the final demise of both the Hellenistic Age and the Ptolemaic Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vizin.org/projects/actium/html/actiumsol.htm Actium - the solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''zebrafish''', '''''Danio rerio''''', is a [[tropical]] [[freshwater fish]] belonging to the minnow [[Family (biology)|family]] ([[Cyprinidae]]) of [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Cypriniformes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot;&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Danio|species=rerio||month=March|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular [[Aquarium|aquarium fish]], frequently sold under the trade name '''zebra danio''', and is an important vertebrate [[model organism]] in scientific research.

==Taxonomy==
The zebrafish are [[Cyprinidae]] with a [[derived]] member of the genus ''[[Danio]]''. It has a [[cladistics|sister group]] relationship with ''[[Danio kyathit]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayden&quot; /&gt;

Zebrafish are closely related to the genus ''[[Devario]]'', as demonstrated by a [[phylogenetic tree]] of close species. {{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n3/fig_tab/6800867f2.html#figure-title|title=Figure 2. Phylogenetic relationships among ''danios''}}

==Distribution==
The zebrafish is native to the streams of the southeastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayden&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayden|first=Richard L.|coauthors=Tang, Kevin L.; Conway, Kevin W.; Freyhof, Jörg; Chamberlain, Sarah; Haskins, Miranda; Schneider, Leah; Sudkamp, Mitchell; Wood Robert M.; Agnew, Mary; Bufalino, Angelo; Sulaiman, Zohrah; Miya, Masaki; Saitoh, Kenji; He, Shunping|year=2007|title=Phylogenetic relationships of ''Danio'' within the order Cypriniformes: a framework for comparative and evolutionary studies of a model species|journal=J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.)|volume=308B|pages=642–654|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21175|pmid=17554749|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the countries [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], and [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NAS factsheet&quot;&gt;[http://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=505 USGS NAS - Nonindigenous Aquatic Species]&lt;/ref&gt; It arose in the [[Ganges]] region in Eastern [[India]]. It commonly inhabits streams, canals, ditches, ponds, and slow-moving to [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] [[water bodies]], including [[rice paddy|rice fields]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beec&quot; /&gt;

Zebrafish have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to parts of the [[United States]], presumably by deliberate release or by escape from fish farms.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAS factsheet&quot;/&gt; They have also been sighted in [[Colombia]].

==Description==
[[File:Zebrafish95-300.jpg|thumb|right|A young zebrafish (''Danio rerio'')]]
The fish is named for the five uniform, pigmented, horizontal blue stripes on the side of the body, all of which extend to the end of the [[caudal fin]]. Its shape is [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] and laterally compressed, with its mouth directed upwards. Males are [[torpedo]]-shaped and have gold stripes between the blue stripes; females have a larger, whitish belly and have silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females will exhibit a small genital [[Fish anatomy#Reproductive system|papilla]] in front of the [[anal fin]] origin. The zebrafish can grow to {{convert|6.4|cm|in}}, although it is uncommon for them to grow past 4&amp;nbsp;cm in captivity. Life-span in captivity is around 2–3 years, although in ideal conditions, may extend to 5 years.&lt;ref name=beec/&gt;

===Reproduction===
The approximate [[generation time]] for the ''Danio'' is 3–4 months. A male must be present for ovulation and [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] to occur. Females are able to spawn at intervals of 2–3 days, laying hundreds of eggs in each [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]. Upon release, embryonic development begins; absent sperm, growth stops after the first few cell divisions. Fertilized eggs almost immediately become transparent, a characteristic that makes ''D. rerio'' a convenient research model [[species]].&lt;ref name=beec&gt;{{
cite journal|author=Spence R, Gerlach G, Lawrence C, Smith C |title=The behaviour and ecology of the zebrafish, Danio rerio |journal=Biological Reviews  |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=13–34 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18093234|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00030.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development progresses rapidly. Precursors to all major organs appear within 36 hours of [[fertilization]]. Hatching takes place 48–72 hours after fertilization, depending on the embryo's internal conditions and the external temperature, ideally {{C to F|28.5}}. Swimming and feeding behavior begin about 36 hours later. The sex of juveniles cannot be distinguished except by dissection, and sex determinants are not clearly understood.

===Feeding===
The zebrafish is [[omnivorous]]. It primarily eats [[zooplankton]], [[insect]]s and insect [[larva]]e, and [[phytoplankton]]. It can eat a variety of other foods, such as [[worm]]s and small [[crustacean]]s if its preferred sources are not readily available.&lt;ref name=beec/&gt; Most Danios accept common food flakes and [[tubifex worm]]s in the [[aquarium]].

==Strains==
Recently, transgenic zebrafish have become commercially available that express [[green fluorescent protein]], red fluorescent protein, and [[yellow fluorescent protein]]. They are tradenamed [[GloFish]]. Other subspecies include ''golden'', ''sandy'', ''longfin'' and ''leopard''.

The leopard danio, previously known as ''Danio frankei'', is a spotted colour [[morph (zoology)|morph]] of the zebrafish caused by a pigment mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watanabe M, Iwashita M, Ishii M, ''et al.'' |title=Spot pattern of leopard Danio is caused by mutation in the zebrafish connexin41.8 gene |journal=EMBO Rep. |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=893–7 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16845369 |pmc=1559663 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xanthochromism|Xanthistic]] forms of both the [[zebra]] and [[leopard]] pattern, along with long-finned subspecies, have been obtained via selective breeding programs for the aquarium trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mills, Dick |title=Eyewitness Hnbk Aquarium Fish |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1993 |isbn=0-7322-5012-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquarium care==
Zebrafish are hardy fish and considered good for beginner [[aquarium|aquarists]]. Their ease of keeping and breeding, beauty, price, playful nature and broad availability all contribute to their popularity. They thrive best in {{convert|22|-|28|C|F}} water. They need an aquarium of {{convert|10|USgal|L}} or more, and they do well in schools. They also thrive as [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] of six or more, and interact well with other [[fish type]]s in the aquarium. However, they are susceptible to ''[[Oodinium]]'' or velvet disease, [[microsporidia]] (''Pseudoloma neurophilia''), and ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' species. Given the opportunity, adults eat hatchlings, which may be protected by separating the two groups with a net, breeding box or separate tank.

==In scientific research==
[[Image:Zfishchroma.jpg|thumb|Zebrafish [[chromatophore]]s, shown here mediating [[camouflage|background adaptation]], are studied by scientists]]
''D. rerio'' is a common and useful [[model organism]] for studies of [[vertebrate]] development and [[gene]] function.&lt;ref name=Mayden/&gt; [[George Streisinger]] at the [[University of Oregon]] established its utility. Success with it in large scale forward [[genetic screen]]s (commonly referred to as the Tübingen/Boston screens) consolidated its importance. The scholarly journal ''Development''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.biologists.org/ Development journal]&lt;/ref&gt; devoted an issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Zebrafish issue |journal=Development |volume=123 |issue=1 |year=1996 |month=December |url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/vol123/issue1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to research using it in celebration of this landmark. It has a dedicated online database of genetic, genomic, and developmental information, the [[Zebrafish Information Network]] (ZFIN). ''D. rerio'' is one of the few fish species [[Animals in space|to have reached space]]. They may supplement higher vertebrate models, such as rats and mice.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the brain (in larval stages). Heart muscle regeneration does not make use of [[stem cell]]s; instead, mature heart muscle cells regress to a stem-cell-like state and redifferentiate.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; In 2011 the [[British Heart Foundation]] ran an advertising (including on television and online) campaign publicising their intention to study the applicability of this ability to humans by &quot;spend[ing] £50 million on a programme of groundbreaking research that could help us begin to repair damaged [human] hearts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bhf.org.uk/research/mending-broken-hearts-appeal/the-science.aspx?pid=p&amp;sc_cid=MBH-EX-24&amp;utm_source=MBH-AW&amp;utm_medium=MBH-AW&amp;utm_campaign=MBH-AW-G9_010211&amp;gclid=CL2w_L2hhqcCFcgf4QodBA25eA&lt;/ref&gt;

Zebrafish have also been found to regenerate [[photoreceptor cells]] and [[retina]]l neurons following injury. The mechanisms of this regeneration are unknown. Researchers frequently [[amputate]] the dorsal and ventral tail fins and analyze their regrowth to test for mutations. This research is leading the scientific community in the understanding of healing/repair mechanisms in vertebrates. It has also been found if the same fin is damaged enough times, the fish will grow a new fin which will have mutated only a small amount. Most scientists believe this is a defence mechanism to try to prevent the fin from being damaged again.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Genetics===
====Gene expression====
A common [[reverse genetics]] technique is to [[gene knockdown|reduce gene expression]] or modify [[Splicing (genetics)|splicing]] using [[Morpholino]] [[antisense]] technology. Morpholino [[oligonucleotide]]s (MO) are stable, synthetic [[macromolecules]] that contain the same [[nucleosides|bases]] as DNA or RNA; by binding to complementary RNA sequences, they reduce the [[gene expression|expression]] of specific genes. The journal ''Genesis''&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jhome/68503812 genesis - The Journal of Genetics and Development]&lt;/ref&gt; devoted an issue&lt;ref&gt;

MO can be injected into one cell of an embryo after the 32-cell stage, reducing gene expression in only cells descended from that cell. However, cells in the early embryo (less than 32 cells) are interpermeable to large molecules,&lt;ref name=blast2&gt;{{

A known problem with gene knockdowns is that, because the genome underwent a [[genome#Genome evolution|duplication]] after the divergence of [[ray-finned fish]]es and [[lobe-finned fish]]es, it is not always easy to silence the activity one of the two gene [[paralog]]s reliably due to [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] by the other paralog.

Despite the complications of the zebrafish [[genome]], a number of commercially available global platforms for analysis of both gene expression by [[expression profiling|microarrays]] and promoter regulation using [[ChIP-on-chip]] exist.

====Gene sequencing====
In 2009, researchers at the [[Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology]], [[Delhi]] announced the sequencing of a wild caught strain, containing 1.7 billion 
genetic letters.&lt;ref&gt;

====Mitochondrial DNA====
In October 2001, researchers from the [[University of Oklahoma]] published ''D. rerio's'' complete [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequence.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/11/11/1958.full

|pmc=311132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its length is 16,596 base pairs. This is within 100 base pairs of other related species of fish, and it is notably only 18 pairs longer than the [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus'') and 21 longer than the [[carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio''). Its gene order and content is identical to the common [[vertebrate]] form of mitochondrial DNA. It contains 13 [[protein]]-coding genes and a noncoding control region containing the [[origin of replication]] for the heavy strand. In between a grouping of five [[tRNA]] genes, a sequence resembling vertebrate origin of light strand replication is found. It is difficult to draw evolutionary conclusions because it is difficult to determine whether base pair changes have adaptive significance via comparisons with other vertebrates [[nucleotide]] sequences.

====Pigmentation gene====
In December 2005, a study of the ''golden'' strain identified the gene responsible for its unusual pigmentation as [[SLC24A5]], a [[Solution|solute]] carrier that appeared to be required for [[melanin]] production, and confirmed its function with a Morpholino knockdown. The [[Orthologue|orthologous]] gene was then characterized in humans and a one base pair difference was found to strongly segregate fair-skinned Europeans and dark-skinned Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{

====Transgenesis====
Transgenesis is a popular approach to study the function of genes in zebrafish. Construction of transgenic zebrafish is rather easy by a method using the Tol2 transposon system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2004.06.005 |author=Kawakami, K, ''et al.'' |title=A transposon-mediated gene trap approach identifies developmentally regulated genes in zebrafish |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=133–144 |year=2004 |pmid=15239961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In environmental monitoring==
===Oestrogen detection===
In January 2007, [[China|Chinese]] researchers at [[Fudan University]] genetically modified fish to detect [[oestrogen]] pollution in lakes and rivers, which is linked to male infertility.&lt;ref&gt;Song Houyan and Zhong Tao, professors at Fudan's molecular medicine lab, spent three years cloning estrogen-sensitive genes and injecting them into the fertile eggs of zebrafish. The modified fish turn green if they are placed into water that is polluted by estrogen. [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-01/12/content_5597696.htm Fudan scientists turn fish into estrogen alerts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medical research==

In cardiovascular research the zebrafish is being used to model [[Coagulation|blood clotting]], [[Angiogenesis|blood vessel development]], [[heart failure]], and [[congenital heart defect|congenital heart disease]]. In programmes of research into acute [[inflammation]], a major underpinning process in many diseases, researchers have established a zebrafish model of inflammation, and its resolution. An approach that allows detailed study of the genetic controls of inflammation and the possibility of identifying potential new drugs.

Another focus of work is to understand how a gene called [[Hedgehog (gene)|Hedgehog]], a biological signal that underlies a number of human cancers, controls cell growth. This is fast becoming an avenue of research that is leading to new cancer therapies. 
In probing disorders of the nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases, movement disorders, psychiatric disorders and deafness, researchers are using the zebrafish to understand how the genetic defects underlying these conditions cause functional abnormalities in the human brain, spinal cord and sensory organs.
Researchers are delving into the complexities of muscle degeneration in genetic models of human musculoskeletal diseases, such as muscular dystrophy.

These studies exemplify how zebrafish research offers unique opportunities to understanding some of the greatest challenges in medical science, by enabling new discoveries of how cells and tissues work to be translated into new ways of understanding a broad range of human diseases.

Finally, and as demonstrated through ongoing research programmes, the zebrafish models affords an ideal opportunity, not only to identify novel candidates for genes underlying human disease, but offers a potential system in which to begin to develop novel therapeutic agents in drug discovery programmes, hence helping to identify new treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishforscience.com/ |title=Fish for Science |publisher=University of Sheffield |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repairing retinal damage===
In 2007, researchers at [[University College London]] grew a type of zebrafish adult [[stem cell]] found in the [[eye]]s of fish and mammals that develops into [[neuron]]s in the [[retina]]&amp;mdash;the part of the eye that sends messages to the brain. These [[cell (biology)|cell]]s could be injected in the eye to treat diseases that damage retinal neurons&amp;mdash;nearly every disease of the eye, including [[macular degeneration]], [[glaucoma]], and [[diabetes]]-related [[blindness]]. Retinal damage is responsible for most cases of sight loss. The researchers studied Müller [[glial cells]] in the eyes of humans aged from 18 months to 91 years and were able to develop them into all types of retinal neurons. They were able to grow them easily in the lab. The stem cells successfully migrated into diseased rats' retinas and took on the characteristics of the surrounding neurons. The team is working on the same approach in humans.&lt;ref&gt;

===Transparent adult bodies===
In 2008, researchers at [[Children's Hospital Boston]] developed a new strain of zebrafish, named Casper, whose adult bodies were transparent.&lt;ref name=zviv&gt;{{
cite journal |author=White RM, Sessa A, Burke C, ''et al.'' |title=Transparent adult zebrafish as a tool for in vivo transplantation analysis |journal=[[Cell Press|Cell Stem Cell]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=183–9 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18371439 |pmc=2292119 |doi=10.1016/j.stem.2007.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for detailed visualization of cellular activity, circulation, [[metastasis]] and many other phenomena. Because many gene functions are shared between fish and humans, Casper is expected to yield insight into human diseases such as leukemia and other cancers.&lt;ref name=zviv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Adwa Tigray Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|305px|right|The landscape of Adwa.]]

The '''Battle of Adwa''' (usually known as '''Adowa''', or sometimes by the Italian name ''Adua'') was fought on 1 March 1896 between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Italy]] near the town of [[Adwa]], Ethiopia, in [[Tigray Region|Tigray]]. It was the climactic battle of the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].

== Background ==
As the 20th century approached, most of 19th century [[Africa]] had been carved up between the various [[Europe]]an powers.  The two exceptions were the tiny [[Liberia|Republic of Liberia]] on the west coast of the continent and the ancient [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the strategic [[Horn of Africa]].  The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was a relative newcomer to the [[colonialism|colonial]] [[scramble for Africa]].  Italy possessed only two recently obtained territories.  Both were impoverished and located near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa, [[Eritrea]] and [[Somaliland|Somalia]].  Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia, which would join its two territories.

In 1889, the Italians signed the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]].  A disputed article of the treaty made the Ethiopian Empire a [[protectorate]] of the Kingdom of Italy.  As a result, Italy and Ethiopia faced off in what was later to be known as the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].

In late 1895, after advancing deep into Ethiopian territory, a small Italian-led unit was defeated by a much larger Ethiopian group at the [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1895)|Battle of Amba Alagi]].  The Italians were forced to withdraw to more defensible positions in [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], where the two main armies faced each other.

By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General [[Oreste Baratieri]], commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]]'s army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act. On the evening of 29 February, Baratieri met with his [[Brigadier General|brigadiers]] Matteo Albertone, Giuseppe Arimondi, Vittorio Dabormida, and Giuseppe Ellena, concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note,  revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as [[Asmara]]. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Marcus, ''The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913'', 1975 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Dabormida exclaiming, &quot;Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat.&quot; Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00.&lt;ref&gt;David Levering Lewis, ''The Race for Fashoda'' (New York: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1987), p. 116. ISBN 1-55584-058-2&lt;/ref&gt; His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.

== The battle ==
[[Image:Battle of Adwa tapestry at Smithsonian.png|thumb|left|300px|Painting commemorating the Battle of Adwa, Catalogue No. E261845-0, Department of Anthropology, NMNH, Smithsonian Institution.]]
The Italian army comprised four brigades totalling 17,700 troops, with fifty-six artillery pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Fashoda'', pp. 116f. He breaks down their numbers into 10,596 Italian officers and soldiers and 7,104 Eritrean askaris.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is likely that even fewer men fought in this battle on the Italian side: Harold Marcus notes that &quot;several thousand&quot; soldiers were needed for support and to guard the lines of communication to the rear, so he estimates the Italian army to have consisted of 14,500 effectives.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, ''Menelik II'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; One brigade under General Albertone was made up of [[Eritrea]]n [[askari]] led by Italian officers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham, page 481 &quot;The Scramble for Africa&quot;, ISBN 0-349-10449-2&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining three brigades were Italian units under Brigadiers Dabormida, Ellena and Arimondi. While these included elite [[Bersaglieri]], [[Alpini]] and [[Hunters of the Alps|Cacciatori]] units, a large proportion of the troops were inexperienced conscripts recently drafted from metropolitan regiments in Italy into newly formed &quot;di formazione&quot; battalions for service in Africa.&lt;ref name = &quot;Berkley 1901&quot;&gt;George Fitz-Hardinge Berkley ''The Campaign of Adowa and the rise of Menelik'', London: Constable 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raffaele Ruggeri, page 82 ''Le Guerre Coloniali Italiane 1885/1900'', Editrice Militare Italiana 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chris Prouty describes:
{{quote|They [the Italians] had inadequate maps, old model guns, poor communication equipment and inferior footgear for the rocky ground. (The newer Remingtons were not issued because Baratieri, under constraints to be economical, wanted to use up the old cartridges.)  Morale was low as the veterans were homesick and the newcomers, too inexperienced to have any ''esprit de corps''.  There was a shortage of mules and saddles.&lt;ref&gt;Prouty, ''Empress Taytu and Menilek II'' (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986), p. 155. ISBN 0-932415-11-3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Image-TekleHaimanot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Negus'' [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]].]]
Estimates for the Ethiopian forces under Menelik range from a low of 73,000 to a high of 100,000, outnumbering the Italians by an estimated five or six times.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K.P. Pankhurst has published one collection of these estimates, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University, 1968), pp. 555–57. See also Herausgegeben von Uhlig, Siegbert, ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]: A-C''. Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The forces were divided among Emperor Menelik, Empress [[Taytu Betul]], [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|''Ras'']]{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[Duke]].|group=nb}} [[Welle Betul]], ''Ras'' [[Mengesha Atikem]], ''Ras'' [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes|Mengesha Yohannes]], ''Ras'' [[Alula Engida]], ''Ras'' [[Mikael of Wollo]], ''Ras'' [[Ras Makonnen|Makonnen Wolde Mikael]], ''[[Fitawrari]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to Commander of the [[Vanguard (military tactics)|Vanguard]].|group=nb}} [[Gebeyyehu]], and ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and religious titles|Negus]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[Monarch|King]].|group=nb}} [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymanot Tessemma]].&lt;ref&gt;Pétridès (as well as [[Richard K.P. Pankhurst|Pankhurst]], with slight variations) break the troop numbers down (over 100,000 by their estimates) as follows: 35,000 infantry (25,000 riflemen and 10,000 spearmen) and 8,000 cavalry under Emperor Menelik; 5,000 infantry under Empress Taytu; 8,000 infantry (6,000 riflemen and 2,000 spearmen) under Ras Wale; 8,000 infantry (5,000 riflemen and 3,000 spearmen) under Ras Mengesha Atikem, 5,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 3,000 cavalry under Ras Mengesha Yohannes and Ras Alula Engida; 6,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 5,000 [[Oromo people|Oromo]] cavalry under Ras Mikael of Wollo; 25,000 riflemen under Ras Makonnen; 8,000 infantry under ''Fitawrari'' Gebeyyehu; 5,000 riflemen, 5,000 spearmen, and 3,000 cavalry under ''Negus'' Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, von Uhlig, ''Encyclopaedia'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the armies were followed by a similar number of traditional peasant followers who supplied the army, as had been done for centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casualties&quot;&gt;von Uhlig, Siegbert, ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]: A-C'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the army was composed of riflemen, a significant percentage of which were in Menelik's reserve; however, the army was also composed of a significant number of cavalry and infantry only armed with [[lance]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casualties&quot;/&gt; On the night of 29 February and the early morning of 1 March three Italian brigades advanced separately towards Adwa over narrow mountain tracks, while a fourth remained camped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uhlig-109&quot;&gt;von Uhlig, ''Encyclopaedia'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Levering Lewis]] states that the Italian battle plan

{{quote|called for three columns to march in parallel formation to the crests of three mountains — Dabormida commanding on the right, Albertone on the left, and Arimondi in the center — with a reserve under Ellena following behind Arimondi. The supporting crossfire each column could give the others made the… soldiers as deadly as razored shears. Albertone's brigade was to set the pace for the others. He was to position himself on the summit known as [[Kidane Meret]], which would give the Italians the high ground from which to meet the Ethiopians.&lt;ref name=Lewis-117/&gt;}}

However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Their sketchy maps caused Albertone to mistake one mountain for Kidane Meret, and when a scout pointed out his mistake, Albertone advanced directly into Ras Alula's position.
[[File:Adwa map.jpg|thumb|right|An 1890s Italian map of Adwa (the map appears to be facing west)]]
Unbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik knew his troops had exhausted the ability of the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March).  The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras Alula, his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward.  Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras Alula the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael at the head of the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve.&lt;ref name=Lewis-117&gt;Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, in perfect position to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable to crossfire.&lt;ref name= &quot;Casualties&quot; /&gt;

Albertone's askari brigade was the first to encounter the onrush of Ethiopians at 6:00, near Kidane Meret,&lt;ref&gt;In the attached map, this is labelled &quot;Chidane Meret&quot;, which is immediately above (west) of the hill &quot;Rajò&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Ethiopians had managed to set up their mountain artillery (40-42 Russian's mobile guns and some Russian's officers of the volunteers). His heavily outnumbered askaris held their position for two hours until Albertone's capture, and under Ethiopian pressure the survivors sought refuge with Arimondi's brigade.  Arimondi's brigade beat back the Ethiopians who repeatedly charged the Italian position for three hours with gradually fading strength until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 [[Shewa]]ns and swamped the Italian defenders.  Two companies of Bersaglieri who arrived at the same moment could not help and were cut down.

Dabormida's Italian brigade had moved to support Albertone but was unable to reach him in time. Cut off from the remainder of the Italian army, Dabormida began a fighting retreat towards friendly positions. However, he inadvertently marched his command into a narrow valley where the Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael slaughtered his brigade, while shouting ''Ebalgume! Ebalgume!'' (&quot;Reap! Reap!&quot;). Dabormida's remains were never found, although his brother learned from an old woman living in the area that she had given water to a mortally wounded Italian officer, &quot;a chief, a great man with spectacles and a watch, and golden stars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;George Fitz-Hardinge Berkeley, ''Campaign of Adowa'' (1902), quoted in Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining two brigades under Baratieri himself were outflanked and destroyed piecemeal on the slopes of [[Mount Belah]]. Menelik watched as [[Gojjam]] forces under the command of [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam|Tekle Haymonot]] made quick work of the last intact Italian brigade.  By noon, the survivors of the Italian army were in full retreat and the battle was over.

== Aftermath ==
The Italians suffered about 7,000 killed and 1,500 wounded in the battle and subsequent retreat back into Eritrea, with 3,000 taken prisoner; Ethiopian losses have been estimated around 4,000–5,000, but with 8,000 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uhlig-109&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pankhurst-1998&quot;&gt;Pankhurst, Richard. ''The Ethiopians: A History'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In their flight to [[Eritrea]], the Italians left behind all of their artillery and 11,000 rifles, as well as most of their transport.&lt;ref name= &quot;Pankhurst-1998&quot;/&gt; As Paul B. Henze notes, &quot;Baratieri's army had been completely annihilated while Menelik's was intact as a fighting force and gained thousands of rifles and a great deal of equipment from the fleeing Italians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henze, ''Layers of Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3,000 Italian prisoners, who included General Albertone, appear to have been treated as well as could be expected under difficult circumstances, though about 200 died of their wounds in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Prouty notes that Albertone was given into the care of Azaj Zamanel, commander of Empress Taytu's personal army, and &quot;had a tent to himself, a horse and servants&quot;. ''Empress Taytu'', pp. 169f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, 800 captured askaris, regarded as traitors by the Ethiopians, had their right hands and left feet amputated. Augustus Wylde records when he visited the battlefield months after the battle, the pile of severed hands and feet was still visible, &quot;a rotting heap of ghastly remnants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Augustus B. Wylde, ''Modern Abyssinia'' (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many had not survived their punishment, Wylde writing how the neighborhood of Adwa &quot;was full of their freshly dead bodies; they had generally crawled to the banks of the streams to quench their thirst, where many of them lingered unattended and exposed to the elements until death put an end to their sufferings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wylde, ''Modern Abyssinia'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; There does not appear to be any foundation for reports that some Italians were castrated and these may reflect confusion with the atrocious treatment of the askari prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Prouty has collected the few documented experiences of these POWs, none of whom claim to have been treated inhumanely (''Empress Taytu'', pp. 170–83). She repeats the opinion of the Italian historian [[Angelo del Boca]], that &quot;the paucity of the record is attributable to the glacial welcome received in Italy by the returning prisoners for having lost a war, and the fact that they were subjected to long interrogations when they debarked, were defrauded of their back pay, had their mementoes confiscated and were ordered not to talk to journalists&quot; (p. 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

Baratieri was relieved of his command and later charged with preparing an &quot;inexcusable&quot; plan of attack and for abandoning his troops in the field. He was acquitted on these charges but was described by the court martial judges as being &quot;entirely unfitted&quot; for his command. Chris Prouty offers a panoramic overview of the response in Italy to the news:
{{quote|When news of the calamity reached Italy there were street demonstrations in most major cities. In Rome, to prevent these violent protests, the universities and theatres were closed. Police were called out to disperse rock-throwers in front of Prime Minister Crispi's residence. Crispi resigned on 9 March. Troops were called out to quell demonstrations in Naples. In Pavia, crowds built barricades on the railroad tracks to prevent a troop train from leaving the station.  The Association of Women of Rome, Turin, Milan and Pavia called for the return of all military forces in Africa. Funeral masses were intoned for the known and unknown dead. Families began sending to the newspapers letters they had received before Adwa in which their menfolk described their poor living conditions and their fears at the size of the army they were going to face. King Umberto declared his birthday (14 March) a day of mourning. Italian communities in St. Petersburg, London, New York, Chicago, Buenos Aires and Jerusalem collected money for the families of the dead and for the Italian Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Prouty, ''Empress Taytu'', pp. 159f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One question much asked – both then and long afterward – is why did Emperor Menelik fail to follow up his victory and drive the routed Italians out of their colony? The victorious Emperor  limited his demands to little more than the abrogation of the deceptive [[Treaty of Wuchale]]. In the context of the prevailing balance of power, the emperor's crucial goal was to preserve Ethiopian independence. In addition, Ethiopia had just begun to emerge from a long and brutal [[Famines in Ethiopia|famine]]; Harold Marcus reminds us that the army was restive over its long service in the field, short of rations, and the short rains which would bring all travel to a crawl would soon start to fall.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, ''Menelik II'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Menelik claimed a shortage of cavalry horses with which to harry the fleeing soldiers. Chris Prouty observes that &quot;a failure of nerve on the part of Menelik has been alleged by both Italian and Ethiopian sources.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Prouty, ''Empress Taytu'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis believes that it &quot;was his farsighted certainty that total annihilation of Baratieri and a sweep into Eritrea would force the Italian people to turn a bungled colonial war into a national crusade&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Fashoda'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; that stayed his hand.

As a direct result of the battle, Italy signed the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]], recognizing Ethiopia as an independent state. Almost forty years later, on 3 October 1935, after the [[League of Nations]]'s weak response to the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], the Italians launched a new military campaign endorsed by [[Benito Mussolini]], the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. This time the Italians employed vastly superior military technology such as tanks and aircraft, as well as [[Chemical warfare]], the Ethiopian forces were soundly defeated by May 1936. Following the war, Italy occupied Ethiopia for five years (1936–41), before eventually being driven out during World War II by [[British Empire]] and Ethiopian patriot forces.

== Significance ==
The Russian state, as a sincere ally, enthusiastically paid victory compliments to the Ethiopian army. One of the documents of that time states, &quot;The Victory immediately gained the general sympathy of Russian society and it continued to grow.&quot; The unique outlook which polyethnic Russia exhibited to its ally Ethiopia disturbed many supporters of European nationalism during the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

&quot;The confrontation between Italy and Ethiopia at Adwa was a fundamental turning point in Ethiopian history,&quot; writes Henze. &quot;Though apparent to very few historians at the time, these defeats were the beginning of the decline of Europe as the center of world politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henze, ''Layers of Layers of Time'', p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, the Ethiopian historian [[Bahru Zewde]] observed that &quot;few events in the modern period have brought Ethiopia to the attention of the world as has the victory at Adwa;&quot; however, Bahru Zewde puts his emphasis on other elements of this triumph: &quot;The racial dimension was what lent Adwa particular significance. It was a victory of blacks over whites.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'' (London: James Currey, 1991), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

This defeat of a colonial power and the ensuing recognition of African sovereignty became rallying points for later African nationalists during their struggle for decolonization, as well as activists and leaders of the [[Pan-African]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Professor [[Kinfe Abraham]], &quot;The Impact of the Adowa Victory on The Pan-African and Pan-Black Anti-Colonial Struggle,&quot; Address delivered to The [[Institute of Ethiopian Studies]], Addis Ababa University, February 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Afrocentric]] scholar Molefe Asante explains,
{{quote|After the victory over Italy in 1896, Ethiopia acquired a special importance in the eyes of Africans as the only surviving African State. After Adowa, Ethiopia became emblematic of African valour and resistance, the bastion of prestige and hope to thousands of Africans who were experiencing the full shock of European conquest and were beginning to search for an answer to the myth of African inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;Molefe Asante, quoted in Rodney Worrell, ''Pan-africanism in Barbados'', (New Academia Publishing: 2005) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, many writers have pointed out how this battle was a humiliation for the Italian military. One student of Ethiopia, Donald N. Levine, points out that for the Italians Adwa &quot;became a national trauma which demagogic leaders strove to avenge. It also played no little part in motivating Italy's revanchist adventure in 1935&quot;. Levine also noted that the victory &quot;gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening the hand of those who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West - resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/Haile Selassie would have to contend&quot;

[[Image:Bistability.svg|thumb|350px|Balls marked &quot;1&quot; and &quot;3&quot; are in the two stable positions]]

'''Bistability''' is a fundamental phenomenon in nature. Something that is '''bistable''' can be resting in any of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to [[stored energy]]. The defining characteristic of bistability is simply that two stable states (minima) are separated by a peak (maximum).

In physics, for an [[Statistical ensemble|ensemble]] of particles, the bistability comes from the fact that its [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] has three [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]s. Two of them are [[minimum|minima]] and the last is a [[maximum]]. By mathematical arguments, the maximum must lie between the two minima. By default, the system state will be in either of the minima states, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualised as a barrier.

A transition from one state of minimal free energy requires some form of activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare [[activation energy]] and [[Arrhenius equation]] for the chemical case). After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the next state of lowest energy again. The time it takes is usually attributed the [[relaxation time]]. There might be uncertainty as to which state will be the new one, but it is often well defined in the situation.

[[Optical bistability]] is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input.

==In biological and chemical systems==
Bistability is key for understanding basic phenomena of cellular functioning, such as decision-making processes in [[cell cycle]] progression, [[cellular differentiation]], and [[apoptosis]]. It is also involved in loss of cellular homeostasis associated with early events in [[cancer]] onset and in [[prion]] diseases as well as in the origin of new species ([[speciation]]).&lt;ref name=Wilhelm&gt;{{cite journal |author = Wilhelm, T |year = 2009 |title = The smallest chemical reaction system with bistability |journal = BMC Systems Biology |volume = 3 |pages = 90 |doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-3-90 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/90 |pmid = 19737387 |pmc = 2749052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bistability can only arise in biological and chemical systems if three necessary conditions are fulfilled: positive [[feedback]], a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent explosions.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt;

Bistable chemical systems have been studied extensively to analyse relaxation kinetics, non-equilibrium [[thermodynamics]], [[stochastic resonance]], as well as [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt;

Bistability is often accompanied by [[hysteresis]]. On a population level, if many realisations of a bistable system are considered (e.g. many bistable cells ([[speciation]])&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{cite journal |author = Nielsen et al. |last2 = Dolganov |first2 = Nadia A. |last3 = Rasmussen |first3 = Thomas |last4 = Otto |first4 = Glen |last5 = Miller |first5 = Michael C. |last6 = Felt |first6 = Stephen A. |last7 = Torreilles |first7 = StéPhanie |last8 = Schoolnik |first8 = Gary K. |editor1-last = Isberg |year = 2010 |editor1-first = Ralph R. |title = A Bistable Switch and Anatomical Site Control Vibrio cholerae Virulence Gene Expression in the Intestine |journal = PloS Pathogens |volume = 6 |issue = 9 |pages = 1 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001102
|url=http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001102 |pmid = 20862321 |pmc = 2940755}}&lt;/ref&gt;), one typically observes [[bimodal distribution]]s.

==In mechanical systems==
Bistability as applied in the design of mechanical systems is more commonly said to be &quot;over centre&quot; -- that is, work is done on the system to move it just past the peak, at which point the mechanism goes &quot;over centre&quot; to its secondary stable position. The result is a toggle-type action. An especially common method of achieving an &quot;over centre&quot; action is to use a [[spring (device)|spring]].

As an example of a common over-centre device, a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] goes over centre as it is turned in the forward direction. In this case, &quot;over centre&quot; refers to the ratchet being stable and &quot;locked&quot; in a given position until clicked forward again; it has nothing to do with the ratchet being unable to turn in the reverse direction. Position &quot;1&quot; and position &quot;2&quot; in the figure above could be read as &quot;current tooth&quot; and &quot;next tooth.&quot;

'''Bjørn Lomborg''' (born January 6, 1965) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] author, academic, and environmental writer. He is an [[adjunct professor]] at the [[Copenhagen Business School]], director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre and a former director of the [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]]. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''.

In 2002, Lomborg and the [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of [[welfare economics]].

Until 2010 Lomborg campaigned against the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, and argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises as they are inevitable, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions, and on other important world problems such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition.

In 2010, in conjunction with an announcement of a forth-coming book,  Lomborg revised his position regarding [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation of anthropogenic global warming]]. He has consistently supported the position that global warming exists, but cost benefit analyses, as calculated by the [[Copenhagen Consensus]] ranked climate mitigation initiatives low on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004. In 2008, the issue of global warming saw an increase in its priority ranking, culminating with examination of a broader list of possible solutions. He announced his agreement with &quot;tens of billions of dollars a year to be invested in tackling climate change&quot; and declared global warming to be &quot;undoubtedly one of the chief concerns facing the world today&quot; and &quot;a challenge humanity must confront&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 100 Billion&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/aug/30/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-u-turn|title=Bjørn Lomborg: $100bn a year needed to fight climate change|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|date=30 August 2010|work=guardian.co.uk home Location|accessdate=30 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20100831/sc_yblog_upshot/noted-anti-global-warming-scientist-reverses-course Brett Michael Dykes, &quot;Noted anti-global-warming scientist reverses course&quot;, Yahoo News (August 31, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2010 interview with the [[New Statesman]], Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: &quot;Global warming is real - it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2010/09/interview-gay-climate&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Lomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the [[University of Georgia]], earned an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] degree in [[political science]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] in 1991, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in political science at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1994.

He lectured in [[statistics]] in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an [[assistant professor]] (1994&amp;ndash;1996) and [[associate professor]] (1997&amp;ndash;2005).  He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an [[Professors in the United States#Adjunct professor|Adjunct Professor]] at [[Copenhagen Business School]].

Early in his career his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in [[collective action]] [[Ethical dilemma|dilemmas]], simulation of [[political party|party]] behavior in [[Party-list proportional representation|proportional voting systems]], and the use of surveys in [[public administration]].  In 1996, Lomborg's paper, &quot;Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of [[Social structure|Social Structure]] in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma&quot;, was published in the [[academic journal]], ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.&lt;ref name=1996Nucleus&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the [[Environmental movement|environmental arena]].  His most famous book in this area is ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', whose English translation was published as a work in [[environmental economics]] by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited ''Global Crises, Global Solutions'', which presented the first conclusions of the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled ''Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming.''

==''The Skeptical Environmentalist''==
:''Main article:'' ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''

In 1998, Lomborg published four [[essay]]s about the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in the leading Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', which according to him &quot;resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lomborg.com/about/biography/ Bjørn Lomborg Biography], www.lomborg.com. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Why are these essays mentioned? Were they a trial run or short version of THE BOOK THIS SECTION IS ABOUT? --&gt;

In 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.

===Accusations of scientific dishonesty===
After the publication of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', Lomborg was accused of scientific dishonesty. Several environmental scientists brought a total of three complaints against Lomborg to the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] (DCSD), a body under Denmark's [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]]. The charges claimed that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

====DCSD investigation====
On January 6, 2003 the DCSD reached a decision on the complaints. The ruling was a mixed messages, deciding the book to be scientifically dishonest, but Lomborg himself not guilty because of lack of expertise in the fields in question:&lt;ref&gt;[http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2003 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13-Feb-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty. ...In view of the subjective requirements made in terms of intent or gross negligence, however, Bjørn Lomborg's publication cannot fall within the bounds of this characterization. Conversely, the publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.''

The DCSD cited ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' for:

#Fabrication of data;
#Selective discarding of unwanted results (selective citation);
#Deliberately [[systemic bias|misleading use of statistical methods]];
#Distorted interpretation of conclusions;
#[[Plagiarism]];
#Deliberate misinterpretation of others' results.

====MSTI review====
On February 13, 2003, Lomborg filed a complaint against the DCSD's decision, with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI), which has oversight over the DCSD.  On December 17, 2003, the Ministry annulled the decision made by DCSD. In doing so, MSTI cited several procedural errors, including:
* The DCSD did not provide specific statements on actual errors. On this point the MSTI stated &quot;the DCSD has not documented where [Dr. Lomborg] has allegedly been biased in his choice of data and in his argumentation, and&amp;nbsp;... the ruling is completely void of argumentation for why the DCSD find that the complainants are right in their criticisms of [his] working methods. It is not sufficient that the criticisms of a researcher's working methods exist; the DCSD must consider the criticisms and take a position on whether or not the criticisms are justified, and why.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* The DCSD did not use a precise standard for deciding &quot;good scientific practice&quot; in the [[social sciences]];{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* The DCSD's definition of &quot;objective scientific dishonesty&quot; was not clear about whether &quot;distortion of statistical data&quot; had to be deliberate or not;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* The DCSD had not properly documented that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' was a scientific publication on which they had the right to intervene in the first place;

The Ministry remitted the case to the DCSD. In doing so the Ministry indicated that it regarded the DCSD's previous findings of scientific dishonesty in regard to the book as invalid.&lt;ref name=forskdk&gt;{{Cite web

====DCSD response====
On March 12, 2004, the Committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=forskdk /&gt;

====Response of the scientific community====
The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm &quot;Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed&quot;]. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; among Danish academics. 308 scientists, many of them from the social sciences, criticised the DCSD's methods in the case and called for the DCSD to be disbanded.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD&gt;{{Cite web

Retrieved 13-Feb-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures (primarily from the medical and [[natural science]]s community) to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the Danish Research Agency.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD /&gt;

==Continued debate and criticism==
The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003-2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.

''[[The Lomborg Deception]]'' by [[Howard Friel]] claims to offer a &quot;careful analysis&quot; of the ways in which Lomborg has &quot;selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence&quot;.&lt;ref name=pk&gt;
Philip Kitcher. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5983/1230-a.pdf The Climate Change Debates] ''Science'', Vol. 328, 4 June 2010, p. 1232.&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg has denied the claims.

A Dutch [[think tank]], HAN, [[Heidelberg Appeal|Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands]], published a report in which they claimed 25 out of 27 accusations against Lomborg to be unsubstantiated or not to the point.&lt;ref&gt;Rörsch, Arthur, et al. [http://www.stichting-han.nl/Commentaren/algemeen/2.critical%20concideration1.doc &quot;A Critical Consideration of the Verdict of the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty on the Book by Bjorn Lomborg 'The Skeptical Environmentalist'&quot;]. Heidelberg Appeal the Netherlands, 4-April-2003. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A group of scientists with relation to this think tank also published an article in 2005 in the Journal of Information Ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rörsch, A. et al. |title=On the opposition against the book The Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=16–28 |year=2005 |month=Spring |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.

===Kåre Fog===
The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of ''Journal of Information Ethics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fog, K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=66–76 |year=2005 |month=Fall |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.2.66}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called &quot;the Galileo hypothesis&quot;, which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition.

Kåre Fog has established a catalogue of criticisms against Lomborg on the ''Lomborg-errors'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 | url = http://www.lomborg-errors.dk
 | title = Lomborg-errors
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fog maintains the catalogue, which includes a section for each page in each chapter in ''The Skeptical Environmentalist''. In each section, Fog lists and details what he believes to be flaws and errors in Lomborg's work. Fog explicitly indicates if there are any details which he believes support the interpretation that the particular error may have been made deliberately by Lomborg, in order to mislead. Lomborg has on numerous occasions commented and defended himself against Kåre Fog's critique, especially in the web-book &quot;Godhedens Pris&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/102-file/Reply_to_Skeptical_Questions.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Further career==
===Government work===
In March 2002, the newly elected [[Centre-right|center-right]] [[prime minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI). On June 22, 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus, saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which seeks to establish priorities for advancing [[world|global]] welfare using methodologies based on the theory of [[welfare economics]]. A panel of prominent [[economics|economists]] was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government, and co-sponsored by ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]].

===Further books===
''Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems'', published in 2007, offers an &quot;...&amp;nbsp;overview of twenty-three of the world's biggest problems relating to the environment, governance, economics, and health and population. Leading economists provide a short survey of the state-of-the-art analysis and sketch out some policy solutions for which they provide cost-benefit ratios.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521715970&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming]]'', also published in 2007, argues against taking immediate and &quot;drastic&quot; action to curb greenhouse gases while simultaneously stating that &quot;Global warming is happening. It's a serious and important problem&amp;nbsp;...&quot;. He argues that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the cost and benefits of the proposed measures against global warming. ...&amp;nbsp;is the worst way to spend our money. Climate change is a 100-year problem&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; we should not try to fix it in 10 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0462099121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Friel]] wrote a book entitled ''[[The Lomborg Deception]]'', which criticizes Lomborg, claiming that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/233942? |title=Debunking Lomborg, the Climate-Change Skeptic |publisher=newsweek.com |accessdate=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg has denied these claims in a public rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;http://lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/118-file/BL%20reply%20to%20Howard%20Friel.pdf?PHPSESSID=472777bb754a1c0c02d803620257a62a&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Lomborg appeared to reverse his position on global warming in an interview with [[the Guardian]]. He revealed that he endorses the use of a carbon tax to fight climate change in his latest book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 100 Billion&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Lomborg is [[gay]] and a [[vegetarian]].&lt;ref name=NewStatesman&gt;{{Cite web| title=The man who demanded a recount | first=Jason | last=Cowley | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200306300013 | date=2003-06-30 | accessdate=2007-07-24 | publisher=[[New Statesman]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[public figure]] he has been a participant in information campaigns in Denmark about homosexuality, and states that &quot;Being a public gay is to my view a civic responsibility. It's important to show that the width of the gay world cannot be described by a tired stereotype, but goes from leather gays on parade-wagons to suit-and-tie yuppies on the direction floor, as well as everything in between&quot;&lt;ref name=OBLS&gt;{{Cite web| title=OBLS personer: Bjørn Lomborg | accessdate=2007-06-12 | url=http://www.dr.dk/obls/personer-lomborg.html | publisher=[[Danmarks Radio]]}} - translated.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognitions and awards==
In November 2001, Lomborg was selected &quot;Global Leader for Tomorrow&quot; by the [[World Economic Forum]].
In June 2002, [[BusinessWeek]] named Lomborg one of the &quot;50 Stars of Europe&quot; (June 17), in the category of Agenda Setters. The magazine noted, &quot;No matter what they think of his views, nobody denies that Bjorn Lomborg has shaken the environmental movement to its core.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/@@*f80dYcQmsnuwBwA/magazine/content/02_24/b3787628.htm The Stars of Europe - Agenda Setters - Bjorn Lomborg].

==Discussions in the media==
After the release of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the [[News media|media]], where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international [[mass media]]. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and [[Publishing|print media]] around the world.
* ''[[Scientific American]]'' published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own [[website]], quoting the article at such length that ''Scientific American'' threatened to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in [[PDF]] format on ''Scientific American'''s site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF &quot;Bjørn Lomborg’s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)&quot;].

Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Economist]]'' defended Lomborg, claiming the panel of experts that had criticised Lomborg in ''Scientific American'' was both biased and did not actually counter Lomborg's book. ''The Economist'' argued that the panel's opinion had come under no scrutiny at all, and that Lomborg's responses had not been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1522706 &quot;Thought control&quot;].

*''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the U.S. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television programme featured an episode entitled &quot;Environmental Hysteria&quot; in which Lomborg criticised what he claimed was environmentalists' refusal to accept a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental questions, and stressed the need to prioritise some issues above others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=eh ''Bullshit'', &quot;Environmental Hysteria&quot;].

[[File:Karta ID Maluku isl.PNG|right|250px|thumb|Location of the Banda Islands among the [[Maluku Islands]] ]]

The '''Banda Islands''' ({{lang-id|Kepulauan Banda}}) are a [[volcanic group]] of ten small [[volcanic]] [[island]]s in the [[Banda Sea]], about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Seram Island]] and about {{convert|2000|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Java (island)|Java]], and are part of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Maluku (Indonesian province)|Maluku]]. The main town and administrative centre is [[Bandanaira]], located on the island of the same name. They rise out of 4–6&amp;nbsp;km deep ocean and have a total land area of approximately 180&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They have a population of about 15,000.  Until the mid 19th century the Banda Islands were the world's only source of the spices [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], produced from the nutmeg tree. The islands are also popular destinations for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]]. 
== History ==
===Pre-European history===
Before the arrival of Europeans, Banda had an [[oligarchic]] form of government led by ''orang kaya'' ('rich men') and the Bandanese had an active and independent role in trade throughout the archipelago.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp24&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | page =24  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Banda was the world's only source of [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], spices used as flavourings, medicines, preserving agents, that were at the time highly valued in European markets; sold by [[Arab]] traders to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]s for exorbitant prices. The traders did not divulge the exact location of their source and no European was able to deduce their location. 

The first written accounts of Banda are in ''Suma Oriental'', a book written by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[apothecary]] [[Tomé Pires]] who based in Malacca from 1512 to 1515 but who visited Banda several times. On his first visit, he interviewed the Portuguese and the far more knowledgeable Malay sailors in Malacca. He estimated the early sixteenth century population to be 2500-3000. He reported the Bandanese as being part of an Indonesia-wide trading network and the only native Malukan long-range traders taking cargo to [[Malacca]], although shipments from Banda were also being made by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders. 

In addition to the production of nutmeg and mace, Banda maintained significant entrepot trade; goods that moved through Banda included cloves from [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in the north, [[Birds of Paradise|bird of paradise]] feathers from the [[Aru Islands]] and western [[New Guinea]], ''massoi'' bark for traditional medicines, and slaves. In exchange, Banda predominantly received rice and cloth; namely light cotton ''[[batik]]'' from [[Java]], ''[[Calico (textile)|calicoes]]'' from [[India]] and ''[[ikat]]'' from the [[Lesser Sundas]].  In 1603, an average quality ''[[sarong]]''-sized cloth traded for eighteen kilograms of nutmeg.  Some of these textiles were then on-sold, ending up in [[Halmahera]] and [[New Guinea]].  Coarser ''ikat'' from the Lesser Sundas was traded for [[sago]] from the [[Kei Islands]], [[Aru Islands|Aru]] and [[Seram]].

===Portuguese===
In August 1511 on behalf of the king of [[Portugal]], [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]], which at the time was the hub of Asian trade. In November of that year, after having secured Malacca and learning of the Bandas' location, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships led by his good friend [[António de Abreu]] to find them. [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] pilots, either recruited or forcibly conscripted, guided them via [[Java]], the [[Lesser Sundas]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] to Banda, arriving in early 1512.&lt;ref&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7; {{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton  | coauthors =  | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Europeans to reach the Bandas, the expedition remained in Banda for about one month, purchasing and filling their ships with Banda's nutmeg and mace, and with [[clove]]s in which Banda had a thriving [[entrepôt]] trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;HANNARDp7&quot;&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7&lt;/ref&gt; D'Abreu sailed through [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] while his second in command [[Francisco Serrão]] went ahead towards Maluku islands, was shipwrecked and ended up in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp25&quot;/&gt; Distracted by hostilities else where in the archipelago, such as Ambon and Ternate, the Portuguese did not return until 1529; a Portuguese trader Captain Garcia landed troops in the Bandas. Five of the Banda islands were within gunshot of each other and he realised that a fort on the main island Neira would give him full control of the group. The Bandanese were however hostile to such a plan and their warlike antics were both costly and tiresome to Garcia whose men were attacked when they attempted to build a fort. From then on, the Portuguese were infrequent visitors to the islands preferring to buy their nutmeg from traders in Malacca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton  | coauthors =  | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other eastern Indonesian islands, such as [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Solor]], [[Ternate]] and [[Morotai]], the Bandanese displayed no enthusiasm for Christianity or the Europeans who brought it in the sixteenth century, and no serious attempt was made to Christianise the Bandanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp25&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1993  | location =London  | page =25  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining their independence, the Bandanese never allowed the Portuguese to build a fort or a permanent post in the islands. Ironically though, it was this lack of ports which brought the Dutch to trade at Banda instead of the clove islands of Ternate and Tidore.

===Coming of the Dutch===
[[Image:Fort Nassau 1646.jpg|right|thumb|Fort Nassau in 1646]]
The Dutch followed the Portuguese to Banda but were to have a much more dominating and lasting presence. Dutch-Bandanese relations were mutually resentful from the outset, with Holland’s first merchants complaining of Bandanese reneging on agreed deliveries and price, and cheating on quantity and quality. For the Bandanese, on the other hand, although they welcomed another competitor purchaser for their spices, the items of trade offered by the Dutch&amp;mdash;heavy woollens, and damasks, unwanted manufactured goods, for example&amp;mdash;were usually unsuitable in comparison to traditional trade products. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Arab]] and [[India]]n, and Portuguese traders for example brought indispensable items along steel knives, copper, medicines and prized [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]].

As much as the Dutch disliked dealing with the Bandanese, the trade was a highly profitable one with spices selling for 300 times the purchase price in Banda. This amply justified the expense and risk in shipping them to Europe. The allure of such profits saw an increasing number of Dutch expeditions; it was soon seen that competition from each would eat into all their profits. Thus the competitors united to form the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)'' (the ‘[[Dutch East Indies Company]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;uclwxl&quot;&gt;Hannard (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early seventeenth century the Bandas were ruled by a group of leading citizens, the ''orang kaya'' (literally 'rich men'), each of these was a head of district. At the time nutmeg was one of the &quot;fine spices&quot; kept expensive in Europe by disciplined manipulation of the market, but a desirable commodity for Dutch traders in the ports of India as well; economic historian [[Fernand Braudel]] notes that India consumed twice as much as Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel 1984, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Banda’s ''orang kaya'' were persuaded (or deceived) by the Dutch to sign a treaty granting the Dutch a monopoly on spice purchases. Even though the Bandanese had little understanding of the significance of the treaty known as 'The Eternal Compact', or that not all Bandanese leaders had signed, it would later be used to justify Dutch troops being brought in to defend their monopoly. 

The Bandanese soon grew tired of the Dutch actions; the low prices, the useless trade items, and the enforcement of Dutch sole rights to the purchase of the coveted spices. The end of the line for the Bandanese came in 1609 when the Dutch reinforced Fort Nassau on Bandanaira Island. The ''orang kaya'' called a meeting with the Dutch admiral and forty of his highest-ranking men and ambushed and killed them all.&lt;ref name = &quot;uclwxl&quot;/&gt;

===English-Dutch rivalry===
[[Image:Fort Belgica 1824.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Belgica in 1824]]
While Portuguese and Spanish activity in the region had weakened, the English had built fortified trading posts on tiny Ai and Run islands, ten to twenty kilometres from the main Banda Islands. With the British paying higher prices, they were significantly undermining Dutch aims for a monopoly. As Dutch-British tensions increased, the Dutch built, in 1611, the larger and more strategic Fort Belgica, located above Fort Nassau.  In 1615, the Dutch invaded Ai with 900 men and the British retreated to Run where they regrouped. That same night, the British launched a surprise counter-attack on Ai, retaking the island and killing 200 Dutchmen. A year later, a much stronger Dutch force attacked Ai. The defenders were able to hold off the attack with cannon fire, but after a month of siege the defenders ran out of ammunition. The Dutch slaughtered the defendants. The Dutch strengthened the fort and renamed it 'Fort Revenge'. European control of the Bandas was contested up until 1667 when, under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]], the British traded the small island of [[Run (island)|Run]] for [[Manhattan]], giving the Dutch full control of the Banda archipelago.

On August 9, 1810. The British captured the Islands and accepted their surrender from the Dutch after engaging the fortifications in action by Captain C. Cole, with the British warships [[HMS  Caroline (1795)|''Caroline'']] (36 guns), [[French frigate Piémontaise (1804)|''Piedmontaise'']] (38 guns), Captain Foote, [[HMS Barracouta (1807)|''Barracouta'']] ( 18 guns), Captain Kenah, and [[HMS Mandarin (1810)|''Mandarin'']] (12 guns). Kenah had on board about one hundred men of the Madras European Regiment. He had sailed from Madras with supplies for [[Amboyna]], which the British had captured in February.

===Massacre of the Bandanese===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Militairen bij het standbeeld van Koning Willem III op Banda TMnr 10018594.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonial soldiers standing guard next to the statue of [[King Willem III of the Netherlands]], representing [[Dutch empire|Dutch dominance]] on Banda.]]

Newly-appointed VOC governor-general [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] set about enforcing Dutch monopoly over the Banda’s spice trade. In 1621 well-armed soldiers were landed on Bandaneira Island and within a few days they had also occupied neighbouring and larger Lontar. The ''orang kaya'' were forced at gunpoint to sign an unfeasibly arduous treaty, one that was in fact impossible to keep, thus providing Coen an excuse to use superior Dutch force against the Bandanese.&lt;ref name = &quot;uclwxl&quot;/&gt; The Dutch quickly noted a number of alleged violations of the new treaty, in response to which Coen launched a punitive massacre. Japanese mercenaries were hired to deal with the ''orang kaya'', forty of whom were beheaded with their heads impaled and displayed on bamboo spears.

The population of the Banda Islands prior to Dutch conquest is generally estimated to have been around 13-15,000 people, some of whom were Malay and Javanese traders, as well as Chinese and Arabs. The actual numbers of Bandanese who were killed, forcibly expelled or fled the islands in 1621 remain uncertain. But readings of historical sources suggest around one thousand Bandanese likely survived in the islands, and were spread throughout the nutmeg groves as forced labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna 1991, p.54; Loth 1995, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch subsequently re-settled the islands with imported slaves, convicts and indentured labourers (to work the nutmeg plantations), as well as immigrants from elsewhere in Indonesia. Most survivors fled as refugees to the islands of their trading partners, in particular [[Keffing]] and [[Guli Guli]] in the [[Seram|Seram Laut]] chain and [[Kei Islands|Kei Besar]].&lt;ref name = &quot;uclwxl&quot;/&gt; Shipments of surviving Bandanese were also sent to Batavia ([[Jakarta]]) to work as slaves in developing the city and its fortress. Some 530 of these individuals were later returned to the islands because of their much-needed expertise in nutmeg cultivation (something sorely lacking among newly-arrived Dutch settlers).&lt;ref&gt;Hanna 1991, p.55; Loth 1995, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas up until this point the Dutch presence had been simply as traders, that was sometimes treaty-based, the Banda conquest marked the start of the first overt colonial rule in Indonesia albeit under the auspices of the VOC.

===VOC Monopoly===
[[Image:Banda Neira 1724.jpg|thumb|right|Banda Neira in 1724]]
Having decimated the islands' population, Coen divided the productive land of approximately half a million nutmeg trees into sixty-eight 1.2-hectare ''perken''. These land parcels were then handed to Dutch planters known as ''perkeniers'' of which 34 were on Lontar, 31 on Ai and 3 on Neira.  With few Bandanese left to work them, slaves from elsewhere  were brought in. Now enjoying control of the nutmeg production the VOC paid the ''perkeniers'' 1/122nd of the Dutch market price for nutmeg, however, the ''perkeniers'' still profited immensely building substantial villas with opulent imported European decorations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The outlying island of Run was harder for the VOC to control and they exterminated all nutmeg trees there. The production and export of nutmeg was a VOC monopoly for almost two hundred years. [[Fort Belgica]], one of many forts built by the [[Dutch East India Company]], is one of the largest remaining European forts in Indonesia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[Religion|Religious]] violence between Christians and Muslims, spilling over from intercommunal conflict in Ambon affected the islands in the late 1990s. The disturbance and resulting deaths damaged the previously prosperous [[tourism]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;Witton, Patrick (2003). Indonesia. Melbourne: Lonely Planet. ISBN 1-74059-154-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
There are seven inhabited islands and several that are uninhabited.  The inhabited islands are:

The islands are part of the [[Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests]] [[ecoregion]].

Most of the present-day inhabitants of the Banda Islands are descended from migrants and plantation labourers from various parts of Indonesia, as well as from indigenous Bandanese. They have inherited aspects of pre-colonial ritual practices in the Bandas that are highly valued and still performed, giving them a distinct and very local cultural identity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In addition, Bandanese speak a distinct [[Malay Dialect]] which has several features distinguishing it from [[Ambonese Malay]], the better-known and more widespread dialect that forms a lingua franca in central and southeast Maluku. Bandanese Malay is famous in the region for its unique, lilting accent, but it also has a number of locally identifying words in its lexicon, many of them borrowings or [[loanwords]] from [[Dutch language|Dutch]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
[[Image:BandaVolcanoSeenFromFortBelgica.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Banda Api as seen from Fort Belgica on Banda Neira.]]
Examples :
* fork	: forok (Dutch vork)
* ants	: mir (Dutch mier)
* spoon	: lepe (Dutch lepel)
* difficult : lastek (Dutch lastig)
* floor : plur (Dutch vloer)
* porch: stup (Dutch stoep)

Banda Malay shares many [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] loanwords with Ambonese Malay not appearing in the national language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. But it has comparatively fewer, and they differ in pronunciation.

Examples :
* turtle : tetaruga (Banda Malay); totoruga (Ambonese Malay) (from Portuguese tartaruga)
* throat : gargontong (Banda Malay); gargangtang (Ambonese Malay) (from Portuguese garganta)

Finally, and most noticeably, Banda Malay uses some distinct pronouns. The most immediately distinguishing is that of the second person singular familiar form of address: pané.

The descendants of some of the Bandanese who fled Dutch conquest in the seventeenth century live in the [[Kai Islands]] (Kepulauan Kei) to the east of the Banda group, where a version of the original [[Banda language (Indonesian)|Banda language]] is still spoken in the villages of Banda Eli and Banda Elat on Kai Besar Island. While long integrated into Kei Island society, residents of these settlements continue to value the historical origins of their ancestors.

}}The '''Brisbane Broncos''' are an Australian professional [[rugby league football]] club based in the city of [[Brisbane]], the capital of the state of Queensland. Founded in 1988, the Broncos play in Australasia's elite competition, the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership. They have won six premierships in the premierships and two [[World Club Challenge]]s. The Broncos have also achieved four [[minor premiership]]s during their twenty-two years in competition, making them the League's most successful club over the past two decades. Brisbane have never been defeated in a [[grand final]] and, between 1991 and 2009, never failed to qualify for the finals. In 2010, Brisbane finished 10th in the NRL premiership, failing to make the semi finals for the first time in 19 years.

The club has one of the largest fan bases in Australia and has the highest average attendance of any [[rugby football|rugby]] club in the world; 36,336 in the [[2010 NRL season]].&lt;ref&gt;http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/2009.html&lt;/ref&gt; The club records the highest annual revenue of all NRL clubs and has been named Australia's most popular and most watched football team of any code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The club was founded in 1988 as part of the [[Winfield Cup]]'s national expansion, becoming, along with the [[Gold Coast Chargers#Gold Coast-Tweed Giants|Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]], one of Queensland's first two participants in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]]. The Broncos later became a dominant force in that competition before playing a significant role in the [[Super League War]] of the mid-1990s, then continuing to compete successfully in the reunified National Rugby League competition of today.

The Broncos are based in the Brisbane suburb of [[Red Hill, Queensland|Red Hill]] where their training ground and Leagues club are located, but they play their home games at [[Milton, Queensland|Milton]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium]]. They are also the only publicly listed sporting club on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ({{asx|BBL}}).

==History==
{{Main|History of the Brisbane Broncos}}
Queensland’s success in the 1980s' [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]], the representative fixture between Queensland and [[New South Wales]], in addition to the inclusion of a Combined Brisbane team in the [[Amco Cup|mid-week competition]], convinced the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) to invite a Queensland-based team into the competition.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt; After tough competition between the various syndicates for the Brisbane license, the [[Queensland Rugby League]] chose the bid of former [[Brisbane Rugby League]] (BRL) players, [[Barry Maranta]] and [[Paul Morgan (rugby league)|Paul &quot;Porky&quot; Morgan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Darren Lockyer cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Darren Lockyer]] playing for the Broncos in 2004. Lockyer made his Broncos debut in 1995 and is the current captain of the team.]]
The Broncos secured the services of [[Australian Kangaroos]] captain [[Wally Lewis]] and former [[BRL]] coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]].&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt; The team made their debut in the NSWRL's [[1988 Winfield Cup]] premiership against reigning premiers, the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]], and defeated them 44–10. However after this promising start they failed to make the finals. In their [[1989 Brisbane Broncos season|second season]] they won the mid-week knockout competition, the [[1989 Panasonic Cup]]. The club first tasted [[1992_Brisbane_Broncos_season#Grand final|premiership success in 1992]], and [[1993_Brisbane_Broncos_season#Grand final|again in 1993]], defeating the [[St. George Dragons]] in both years.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Pramberg, Bernie and Malone, Paul and Colman, Mike and Dick, Barry| title= Broncos: 20 Fabulous Years | publisher={{sic|Play|right|hide=y}} Publishing Pty Ltd | year=2007| isbn=0-9775226-4-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brisbane Broncos 1995|1995]], the [[Super League War]] broke out.  After threats of expulsion from the NSWRL, the Broncos were one of the first clubs to sign with the new league and all players followed suit. Broncos CEO [[John Ribot]] moved to take over the running of the rebel [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], leading to a perception that the conflict was orchestrated by the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncshistory&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan &amp; Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs| publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004| isbn=1-74110-075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos History RL1908 |url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brisbane won the only [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|Super League premiership]] in [[Brisbane Broncos 1997|1997]], before winning the first National Rugby League trophy in the re-unified [[Brisbane Broncos 1998|1998]] competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

[[Brisbane Broncos 1999|1999]] was disappointing for the club with a terrible early-season form hindering their attempt at a third consecutive premiership losing 8 of their first 10 matches. Club legend [[Allan Langer]] retired mid-season, perhaps as a result of the team's form. Despite the club's mid-season turnaround, which resulted in qualification for the finals after an 11-match winning streak, the team was eliminated by the [[Cronulla Sharks]] in the first week of the finals.  However, the Broncos' rebounded in 2000 with their fifth premiership, defeating the [[Sydney Roosters]]. The game marked the retirement of veterans [[Kevin Walters]] and [[Michael Hancock (rugby league)|Michael Hancock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:NRL Grand Final 2006.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The 2006 Grand final at [[Stadium Australia]].]]
Allan Langer returned to the club in [[Brisbane Broncos 2002|2002]] for one season before eventually retiring. 2002 was also the beginning of Brisbane's &quot;post-Origin slump&quot;, which has haunted the club in the years since. Many players represent [[Queensland state rugby league team|Queensland]] in the State of Origin series, with 7 Broncos players on average included in the Queensland Origin team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos – Representative Players|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?MenuID=330&amp;TopMenuID=266| accessdate=21 April 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extra workload has caused a loss of form for the club immediately after the series, evidenced in 2003 when the ladder-leading Broncos lost 10 of their last 11 games.  Despite faring better in [[Brisbane Broncos 2004|2004]] and [[Brisbane Broncos 2005|2005]], the team still struggled in the latter stages of the season, losing all of their finals matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

In [[Brisbane Broncos 2006|2006]], after a strong early and mid-season performance, the Broncos again entered the post-Origin slump, losing 5 consecutive games. However, they reversed this run of form, winning 6 of their last 7 games including the premiership decider against the [[Melbourne Storm]] and keeping their perfect Grand Final record intact.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt; After a dismal 2007 season in which they only scraped into the finals, coach Wayne Bennett announced he would leave at the end of 2008 after twenty-one years as coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fox Sports|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,23162743-23214,00.html|title=Bennett tells players he's leaving|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Henjak]], a former rugby league player who had been assistant coach with the Broncos since the beginning of 2006, was named their second-ever coach, commencing as coach for the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/19/2221586.htm|publisher=''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]''|title=Henjak name Broncos coach|date=19 April 2008|accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2009 season included their worst-ever post-Origin slump, featuring three matches in a row where the opposing team scored more than 40 points, concluding with a 56–0 loss to Canberra on 1 August 2009. They rallied around and in their match against Penrith two rounds later, they won 58–24. This snapback (after Penrith, they won the rest of their games that season) got them into the finals for the 18th year running, but they fell against Melbourne in the 3rd preliminary final by 40–10.

Their 2010 season started moderately: a 30–24 win against North Queensland, a 14–22 loss to Canberra, and a 48–16 hammering by the Warriors on 28 March 2010. On Monday 29 March, former Broncos player and recruitment agent Allan Langer was caught drink-driving in Brisbane's northside.&lt;ref&gt;The Courier-Mail, 30 March 2010 and various other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a late season 10–6 win against eventual premiers [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St George Illawarra]], the 2010 season was one to forget; with injuries and poor form seeing the Broncos out of the finals for the first time since 1991. The Broncos missing the finals now means that every club has missed the finals at least once since the 2002 season.

In February 2011, it was announced Ivan Henjak was leaving the club, and Anthony Griffin would take over as coach for the 2011 Season.

The representative playing list of the Brisbane Broncos has traditionally been extensive due to the club's premiership success and being the dominant Queensland team in the competition for the majority of its participation.Dan Reid is currently in the toyota cup and scoring more tries then darren lockyer. Consequently, there have been a large number of Queensland Maroons in the team. In 2007, a 20 man legends team was announced to celebrate the club's 20 year anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Broncos Name Legends Team | url=http://www.nrl.com/News/Latest/NewsArticle/tabid/76/NewsId/5007/Default.aspx | accessdate=9 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics and records==
{{details|Brisbane Broncos Records}}
The Brisbane Broncos are the most successful club in terms of percentage of total games won, having won 65.80% of their games. This is more than 5% better than the second-placed club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Win-Loss Records / All Teams | url=http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_wl.html | accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their twenty completed seasons, the club has made a total of six Grand Finals, winning each time, and have made the finals for the past sixteen seasons. They are one of only two clubs to have won the [[World Club Challenge]] twice, and were the first club to do so on British soil. They also won the now defunct [[Amco Cup|Panasonic Cup]] in [[1989 Panasonic Cup|1989]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

Current team captain Darren Lockyer holds the record for the most First Grade games for the club. Lockyer also holds the record for the most points scored for the club, tallying 1,171 since his debut in 1995, and the club record of 272 points in a season, having achieved this in 1998. [[Steve Renouf]] holds the record for the most career tries for the club with 142. Renouf also shares the club record for the most number of tries in a season with [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]] at 23. [[Lote Tuqiri]]'s tally of 26 points from three tries and seven goals in a single match against the [[Northern Eagles]] remains the club record for most individual points in a game.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncsrecords&quot;/&gt; [[Corey Parker (rugby league)|Corey Parker]] holds the record for most goals in a game kicking ten in a round one clash of 2008, breaking the previous mark of nine kicked by Lockyer in 1998 and matched by [[Michael De Vere]] in 2001. Parker converted ten from ten goals in the Broncos 48–12 win over the [[Penrith Panthers]] in which Parker scored 24 points placing him in equal second place on the most points in a match tally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/lockyer-gets-rousing-welcome-from-fans/20080316-1zqx.html|title=Lockyer gets rousing welcome from fans|date=16 March 2008|accessdate=16 March 2008 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Wayne | last=Heming}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six players have scored four tries in a match for the Brisbane Broncos including [[Steve Renouf]], [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Karmichael Hunt]], [[Justin Hodges]], [[Denan Kemp]] and [[Israel Folau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsrecords&quot;&gt;2006 Official Rugby League Annual.

==Stadium==
{{Main|Brisbane Broncos Stadiums}}
[[Image:Last broncos game at anz.jpg|thumb|250px|The Brisbane Broncos, at the then-ANZ Stadium (1993–2003).]]
In their first five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at [[Lang Park]], the ground considered to be the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust, the team relocated to [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;/&gt; The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's premiership title in the previous season.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncscrowd&quot;/&gt; However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712.

[[Image:Suncorpstadium071006.JPG|thumb|250px|left|View of the current Brisbane Broncos home ground, Suncorp Stadium.]]
With the Queensland Government's $280,000,000 redevelopment of Lang Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Suncopr Stadium Land Park Redevelopment |url=http://www.arup.com/australasia/project.cfm?pageid=1354 | accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team moved back to the refurbished and renamed Suncorp Stadium upon its completion in mid-2003. The more centrally-located stadium has begun to attract larger crowds, with the 2006 average attendance of 31,208 being significantly higher than the [[Newcastle Knights]] with 21,848 and about double the regular season competition average of 15,601.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncscrowd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club record attendance for a regular season match is 58,593, set against the St. George Dragons in the final round of the 1993 season. The record attendance for a match at Suncorp Stadium is 52,255 set in the semi-final match of the 2008 season, against the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncscrowd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem and colours==
[[Image:brisbane 1988.jpg|thumb|150px|The club's original logo, used from 1988 to 1999.]]It had originally been planned for the Brisbane Broncos to adopt a logo incorporating both a [[kangaroo]] and a stylised &quot;Q&quot; which had been featured in the logo for the Queensland Rugby League for many years. However, with the [[Australian national rugby league team]] also known as the Kangaroos, this was deemed inappropriate and conflicting. The state flower the [[Cooktown Orchid]] and the [[Poinsettia]] which had long been used by Brisbane representative teams in the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] and midweek knockout competitions was also ruled out, along with other [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animals]] such as the [[brumby]], [[possum]], [[galah]] and the [[kookaburra]], which was used on Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen [[Paddle steamer|paddleships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat | publisher=University of Queensland Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-7022-3275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having wanted to continue with the use of [[alliteration]] for local sporting teams such as the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and [[Brisbane Bears]], the club's directors eventually decided on the nickname [[Bronco]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncshistory&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan &amp; Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs | publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004 | isbn=1-74110-075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original club logo was first featured in the Broncos' inaugural season in the premiership in 1988 and was used until 1999. It used a mostly gold colour scheme, in line with the predominant colour on the team jerseys. In 2000, the club adopted a new logo with a more maroon design, which was much closer to the traditional colour associated with Queensland rugby league and Queensland sport in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt; This design continues to be used to date.

Traditionally, the colours of the Brisbane Broncos have been maroon, white and gold, which have all long been linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially, the founders of the club favoured the official blue and gold colours of [[Brisbane City Council]]. However, Sydney advertiser [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]] advised the board that &quot;Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot;/&gt; As a result, the traditional maroon and white colours of Queensland along with gold, symbolising the Queensland sunshine,&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack   | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat   | publisher=University of Queensland Press   | year=2002  | isbn=0-7022-3275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; were adopted as the club's colours.

In the inaugural 1988 season, the club's jersey design featured the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon and white and the bottom third being maroon. Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to differentiate from the maroon and white of [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and the maroon of the [[Queensland State of Origin team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;/&gt; Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue was added to the jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favour of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

At the 1995 [[Rugby League World Sevens]] tournament, the club introduced a new combination of jersey colours – mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it &quot;will become our Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bronco! Magazine Issue 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, following the release of the club's predominantly white with navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the National Rugby League ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the [[Penrith Panthers]], Melbourne Storm and [[New Zealand Warriors]]. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn, which was much derided by the local media. Following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favour of the design worn against Newcastle in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

The '''Brisbane Lions''' are an [[Australian rules football]] club which plays in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). The club is based in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]]. The club was formed from the merger of the [[Brisbane Bears]] and the [[Fitzroy Lions]] in 1996. It is the most successful AFL club of the last decade (2000–2009), having appeared in four consecutive [[AFL Grand Final]]s between [[2001 AFL season|2001]] and [[2004 AFL season|2004]], winning three (2001, 2002 and 2003).

==History==
On 4 July 1996 the Australian Football League (AFL) approved the first ever club merger in VFL/AFL history. The [[Brisbane Bears]] and the [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy Lions]] combined to form the '''Brisbane Lions'''. The merged entity played its home games at [[The Gabba]].

Prior to the merge the [[Brisbane Bears]] had enjoyed a successful season, losing a preliminary final to the eventual premiers, [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]]. In contrast, [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] had finished in last place for two successive seasons, although they contained a number of promising young players.

The Brisbane Lions were officially launched on 1 November 1996, joining the national competition in 1997.

===The Lions: 1997–2000===
[[File:2006 AFL Brisbane Lions.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Brisbane Lions logo from 2001–2009]]
In their first year in the AFL the Lions made the finals, finishing in eighth position after being defeated by the [[St Kilda Football Club]] in a Qualifying Final. The following year, however, they finished in last position, despite boasting a talented playing list. Accordingly, inaugural coach [[John Northey]] was sacked with eight rounds remaining in the season. During the off-season the club hired [[Leigh Matthews]], who in 1990 had delivered Collingwood its first premiership since 1958.

Matthews, who was voted ''&quot;Player of the Century&quot;'' in 2000, played his entire career with [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and brought many of the Hawthorn disciplines to the Lions. Within a season the Lions rose from the bottom of the ladder to 4th, before losing to the eventual Premiers the Kangaroos in the Preliminary Final.

===Triple premiership success: 2001–2003===
The club won its first AFL Premiership by defeating [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 15.18 (108) to 12.10 (82) in the [[2001 AFL Grand Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=AFL Clubs| publisher=AFL| url=http://cms.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/AFL_Clubs.pdf| accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lions utility player [[Shaun Hart]] won the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best on ground in the [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]].&lt;ref name=GF&gt;{{Cite book| last=Lovett| first=Michael (Chief editor)| title=AFL Record Season Guide| publisher=Geoff Slattery Media Group| year=2010| isbn=978-0-9806274-5-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|521}} On the morning after winning the flag, the club took the Premiership Cup to the [[Brunswick Street Oval]] in Fitzroy, the original home of the [[Fitzroy Football Club]]. It was an important way of connecting with Melbourne-based Lions fans, many of whom had previously supported Fitzroy, and of winning over disaffected Fitzroy fans who had not started supporting the Brisbane Lions post-merger by honouring the history of the club. The Premiership Cup then made its historic first trip to Brisbane, a traditionally [[rugby league]] focused city.

In the same year, Brisbane Lion (and former Bear) midfielder [[Jason Akermanis]] won the league's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]].&lt;ref name=GF/&gt;{{rp|508}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Mottram| first=Linda| title=Akermanis wins Brownlow medal| publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]| date=2001-01-25| url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s374998.htm| accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Lions won back-to-back Premierships when they defeated [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] 9.12.66 to 10.15.75 in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final]] in cold and wet conditions at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Early in the contest the Lions lost both ruckman Beau McDonald and utility player Martin Pike (who had already amassed 9 possessions in the first quarter) to injury and had to complete the match with a limited bench. Despite not scoring a goal in the first quarter, the undermanned Lions overcame a spirited Collingwood in the closest Grand Final in 15 years. Controversy surrounded the awarding of the Norm Smith medal for best player in the Grand Final to Collingwood captain Nathan Buckley. The voting panel cast its votes 20 minutes before the conclusion of the match. However, Lions captain Michael Voss was dominant in the final quarter to lead his team to victory and many speculated that, had voting taken place at the final siren, Voss may have won the award over Buckley.  The voting procedure was changed for subsequent Grand Finals.

In the same year, Brisbane Lion midfielder [[Simon Black]] won the [[Brownlow Medal]] for best and fairest player of the 2002 season.&lt;ref name=GF/&gt;{{rp|508}}

In 2002 former Brisbane lawyer Michael Bowers became [[Chief Executive Officer]] as part of a move to turn around the club's problematic finances.&lt;ref name=GF/&gt;{{rp|51}}

In 2003, the Brisbane Lions became the first Grand Finalist in AFL history to have three Brownlow Medallists in its lineup, the three being 1996 winner [[Michael Voss]],&lt;ref name=GF/&gt;{{rp|508}} 2001 winner [[Jason Akermanis]] and 2002 winner [[Simon Black]].

With a number of players under an injury cloud - and having lost to Collingwood in a semi-final at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] two weeks previously - the Lions went into the game as underdogs. However, they sealed their place in history as an AFL dynasty by thrashing the [[Collingwood Football Club|Magpies]] in cool but sunny conditions. At one stage in the final quarter the Lions led by almost 80 points before relaxing when the match was well and truly won, allowing Collingwood to score the last four goals. The final score of 20.14 (134) to 12.12 (84)&lt;ref name=GF/&gt;{{rp|860}} saw the club become only the third in AFL history to win three consecutive premierships and the first to do so since Melbourne in 1957. Simon Black claimed the Norm Smith Medal with a dominant 39 possession match, the most possessions ever gathered by a player in a grand final&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Blake| first=Martin| title=Black right on the ball| publisher=[[The Age]]| date=2003-09-28| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/27/1064083247266.html| accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Failed quest: 2004===
In 2004, the Lions fell just short in its quest for a fourth consecutive flag, losing to [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] in the [[2004 AFL Grand Final]]. At the 20 minute mark of the third quarter the Lions led, but were overrun by Port Adelaide.

===Finals misses: 2005–2008===
The Lions had an inconsistent season in 2005 and fell away badly towards the end, losing many games by very large margins. This culminated in a record 139-point defeat at the hands of the [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], whom they previously defeated in Round 1 in a controversial encounter.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} They finished a disappointing eleventh – out of the Finals for only the second time in the club's history. When able to field its strongest lineup, the Lions produced some strong performance reminiscent of its triple Premiership days. However, injuries to [[Justin Leppitsch]], [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]], [[Nigel Lappin]], and the retirements of Premiership players such as [[Marcus Ashcroft]], [[Alastair Lynch]], [[Martin Pike]], [[Shaun Hart]] and [[Craig McRae]] had taken its toll and the club played more first year players than any other side in the competition.

The Lions began the [[2006 AFL Season|2006 season]] optimistically, but injuries again plagued the club, whose players recorded an AFL record total of 200 matches lost to injury for the season.

[[Justin Leppitsch]] was forced to retire through injury and with season ending injuries to prominent players [[Nigel Lappin]], [[Chris M. Scott|Chris Scott]], [[Ashley McGrath]], [[Richard Hadley]], [[Anthony Corrie]] and key ruckman [[Jamie Charman]]. Coach Leigh Matthews was forced to debut an unprecedented number of youngsters and rookies and due to this, the club experienced inconsistent results. While many of the new youngsters displayed great promise, and continued to attack the ball and tackle opponents in typical Brisbane Lions spirit, it became evident during the final few matches that the young Lions were clearly into rebuilding mode. With [[AFL Rising Star]] nominations to [[Michael Rischitelli]], [[Cheynee Stiller]] and [[Matthew Moody]], and the emergence of rookie [[Jason Roe (footballer)|Jason Roe]] among others, the future looks promising, but the realists also know that the rebuilding phase will take a few years.

Despite the young team losing more home games than ever before, and reducing the Gabba's status as a fortress that intimidated opposition teams, the Lions still produced average crowds the equal of the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] Premiership team [[Brisbane Broncos]].

Justin Leppitsch and [[Brad Scott (Australian rules footballer)|Brad Scott]] announced their retirements during the season. A controversial and high-profile feud between the club and [[Jason Akermanis]] divided supporters of the club and received massive publicity, resulting in Akermanis being stood down for the last seven matches of the season by his senior playing peer group, who felt that his loyalty to the club and playing group was compromised.

After the 2006 home and away season it was revealed that major sponsor [[AAPT]] would not be renewing their [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]]. It was announced shortly after that [[Vodafone]] had signed a sponsorship deal with the club worth A$5.4 million over three years.

The Brisbane Lions team of the decade fullback [[Mal Michael]] announced his retirement from football on 5 October 2006 due to lack of motivation and desire to pursue other non-football related activities. While at the Lions he was one of the premier fullbacks in the AFL and was somewhat unlucky not to receive an [[All-Australian]] honour and was a pivotal figure at the Brisbane Lions, playing a significant role in each of the grand finals contested. In highly controversial circumstances, a contract loophole enabled Michael to sign with the Essendon Bombers and continue his career there.

The captain, [[Michael Voss]], also announced his retirement from football on 6 October 2006 due to the stress placed on his body from years of football and a chronic knee injury. He was the co-captain of the team from 1997 to 2000 with [[Alastair Lynch]] before leading the side for the remainder of his career, including the historic three straight premierships. In his final season of football, Voss still played 21 out of a possible 22 games, missing one game through knee soreness which turned out to be the same knee which led to his retirement.

At the completion of the 2006 season [[Chris L. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] remained as the last ever representative of the Fitzroy Football Club to be playing senior AFL football.

The Brisbane Lions finished runner up in the 2007 [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|NAB Cup]] and then went on to create history by being the first team in the history of the AFL to have five co-captains. They started the season with a convincing 25 point win over [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]], 9.15.(69) to 6.8.(44) and a massive win, after tributes to former captain, [[Michael Voss]], against the [[St Kilda Football Club]], with a 52 point margin.

On 12 May 2007, the Lions marked Leigh Matthews' 200th game in charge of the team against the [[Adelaide Football Club|Crows]]

One week later, on 19 May 2007, against Mal Michael's new team, the Essendon Bombers, the Lions began confidently but eventually succumbed to their biggest loss in season 2007 by a margin of 64 points. The Lions lost to [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] by 33 points at the Gabba in [[2007 AFL season#Round 9 (Indigenous Round)|Round 9]] and drew with [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at [[Docklands Stadium]] with the final scores 10.13 (73)apiece.

On 7 June 2007 Lions co-captain [[Simon Black]] and former Lions captain [[Michael Voss]] were charged for an assault that allegedly took place on the eve of the 2006 AFL Grand Final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/afl/voss-black-and-gehrig-face-court/2007/06/06/1181089187691.html Voss, Black and Gehrig face court – AFL – Sport – brisbanetimes.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Against [[Jason Akermanis]]' new side, the [[Western Bulldogs]], in Round 11, the Lions yet again began confidently, kicking the first two goals of the game before being overrun. The Lions failed to score a goal in the second quarter but came back in the last to reduce the margin to 23 points, holding the Bulldogs goalless in the final term. Akermanis kicked two consecutive goals in the first quarter to take the margin out to 15 and 21 points respectively.

At a rainy [[Kardinia Park (Stadium)|Kardinia Park]] two weeks later, the Lions failed to score a goal in the first half and never looked like coming back, going down to their second biggest loss of the season so far. On 30 June 2007, Brisbane faced [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and led by seven points at quarter time before being overrun in the second, the Power kicking seven goals to two to led by 19 points at half-time. At three-quarter time, the Lions were down by 28 points and 40 points a few minutes early into the final term before they fought back to level the scores at 105-all courtesy of a [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] goal from a free kick. A minute later a [[50-metre penalty]] gifted Port Adelaide's Brett Ebert a goal and managed to hold on for a seven point win.

On 22 July 2007 the Lions faced a struggling [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton Blues]] side who were on the back of a 62-point thrashing to [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] the previous week. Brisbane kicked 8.5–0.3 in the last quarter, the final margin being 117 points, Brisbane's biggest ever win over Carlton, bettering their 103-point loss to Carlton in Round 10, 1987. Also, gun forward [[Jonathan Brown (Australian rules footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] became the first player in Brisbane Lions/[[Brisbane Bears]] history to kick 10 goals in a match, beating [[Brad Hardie]] ([[1989 VFL season|1989]]) and [[Daniel Bradshaw]] ([[2005 AFL season|2005]]) who both kicked nine goals. This resulted in the sacking of the [[Denis Pagan|opposition coach]] after a run of poor results.In Round 17, the Lions celebrated their return to the Melbourne Cricket Ground with a 93 point defeat of [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]. Jared Brennan played one of the best games in his 54 game career, scoring seven goals and five behinds.

[[Rhan Hooper]] received a three match ban for striking Hawthorn's [[Rick Ladson]], [[Joel Macdonald]] and [[Troy Selwood]] missed the must-win clash against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]]. Brisbane started off well with [[Richard Hadley]] booting the first goal of the game but poor kicking and too many turnovers saw them trail by 10 points at quarter-time before Jonathan Brown evened the scores at 24-all at half-time. The Lions failed to score a goal in the third time-scoring 0.3 to the Swans' 3.5. However, they jumped straight out of the blocks in the first 3 minutes, with Jonathan Brown putting the Lions in front with his second for the night. But with less than four minutes remaining, [[Brett Kirk]] thought he'd won the game for Sydney only for Jonathan Brown to kick a 55-metre goal just before the full-time siren to secure a 9.9 (63) to 8.15 (63) draw.

The Lions failed to make the finals for a third successive year and lost [[Chris L. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] and [[Chris M. Scott|Chris Scott]] to retirement. Youngster [[Cameron Wood]] was traded to [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in exchange for Pick 14, which the Lions gave to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] for [[Travis Johnstone]]. On the last day of the [[2007 AFL Draft#Trades|2007 trade week]], [[Richard Hadley]] was traded to Carlton for pick #52.

The Lions began the [[2008 NAB Cup]] shakily, losing to Essendon by 27 points. The 2008 home and away campaign started with a game against the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval]], in which the Lions lost by 16 points. In their second match at home at the Gabba, the Lions wrestled with an in form Collingwood and eventually triumphed by two points. Jed Adcock scored the winning goal for the Lions. After a 17-point loss to the [[Sydney Swans]] the next week (Rivalry Round), the Lions managed a record breaking comeback against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] after turning around a 47-point deficit half way through the third quarter, to come out winners by 20 points by the final siren. The Lions were then defeated by Hawthorn by 12 points followed by a sound victory over Melbourne by 52 points. They suffered another defeat to Geelong by 27 points  followed by the Lions' first consecutive wins for the season with wins over Carlton by 33 points and Saint Kilda by 46 points. This was followed up by wins over North by 31 points and Fremantle by 22 points. The winning streak would eventually be snapped by a defeat from the Bulldogs by 63 points. The team struggled for the rest of the season and missed out on the finals with a 10–12 record, losing 3 games despite having at least 5 more scoring shots in each of those games. Coach Leigh Matthews resigned at the end of the season after 10 seasons and 3 premierships with the club.

===Voss arrival: 2009–present===
''Main articles: [[Brisbane Lions season 2009|Brisbane Lions seasons 2009]] and [[Brisbane Lions season 2010|2010]]''

{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
The Lions made a good start in the [[2009 NAB Cup]] under new senior coach Micahel Voss by registering a 9 point win over [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]. However this was followed by a series of losses in the pre-season to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]. The Lions then began the Premiership season well with wins against recent premiers the [[West Coast Eagles]] and hoodoo rivals, the [[Sydney Swans]]. However, the Lions lost their strong form against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] with a loss of 19 points. The Lions went on to make the finals for the first time since 2004; in their elimination final against Carlton at the Gabba they trailed by as much as five goals midway through the final quarter but came back and won by seven points. Their season ended abruptly with a 51-point loss to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week at the MCG.

The 2009/2010 off-season was dominated by the arrival of [[Brendan Fevola]] from Carlton, and the hype was focused on Fevola and Jonathan Brown in the sense that the Lions could capitalise on their strong 2009 season. Indeed, the Lions won their first four matches of the 2010 season to be top of the ladder after four rounds, but they would only win three more games after that to crash to a lowly finish by seasons end. One of those wins however, was against eventual premiers {{AFL Col}}.

[[File:FevolaBrisbane.JPG|thumb|[[Brendan Fevola]] became the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; [[Coleman Medal]]list to win the medal at a club and be traded to another the following year. He originally came from [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]]]

===Membership base and sponsorship===
Crowds and memberships for the Brisbane Lions grew dramatically during the four seasons in which they made the AFL Grand Final.  Since then, with the team being less successful, attendances have declined, but have remained stable over the past three seasons.

In response to escalating levels of violence across Northern Ireland, [[Operation Demetrius|internment without trial]] was introduced on 9 August 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;g45&quot;/&gt; In a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' gesture to nationalists, all marches and parades were banned, including the flashpoint march by the Apprentice Boys of Derry which was due to take place on 12 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;g46&quot;&gt;''The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; There was disorder across Northern Ireland following the introduction of internment, with 21 people being killed in three days of rioting.&lt;ref name=&quot;e141&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard English | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] | year = 2003 | page = 141 | doi =  | isbn = 0-330-49388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August Bombardier Paul Challenor became the first soldier to be killed by the Provisional IRA in Derry, when he was shot by a sniper on the [[Creggan, Derry|Creggan]] estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;b83&quot;/&gt; A further six soldiers had been killed in Derry by mid-December 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;b84&quot;&gt;''Brits'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; 1,932 rounds were fired at the British Army, who also faced 211 explosions and 180 [[nail bomb]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;b84&quot;/&gt; and who fired 364 rounds in return.

Provisional IRA activity also increased across Northern Ireland with thirty British soldiers being killed in the remaining months of 1971, in contrast to the ten soldiers killed during the pre-internment period of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;e141&quot;/&gt; Both the [[Official IRA]] and Provisional IRA had established &quot;no-go&quot; areas for the British Army and RUC in Derry through the use of barricades.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot;&gt;''Brits'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place to prevent access to what was known as [[Free Derry]], 16 of them impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot;/&gt; IRA members openly mounted roadblocks in front of the media, and daily clashes took place between nationalist youths and the British Army at a spot known as &quot;aggro corner&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot;/&gt; Due to rioting and damage to shops caused by [[incendiary device]]s, an estimated total of {{Nowrap|£4 million}} worth of damage had been done to local businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot;/&gt;

In January 1972 the NICRA intended, despite the ban, to organise a march in Derry to protest against internment. The authorities who knew of the proposed march decided to allow it to proceed in the nationalist areas of the city, but to stop it from reaching [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall Square]], as planned by the organisers. Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]], then Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland, ordered that 1st Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (1 PARA) should travel to Derry to be used to arrest possible rioters during the march.&lt;ref name=Saville2.16-17&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bloody Sunday Inquiry|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter002 |title = Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=2010 |volume = 2.15-2.16 |accessdate=22 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 PARA arrived in Derry on the morning of Sunday 30th January 1972 and took up positions in the city.&lt;ref name=Saville3.1&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bloody Sunday Inquiry|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003 |title = Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=2010 |volume = 3.1 |accessdate=22 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many details of the day's events are in dispute, with no agreement even on the number of marchers present that day.

==Narrative of events==
{{Main|Narrative of events of Bloody Sunday (1972)}}

The people planned on marching to the [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall]], but because of army barricades designed to reroute the march it was redirected to [[Free Derry]] Corner. A group of teenagers broke off from the march and persisted in pushing the barricade and marching on the Guildhall. They attacked the [[British army]] [[barricade]] with stones. At this point, a water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets were used to disperse the rioters. Such confrontations between soldiers and youths were common, though observers reported that the rioting was not intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Peter Pringle &amp; Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000 | isbn=1-84115-316-8}} P. 100: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the level of rioting was no greater than usual - and no petrol bombs or nail bombs were being thrown.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Two civilians, Damien Donaghy and John Johnston were shot and wounded by soldiers on William Street who claimed the former was carrying a black cylindrical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000 | isbn=1-84115-316-8}}P 116: &quot;Seconds after the corporal fired, he would say that he spotted the same man with a black cylindrical object in one hand strike what appeared to be a match against the wall. Johnston was standing a few feet from Donaghy. One of the bullets sliced through his right thigh.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain point, reports of an IRA sniper operating in the area were allegedly given to the Army command centre. At {{Nowrap|4:07&amp;nbsp;pm}} Brigade gave the British Parachute Regiment permission to go in to the Bogside. The order to fire live rounds was given, and one young man was shot and killed when he ran down Chamberlain Street away from the advancing troops. This first fatality, Jackie Duddy, was among a crowd who were running away. He was running alongside a priest, [[Bishop Edward Daly|Father Edward Daly]], when he was shot in the back. Continuing violence by British troops escalated, and eventually the order was given to mobilise the troops in an arrest operation, chasing the tail of the main group of marchers to the edge of the field by Free Derry Corner.

Despite a cease-fire order from the army HQ, over a hundred rounds were fired directly into the fleeing crowds by troops under the command of Major Ted Loden. Twelve more were killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/bs.htm |title=CAIN: Events: Bloody Sunday: Menu Page |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them as they attempted to aid the fallen. Fourteen others were wounded, twelve by shots from the soldiers and two knocked down by [[armoured personnel carriers]].

===The dead===

Three of them saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran. He is the uncle of the Irish boxer [[John Duddy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30&amp;nbsp;January 1972 | author = | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/circum.htm | publisher = [[CAIN]] | date = | accessdate = 16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doherty was the subject of a series of photographs, taken before and after he died by French journalist [[Gilles Peress]]. Despite testimony from &quot;Soldier F&quot; that he had fired at a man holding and firing a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs showed Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Inquiry urged to identify soldiers | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2004398.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 23 May 2002 | accessdate = 16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Michael M. McDaid (20).''' Shot in the face at the barricade as he was walking away from the paratroopers. The trajectory of the bullet indicated he could have been killed by soldiers positioned on the Derry Walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot;/&gt;

* '''James Joseph Wray (22).''' Wounded then shot again at close range while lying on the ground. Witnesses who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal stated that Wray was calling out that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot;/&gt;

* '''[[Gerald Donaghy]] (17).''' Shot in the stomach while attempting to run to safety between Glenfada Park and Abbey Park. Donaghy was brought to a nearby house by bystanders where he was examined by a doctor. His pockets were turned out in an effort to identify him. A later [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|police]] photograph of Donaghy's corpse showed [[nail bomb]]s in his pockets. Neither those who searched his pockets in the house nor the British army medical officer (Soldier 138) who pronounced him dead shortly afterwards say they saw any bombs. Donaghy had been a member of [[Fianna Éireann]], an IRA-linked Republican youth movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot;/&gt; Paddy Ward, a police informer&lt;ref&gt;http://www.derryjournal.com/journal/Death-of-39informer39-.6096320.jp&lt;/ref&gt; who gave evidence at the Saville Inquiry, claimed that he had given two nail bombs to Donaghy several hours before he was shot dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;INNES&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = McGuinness is named as bomb runner | author = John Innes | url = http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=628&amp;id=1161662003 | publisher = [[The Scotsman]] | date = 21 October 2003 | accessdate = 18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Gerald (James) McKinney (34).''' Shot just after Gerald Donaghy. Witnesses stated that McKinney had been running behind Donaghy, and he stopped and held up his arms, shouting &quot;Don't shoot! Don't shoot!&quot;, when he saw Donaghy fall. He was then shot in the chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot;/&gt;

Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another man later dying of his wounds. The official army position, backed by the British [[Home Secretary]] the next day in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], was that the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|paratroopers]] had reacted to gun and nail bomb attacks from suspected IRA members. However, all eyewitnesses (apart from the soldiers), including marchers, local residents, and British and Irish journalists present, maintain that soldiers fired into an unarmed crowd, or were aiming at fleeing people and those tending the wounded, whereas the soldiers themselves were not fired upon. No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or reported any injuries, nor were any bullets or nail bombs recovered to back up their claims. In the events that followed, irate crowds burned down the British embassy on [[Merrion Square]] in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/2/newsid_2758000/2758163.stm 1972: British embassy in Dublin destroyed] BBC News Online.

Although there were many IRA men—both [[Official IRA|Official]] and [[Provisional IRA|Provisional]]—present at the protest, it is claimed they were all unarmed, apparently because it was anticipated that the paratroopers would attempt to &quot;draw them out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rumours of plan to clear Bogside are 'nonsense' |author=David Sharrock |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20020627205642/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archivedate= 27 June 2002 |publisher =The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 March 2000 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; March organizer and MP [[Ivan Cooper]] had been promised beforehand that no armed IRA men would be near the march.

The city's [[coroner]], retired British Army Major [[Hubert O'Neill]], issued a statement on 21 August 1973, at the completion of the [[inquest]] into the people killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/chron.htm 'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events] CAIN Web Service, 23 March 2006. Retrieved 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He declared: 
{{quote|This Sunday became known as Bloody Sunday and bloody it was. It was quite unnecessary. It strikes me that the Army ran amok that day and shot without thinking what they were doing. They were shooting innocent people. These people may have been taking part in a march that was banned but that does not justify the troops coming in and firing live rounds indiscriminately. I would say without hesitation that it was sheer, unadulterated [[murder in English law|murder]]. It was murder.}}

Two days after Bloody Sunday, the Westminster Parliament adopted a resolution for a [[tribunal]] into the events of the day, resulting in [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Heath]] commissioning the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|Lord Widgery]] to undertake it. Many witnesses intended to [[boycott]] the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly produced report—completed within ten weeks (10 April) and published within eleven (19 April)—supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify [[lead]] residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. Most Irish people and witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a whitewash. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation involved the use of lead-based [[solder]]. In fact, in 1992, [[John Major]], writing to [[John Hume]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Don Mullan]] |title=Eyewitness Bloody Sunday |location=Wolfhound |publisher=Printing Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-86327-586-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devlin punched [[Reginald Maudling]], the [[Secretary of State for the Home Department]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, when he made a statement to Parliament on the events of Bloody Sunday stating that the [[British Army]] had fired only in self-defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = 1969: Devlin is youngest-ever woman MP |author = |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/17/newsid_2524000/2524881.stm |publisher = BBC |date = 17 April 1969 |accessdate = 2 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1997, the United Kingdom television station [[Channel 4]] carried a news report that suggested that members of the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] had also opened fire on the protesters and could have been responsible for three of the fourteen deaths.

On 29 May 2007 it was reported that General Sir [[Mike Jackson]], second-in-command of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday, said: &quot;I have no doubt that innocent people were shot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==The Saville Inquiry==
{{Main|Bloody Sunday Inquiry}}
[[Image:Guildhall, Derry, August 2010.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The city [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall]], home to the Inquiry]]
Although British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] rejected [[John Hume]]'s requests for a [[public inquiry]] into the killings, his successor, [[Tony Blair]], decided to start one. A second commission of inquiry, chaired by [[Lord Saville]], was established in January 1998 to re-examine 'Bloody Sunday'. The other judges were [[John Toohey]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], a former [[Judge|Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] who had worked on Aboriginal issues (he replaced New Zealander Sir [[Edward Somers]] QC, who retired from the Inquiry in 2000 for personal reasons), and Mr Justice [[William Lloyd Hoyt|William Hoyt]] QC, former [[Chief Justice]] of [[New Brunswick]] and a member of the [[Canadian Judicial Council]]. The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report was published 15 June 2010. The Saville Inquiry was a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. [[Lord Saville]] declined to comment on the Widgery report and made the point that the Saville Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into 'Bloody Sunday', not the Widgery Tribunal.

Evidence given by [[Martin McGuiness]], a senior member of [[Sinn Féin]] and now the [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]], to the inquiry stated that he was second-in-command of the [[Derry]] City brigade of the [[Provisional IRA]] and was present at the march. He did not answer questions about where he had been staying because he said it would compromise the safety of the individuals involved.

A claim was made at the Saville Inquiry that McGuinness was responsible for supplying detonators for nail bombs on Bloody Sunday. Paddy Ward claimed he was the leader of the [[Fianna Éireann]], the youth wing of the IRA in January 1972. He claimed McGuinness, the second-in-command of the IRA in the city at the time, and another anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts on the morning of 30 January, the date planned for the civil rights march. He said his organisation intended to attack city-centre premises in Derry on the day when civilians were shot dead by British soldiers. In response McGuinness rejected the claims as &quot;fantasy&quot;, while Gerry O'Hara, a Sinn Féin councillor in Derry stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;INNES&quot;/&gt;

Many observers allege that the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] acted in a way to impede the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Bloody Sunday footage release calls |author = |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2710309.stm | publisher = BBC News |date = 30 January 2003 |accessdate = 18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,000 army photographs and original army helicopter video footage were never made available. Additionally, guns used on the day by the soldiers that could have been evidence in the inquiry were lost by the MoD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Concern over Bloody Sunday guns |author = |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/699875.stm |publisher = BBC News |date = 3 April 2000 |accessdate = 18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A&gt;{{cite news |title = Q&amp;A: Bloody Sunday inquiry |author = |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/bloodysunday/article/0,2763,1357102,00.html |publisher = The Guardian |date = 22 November 2004 |accessdate = 18 May 2007 |location=London |first=Derek |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MoD claimed that all the guns had been destroyed, but some were subsequently recovered in various locations (such as [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Beirut]]) despite the obstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Riddle of the Derry guns |author = Philip Jacobson |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article551570.ece |publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] |date = 14 August 2005 |accessdate = 18 May 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the inquiry had retired to write up its findings, it had interviewed over 900 witnesses, over seven years, making it the biggest investigation in [[Law of the United Kingdom|British legal]] history.&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A/&gt; The cost of this process has drawn criticism; as of the publication of the Saville Report being {{Nowrap|£195 million}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/10320609.stm| work=BBC News |title=Bloody Sunday Report Published. |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report concluded that an Official IRA sniper fired on British soldiers, albeit on the balance of evidence his shot was fired after the Army shots that wounded Damien Donaghey and John Johnston. The Inquiry rejected the sniper's account that this shot had been made in reprisal, stating the view that he and another Official IRA member had already been in position, and the shot had probably been fired simply because the opportunity had presented itself.&lt;ref name=SavilleSnipers312&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of the The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&amp;nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Saville Inquiry was inconclusive on [[Martin McGuiness]]' role due to a lack of certainty over his movements, concluding that while he was &quot;engaged in paramilitary activity&quot; during Bloody Sunday, and had probably been armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]], there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were &quot;sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire&quot;.&lt;ref name=SavilleMcGuinness3119&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of the The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&amp;nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |quote=3.119 In the course of investigating the activities of the Provisional and Official IRA on the day, we considered at some length allegations that Martin McGuinness, at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or Command of the Provisional IRA, had engaged in paramilitary activity during the day. In the end we were left in some doubt as to his movements on the day. Before the soldiers of Support Company went into the Bogside he was probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this, save that we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on Northern Ireland divisions==
[[File:Bloody Sunday memorial.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bloody Sunday memorial in the [[Bogside]]]]
[[Harold Wilson]], then the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]], reiterated his belief that a [[united Ireland]] was the only possible solution to [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Troubles]]. [[William Craig (politician)|William Craig]], then Stormont Home Affairs Minister, suggested that the west bank of [[Derry]] should be ceded to the [[Republic of Ireland]].

When it was deployed on duty in Northern Ireland, the [[British Army]] was welcomed by [[Roman Catholic]]s as a neutral force there to protect them from [[Protestant]] mobs, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary|B-Specials]].&lt;ref&gt;This &quot;Honeymoon period&quot;, as it has come to be known, ended around the time of the [[Falls Road Curfew]] on 3 July 1970. See CAIN for details here [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch70.htm]. The 'B-Specials' were disbanded and replaced by the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) on 1 April 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; After Bloody Sunday many Catholics turned on the [[British army]], seeing it no longer as their protector but as their enemy. Young [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] became increasingly attracted to violent [[Irish republicanism|republican]] groups. With the [[Official IRA]] and [[Official Sinn Féin]] having moved away from mainstream Irish republicanism towards [[Marxism]], the [[Provisional IRA]] began to win the support of newly radicalised, disaffected young people.

In the following twenty years, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and other smaller republican groups such as the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) mounted an [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997|armed campaign]] against the British, by which they meant the RUC, the British Army, the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) of the British Army (and, according to their critics, the Protestant and [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] establishment). With rival paramilitary organisations appearing in both the nationalist/republican and [[Unionism in Ireland|Irish unionist]]/[[Ulster loyalist]] communities (the [[Ulster Defence Association]], [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), etc. on the loyalist side), the Troubles cost the lives of thousands of people. Incidents included the killing of three members of a pop band, the [[Miami Showband killings|Miami Showband]], by a gang including members of the UVF who were also members of the local army regiment, the UDR, and in uniform at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/15/newsid_2534000/2534941.stm 1976: UDR men jailed for Showband killings].&lt;/ref&gt; and the killing by the Provisionals of eighteen members of the Parachute Regiment in the [[Warrenpoint Ambush]]-seen by some as revenge for Bloody Sunday.

With the official cessation of violence by some of the major paramilitary organisations and the creation of the power-sharing executive at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] in [[Belfast]] under the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]], the Saville Inquiry's re-examination of the events of that day is widely hoped to provide a thorough account of the events of Bloody Sunday.

In his speech to the House of Commons on the Inquiry, British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] stated: &quot;These are shocking conclusions to read and shocking words to have to say. But you do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=''RTÉ News'' |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0615/bloodysunday.html |title=Bloody Sunday killings 'unjustifiable' |date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also said that this was not a premeditated action, though &quot;there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate&quot; as &quot;what happened should never, ever have happened&quot;. Howerton then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was &quot;deeply sorry&quot;.

A survey conducted by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in June 2010 found that 61 per cent of Britons and 70 per cent of Northern Irish agreed with Cameron’s apology for the Bloody Sunday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angus Reid Public Opinion |url=http://www.visioncritical.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/2010.06.28_Sunday_BRI.pdf |title=Britons and Northern Irish Welcome PM’s Apology for Bloody Sunday |publisher=Angus Reid Public Opinion |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Pollard, solicitor representing several of the soldiers, said on 15 June 2010 that Saville had cherry-picked the evidence and did not have justification for his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Devenport, BBC NI Political Editor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/10320609.stm |title=Bloody Sunday killings 'unjustified and unjustifiable' |publisher=BBC News |date=30 January 1972 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roy Harper]] song &quot;All Ireland&quot; from the album '[[Lifemask]]', written in the days following the incident, is critical of the military but takes a long term view with regard to a solution.

[[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Geezer Butler]] (also of Irish descent) wrote the lyrics to the Black Sabbath song &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; on the album of the same name in 1973. Butler stated, &quot;… the Sunday Bloody Sunday thing had just happened in Ireland, when the British troops opened fire on the Irish demonstrators...

'''Saint Bruno of Querfurt''' (c. 970 – February 14, 1009), also known as ''Brun'' and ''Boniface'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|title=St. Bruno of Querfurt|publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume III. Published 1908. New York: Robert Appleton Company. |author=Nihil Obstat| date= November 1, 1908 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03018a.htm|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sainted [[missionary]] [[bishop]] and [[Christian martyrs|martyr]], who was beheaded near the border of [[Kievan Rus]] and [[Lithuania]] while trying to spread Christianity in Eastern Europe. He is also called the second Apostle of the [[Prussia]]ns ([[Old Prussians]]).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bruno was from a noble family of [[Querfurt]] (now in  [[Saxony-Anhalt]]). He is rumored to have been a relative of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. At the age of six he was sent to be educated in [[Magdeburg]], seat of [[Adalbert of Magdeburg]], the teacher and namesake of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]]. While still a youth he was made a canon of Magdeburg cathedral. The fifteen-year-old Otto III made Bruno a part of his royal court. While in Rome for Otto's imperial coronation, Bruno met [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert of Prague]], the first Apostle of the Prussians, killed a year later, which inspired Bruno to write a biography of St Adalbert when he reached the recently Christianized and consolidated [[Kingdom of Hungary]] himself. Bruno spent much time at the monastery where Adalbert had become a monk and where abbot [[John Canaparius]] may have written a life of Saint Adalbert. Later, Bruno entered a monastery near [[Ravenna]], founded by Otto, and underwent severe [[ascetic]] training under the guidance of [[Saint Romuald|St. Romuald]].

===Missionary life===
[[Image:Pomeraniae Ducatus Tabula.jpg|thumb|450px|The lands given St. Bruno in 1003 were in the region shown on left bank of the Oder, [[Hither Pomerania]] along the coast, or the future [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] to its south.]]
In [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] hoped to open a monastery between the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]] (somewhere in the  [[Paganism|pagan]] lands that became [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] or Western &lt;!-- don't join as [[Western Pomerania]]... the generic name is the only one with a map applicable to the era--&gt;[[Pomerania]]) to help convert the local population into Christianity. In 1003 [[Pope Sylvester II]] appointed Bruno, at the age of 33, to head a mission amongst the pagan peoples of Eastern Europe. Owing to a regional conflict between the [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry II]] and [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Duke Boleslaus I of Poland]] he delayed the plans for the monastery, and so Bruno set out for [[Hungary]]. There he went to the places that Saint Adalbert of Prague had attended. Bruno tried to convert [[Ahtum]], the Duke of [[Banat]], who was an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], but this precipitated a large controversy leading to organized opposition from Orthodox monks. Bruno elected to gracefully exit the region after he first finished his book, the famous ''&quot;Life of [[Saint Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]],&quot;'' a literary memorial of much worth giving a history of the (relatively recent) conversion of the Hungarians.

After this diplomatic failure, Bruno went to [[Kiev]], where Grand Duke [[Vladimir I, Prince of Kiev|Vladimir I]] authorized him to make [[Christian]] converts among the [[Pechenegs]], semi-nomadic [[Turkic peoples]] living between the [[Danube]] and the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] rivers. Bruno spent five months there and baptized some thirty adults. He helped to bring about a peace treaty between them and the ruler of Kiev.

Before leaving for Poland, Bruno [[Consecration|consecrated]] a bishop for the [[Pechenegs]]. While in Poland he consecrated the first [[Bishop of Sweden]] and is said to have sent emissaries to baptize the king of Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=DC0aAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Bruno+von+Querfurt+olaf&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1900&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES Bruno of Querfurt, baptism of king of Sweden]&lt;/ref&gt; whose mother had come from Poland. Bruno found out that his friend Benedict and four companions had been killed by robbers in 1003. Bruno took eyewitness accounts and wrote down a touching history of the so-called Five Martyred Brothers.

===Mission to Prussia and death===
In the autumn or at the end of 1008 Bruno and eighteen companions set out to found a mission among the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]; they succeeded in converting Netimer, a &quot;king of Lithuanians&quot;, and then traveled to the east, heading very likely towards [[Yotvingians|Yotvingia]]. Yotvingia was a Prussian region, then subordinate to [[Kievan Rus]] (since 983), that intersected the borders of what was then [[Old Prussia|Prussia]], Kievan Rus and the [[Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the &quot;Annals of Magdeburg&quot; (c. 1170) and some other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Bruno was [[decapitation|beheaded]] on February 14, 1009, whereas most of his companions were hanged the same day by Zebeden, brother of newly-converted Netimer. Duke [[Boleslaus the Brave]] brought the bodies to Poland (it was supposed that they were laid to rest in [[Przemyśl]], where some historians place Bruno's diocese; such localization of the Bruno's burial place is hardly probable because Przemyśl then belonged to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Kievan Rus through 1018). The ''&quot;Annals of Magdeburg,&quot;'' ''&quot;Thietmar of Merseburg's Chronicle,&quot;'' various works of Magdeburg Bishops, the ''&quot;[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]&quot;'' and many other written sources of 11th-15th centuries record this story.

Soon after his death, Bruno and his companions were venerated as martyrs and Bruno was soon after [[canonized]]. It was said that [[Braunsberg]] was named after St Bruno.

'''Ellas Otha Bates''' (December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known by his [[stage name]] '''Bo Diddley''', was an American [[rhythm and blues]] vocalist, [[guitar]]ist, [[songwriter]] (usually as '''Elias McDaniel'''), and inventor. He was also known as &quot;The Originator&quot; because of his key role in the transition from the [[blues]] to rock &amp; roll, influencing a host of acts including [[Buddy Holly]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[The Clash]], [[The Yardbirds]], and [[Eric Clapton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showbizspy.com/news/06032008/mick-jagger-leads-tribute-for-diddley |title=Mick Jagger Leads Tribute For Diddley |accessdate=2008-10-27 |last=WENN |date=June 3, 2008 |work=showbizspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced more insistent, driving rhythms and a hard-edged guitar sound on a wide-ranging catalog of songs. Accordingly, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]&lt;ref name='Rock Hall'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/bo-diddley |title=Bo Diddley |accessdate=2008-10-27 |publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R&amp;B Foundation Award&quot;&gt;[[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Grammy Award]] from the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. He was known in particular for his technical innovations, including his trademark rectangular guitar.

==History==
===Early life and career===
Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], as Ellas Otha Bates,&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give his name as Otha Ellas Bates.&lt;/ref&gt; he was adopted and raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, whose surname he assumed, becoming Ellas McDaniel. In 1934, the McDaniel family moved to the largely black [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] area of Chicago, where the young man dropped the name Otha and became known as Ellas McDaniel, until his musical ambitions demanded that he take on a more catchy identity. In Chicago, he was an active member of his local [[Ebenezer Baptist Church]], where he studied the [[trombone]] and the [[violin]], becoming proficient enough on the latter for the musical director to invite him to join the orchestra, with which he performed until the age of 18. He was more impressed, however, by the pulsating, rhythmic music he heard at a local [[Pentecostal Church]], as well as an interest in the guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2066171/Bo-Diddley.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Bo Diddley Bo Diddley, who has died aged 79, was one of the most important influences in the development of popular music, even though for much of his career he was seldom in the charts or in the recording studio. | date=June 2, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsimon.com/diddley.htm |title=Bo Diddley Page |publisher=Tsimon.com |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by a concert where he saw [[John Lee Hooker]] perform,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; he supplemented his work as a carpenter and mechanic with a developing career [[busking|playing on street corners]] with friends, including Jerome Green (c. 1934–1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/jerome.html |title=Jerome Green |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a band called The Hipsters (later The Langley Avenue Jive Cats). During the summer of 1943–44, he played for tips at the [[Maxwell Street]] market in a band with [[Earl Hooker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cowdery.home.netcom.com/maxwell/bo.html |title=1997 Interview |publisher=Cowdery.home.netcom.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951 he was playing on the street with backing from Roosevelt Jackson (on washtub bass) and [[Jody Williams (blues musician)|Jody Williams]] (whom he had taught to play the guitar).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahl, Bill 2002&quot;&gt;Dahl, Bill (2002). Jody Williams—Return Of A Legend [CD liner notes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/musicians.html |title=BO DIDDLEY - The Originator |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams later played lead guitar on &quot;[[Who Do You Love?]]&quot; (1956).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahl, Bill 2002&quot;/&gt; In 1951 he landed a regular spot at the 708 Club on Chicago's [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], with a repertoire influenced by [[Louis Jordan]], John Lee Hooker, and [[Muddy Waters]].

In late 1954, he teamed up with [[harmonica]] player [[Billy Boy Arnold]], [[drummer]] Clifton James, and [[Bassist|bass player]] Roosevelt Jackson, and recorded [[Demo (music)|demos]] of &quot;[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm A Man]]&quot; and &quot;[[Bo Diddley (song)|Bo Diddley]]&quot;. They re-recorded the songs at [[Chess Records|Chess Studios]] with a backing [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] comprising [[Otis Spann]] (piano), [[Lester Davenport]] (harmonica), Frank Kirkland (drums), and Jerome Green (maracas). The record was released in March 1955, and the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]], &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, became a #1 R&amp;B hit.

McDaniel adopted the stage name &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;. The origin of the name is somewhat unclear, as several differing stories and claims exist. Diddley claims that his peers gave him the nickname, which he first suspected to be an insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19748/m1/ |title=Show 3 - The Tribal Drum: The rise of rhythm and blues. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library | {{Gilliland}} |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bo Diddley himself said that the name first belonged to a singer his adoptive mother was familiar with, while harmonicist [[Billy Boy Arnold]] once said in an interview that it was originally the name of a local comedian that [[Leonard Chess]] borrowed for the song title and artist name for Bo Diddley's first single. A &quot;[[diddley bow]]&quot; is a typically homemade American string instrument of African origin, probably developed from instruments found on the coast of west Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Morris, ''I'm A Man: The Chess Masters, 1955-1958'' liner notes, [[Geffen Records]], February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success in the 1950s and 1960s===
On November 20, 1955, he appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', a popular television [[variety show]], where he infuriated [[Ed Sullivan|the host]]. &quot;I did two songs and he got mad,&quot; Bo Diddley later recalled. &quot;Ed Sullivan said that I was one of the first colored boys to ever double-cross him. Said that I wouldn't last six months&quot;. The show had requested that he sing the [[Merle Travis]]-penned [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] hit &quot;[[Sixteen Tons]]&quot;, but when he appeared on stage, he sang &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; instead. This substitution resulted in his being banned from further appearances.

The request came about because Sullivan's people heard Diddley casually singing &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; in the dressing room. Diddley's accounts of the event were inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;TV-a-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol. Jake Austen. Edition: illustrated. Chicago Review Press. 2005. pages 14, 15. ISBN 1-55652-572-9, 9781556525728&lt;/ref&gt;

Chess included Diddley's recording of &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; on the album ''[[Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Bo-Diddley-Gunslinger/dp/B0001XAQSW#moreAboutThisProduct |title=Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger: Bo Diddley: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was originally released in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dustygroove.com/item.php?id=sx6fryfrvp&amp;ref=browse.php&amp;refQ=cat%3D11%26amp%3Bpage%3D5 |title=Dusty Groove America – Bo Diddley: Bo Diddley Is A Gunslinger |publisher=Dustygroove.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to have hits through the rest of the 1950s and even the 1960s, including &quot;Pretty Thing&quot; (1956), &quot;Say Man&quot; (1959), and &quot;[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]&quot; (1962). He released a string of albums whose titles, including ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger'' and ''Have Guitar, Will Travel'', were bolstered his self-invented legend. Between 1958 and 1963, [[Checker Records]] released 11 full-length albums by Bo Diddley. Although he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the [[Alan Freed]] concerts, for example), he rarely tailored his compositions to teenage concerns.

In 1963, he starred in a UK concert tour with the [[Everly Brothers]] and [[Little Richard]]. [[The Rolling Stones]], still barely known outside London at that time, appeared as a supporting act on the same bill.

In addition to the many songs recorded by him, in 1956 he co-wrote, with Jody Williams, the pioneering [[pop music|pop song]] &quot;[[Love Is Strange]]&quot;, a hit for [[Mickey &amp; Sylvia]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/career50s.html |title=BO DIDDLEY – The Originator |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bo Diddley was one of the first American male musicians to include women in his band, including &quot;The Duchess&quot; [[Norma-Jean Wofford]], Peggy Jones (aka &quot;Lady Bo&quot;), Cornelia Redmond (aka Cookie), and Debby Hastings, who led his band for the final 25 years of his performing career. He also set up one of the first [[home recording]] [[recording studio|studios]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/bo-diddley |title=Bo Diddley |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Bo-Diddley.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bo Diddley touring Japan with Japanese band Bo Gumbos.]]
Over the decades, Bo Diddley's venues ranged from intimate clubs to stadiums. On March 25, 1972, he played with [[The Grateful Dead]] at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] in New York City. The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as Volume 30 of the band's ''[[Dick's Picks]]'' concert album series. Also in the early 1970s, the soundtrack for the ground-breaking animated film ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz The Cat]]'' contained his song &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, in which a crow idly [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-pops]] along to the track.

Bo Diddley spent many years in [[New Mexico]], living in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico]] from 1971 to 1978 while continuing his musical career. He served for two and a half years as Deputy Sheriff in the [[Valencia County, New Mexico|Valencia County]] Citizens' Patrol; during that time he personally purchased and donated three highway patrol pursuit cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;nmmc&quot;&gt;[http://www.newmexicomusic.org/noteable.php?select=5 New Mexico Music Commission | Notable New Mexicans |]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, Diddley left Los Lunas and moved to [[Hawthorne, Florida]] where he lived on a large estate in a custom made log-cabin home, which he helped to build. For the remainder of his life he spent time between New Mexico and Florida, living the last 13 years of his life in [[Archer, Florida]], a small farming town near [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].

He appeared as an opening act for [[The Clash]] in their 1979 US tour; in ''Legends of Guitar'' (filmed live in Spain, 1991) with [[B.B. King]], [[Les Paul]], [[Albert Collins]], [[George Benson]], among others, and joined [[The Rolling Stones]] as a guest on their 1994 concert broadcast of ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'', performing &quot;[[Who Do You Love?]]&quot; with the band. [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Robert Cray]] also appeared on the pay-per-view special.

===Bit acting parts===
His pawnbroker character's offering Louis Winthorpe III &quot;fifty bucks&quot; created one of more quoted scenes in 1983's ''[[Trading Places]]''. In the late 1980s, he teamed with [[Bo Jackson]] in [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] famous &quot;[[Bo Knows]]&quot; commercials, saying his one line: &quot;Bo, you don't know Diddley!&quot;

In 1998, Bo appeared alongside legendary guitarists [[B.B. King]], [[Eric Clapton]], and [[Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter]] as members of the Louisiana Gator Boys in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''.

In 2003, Bo was cast as himself in an episode of [[According to Jim]], titled ''Bo Diddley''.

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him #20 on their list of the [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ 100 Greatest Artists of All Time].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = ''Rolling Stone'' Issue 946| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Bo Diddley celebrated his 50th anniversary in music with successful tours of Australia and Europe, and with coast-to-coast shows across North America. He performed his song &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; with [[Eric Clapton]], [[Robbie Robertson]], and longtime bassist and musical director [[Debby Hastings]] at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 20th annual induction ceremony and in the UK, ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine included his 1957 debut album &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; in its listing of the '100 Music, Movie &amp; TV Moments That Have Changed The World'.

In 2006, Bo Diddley participated as the headliner of a [[grassroots]] organized fundraiser concert, to benefit the town of [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], which had been devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The &quot;Florida Keys for Katrina Relief&quot; had originally been set for October 23, 2005, when [[Hurricane Wilma]] barreled through the [[Florida Keys]] on October 24, causing flooding and economic mayhem. In January 2006, the Florida Keys had recovered enough to host the fundraising concert to benefit the more hard-hit community of Ocean Springs. When asked about the fundraiser Bo Diddley stated, &quot;This is the United States of America. We believe in helping one another.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com/musical_performers.htm |title=Musical Performers |publisher=Floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com |date=2006-01-08 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Holger Petersen, on [[Saturday Night Blues]] on [[CBC Radio]] in the fall of 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/snb/latestshow.html | work=CBC News | title=CBC Radio – Saturday Night Blues – Past Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bo Diddley commented about the [[racism]] that existed in the music industry establishment during the early part of his career that saw him deprived of his [[royalty|royalties]] from the most successful part of his career.

Bo Diddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006 with the fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson Band]], featuring Johnson on keyboards, Richard Hunt on drums, and Gus Thornton on bass. But from 1985 until he died, his touring band consisted of Debby Hastings (bass/musical director), Frank Daley or Nunzio Signore (guitar), Tom Major, Dave Johnson, Yoshi Shimada or [[Sandy Gennaro]] (drums), and his personal manager, Margo Lewis (keyboards).

===Illness===
On May 13, 2007, Bo Diddley was admitted to [[intensive care]] in [[Creighton University Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], following a [[stroke]] after a concert in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] on May 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=60a08a4d-9f34-45ac-b395-c284d9a5ef50&amp;entry=index Rock Pioneer Bo Diddley Sidelined by Stroke E!News]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting the show, he had complained that he didn't feel well. He referred to smoke from the wildfires that were ravaging South Georgia and blowing south to the area near his home in Archer, Florida. Nonetheless, he delivered an energetic performance to an enthusiastic crowd. The next day, as Bo Diddley was heading back home, he seemed dazed and confused at the airport. His manager, Margo Lewis, called 911 and airport security and Bo was immediately taken by ambulance to Creighton University Medical Center and admitted to the [[Intensive-care unit]], where he stayed for several days. After numerous tests, it was confirmed that Bo Diddley had suffered a [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=5c8535ca-4223-4537-834e-ecb19af35ddf Bo Diddley Bouncing Back E!News]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a history of [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], and the stroke affected the left side of his brain, causing receptive and expressive [[aphasia]] (speech impairment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/entertainment/13334586/detail.html |title=Publicist: Bo Diddley Hospitalized After Stroke - Entertainment News Story - WTAE Pittsburgh |publisher=Thepittsburghchannel.com |date=2007-05-16 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stroke was followed by a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], suffered in Gainesville, Florida, on August 28, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratliff&quot;&gt;Ben Ratliff, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/arts/music/03diddley.html?_r=1&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=bo+diddley&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin &quot;Bo Diddley, Who Gave Rock His Beat, Dies at 79&quot;]. ''New York Times'', June 3, 2008, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;

While recovering from the stroke and heart attack, Diddley came back to his home town of McComb, Mississippi, in early November 2007 for the unveiling of a plaque devoted to him on the National Blues Trail stating that he was &quot;acclaimed as a founder of rock and roll.&quot; He was not supposed to perform, but as he listened to the music of local musician Jesse Robinson who sang a song written for this occasion, Robinson sensed that he wanted to perform and handed him a microphone. That was the first and last time that Bo Diddley performed publicly after suffering a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=7305146&amp;nav=menu119_3 |title=WLBT 3 - Jackson, MS: Bo Diddley Honored In Hometown |publisher=Wlbt.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral, a four-hour &quot;homegoing&quot; service, took place on June 7, 2008, at Showers of Blessings Church in Gainesville, Florida and kept in tune with the vibrant spirit of Bo Diddley's life and career. The many in attendance chanted &quot;Hey Bo Diddley&quot; as a gospel band played the legend's music. A number of notable musicians sent flowers, including: [[George Thorogood]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrington, Brendon.

He took time to remember Bo Diddley, his friend of a half-century, performing his namesake tune in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jambase.com/Articles/14179/Weekend-of-Legends-06.06-06.08-NYC Perrucci, Dino. &quot;Weekend of Legends&quot;.] ''JamBase.com''.

After the funeral service, a tribute concert was held at the Martin Luther King Center, also in Gainesville, and featured his touring band, The Debby Hastings Band, and guest artist [[Eric Burdon]].

In the days following his death, tributes were paid to him by then-President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States House of Representatives]], and an uncounted number of musicians and performers, including [[Eric Burdon]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Ronnie Hawkins]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], George Thorogood, [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]], the [[Black Lips]] and [[Ronnie Wood]]. He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded a [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] degree by the [[University of Florida]] for his influence on American popular music and in its &quot;People in America&quot; radio series about influential people in American history, the [[Voice of America]] radio service paid tribute to him, describing how &quot;his influence was so widespread that it is hard to imagine what rock and roll would have sounded like without him.&quot; [[Mick Jagger]] stated that &quot;he was a wonderful, original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on [[The Rolling Stones]]. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him.&quot; Jagger also praised the late star as a one of a kind musician, adding, &quot;We will never see his like again.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;http://showbizspy.com/news/06032008/mick-jagger-leads-tribute-for-diddley&lt;/ref&gt; As his bass player Debby Hastings said: he was the rock that the roll was built on.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==The Bo Diddley beat==
[[File:3-2 son clave 4-4.png|thumb|250px|right|&quot;Bo Diddley beat&quot;/[[Son clave]] {{audio|3-2 son clave.mid|Play}}.]]
Bo Diddley was well known for the &quot;Bo Diddley beat,&quot; a [[rumba (dance)|rumba]]-like beat similar to &quot;[[Juba dance|hambone]]&quot;, a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;Roscetti, Ed (2008). ''Stuff! Good Drummers Should Know'', p. 16. Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 1-4234-2848-X.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat resembling [[Shave and a Haircut|&quot;shave and a haircut, two bits&quot;]] beat, Diddley came across it while trying to play [[Gene Autry]]'s &quot;(I've Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/298/Blues+Reflections:+2003 |title=Blues Reflections |publisher=Afropop.org |date=1970-04-03 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years before Bo's &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, a song that closely resembles it, &quot;Hambone&quot;, was cut by [[Red Saunders (musician)|Red Saunders]]' Orchestra with The Hambone Kids.

In its simplest form, the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as a two-bar phrase:
:&quot;'''One''' and two '''and''' three and '''four''' and one and '''two''' and '''three''' and four and...&quot;
The '''bolded''' counts are the [[Clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm. 

His songs (for example, &quot;[[Hey Bo Diddley]]&quot; and &quot;[[Who Do You Love?]]&quot;) often have no [[chord (music)|chord]] changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic [[tension and release]]. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used a variety of rhythms, from straight [[beat (music)|back beat]] to [[Popular music|pop]] [[ballad]] style to [[doo-wop]], frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.

Also an influential guitar player, he developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack. Bo Diddley's trademark instrument was the rectangular-bodied [[Gretsch]] nicknamed &quot;The Twang Machine&quot; (referred to as &quot;cigar-box shaped&quot; by music promoter [[Dick Clark]]). Although he had other odd-shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the &quot;Cadillac&quot; design made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others), Diddley fashioned the square guitar himself around 1958 and wielded it in thousands of concerts over the years. In a 2005 interview on [[Triple J|JJJ]] radio in Australia, Bo implied that the design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a [[Gibson L5]] guitar, he landed awkwardly hurting his groin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. He also played the [[violin]], which is featured on his mournful [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] &quot;The Clock Strikes Twelve&quot;, a [[12-bar blues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/buyersguides/gr/diddleymasters.htm |title=Bo Diddley - I'm a Man: The Chess Masters, 1955-1958 - CD review |publisher=Oldies.about.com |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of [[folk music]] themes. The song &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; was based on the African American clapping rhyme &quot;[[Hambone]]&quot; (which in turn was based on the [[lullaby]] &quot;[[Hush Little Baby]]&quot;). Likewise, &quot;Hey Bo Diddley&quot; is based on the song &quot;[[Old MacDonald]]&quot;. The [[roots of hip hop|rap]]-style boasting of &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;, a wordplay on [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]], used many striking lyrics from the African-American tradition of [[Deejaying|toasts]] and boasts. His &quot;Say Man&quot; and &quot;Say Man, Back Again,&quot; both of which were later cited as progenerators of hip-hop music, share a strong connection to the insult game known as &quot;[[the dozens]]&quot;. For example: &quot;You got the nerve to call somebody ugly, why you so ugly the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Say Man&quot; (McDaniels) 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic marker and other dedications==
Bo Diddley was honored by the Mississippi Blues Commission with a [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] historic marker placed in [[McComb]], his birthplace, in recognition of his enormous contribution to the development of the blues in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2009 the city of [[Gainesville, Florida]], officially renamed and dedicated its downtown plaza the &quot;Bo Diddley Community Plaza.&quot; The plaza was the site of many benefit concerts at which Bo Diddley performed during his lifetime to raise money for local charities, including the [[Red Cross]].

The Obamas' dog, Bo, is also said to be named after him.

The Mario characters known as Boos were originally called &quot;Boo Diddleys&quot; in [[Super Mario Bros. 3]] as a reference to Bo Diddley, though this was long before Bo Diddley died.

[[Peter Cook]] &amp; [[Dudley Moore]] did a sketch in which Moore played a character called &quot;(the famous coloured singer) Bo Dudley&quot; in reference to Diddley. Moore's vocal performance during the sketch, however, was a parody of [[James Brown]]'s &quot;Papa's Got A Brand New Bag&quot;.

'''Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó''' (20 October 1882{{ndash}}16 August 1956), commonly known as '''Bela Lugosi''', was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] actor of [[theatre|stage]] and [[film|screen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WVobit&quot;&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', August 22, 1956, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; He was best known for playing [[Count Dracula]] in the [[Dracula (play)|Broadway play]] and subsequent [[Dracula (1931 film)|film version]]. In the last years of his career, he was featured in several of [[Ed Wood]]'s low budget films.

His earliest known performances are from provincial theaters in the 1903–1904 season, playing small roles in several plays and [[operetta]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, p. 21. ISBN 978-0813122731.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays and other major roles. Moving to [[Budapest]] in 1911, he played dozens of roles with the National Theater of Hungary in the period 1913–1919. Although Lugosi would later claim that he &quot;became the leading actor of Hungary's Royal National Theater&quot;, almost all his roles there were small or supporting parts.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26, 28–29. ISBN 978-0813122731.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], he served as an infantry [[lieutenant]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] from 1914 to 1916. There he rose to the rank of captain in the ski patrol and was awarded a medal equivalent to the [[Purple Heart]] for being wounded at the [[Russia]]n front.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt;

In 1917, Lugosi married Ilona Szmick. The couple divorced in 1920, reputedly over political differences with her parents.

Due to his activism in the actors union in Hungary during the time of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1919]], he was forced to flee his homeland.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt; He first went to [[Vienna, Austria]], and then settled in [[Germany]], where he continued acting.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt; Eventually, he traveled to [[New Orleans]] as a crewman aboard a merchant ship.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt;

==Early films==
Lugosi's first film appearance was in the 1917 movie ''[[The Colonel (film)|Az ezredes]]'' (known in [[English language|English]] as ''The Colonel''). When appearing in [[Cinema of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[silent film]]s he used the stage name '''Arisztid Olt'''. Lugosi made 12 films in Hungary between 1917 and 1918 before leaving for Germany. Following the collapse of [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919, [[political left|leftists]] and [[trade union]]ists became vulnerable. Lugosi was proscribed from acting due to his participation in the formation of an actor's [[labor union|union]]. In exile in Germany, he began appearing in a small number of well received films, including adaptations of the [[Karl May]] novels, ''[[On the Brink of Paradise|Auf den Trümmern des Paradieses]]'' (''On the Brink of Paradise''), and ''[[Caravan of Death (film)|Die Todeskarawane]]'' (''The Caravan of Death''), opposite the ill-fated [[Jewish]] actress [[Dora Gerson]]. Lugosi left Germany in October 1920, intending to emigrate to the [[United States of America|United States]], and entered the country at [[New Orleans]] in December 1920. He made his way to [[New York]] and was legally inspected for immigration at [[Ellis Island]] in March 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Passenger list of the S.S. ''Graf Tisza Istvan'', port of New Orleans, 4 December 1920, with later notation.&lt;/ref&gt; He declared his intention to become a U.S. citizen in 1928, and on June 26, 1931, he was [[naturalization|naturalized]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. ''Selected U.S. Naturalization Records — Original Documents, 1790–1974 (World Archives Project)'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his arrival in America, the 6 foot 1&amp;nbsp;inch (1.85 m), 180&amp;nbsp;lb. (82&amp;nbsp;kg) Béla worked for some time as a laborer, then entered the theater in New York City's Hungarian immigrant colony. With fellow Hungarian actors he formed a small [[repertory|stock company]] that toured Eastern cities, playing for immigrant audiences. He acted in his first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, ''The Red Poppy'', in 1922. Three more parts came in 1925–1926, including a five-month run in the comedy-fantasy ''The Devil in the Cheese''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=50322 Bela Lugosi], [[Internet Broadway Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; His first American film role came in the 1923 melodrama ''[[The Silent Command]]''. Several more silent roles followed, as villains or continental types, all in productions made in the New York area.

==''Dracula''==
Lugosi was approached in the summer of 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Rhodes |first1=Gary Don |title=Lugosi: his life in films, on stage, and in the hearts of horror lovers |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Aueo3mOrIKIC&amp;pg=PA169 |format=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=2009-02-18 |origyear=1997 |page=169 |chapter=Stage Appearances}}&lt;/ref&gt; to star in a Broadway production of ''[[Dracula (play)|Dracula]]'' adapted by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L. Balderston]] from [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula (novel)|novel]]. The [[Horace Liveright]] production was successful, running 261 performances before touring. He was soon called to Hollywood for character parts in early [[talkies]].

In 1929, Lugosi took his place in Hollywood society and scandal when he married wealthy [[San Francisco]] widow Beatrice Weeks, but she filed for divorce four months later. Weeks cited actress [[Clara Bow]] as the &quot;other woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, p. 68. ISBN 978-0813122731.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his critically acclaimed performance on stage, Lugosi was not the [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] first choice for the role of Dracula when the company optioned the rights to the Deane play and began production in 1930. A persistent rumor asserts that director [[Tod Browning]]'s long-time collaborator [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] was Universal's first choice for the role, and that Lugosi was chosen only due to Chaney's death shortly before production. This is questionable, because Chaney had been under long-term contract to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] since 1925, and had negotiated a lucrative new contract just before his death.

Chaney and Browning had worked together on several projects (including four of Chaney's final five releases), but Browning was only a last-minute choice to direct the movie version of ''Dracula'' after the death of director [[Paul Leni]], who was originally slated to direct.

In 1933 he married 19-year-old Lillian Arch, the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. They had a child, [[Bela G. Lugosi]], in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Friedemann O’Brien Goldberg &amp; Zarian Names Bela G. Lugosi Of Counsel |url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/bela021402.htm |quote=Bela G.

Lillian and Béla divorced in 1953,&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; at least partially because of Béla's jealousy over Lillian taking a full-time job as an assistant to [[Brian Donlevy]] on the sets and studios for Donlevy's radio and television series ''Dangerous Assignment''&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, p. 393. ISBN 978-0813122731.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; Lillian eventually did marry Brian Donlevy, in 1966. Lugosi married Hope Lininger in 1953. She had been a fan of his, writing letters to him when he was in hospital recovering from addiction to [[Demerol]]. She would sign her letters 'A dash of Hope'.

==Typecasting==
Through his association with Dracula (in which he appeared with minimal makeup, using his natural, heavily accented voice), Lugosi found himself [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a [[horror film|horror]] villain in such movies as ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'', and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' for Universal, and the independent ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''. His accent, while a part of his image, limited the roles he could play.

Lugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles. He lost out to [[Lionel Barrymore]] for the role of [[Rasputin]] in ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]''; [[C. Henry Gordon]] for the role of Surat Khan in ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|Charge of the Light Brigade]]''; [[Basil Rathbone]] for the role of Commissar Dimitri Gorotchenko in ''[[Tovarich (film)|Tovarich]]'' (a role Lugosi had played on stage). He did play the elegant, somewhat hot-tempered Gen. Nicholas Strenovsky-Petronovich in ''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]''.

It is an erroneous popular belief that Lugosi declined the offer to appear in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' due to make-up (other roles he desired which also required make-up were Cyrano de Bergerac and Quasimodo the bell ringing hunchback). Lugosi may not have been happy with the onerous makeup job and lack of dialogue. 

Regardless of controversy, five films at Universal &amp;mdash; ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'', ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'', ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Black Friday (1940 film)|Black Friday]]'' (plus minor cameo performances in 1934's ''[[Gift of Gab (1934 film)|Gift of Gab]]'') and one at [[RKO Pictures]], ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' &amp;mdash; paired Lugosi with [[Boris Karloff]]. Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff is the subject of contradictory reports, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were &amp;mdash; for a time, at least &amp;mdash; good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the [[English people|Englishman]] would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi).

Universal tried to give Lugosi more heroic roles, as in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'', ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', and a romantic role in the adventure serial ''The Return of Chandu'', but his typecasting problem was too entrenched for those roles to help.

Lugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 [[Players Directory]], published by the Motion Picture Academy, in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films &quot;an error.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Michael Mallory.  [[Universal Studios Monsters: A Legacy of Horror]], 2009, Universe, pg. 63.  ISBN 978-0-7893-1896-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career path==
A number of factors worked against Lugosi's career in the mid-1930s. Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror [[B-movie|B-film unit]], at times in small roles where he was obviously used for &quot;name value&quot; only. Throughout the 1930s Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like Nat Levine, [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Sam Katzman]]. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the Actors' Fund to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.
[[File:LugosiDevilBat5.jpg|thumb|From ''[[The Devil Bat]]'', 1940]]
His career was given a second chance by Universal's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' in 1939, when he played the character role of [[Igor (fictional character)|Ygor]], who uses the Monster for his own revenge, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi playing a straight character role in a major motion picture: he was a stern commissar in [[MGM]]'s comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]]. This small but prestigious role could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year he was back on Hollywood's [[Poverty Row]], playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] B-films were released by [[Monogram Pictures]]. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. ''[[The Gorilla (1939 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1939) had him playing [[double act|straight man]] to [[Patsy Kelly]], in a role she told author [[Boze Hadleigh]] was her finest role.

Ostensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic [[sciatica]]. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as [[asparagus]] juice, doctors increased the medication to [[opiate]]s. The growth of his dependence on pain-killers, particularly [[morphine]] and [[methadone]], was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. In 1943, he finally played the role of Frankenstein's monster in Universal's ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman]]'', which this time contained dialogue (Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], from line readings at the end of 1942's ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' because Ygor's brain had been transplanted into the Monster). Lugosi continued to play the Monster with Ygor's consciousness but with groping gestures because the Monster was now blind. Ultimately, all of the Monster's dialogue and all references to his sightlessness were edited out of the released film, leaving a strange, maimed performance characterized by unexplained gestures and lip movements with no words coming out. He also came to recreate the role of Dracula a second and last time on film in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' in 1948. By this time, Lugosi's drug use was so notorious that the producers were not even aware that Lugosi was still alive, and had penciled in actor [[Ian Keith]] for the role.

''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' was Bela Lugosi's last &quot;A&quot; movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared &amp;mdash; less and less frequently &amp;mdash; in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947 to 1950 he performed in [[summer stock]], often in productions of ''Dracula'' or ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', and during the rest of the year made personal appearances in a touring &quot;spook show&quot; and on television. While in [[England]] to play a six-month tour of ''Dracula'' in 1951, he co-starred in a lowbrow movie comedy, ''Mother Riley Meets the Vampire'' (also known as ''Vampire over London'' and ''My Son, the Vampire''). Upon his return to America, Lugosi was interviewed for television, and revealed his ambition to play more comedy, though wistfully noting, &quot;Now I am the boogie man.&quot; Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, ''[[Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla]]''. Another opportunity for comedy came in September 1949 when [[Milton Berle]] invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/9-27-1949/episode/670241/summary.htmlTexaco Star Theater Episode Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=Tom |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age|publisher=McFarland|year=2004|pages=160|isbn=0-786-42070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was depicted in the [[Tim Burton]] film ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', with [[Martin Landau]] as Lugosi. Though Burton did not actually identify the comedian in the biopic, the events depicted were correct.

==Working with Ed Wood==
Late in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in movies when filmmaker [[Ed Wood]], a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' and as a [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]-like [[mad scientist]] in ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. During [[post-production]] of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his [[drug addiction]], and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to [[Kitty Kelley]]'s biography of [[Frank Sinatra]], when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited at the hospital. Lugosi would recall his amazement, since he didn't even know Sinatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Kitty |title=His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1987|pages=248|isbn=0-553-26515-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extras on an early [[DVD]] release of ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' include an impromptu interview with Lugosi upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, which provide some rare personal insights into the man. During the interview, Lugosi states that he is about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, ''The Ghoul Goes West''. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including ''The Phantom Ghoul'' and ''Dr. Acula''. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of [[Tor Johnson]]'s home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''.

Lugosi married Hope Linninger, his fifth wife, in 1955. Following his treatment, Lugosi made one final film, in late 1955, ''[[The Black Sleep]]'', for Bel-Air Pictures, which was released in the summer of 1956 through [[United Artists]] with a promotional campaign that included several personal appearances. To his disappointment, however, his role in this film was of a [[mute]], with no dialogue.

==Death==
Lugosi died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on August 16, 1956 while lying on a couch in his [[Los Angeles]] home. He was 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Bela Lugosi Dies. Created Dracula.

Lugosi was buried wearing one of the ''Dracula'' stage play costumes, per the request of his son and fourth wife, in the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]]. Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his cloak; [[Bela G. Lugosi]] confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, actually made the decision but believed that it is what his father would have wanted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bela G. Lugosi]] states this in &quot;The Road to Dracula&quot;, a documentary supplement in the DVD &quot;Dracula -(1931)&quot; [Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection, Universal DVD #903 249 9.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Plan 9 from Outer Space''==
One of Lugosi's roles was released posthumously. Ed Wood's ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (Originally titled Grave Robbers From Outer Space) features footage of Lugosi interspersed with a double. Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project. When he later conceived ''Plan 9'', Wood wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired [[Tom Mason]], his wife's [[chiropractor]], to double for Lugosi in additional shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lostmag.com/issue18/lugosi.php|title=Bela Lugosi's Legacy|last=Nuzum |first=Eric |work = Lost |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double is thinner than Lugosi, and in every shot covers the lower half of his face with his cape, as Lugosi sometimes did in ''Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein.'' As [[Leonard Maltin]] put it in early editions of his movies guide book, &quot;Lugosi died during production, and it shows.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1979, the ''[[Lugosi v. Universal Pictures]]'' decision by the [[California Supreme Court]] held that Bela Lugosi's [[personality rights]] could not pass to his heirs, as a [[copyright]] would have. The court ruled that under California law any rights of publicity, including the right to his image, terminated with Lugosi's death.&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.findlaw.com/1998/Feb/1/130405.html |title=Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal. 1979). |accessdate=2007-02-14 |quote=In this decision preceding (and precipitating) the Legislature's enactment of Section 990, the California Supreme Court held that rights of publicity were not descendible in California. Bela Lugosi's heirs, Hope Linninger Lugosi and Bela George Lugosi, sued to enjoin and recover profits from Universal Pictures for licensing Lugosi's name and image on merchandise reprising Lugosi's title role in the 1931 film ''Dracula''. The [[California Supreme Court]] faced the question whether Bela Lugosi's film contracts with Universal included a grant of merchandising rights in his portrayal of Count Dracula, and the descendibility of any such rights. Adopting the opinion of Justice Roth for the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, the court held that the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime. Lugosi, 603 P.2d at 431. |publisher=[[FindLaw]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California's descendibility statute for rights of publicity, Civil Code Section 990, was enacted in 1988, and Lugosi's estate now licenses the commercial use of his name and image.

In [[Tim Burton]]'s 1994 ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', Lugosi is played by [[Martin Landau]] in an interpretation for which Landau received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. According to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), Forrest Ackerman, [[Dolores Fuller]] and Richard Sheffield, Lugosi never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. The film fabricated much about the Hungarian actor.

Three Lugosi projects were featured on the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. ''[[The Corpse Vanishes]]'' appeared in episode 105, the serial ''[[The Phantom Creeps]]'' throughout season two and the Ed Wood production ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' in episode 423.

An episode of ''[[Sledge Hammer]]'' titled &quot;Last of the Red Hot Vampires&quot; was a homage to Bela Lugosi; at the end of the episode, it was dedicated to &quot;Mr. Blaskó&quot;.

In 2001, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''There Are Such Things'' by [[Steven McNicoll]] and Mark McDonnell. Focusing on Lugosi and his well documented struggle to escape from the role that had typecast him, the play went on to receive The Hamilton Dean award for best dramatic presentation from the Dracula Society in 2002.

A statue of Lugosi can be seen today on one of the corners of the [[Vajdahunyad Castle]] in [[Budapest]].

The [[Ellis Island]] Immigration Museum in [[New York City]] features a live, 30-minute play that focuses on Lugosi's illegal entry into the country and then his arrival at Ellis Island to enter the country legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisisland.org/genealogy/ellis_island_visiting.asp|title=Visiting the Ellis Island Immigration Museum|publisher=ellisisland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cape Lugosi wore in the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' still survives today in the ownership of Universal Studios.

The theatrical play ''Lugosi - a vámpír árnyéka'' (''Lugosi - the Shadow of the Vampire'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) is based on Lugosi's life, telling the story of his life as he becomes typecast as Dracula and as his drug addiction worsens. He was played by one of Hungary's most renowned actors, [[Ivan Darvas]].

Andy Warhol's 1963 silkscreen ''The Kiss'' depicts Lugosi from ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' about to bite into the neck of co-star [[Helen Chandler]], who played [[Mina Harker]]. A copy sold for $798,000 at [[Christie's]] in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1787949 Christies: Andy Warhol (1928-1987): The Kiss (Bela Lugosi)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugosi was also the subject of &quot;[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]&quot;, the first single by English rock band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]. It was released in August 1979 and it is often considered to be the first [[gothic rock]] record.

Goth band Lesbian Bed Death's song Bela Lugosi's Back is about the actor. The video associated with the song shows scenes with him.

'''''Bride of the Monster''''' is a 1955 sci-fi horror film starring [[Bela Lugosi]], along with [[Tor Johnson]], Tony McCoy and [[Loretta King Hadler]]. It was produced, directed and co-written by [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]]

A [[sequel]], entitled ''[[Night of the Ghouls]]'', was finished in 1959, but due to last-minute financial problems, was not released until 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb-ghouls-trivia&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Dr. Eric Vornoff ([[Bela Lugosi]]), is experimenting with [[nuclear power]] with the help of his mute assistant, Lobo ([[Tor Johnson]]). His goal is to eventually create an army of superpowered soldiers that he will use to conquer the earth. Their residence, an old mansion, is guarded by a giant octopus of Dr. Vornoff's own creation which lives in the surrounding swamp. The Octopus (referred to as simply &quot;the monster&quot;) has been responsible for the deaths of local townspeople. Newspaper reporter Janet Lawton ([[Loretta King Hadler]], in a role originally intended for [[Dolores Fuller]])&lt;ref name = &quot;grey&quot;/&gt; investigates further, becoming a prisoner of Dr. Vornoff in the process. The police eventually follow, led by lieutenant Dick Craig (Tony McCoy, producer Donald E. McCoy's son), who is also Lawton's boyfriend. Meanwhile, an official from Dr. Vornoff's home country, Professor Strowksi (George Becwar), arrives and tries to persuade him to return to their homeland in hopes that his research will benefit their nation. However, Strowski is killed and Lobo unwittingly turns Dr. Vornoff into an atomic-powered superhuman being. A fire is soon started in the laboratory, killing Lobo. Police officials, the irradiated Dr. Vornoff, Dick Craig and Janet Lawton all escape, and Dr. Vornoff is eventually killed by the octopus as the mansion explodes, forming a [[mushroom cloud]] as the film ends.

==Production and legacy==
The first incarnation of the film was a 1953 script by [[Alex Gordon (writer-producer)|Alex Gordon]] titled ''The Atomic Monster'', but a lack of financing prevented any production.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;/&gt; Later Ed Wood revived the project as ''The Monster of the Marshes''. Actual shooting began in October 1954 at the Ted Allan Studios, but further money problems quickly halted the production.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;/&gt; The required funds were supplied by a rancher named Donald McCoy, who became the film's producer. He also provided his son to star as the film's hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;/&gt; Production resumed in 1955 at Centaur Studios and the film finally premiered at Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre|Paramount theater]] in May 1955, under the title ''Bride of the Atom''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

This film is part of what Wood aficionados refer to as &quot;The Kelton Trilogy&quot;, a trio of films featuring [[Paul Marco]] as &quot;Officer Kelton&quot;, a whining, reluctant policeman.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The other two films are ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' and ''Night of the Ghouls''.  The character of Lobo also appeared again in ''Bride'''s sequel, ''Night of the Ghouls''.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb-ghouls&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned in an episode of the 1986 syndicated series, the ''[[Canned Film Festival]]'', ''Bride of the Monster'' was Bela Lugosi's last speaking role in a feature film. His last appearance in a film was Wood's ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.

The television program ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' featured the film.

In 2008, a [[Film colorization|colorized]] version was released by [[Legend Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BSBBKI |title=ASIN: B001BSBBKI |accessdate=2009-01-30 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is also available from [[Amazon Video on Demand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001LNV63U/ |title=ASIN: B001LNV63U |accessdate=2009-01-30 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a retrospective on the movie entitled ''Citizen Wood: Making ‘The Bride,’ Unmaking the Legend'' was included in the ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' Volume 19 DVD set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Film Threat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/27760/|title=Film Threat - Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume Xix (dvd)|author=Brad Cook|date=12 November 2010|work=|publisher=[[Film Threat]]|accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horror host]] [[Mr. Lobo]] is among the interviewees of the 27 minute documentary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Film Threat&quot;/&gt;

==Controversies among film critics==
In the [[1994 in film|1994]] satirical biopic ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', it is alleged that Wood and the filmmakers stole the mechanical [[octopus]] (previously used in the film ''[[Wake of the Red Witch]]'') from the [[Republic Pictures|Republic Studios]] backlot, while failing to steal the motor which enabled the prop to move realistically. These events are also alleged in the 2004 documentary, ''The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made.'' However, other stories circulated insist Wood legitimately rented the octopus, along with some cars.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  To remedy the lack of movement from the octopus prop, whenever someone was killed by the monster in the film, they simply flailed around in the shallow water while holding the tentacles to imitate movement.  The filming of these scenes, as well as the production of the film in general, were played to comic effect in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', directed by [[Tim Burton]]. Lugosi's monologue to Professor Strowski is featured twice in the movie.

The book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]'' claims that Lugosi's character declares his manservant Lobo ([[Tor Johnson]]) &quot;as harmless as kitchen&quot; [sic]. This allegedly misspoken line is cited as evidence of either Lugosi's failing health/mental faculties, or as further evidence of Wood's incompetence as a director.&lt;ref name=&quot;medved&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 | year = 1980
 | publisher = Putnam
 | location = New York
 | isbn = 0-399-50463-X
 | pages = 178
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a viewing of the film itself reveals that Lugosi said this line correctly, the exact words being, &quot;''Don't be afraid of Lobo; he's as gentle as a kitten.''&quot;

Rudolph Grey's book ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.'' contains anecdotes regarding the making of this film.&lt;ref name=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Grey notes that participants in the original events sometimes contradict one another, but he relates each person's information for posterity. He also includes Ed Wood's claim that one of his films made a profit and surmises that it was most likely ''Bride of the Monster'', but that Wood had oversold the film and could not reimburse the backers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Berry paradox''' is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] arising from the expression &quot;the smallest possible [[integer]] not definable by a given number of [[word]]s&quot;. [[Bertrand Russell]], the first to discuss the paradox in print, attributed it to G. G. Berry (1867–1928),&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Griffin, [http://books.google.com/books?id=obY48lTt-2AC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=g+g+berry The Cambridge companion to Bertrand Russell], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; a junior [[librarian]] at [[Oxford]]'s [[Bodleian library]], who had suggested the more limited paradox arising from the expression &quot;the first [[definable number|undefinable]] [[ordinal number|ordinal]]&quot;.

== The paradox ==
Consider the expression:

:&quot;The smallest [[Positive number|positive]] [[integer]] not definable in under eleven words.&quot;

Since there are [[finite set|finitely]] many words, there are finitely many phrases of under eleven words, and hence finitely many positive integers that are defined by phrases of under eleven words. Since there are infinitely many positive integers, this means that there are positive integers that cannot be defined by phrases of under eleven words. By the [[well ordering principle]], if there are positive integers that satisfy a given property, then there is a ''smallest'' positive integer that satisfies that property; therefore, there is a smallest positive integer satisfying the property &quot;not definable in under eleven words&quot;. This is the integer to which the above expression refers. The above expression is only ten words long, so this integer is defined by an expression that is under eleven words long; it ''is'' definable in under eleven words, and is ''not'' the smallest positive integer not definable in under eleven words, and is ''not'' defined by this expression. This is a paradox: there must be an integer defined by this expression, but since the expression is self-contradictory (any integer it defines is definable in under eleven words), there cannot be any integer defined by it.

== Resolution ==
The  Berry paradox as formulated above arises because of systematic [[ambiguity]] in the word &quot;definable&quot;. In other formulations of the Berry paradox, such as one that instead reads: &quot;...not [[name]]able in less...&quot; the term &quot;nameable&quot; is also one that has this systematic ambiguity. Terms of this kind give rise to [[vicious circle principle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Whitehead (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; To resolve one of these paradoxes means to pinpoint exactly where our use of language went wrong and to provide restrictions on the use of language which may avoid them.

This family of paradoxes can be resolved by incorporating stratifications of meaning in language. Terms with systematic ambiguity may be written with subscripts denoting that one level of meaning is considered a higher priority than another in their interpretation. &quot;The number not nameable&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in less than eleven words&quot; may be nameable&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in less than eleven words under this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Quine]] (1976) ''Ways of Paradox''. Harvard Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal analogues ==

Using programs or proofs of bounded lengths, it is possible to construct an analogue of the Berry expression in a formal mathematical language, as has been done by [[Gregory Chaitin]].  Though the formal analogue does not lead to a logical contradiction, it does prove  certain impossibility results.

[[George Boolos]] (1989) built on a formalized version of Berry's paradox to prove [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]] in a new and much simpler way. The basic idea of his proof is that a [[proposition]] that holds of ''x'' if ''x'' = ''n'' for some natural number ''n'' can be called a ''definition'' for ''n'', and that the set {(''n'', ''k''): ''n'' has a definition that is ''k'' symbols long} can be shown to be representable (using [[Gödel number]]s). Then the proposition &quot;''m'' is the first number not definable in less than ''k'' symbols&quot; can be formalized and shown to be a definition in the sense just stated.

==Relationship with Kolmogorov complexity==
{{main | Kolmogorov complexity}}

It is not possible in general to unambiguously define what is the minimal number of symbols required to describe a given string (given a specific description mechanism). In this context, the terms ''string'' and ''number'' may be used interchangeably, since a number is actually a string of symbols, i.e. an English word (like the word &quot;eleven&quot; used in the paradox) while, on the other hand, it is possible to refer to any word with a number, e.g. by the number of its position in a given dictionary, or by suitable encoding. Some long strings can be described exactly using fewer symbols than those required by their full representation, as is often experienced using [[data compression]]. The complexity of a given string is then defined as the minimal length that a description requires in order to (unambiguously) refer to the full representation of that string.

The Kolmogorov complexity is defined using [[formal language]]s, or [[Turing machines]], that allow to avoid ambiguities about what string results from a given description. After defining that function, it can be proved that it cannot be computed. The proof by contradiction shows that if it were possible to compute the Kolmogorov complexity, then it would also be possible to systematically generate paradoxes similar to this one, i.e. descriptions shorter than what the complexity of the described string implies. That is to say, the definition of the Berry number is paradoxical because it is not actually possible to compute how many words are required to define a number, and we know that such computation is not feasible because of the paradox.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{other uses|IPC Biathlon and Cross-Country Skiing World Championships}}
The first '''[[Biathlon]] World Championships (BWCH)''' was held in 1958, with individual and team contests for men. The number of events has grown significantly over the years. Beginning in 1984, women biathletes had their own World Championships, and finally, from 1989, both genders have been participating in joint BWCHs. In 1978 the development was enhanced by the change from the large army rifle calibre to a small bore rifle, while the range to the target was reduced from 150 to 50 meters.

== BWCH venues ==
The season's BWCHs takes place during February or March. Some years it has been necessary to schedule parts of the Championships at other than the main venue because of weather and/or snow conditions. Full, joint BWCHs have never been held in [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic Winter Games]] seasons. BWCHs in non-IOC events, however, have been held in Olympic seasons. In 2005, the then new event of Mixed Relay (two legs done by women, two legs by men) was arranged separately from the ordinary Championships.
