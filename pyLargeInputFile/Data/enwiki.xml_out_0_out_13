==Church music==
{{Main|Ambrosian Hymnography}}

Ambrose is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of [[Ambrosian chant]] also known simply as &quot;antiphonal [[chant]]&quot;, a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other. (The later pope St. [[Gregory I the Great]] is not known to have composed any [[Gregorian chant]], the [[plainsong]] or &quot;[[Romish chant]]&quot;.) However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing [[hymnody]] from the Eastern Church into the West.

Catching the impulse from [[Hilary of Arles|Hilary]] and confirmed in it by the success of Arian [[psalmody]], Ambrose composed several original [[hymn]]s as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies.  Each of these hymns has eight four-line [[stanza]]s and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs).
Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.
*''Deus Creator Omnium''
*''Aeterne rerum conditor''
*''Jam surgit hora tertia''
*''Jam Christus astra ascendante&quot;
*''[http://www.christmas-carols.org.uk/christmas-carols/come-thou-redemmer-of-the-earth Veni redemptor gentium]'' (a [[Christmas]] hymn)
*[http://victorcauchi.fortunecity.com/christwrit/hymns.htm Text of some Ambrosian Hymns]

In his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of [[psalms]], in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''.

St. Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn ''[[Te Deum]]'', which he is said to have composed when he baptised [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]], his celebrated convert.

==Ambrose and Augustine==
Ambrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']].

===Ambrose and celibacy===
In a passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']] in which Augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with Ambrose, he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:
{{quote|Ambrose himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor. Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden.&lt;ref name=&quot;AugustineOnAmbrose&quot;&gt;Augustine. ''Confessions'' Book Six, Chapter Three.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ambrose and reading===
In this same passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']] is a curious anecdote in  which bears on the history of reading:
{{quote|When [Ambrose] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still. Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.&lt;ref name=&quot;AugustineOnAmbrose&quot; /&gt;}}

This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion. The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become. In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection. However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/jul/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview27 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Read my lips | first=James | last=Fenton | date=July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Several of Ambrose's works have recently been published in the bilingual Latin-German [[Fontes Christiani]] series (currently edited by [[Brepols]]).

Several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around Milan at various times since the 14th century have been called Ambrosians. Their connection to Ambrose is tenuous

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambracia''', occasionally ''Ampracia'' ({{lang-el|ancient Ἀμπρακία}}; modern Αμβρακία), was an ancient [[Corinth, Greece|Corinthian]] colony, situated about 7 miles from the [[Ambracian Gulf]] in [[Greece]], on a bend of the navigable river [[Arachthos River|Arachthos]] (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Hammond  | first = Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière  | author-link=N.

[[File:Map of ancient Epirus and environs.png|right|thumb|200px|Ambracia in antiquity]]

==History==
It was founded between 650 and 625 BC by [[Gorgus]], son of the Corinthian tyrant [[Cypselus]], at which time its economy was based on farmlands, fishing, timber for shipbuilding, and the exportation of the produce of Epirus.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt; After the expulsion of Gorgus's son [[Periander]] its government developed into a strong democracy.  The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] trade), its consequent aversion to [[Corcyra]] (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the [[Battle of Sybota]], which took place in 433 BC between the rebellous corinthian colony of [[Corcyra]] (modern Corfu) and [[Corinth]]).{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}

Ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the [[Amphilochians]] and [[Acarnanians]].  Hence it took a prominent part in the [[Peloponnesian War]] until the crushing defeat at [[Idomene]] (426) which crippled its resources.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}

In the 4th century BC it continued its traditional policy, but in 338 was besieged by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. With the assistance of Corinth and Athens, it escaped complete domination at Philip's hands, but was nevertheless forced to accept a Macedonian garrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;  In [[294 BC]], after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given by the son of [[Cassander]] to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], who made it his capital, and adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.  In the wars of [[Philip V of Macedon]] and the Epirotes against the [[Aetolia]]n league (220–205) Ambracia passed from one alliance to the other, but ultimately joined the latter confederacy.  During the struggle of the Aetolians against [[Roman Republic|Rome]], it stood a stubborn [[siege]], including the first known use of [[poison gas]] against the Romans' [[Tunnel warfare|siege tunnels]].&lt;ref&gt;POLYBIOS 21.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambracia was captured and plundered by [[M. Fulvius Nobilior]] in [[189 BC]], after which it was declared by Rome a &quot;free city&quot;, and gradually fell into insignificance.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}  The foundation by [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] of [[Nicopolis]], into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted, left the site desolate.  In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times a new settlement took its place under the name of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. Some fragmentary walls of large, well-dressed blocks near this latter town indicate the early prosperity of Ambracia.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}

'''Amber''' is [[fossil]]ized tree [[resin]] (not [[sap]]), which has been appreciated for its color and natural organic beauty since [[Neolithic]] times.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; Amber is used as an ingredient in perfumes, as a healing agent in folk medicine, and as jewelry. There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called '''resinite''', and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams. &lt;ref&gt;Poinar GO, Poinar R. The quest for life in amber. Basic Books, 1995, ISBN 0201489287, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==
The English word ''amber'' derives from the [[Arabic]] '''anbar'', via Medieval Latin ''ambar'' and Old French ''ambre''. The word originally referred to a precious oil derived from the [[Sperm whale]] (now called [[ambergris]]). The sense was extended to [[fossil]] [[resin]] circa 1400, and this became the main sense as the use of ambergris waned.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|amber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two substances were confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is lighter than water and floats; whereas amber is lighter than stone, but not light enough to float.&lt;ref&gt;see: Abu Zaid al Hassan from Siraf &amp; Sulaiman the Merchant (851), ''Silsilat-al-Tawarikh (travels in Asia)''.&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;ambar&quot; was brought to Europe by the Crusaders. In French &quot;ambre gris&quot; was then distinguished from &quot;ambre jaune&quot;: ambre gris (gray amber) was [[ambergris]]; ambre jaune (yellow amber) was the [[fossil]] [[resin]] we now call amber.

Amber is discussed by [[Theophrastus]], possibly the first historical mention of the material, in the 4th century BC. The Greek name for amber was '' ηλεκτρον '' (''electron'') and was connected to the Sun God, one of whose titles was ''Elector'' or the ''Awakener''.&lt;ref name=King1&gt;{{Cite book| last = King|first = Rev.

The presence of insects in amber was noticed by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]], and led him to theorize correctly that, at some point, amber had to be in a liquid state to cover the bodies of insects. Hence he gave it the expressive name of ''succinum'' or ''gum-stone'', a name that is still in use today to describe [[succinic acid]] as well as ''succinite'', a term given to a particular type of amber by [[James Dwight Dana]] (see below under Baltic Amber).

Heating amber will soften it and eventually it will burn, which is why in [[Germanic languages]] the word for amber is a literal translation of ''burn-Stone'' ([[Dutch language|nl.]] ''barnsteen'', [[German language|de.]] ''Bernstein'', the latter of which the [[Polish language|Polish]] word ''bursztyn'' derives from). Heated above 200°C, amber suffers decomposition, yielding an &quot;oil of amber&quot;, and leaving a black residue which is known as &quot;amber colophony&quot;, or &quot;amber pitch&quot;; when dissolved in oil of [[turpentine]] or in [[linseed oil]] this forms &quot;amber varnish&quot; or &quot;amber lac&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Amber from the [[Baltic Sea]] has been extensively traded since antiquity and in the main land, from where amber was traded 2000 years ago, the natives called it ''glaes'' (referring to its see-through similarity to [[glass]]). {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] term for amber is ''Gintaras'' and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''Dzintars''. They and the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''jantar'' are thought to originate from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''jainitar'' (sea-resin). However, while most Slavic languages, such as Russian and Czech, retain the old Slavic word, in the Polish language, despite still being correct, ''jantar'' is used very rarely (even considered [[archaism|archaic]]) and was replaced by the word ''bursztyn'' deriving from the German analogue.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Composition and formation==
Amber is [[heterogeneous]] in composition, but consists of several [[resin]]ous bodies more or less soluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]], associated with an insoluble [[Bitumen|bituminous]] substance. Amber is a [[macromolecule]] by free [[radical polymerization]] of several precursors in the [[labdane]] family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Villanueva-García, Antonio Martínez-Richa, and Juvencio Robles [http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1567/EJ-1567C.asp Assignment of vibrational spectra of labdatriene derivatives and ambers: A combined experimental and density functional theoretical study] [[Arkivoc]] (EJ-1567C) pp. 449–458&lt;/ref&gt; These labdanes are [[diterpene]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three [[alkene]] groups for [[polymerization]]. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as [[isomerization]] reactions, [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] and [[cyclization]].

The average composition of amber leads to the general formula [[Carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]].

===Formation===
Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into [[copal]]. Sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Patty C.|last=Rice|title=Amber: Golden Gem of the Ages. 4th Ed.|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|isbn=1-4259-3849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botanical origin===
Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the [[Agathis]] group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus [[Hymenaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12186567|year=2002|last1=Lambert|first1=JB|last2=Poinar Jr|first2=GO|title=Amber: the organic gemstone.|volume=35|issue=8|pages=628–36|journal=Accounts of chemical research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusions===
The abnormal development of resin has been called ''succinosis''. Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped on to the ground, so that the material may be useless except for varnish-making, whence the impure amber is called ''firniss''. Enclosures of [[pyrites]] may give a bluish color to amber. The so-called ''black amber'' is only a kind of [[Jet (lignite)|jet]]. ''Bony amber'' owes its cloudy opacity to minute bubbles in the interior of the resin.

In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm |title=BBC News, &quot; Secret 'dino bugs' revealed&quot;, 1 April 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraction and processing==
=== Distribution and mining ===

Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger.
Historically, the coast around [[Königsberg]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] was the world's leading source of amber. About 90% of the world's extractable amber is still located in the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia on the Baltic Sea (which was previously Königsberg in Prussia, before World War II) .&lt;ref&gt;[http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of ''blue earth'' have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.

Dominican amber, especially Dominican blue amber, is mined through [[bell pit]]ting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Wichard und Wolfgang Weitschat: Im Bernsteinwald. – Gerstenberg Verlag, Hildesheim, 2004, ISBN 3-8067-2551-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
The Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] and polish it with whitening and water or with [[rotten stone]] and oil. The final lustre is given by friction with flannel.

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with [[linseed oil]], heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of &quot;amberoid&quot; or &quot;pressed amber&quot;. The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure; the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like [[copal]] and [[kauri]], as well as by [[celluloid]] and even [[glass]]. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called &quot;true amber&quot;.

==Appearance==
Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color &quot;amber&quot;, amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other more uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as &quot;cherry amber&quot;), green amber, and even [[blue amber]], which is rare and highly sought after.

Much of the most highly-prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as &quot;bony amber&quot;.

Although all [[Dominican amber]] is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is [[blue amber]]. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly [[ultraviolet]] light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about 100&amp;nbsp;kg is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manuel A. Iturralde-Vennet |year=2001|title= Geology of the Amber-Bearing Deposits of the Greater Antilles|journal= Caribbean Journal of Science|volume= 37|issue=3|pages= 141–167|url=http://academic.uprm.edu/publications/cjs/Vol37b/37_141-167.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.

==Classification==
Amber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. [[Terpenoid]]s, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of isoprene (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) units.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; [[Phenol]]ic resins are today only produced by angiosperms, and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct [[Medullosales|medullosan]]s produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0146-6380(92)90051-X|title=The nature and fate of natural resins in the geosphere—II. Identification, classification and nomenclature of resinites☆|year=1992|last1=Anderson|first1=K|last2=Winans|first2=R|last3=Botto|first3=R|journal=Organic Geochemistry|volume=18|issue=6|pages=829–841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii/&gt; There is also a separate classifications of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.

Class I:

This class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt; It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilise regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), whilst Ic uses ''enantio'' labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, ''enantio'' biformenes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/bk-1995-0617.ch006|title=New Evidence Concerning the Structure, Composition, and Maturation of Class I (Polylabdanoid) Resinites|year=1996|last1=Anderson|first1=Ken B.|volume=617|pages=105–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ia:&lt;br/&gt;
Includes ''Succinite'' (= 'normal' Baltic amber) and ''Glessite''.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii/&gt; Have a communic acid base. They also include much succinic acid.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

[[Baltic amber]] yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or ''bony'' varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name ''succinite''. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It can be distinguished from other ambers via [[IR spectroscopy]] due to a specific [[carbonyl]] absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample.{{Verify source|date=October 2009}} Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.&lt;ref name=Rottlaender1970&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natmus.dk/cons/reports/2002/amber/amber.pdf |title=(Rottlaender, 1970)|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ib:&lt;br/&gt;
Like class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack succinic acid.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

Ic:&lt;br/&gt;
This class is mainly based on ''enantio''-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and zanzibaric acids.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt; Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt;

Dominican amber differentiates itself from [[Baltic amber]] by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of [[fossil]] inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.&lt;ref name=Poinar&gt;George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999. ''The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World'', (Princeton University Press) ISBN 0-691-02888-5&lt;/ref&gt; Resin from the extinct species ''[[Hymenaea protera]]'' is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. It is not &quot;[[succinite]]&quot; but &quot;[[retinite]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grimaldi, D. A.: Amber – Window to the Past. – American Museum of Natural History, New York 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Class II:&lt;br/&gt;
These ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as cadinene.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

Class III:&lt;br/&gt;
These ambers are polystyrenes.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

Class IV:&lt;br/&gt;
This class is something of a wastebasket; its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of cedarane-based sesquiterpenoids.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

Class V:&lt;br/&gt;
Class V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and ''n''-alkyl compounds. Their type mineral is ''highgate copalite''.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0146-6380(93)90111-N|title=The nature and fate of natural resins in the geosphere—III.

===Classification of Baltic amber (succinite) gemstones by the International Amber Association===
Natural Baltic amber – gemstone which has undergone mechanical treatment only (for instance: grinding, cutting, turning or polishing) without any change to its natural properties

Modified Baltic amber – gemstone subjected only to thermal or high-pressure treatment, which changed its physical properties, including the degree of transparency and color, or shaped under similar conditions out of one nugget, previously cut to the required size.

Reconstructed (pressed) Baltic amber – gemstone made of Baltic amber pieces pressed in high temperature and under high pressure without additional components.

Bonded Baltic amber – gemstone consisting of two or more parts of natural, modified or reconstructed Baltic amber bonded together with the use of the smallest possible amount of a colorless binding agent necessary to join the pieces.

==Geological record==
The oldest amber recovered dates to the [[Carboniferous|Upper Carboniferous]] period ({{Ma|Upper carboniferous|round=-1}}).&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1179328|pmid=19797645|title=Pushing Back Amber Production|year=2009|last1=Grimaldi|first1=D.|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5949|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bray2009&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1177539|title=Identification of Carboniferous (320 Million Years Old) Class Ic Amber|year=2009|last1=Bray|first1=P.

B.|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5949|pages=132–134|pmid=19797659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers – it is most similar to the resins produced by [[flowering plant]]s, which did not evolve until the [[Jurassic]], around {{Ma|Mid jurassic|round=-1}}. Amber becomes abundant soon afterwards, in the [[Early Cretaceous]], {{Ma|early cretaceous|round=-1}},&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; when it is found in association with insects. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Middle East from Lebanon and Jordan (Kaddumi, 2007; Azar, 2000). This amber is roughly 133 million years old and is considered of high scientific value. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan (Kaddumi, 2007) including the oldest zorapterans, clerid beetles, umenocoleid roaches, and achiliid planthoppers.

Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}) is found as irregular [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s in marine [[Glauconite|glauconitic]] sand, known as ''blue earth,'' occurring in the Lower [[Oligocene]] strata of Samland in [[Prussia]] (Latin: [[Sambia]]), in historical sources also referred to as ''Glaesaria''. After 1945 this territory around [[Königsberg]] was turned into [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]], where it is now systematically mined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Jean|last=Langenheim|title=Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany|publisher=Timber Press Inc.|year=2003|isbn=0-88192-574-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears, however, to have been partly derived from yet earlier [[Tertiary]] deposits ([[Eocene]]); and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as [[glacial drift]]. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern [[Asia]] and the southern part of [[North America]]. [[Heinrich Göppert]] named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests ''Pinites succiniter'', but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called ''Pinus succinifera''. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.

===Paleontological significance===
Amber is a unique preservational mode, preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems and organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/amber.shtml BBC – Radio 4 – Amber].

The chemical composition of the resin is, unfortunately, of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt;

Amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted.

===Scent of amber and amber perfumery===
In ancient China it was customary to burn amber during large festivities. If amber is heated under the right conditions, [[oil of amber]] is produced, and in past times this was combined carefully with [[nitric acid]] to create &quot;artificial musk&quot; – a resin with a peculiar [[musk]]y odor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amber&quot;&gt;[http://www.aphrodisiacs-info.com/amber.html Amber as an aphrodisiac]&lt;/ref&gt; Although when burned, amber does give off a characteristic &quot;pinewood&quot; fragrance, modern products, such as perfume, do not normally use actual amber. This is due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent. In perfumery, scents referred to as “amber” are often created and patented&lt;ref&gt;Saturated indane derivatives and processes for producing same, Ernst T.

The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of [[ambergris]] and/or [[labdanum]] but due to the endangered status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from [[labdanum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://teresacasimiro.com.sapo.pt/Bibliographic_References/21.pdf |title=Characterization of the Portuguese-Grown Cistus ladanifer Essential Oil |author=Gomes, Paula B, Mata, Vera G, Rodrigues, A E |journal=Journal of Essential Oil Research |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. [[Benzoin]] is usually part of the recipe. [[Vanilla]] and [[clove]]s are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.

&quot;Amber&quot; perfumes may be created using combinations of [[labdanum]], [[benzoin resin]], [[copal]] (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), [[vanilla]], [[Dammara resin]] and/or synthetic materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amber&quot;/&gt;

'''Amalaric''', or in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Amalarico'', (502&lt;ref name=&quot;Brockhaus&quot;&gt;Brockhaus Geschichte Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 531) was a son of king [[Alaric II]] and of Theodegotho, daughter of [[Theodoric the Great]] and his first wife. Amalaric was himself king of the [[Visigoths]] from 526 till he was assassinated in 531.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was a child when his father fell in battle against [[Clovis I]], king of the [[Franks]], in 507. [[Gesalec]] was chosen king and the child Amalaric was carried for safety into [[Hispania]]. After Gesalec was killed in 511, the country and [[Provence]] was thenceforth ruled by Amalaric's maternal grandfather, [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] the Ostrogoth, acting through his vice regent, [[Theudis]], an Ostrogothic nobleman. In 522 the young Amalaric was proclaimed king, and four years later, on Theodoric's death, he assumed full royal power in Hispania and that part of [[Languedoc]] called [[Septimania]], relinquishing [[Provence]] to his cousin [[Athalaric]]. He married [[Clotilde (died 531)|Chrotilda]], daughter of [[Clovis I]]; but his disputes with her over religion, he being an [[Arianism|Arian]] and she a [[Catholicism|Catholic]], brought on him the penalty of a Frankish invasion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The invasion was led by [[Childebert I]], king of [[Paris]] (who was also his brother in law, being Clotide's brother). Amalaric was defeated at [[Narbonne]] in 531 and retreated behind the walls of [[Barcelona]], where he was assassinated by his own troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brockhaus&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Bardentreffen 2009 2169.jpg|thumb|Eliana Burki playing the alphorn at the Bardentreffen festival in [[Nuremberg]] 2009.]]
[[Image:Bern alpenhorn.jpg|thumb|Swiss farmer calling his cattle in the Bernese Oberland.]]

The '''alphorn''' or '''alpenhorn''' or '''alpine horn''' is a [[Brass instrument|labrophone]], consisting of a [[natural horn|natural wooden]] [[horn (instrument)|horn]] of [[bore (wind instruments)|conical bore]], having a wooden cup-shaped [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]], used by mountain dwellers in [[Swiss Alps|Switzerland]] and elsewhere. Similar wooden horns were used for [[communication]] in most mountainous regions of [[Europe]], from [[French Swiss|French Switzerland]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]].

For a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the Roman-Etruscan [[lituus]], because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word ''liti'', meaning Alphorn in the dialect of [[Obwalden]]. There is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word ''liti'' was probably borrowed from 16th-18th century writings in Latin, where the word ''lituus'' could describe various wind instruments, such as the [[natural horn|horn]], the [[crumhorn]], or the [[cornett]]. Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gesner]] used the words ''lituum alpinum'' for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his ''De raris et admirandis herbis'' in 1555. The oldest known document using the German word ''Alphorn'' is a page from a 1527 account book from the former [[Cistercian]] abbey St. Urban near [[Pfaffnau]] mentioning the payment of two [[Batzen]] for an itinerant alphorn player from the [[Valais]].

17th-19th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of [[church bells]]. Surviving artefacts, dating back to as far as ca. AD 1400, include wooden [[Brass instrument|labrophones]] in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the '&quot;Büchel&quot; and the &quot;Allgäuisches Waldhorn&quot; or &quot;Ackerhorn&quot;. The alphorn's exact origins remain indeterminate, and the ubiquity of horn-like signal instruments in valleys throughout Europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage.

==Construction and qualities==
[[Image:Fanfare 27BCA 01.JPG|thumb|The military band of the French [[Chasseurs Alpins]] uses Alphorns.]]
[[Image:Swiss playing an alphorn.jpg|thumb|A Swiss playing alphorn near a mountain lake.]]
The alphorn is carved from solid softwood, generally spruce but sometimes pine. In former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn, but modern makers piece the wood together at the base.   A cup-shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete.  

The alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure [[Harmonic series (music)|natural harmonic series]] of the open pipe. The harmonics are the more readily obtained by reason of the small diameter of the bore in relation to the length.  An alphorn made at Rigi-Kulm, Schwyz, and now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], measures 8&amp;nbsp;ft. in length and has a straight tube.  The Swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality, being curved near the bell in the Bernese Oberland.  [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions an alphorn-like instrument under the name of Hölzern Trummet (wooden trumpet) in ''Syntagma Musicum'' (Wittenberg, 1615–1619; Pl. VIII).

The notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard Western [[equal temperament]]. Most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale.[http://real.xobix.ch/ramgen/swissinfo/swissalpinemusic/2006/tonleiterall_audio_64k.rm (audio)][[Image:Harmonic Series.png|thumb|center|400px]]
&lt;br&gt;
In the hands of a skilled composer or arranger, the natural harmonics can be used to haunting melancholy effect or, by contrast, to create a charming pastoral flavor, as in the lilting &quot;Ranz des Vaches&quot; and works by Brahms, Rossini, and Britten cited below.  Similar to the view of  [[Leopold Kronecker]] that &quot;God made the integers; all else is the work of man,&quot; musicians drawn to the alphorn and other instruments that sound the natural harmonics, such as the [[natural horn]], consider the notes of the natural harmonic series&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; particularly the 7th and 11th harmonics&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; to be God's Notes, the remainder of the chromatic scale enabled by keys, valves, slides and other methods of changing the qualities of the simple open pipe being an artifact of mere mortals.&lt;br clear=all&gt;

The well-known &quot;Ranz des Vaches&quot; [http://www.lyoba.ch/culture/desalpe/ranz.htm#PARTITION (score] [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?sid=7020216&amp;cKey=1183635931000&amp;ty=st&amp;rubricId=25004&amp;siteSect=25001  ;  audio)] is a traditional Swiss melody often heard on the alphorn. The song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] introduced the &quot;Ranz des Vaches&quot; into his masterpiece ''William Tell,'' along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well-suited to the alphorn. [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] wrote to [[Clara Schumann]] that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First Symphony]] was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the Rigi area of Switzerland.  Finally, the prologue to [[Benjamin Britten|Britten's]] ''[[Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings]]'', played on horn without the use of valves but equally suited to the alphorn, is a beautiful, inspired example of the lyric possibilities of natural harmonics.

An '''army''' (from [[Latin]] ''arma'' &quot;arms, weapons&quot; via [[Old French]] ''armée'', &quot;armed&quot; (feminine)), in the broadest sense, is the land-based [[military]] of a [[nation]] or [[State (polity)|state]]. It may also include other branches of the military such as the [[air force]] via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a [[field army]] an army composed of full-time career [[soldiers]] who 'stand over', in other words, who do not disband during times of peace. They differ from [[army reserves]] who are activated only during such times as [[war]] or [[natural disasters]].

In several countries the army is officially called the '''land army''' to differentiate it from an [[air force]] called the air army, notably [[France]]. In such countries, the word &quot;army&quot; on its own retains its connotation of a land force in common usage. The current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the [[People's Liberation Army]] of [[People's Republic of China|China]] with 2,250,000 active troops and 800,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]].

By definition, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]].

==History==
{{Main|Army history}}

===Sparta===

The [[Spartan Army]] was one of the earliest professional armies. Boys were sent to a barracks at the age of seven to train for being a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan serfs or ''helots,'' did the manual labour.
 
This allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year. The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.

===Ancient Rome===
The [[Roman Army]] had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. Reforms around 115 BC turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens but citizens who served continuously for 25 years before being discharged.
 
The Romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops, non-Romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry. After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the Late Roman Empire, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[mercenaries]].

===Medieval Europe===
In the earliest [[Middle Ages]] it was the obligation of every noble to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to the better his troops would be.

The [[knight]]s were drawn to battle by feudal and social obligation, and also by the prospect of profit and advancement. Those who performed well were likely to increase their landholdings and advance in the social hierarchy. The prospect of significant income from pillage, and ransoming prisoners was also important. For the mounted knight war could be a relatively low risk affair.

As central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the peasantry began to be the central recruiting tool. England was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.

In theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.

Thus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large mercenary market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.

As the Middle Ages progressed in [[Italy]], Italian cities began to rely mostly on [[mercenaries]] to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.

===Early modern===

First [[nation-states]] lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.

The [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.

As late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.

The newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].

In many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.

However, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.

As any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.

It has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism, and during this period the modern notion of the [[nation state]] was born. However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the [[levée en masse]] and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].

Before then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain, armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many European states.

Prior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the [[monarch]] maintained a personal Bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]] or 'gentlemen pensioners', and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was recaptured by [[France]] in 1558).

Troops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ad-hoc basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.

After the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the [[United States]], with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.

Until 130 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from Brandenburg-Prussia, leading many to flee to neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In order to halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]]. Every youth was required to serve as a soldier in these recruitment districts for three months each year; this met agrarian needs and added extra troops to bolster the regular ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koch88&quot;&gt;Koch, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian tsar]]s before [[Peter I of Russia]] maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps ([[streltsy]] in Russian) that were highly unreliable and undisciplined. In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.&lt;ref name=blum&gt;Jerome Blum (1971) &quot;Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century&quot;, ISBN 0691007640, pp. 465,466&lt;/ref&gt;

The term of service in the 18th century was for life. In 1793 it was reduced to 25 years. In 1834 it was reduced to 20 years plus 5 years in reserve and in 1855 to 12 years plus 3 years of reserve.&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;{{time fact|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- I have seen different dates for these changes --&gt;

The first [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[standing army]] were [[Janissaries]]. They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted.The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.

From the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[devşirme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The &quot;recruits&quot; were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[Mamelukes]].

[[China]] organized the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] people into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.

===Late Modern===

[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French Republic]] to form the ''[[La Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called &quot;the nation in arms&quot;, which successfully battled European professional armies.

Conscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.

Canada also had a political dispute over conscription during [[World War II]]. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.

In developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.

[[Russia]], as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in [[Switzerland]] (see [[Swiss army]]).

==Armies as armed services==
Western armies are usually subdivided as follows:
*'''[[Corps]]''': A Corps usually consists of two or more Divisions and is commanded by a [[Lieutenant General]].
*[[Division (military)|'''Division''']]: Each division is commanded by a [[Major General]], and usually holds three Brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the Divisions operating in the mountains, all the Divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division. A typical division would hold three infantry brigades.
*'''[[Brigade]]''': A Brigade is under the command of a [[Brigadier General]] or sometimes is commanded by a [[Colonel]] and comprises three or more Battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.
*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[Colonel]] or sometimes by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] who commands roughly 600 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A regiment comprises either three batteries or four companies - and other arms excluding armoured units that are organised into squadrons each under the command of a major and comprising individual subunits called sections (which are further divisible into platoons and squads).&lt;ref name=&quot;definations&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html| title= Subdivisions of the army| accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field army==
A [[field army]] is composed of a headquarters, army [[troops]], a variable number of [[corps]] typically between three to four, and a variable number of [[Division (military)|divisions]], also between three to four. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a General or Lieutenant General.

A particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).

Armies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.

In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[VVS|Soviet Air Force]], &quot;Armies&quot; were actually [[corps]]-sized formations, subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized &quot;[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]&quot; in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]].

'''Alligatoridae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[crocodylia]]ns that includes [[alligator]]s and [[caiman]]s.

== True alligators ==
Alligators proper occur in the fluvial deposits of the age of the [[Cretaceous|Upper Chalk]] in Europe, where they did not die out until the [[Pliocene]] age. The true alligators are now restricted to two species, ''[[American Alligator|A. mississippiensis]]'' in the [[southeastern United States]], which can grow to 4.24&amp;nbsp;m (14&amp;nbsp;ft) and weigh 1000&amp;nbsp;lbs (454.5&amp;nbsp;kg)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eparks.org/marine_and_coastal/marine_wildlife/alligator.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and the small ''[[Chinese Alligator|A. sinensis]]'' in the [[Yangtze River]], [[People's Republic of China]], which grows to an average of 1.5&amp;nbsp;m (5&amp;nbsp;ft). Their name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el lagarto'', which means &quot;the lizard&quot;. [[Image:Alligator prenasalis.JPG|thumb|left|''Alligator prenasalis'' fossil]]

== Caimans ==
In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the alligator family is represented by five species of the [[genus]] ''Caiman'', which differs from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and the ventral armour is composed of overlapping bony [[scute]]s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Some authorities further divide this genus into three, splitting off the smooth-fronted caimans into a genus ''Paleosuchus'' and the Black Caiman into ''Melanosuchus''. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guggisberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Guggisberg, C.A.W. |url =  | title = Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation| year = 1972 | page = 195 | isbn = 0-7153-5272-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. crocodilus'', the [[Caiman crocodilus|Spectacled Caiman]], has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about 2.2 meters. The largest is the [[red list|near-threatened]] ''Melanosuchus niger'', the Jacare-assu, Large, or [[Black Caiman]] of the [[Amazon River]] basin. Black Caimans grow to 16.5 feet (5 m),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/cnhc/cbd-faq-q2.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the largest recorded size 5.79&amp;nbsp;m (19&amp;nbsp;ft). The black caiman and [[American Alligator]] are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family. 

Although the Caiman has not been studied in-depth, scientists have learned that their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring.

== Differences from crocodiles ==
{{see also|Crocodilia#Differences between alligators and crocodiles}}
[[Alligator]]s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the [[crocodile]]; in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips; and an intolerance to salinity, alligators strongly preferring fresh water, while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt. In general, crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators. Another odd trait recently discovered is that both caimans and the American Alligator have been observed taking foliage and fruit into their diet in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/alligators_eat_fruit.php&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alder''' is the common name of a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s ('''''Alnus''''') belonging to the [[birch]] family (Family [[Betulaceae]]). The genus comprises about 30 [[species]] of [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s, few reaching large size, distributed throughout the [[North Temperate Zone]] and in the [[Americas]] along the [[Andes]] southwards to [[Argentina]].

==Description==

Alder [[leaf|leaves]] are [[deciduous]] (not [[evergreen]]), alternate, simple, and [[serrated]]. The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-pollinated, but also visited by [[bee]]s to a small extent. They differ from the [[birch]]es (''Betula'', the other genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many [[conifer cone]]s.

The largest species are [[Red Alder]] (''A. rubra'') on the west coast of [[North America]] and [[Alnus glutinosa|Black Alder]] (''A. glutinosa''), native to most of [[Europe]] and widely introduced elsewhere, both reaching over 30 m. By contrast, the widespread [[Green Alder]] (''A. viridis'') is rarely more than a 5 m tall shrub.

==Ecology==
Alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous [[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on alders]].

''A. glutinosa'' and ''A. viridis'' are classed as environmental weeds in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayson|first=Howell|title=Consolidated list of environmental weeds in New Zealand|publisher=Department of Conservation|location=Wellington|date=May 2008|isbn=978-0-478-14412-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrogen fixation ===
Alder is particularly noted for its important [[symbiotic]] relationship with ''[[Frankia alni]]'', [[actinomycete]] [[Filamentation|filamentous]] nitrogen-fixing [[bacterium]]. This bacterium is found in [[root nodules]] which may be as large as a human fist, with many small lobes and light brown in appearance. The bacterium absorbs [[nitrogen]] from the air and makes it available to the tree. Alder, in turn, provides the bacterium with [[carbon]], which it produces through [[photosynthesis]]. As a result of this mutually-beneficial relationship, alder improves the [[Fertility (soil)|fertility]] of the [[soils]] where it grows, and as a [[pioneer species]], it helps provide additional nitrogen for the [[Ecological succession|successional]] species which follow.

==Word origin==
The common name ''alder'' is derived from an old [[Germanic language|Germanic]] root, also
found to be the translation of the [[Old French]] &quot;verne&quot; for alder or [[copse]] of alders. The botanic name ''Alnus'' is the equivalent [[Latin]] name. Both the Latin and the Germanic words derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''el-'', meaning &quot;red&quot; or &quot;brown&quot;, which is also a root for the English words ''elk'' and another tree: ''elm'', a tree distantly related to the alders.
In [[Celtic mythology]], [[Bran the Blessed]] is associated with the alder tree &quot;The Alder deity is considered to be Bran the Blessed, god of the Underworld. He was also known as the god of Prophecy, Arts, War and Writing. With the size of a giant, it was impossible for Bran to fit in a house or in a boat.

Fearne is also the third letter in the [[Ogham]] alphabet, meaning alder in this form of Celtic.

The [[catkin|catkins]] of some alder species, have a degree of edibility&lt;ref name=&quot;Edible Alder Catkins&quot;&gt;[http://www.pfaf.org/user/DatabaseSearhResult.aspx Plants For A Future (Database)]&lt;/ref&gt; and may be rich in protein. Although they are reported to have a bitter and unpleasant taste, they are more useful for survival purposes. The wood of certain alder species is often used to smoke various food items. 

Alder bark contains the anti-inflammatory [[salicin]] which is metabolized into [[salicylic acid]] in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans used Red Alder bark ''([[Alnus rubra]])'' to treat poison oak, insect bites, and skin irritations.  Blackfeet Indians used an infusion made from the bark of Red Alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis.  Recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains [[betulin]] and [[lupeol]], compounds shown to be effective against a variety of tumors.&lt;ref&gt;Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, ISBN 0-87842-359-1&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inner bark of the alser, as well as red osier dogwood, or chokecherry, was also used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in their smoking mixtures, known as kinnikinnick, to improve the taste of the [[bearberry]] leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2009) [http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=1355 &quot;Bearberry&quot;] ''Discovering Lewis and Clark''  The Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the Austrian town of [[Grossarl]].

Electric guitars, most notably the [[Fender Stratocaster]] and [[Fender Telecaster]] have been built with alder bodies since the 1950s.  Alder is appreciated for its bright tone, and has been adopted by many electric guitar manufacturers.

==Classification==
The genus is divided into three subgenera:

'''Subgenus ''Alnus''.''' Trees. Shoot buds stalked. Male and female catkins produced in autumn (fall) but staying closed over winter, pollinating in late winter or early spring. About 15–25 species, including:
*''[[Alnus acuminata]]'' — Andean Alder. Andes Mountains, South America.
*''[[Alnus cordata]]'' — Italian Alder. Italy.
*''[[Alnus cremastogyne]]''
*''[[Alnus firma]]'' — [[Kyūshū]] ([[Japan]])
*''[[Alnus glutinosa]]'' — Black Alder. Europe.
[[Image:Alnus incana rugosa leaves.jpg|right|thumb|Speckled Alder (''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''rugosa'') — leaves]]

'''Amos Bronson Alcott''' (November 29, 1799 – March 4, 1888) was an American teacher, writer, philosopher, and reformer. As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment. He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a [[veganism|vegan]] diet before the term was coined. He was also an [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and an advocate for women's rights.

Born in [[Connecticut]] in  1799, Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman. Worried about how the itinerant life might negatively impact his soul, he turned to teaching. His innovative methods, however, were controversial, and he rarely stayed in one place very long. His most well-known teaching position was at the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] in Boston. His experience there was turned into two books: ''Records of a School'' and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels''. Alcott became friends with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and became a major figure in [[transcendentalism]]. His writings on behalf of that movement, however, are heavily criticized for being incoherent. Based on his ideas for human perfection, Alcott founded [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]], a transcendentalist experiment in community living. The project was short-lived and failed after seven months. Alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life. Nevertheless, he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in 1879. He died in 1888.

Alcott married [[Abby May]] in 1830 and they eventually had four surviving children, all daughters. Their second was [[Louisa May Alcott|Louisa May]], who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel ''[[Little Women]]'' in 1868. Alcott is often criticized for his inability to earn a living and support his family; he often relied on loans from his brother-in-law, Emerson, and others. He was never financially secure until his daughter became a best-selling novelist.

==Life and work==
===Early life===
A native [[New England]]er, Amos Bronson Alcott was born in [[Wolcott, Connecticut]] (only recently renamed from &quot;Farmingbury&quot;) on November 29, 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 13&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Joseph Chatfield Alcott and Anna Alcott (née Bronson). The family home was in an area known as Spindle Hill, and his father, Joseph Alcox, traced his ancestry to colonial-era settlers in eastern [[Massachusetts]]. The family originally spelled their name &quot;Alcock&quot;, later changed to &quot;Alcocke&quot; then &quot;Alcox&quot;. Amos Bronson, the oldest of eight children, later changed the spelling to &quot;Alcott&quot; and dropped his first name.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 7–9&lt;/ref&gt;

At age six, young Bronson began his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The school taught only reading, writing, and spelling and he left this school at the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 19&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, his uncle, Reverend Tillotson Bronson, invited to take him into his home in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]] to be educated and prepared for college. Bronson gave it up after only a month&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 12&lt;/ref&gt; and was self-educated from then on.&lt;ref name=Hankins129&gt;Hankins, 129&lt;/ref&gt; He was not particularly social and his only close friend was his neighbor and second cousin [[William Alcott]], with whom he shared books and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; Bronson Alcott later reflected on his childhood at Spindle Hill: &quot;It kept me pure... I dwelt amidst the hills... God spoke to me while I walked the fields.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at age 15, he took a job working for clockmaker [[Seth Thomas (clockmaker)|Seth Thomas]]&lt;ref name=Reisen9&gt;Reisen, 9&lt;/ref&gt; in the nearby town of [[Plymouth, Connecticut|Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, O. 1937, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 17, Alcott passed the exam for a teaching certificate but had trouble finding work as a teacher.&lt;ref name=Reisen9/&gt; Instead, he left home and became a traveling salesman in the [[Southern United States|American South]],&lt;ref name=Hankins129/&gt; peddling books and merchandise. He hoped the job would earn him enough money to support his parents, &quot;to make their cares, and burdens less... and get them free from debt&quot;, though he soon spent most of his earnings on a new suit.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 15&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he thought it an acceptable occupation but soon worried about his spiritual well-being. In March 1823, Alcott wrote to his brother: &quot;Peddling is a hard place to serve God, but a capital one to serve [[Mammon]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his life, he fictionalized this experience in his book ''New Connecticut'', originally circulated only among friends before its publication in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career and marriage===
[[File:Abby May Alcott.jpg|thumb|Abby May Alcott in her later years]]
By the summer of 1823, Alcott returned to Connecticut in debt to his father, who bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 16&lt;/ref&gt; He took a job as a schoolteacher in Cheshire with the help of his Uncle Tillotson.&lt;ref name=Beddell17&gt;Beddell, 17&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly set about reforming the school. He added backs to the benches on which students sat, improved lighting and heating, de-emphasized [[rote learning]], and provided individual [[slate (writing)|slates]] to each student — paid for by himself.&lt;ref name=Reisen10&gt;Reisen, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott had been influenced by [[educational philosophy]] of the [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and even re-named his school &quot;The Cheshire Pestalozzi School&quot;.&lt;ref name=Beddell17/&gt; His style attracted the attention of [[Samuel Joseph May]], who introduced Alcott to his sister [[Abby May]]. She called him, &quot;an intelligent, philosophic, modest man&quot; and found his views on education &quot;very attractive&quot;.&lt;ref name=Reisen10/&gt; Locals in Cheshire were less supportive and became suspicious of his methods. Many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently re-opened  private school for boys.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 18&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 1827, Alcott started teaching in [[Bristol, Connecticut]], still using the same methods he used in Cheshire, but opposition from the community surfaced quickly;&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 50&lt;/ref&gt; he was unemployed by March 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 32&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Boston on April 24, 1828, and was immediately impressed, referring to the city as a place &quot;where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 34&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the Salem Street Infant School two months later on June 23.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Abby May applied as his teaching assistant; instead, the couple were engaged, without consent of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 12&lt;/ref&gt; They were married at [[King's Chapel]] on May 22, 1830; he was 30 years old and she was 29.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her father's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reisen13&quot;/&gt; After their marriage the Alcotts moved to 12 Franklin Street in Boston, a [[boarding house]] run by a Mrs. Newall.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 51&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Alcott also first expressed his public disdain for [[slavery]]. In November 1830, he and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded what he later called a &quot;preliminary Anti-Slavery Society&quot;, though he differed from Garrison as a [[nonresistance|nonresistant]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Lewis. ''Radical Abolitionism: Anarchy and the Government of God in Antislavery Thought''. University of Tennessee Press, 1995: 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance at Alcott's school was falling. A wealthy [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] named Reuben Haines proposed he and educator William Russell start a new school in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=Reisen13&gt;Reisen, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott accepted and he and his newly-pregnant wife set forth on December 14.&lt;ref name=Matteson42&gt;Matteson, 42&lt;/ref&gt; The school was established in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]]&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 85&lt;/ref&gt; and the Alcotts were offered a rent-free home by Haines. Alcott and Russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby [[Philadelphia]] instead.&lt;ref name=Matteson42/&gt; Unsuccessful, they went back to Germantown, though the rent-free home was no longer available and the Alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding-house.&lt;ref name=Matteson43&gt;Matteson, 43&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that their first child, a daughter they named [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna Bronson Alcott]], was born on March 16, 1831,&lt;ref name=Reisen13/&gt; after 36 hours of labor.&lt;ref name=Matteson43/&gt; By the fall of that year, their benefactor Haines died suddenly and the Alcotts again suffered financial difficulty. &quot;We hardly earn the bread&quot;, wrote Abby may to her brother, &quot;[and] the butter we have to think about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple's only son was born on April 6, 1831, but lived only a few minutes. The mother recorded: &quot;Gave birth to a fine boy full grown perfectly formed but not living&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 48&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Germantown that the couple's second daughter was born. [[Louisa May Alcott]] was born on her father's birthday, November 29, 1832, at a half hour past midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 48&lt;/ref&gt; Bronson described her as &quot;a very fine healthful child, much more so than Anna was at birth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Germantown school, however, was faltering; soon only eight pupils remained.&lt;ref name=Matteson50&gt;Matteson, 50&lt;/ref&gt; Their benefactor Haines died before Louisa's birth. He had helped recruit students and even paid tuition for some of them. As Abby wrote, his death &quot;has prostrated all our hopes here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 63&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1833, the family moved to Philadelphia,&lt;ref name=Matteson50/&gt; where Alcott ran a day school. As usual, Alcott's methods were controversial; a former student later referred to him as &quot;the most eccentric man who ever took on himself to train and form the youthful mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott began to believe Boston was the best place for his ideas to flourish. He contacted theologian [[William Ellery Channing]] for support. Channing approved of Alcott's methods and promised to help find students to enroll, including his daughter Mary. Channing also secured aid from Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] and Boston mayor [[Josiah Quincy, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental educator===
On September 22, 1834, Alcott opened a school of about 30 students, mostly from wealthy families.&lt;ref name=Packer55&gt;Packer, 55&lt;/ref&gt; It was named the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] because classes were held at the [[Masonic Temple]] on Tremont Street in Boston.&lt;ref name=Dahlstrand110&gt;Dahlstrand, 110&lt;/ref&gt; His assistant was [[Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]], later replaced by [[Margaret Fuller]]. [[Mary Peabody Mann]] served as a French instructor for a time.&lt;ref name=Gura88&gt;Gura, 88&lt;/ref&gt; The school was briefly famous, and then infamous, because of his original methods. Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as [[Friedrich Fröbel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in &quot;spiritual culture&quot;, which included interpretation of the [[Gospel]]s, and advocated ''object teaching'' in writing instruction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} He even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning: paintings, books, comfortable furniture, and busts or portraits of [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Jesus]], and William Ellery Channing.&lt;ref name=Dahlstrand110/&gt;

During this time, the Alcotts had another child. Born on June 24, 1835, she was named [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott|Elizabeth Peabody Alcott]] in honor of the teaching assistant at the Temple School.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; By age three, however, her mother changed her name to Elizabeth ''Sewall'' Alcott, after her own mother.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 33&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Record of a School.JPG|thumb|''Record of a School'', a chronicle of Alcott's Temple School, was publishd in 1835.]]
In July 1835, Peabody published her account as an assistant to the Temple School as ''Record of a School: Exemplifying the General Principles of Spiritual Culture''.&lt;ref name=Gura88/&gt; While working on a second book, Alcott and Peabody had a falling out and ''Conversations with Children on the Gospels'' was prepared with help from Peabody's sister [[Sophia Peabody|Sophia]],&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; published at the end of December 1836.&lt;ref name=Packer55/&gt; Alcott's methods were not well received; many found his conversations on the Gospels close to blasphemous. For example, he asked students to question if Biblical miracles were literal and suggested that all people are part of God.&lt;ref&gt;Packer 59&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'', [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]] criticized Alcott's &quot;flippant and off hand conversation&quot; about serious topics from the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]] to [[circumcision]].&lt;ref name=Gura89/&gt; [[Joseph T. Buckingham]] called Alcott &quot;either insane or half-witted&quot; and &quot;an ignorant and presuming [[charlatan]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not sell well; a Boston lawyer bought 750 copies to use as waste paper.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 184&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple school was widely denounced in the press. Reverend [[James Freeman Clarke]] was one of Alcott's few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from Boston periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott was rejected by most public opinion and, by the summer of 1837, he had only 11 students left and no assistant after Margaret Fuller moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 143&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and, as the school closed, Alcott became increasingly financially desperate. Remaining steadfast to his pedagogy, a forerunner of [[progressive education|progressive]] and [[democratic school]]ing, he alienated parents in a later &quot;parlor school&quot; by admitting an [[African American]] child to the class, whom he then refused to expel in the face of protests.

===Transcendentalism===
Beginning in 1836, Alcott's membership in the [[Transcendental Club]] put him in such company as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Orestes Brownson]] and [[Theodore Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''Emerson''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003: 32–33. ISBN 0-674-01139-2&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member with the Club's second meeting and hosted their third.&lt;ref name=Gura89&gt;Gura, 89&lt;/ref&gt; A biographer of Emerson described the group as &quot;the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers, agreeing in nothing but their liberality&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gura5&gt;Gura, 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Henry Hedge]] wrote of the group's nature: &quot;There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gura5/&gt; Alcott preferred the term &quot;Symposium&quot; for their group.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 1840 Alcott moved to the town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]&lt;ref name=Packer115&gt;Packer, 115&lt;/ref&gt; urged by Emerson. He rented a home for $50 a year within walking distance of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson House|Emerson's house]]; he named it Dove Cottage,&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 83&lt;/ref&gt; though they also called it Concordia Cottage.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 52&lt;/ref&gt; A supporter of Alcott's philosophies, Emerson offered to help with his writing, which proved a difficult task. After several revisions, for example, he deemed the essay &quot;Psyche&quot; (Alcott's account of how he educated his daughters) unpublishable.&lt;ref name=Reisen35&gt;Reisen, 35&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott also wrote a series patterned after the work of German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] which were eventually published in the Transcendentalists' journal, ''[[The Dial]]''. Emerson wrote to Margaret Fuller, then editor, that they might &quot;pass muster &amp; even pass for just &amp; great&quot;.&lt;ref name=Packer115/&gt; He was wrong. Alcott's so-called &quot;[[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] Sayings&quot; were widely mocked for being silly and unintelligible; Fuller herself disliked them but did not want to hurt Alcott's feelings.&lt;ref name=Packer116&gt;Packer, 116&lt;/ref&gt; In the first issue, for example, he wrote:
{{bquote|Nature is quick with spirit. In eternal systole and diastole, the living tides course gladly along, incarnating organ and vessel in their mystic flow. Let her pulsations for a moment pause on their errands, and creation's self ebbs instantly into chaos and invisibility again. The visible world is the extremist wave of that spiritual flood, whose flux is life, whose reflux death, efflux thought, and conflux light. Organization is the confine of incarnation,—body the atomy of God.&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On July 26, 1840, Abby May gave birth again. Originally referred to as Baby for several months, she was eventually name [[May Alcott|Abby May]] after her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 152&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, she changed the spelling of her name to &quot;Abbie&quot; before choosing to use only &quot;May&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

With financial support from Emerson,&lt;ref name=Schreiner95&gt;Schreiner, 95&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott left Concord on May 8, 1842, to a visit to England, leaving his brother Junius with his family.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 99&lt;/ref&gt; He met two admirers, [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]] and Henry C. Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; The two men were leaders of [[Alcott House]], an experimental school based on Alcott's methods from the Temple School located about ten miles outside of  [[London]].&lt;ref name=Schreiner95/&gt; The school's founder, James Pierpont Greaves, had only recently died but Alcott was invited to stay there for a week.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 100&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott persuaded them to come come to the United States with him; Lane and his son moved into the Alcott house and helped with family chores.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Persuaded in part by Lane's [[abolitionism|abolitionist views]], Alcott took a stand against the [[John Tyler]] administration's plan to annex [[Texas]] as a slave territory and [[tax resistance|refused to pay]] his [[poll tax]]. Abby May wrote in her journal on January 17, 1843, &quot;A day of some excitement, as Mr. Alcott refused to pay his town tax... After waiting some time to be committed [to jail], he was told it was paid by a friend. Thus we were spared the affliction of his absence and the triumph of suffering for his principles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; The annual poll tax was only $1.50.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 194&lt;/ref&gt; The incident inspired [[Henry David Thoreau]], whose similar protest led to a night in jail and his essay &quot;[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 188&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the Alcott family set up a sort of domestic [[post office]] to curb potential domestic tension. Abby May described her idea: &quot;I thought it would afford a daily opportunity for the children, indeed all of us, to interchange thought and sentiment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fruitlands (transcendental center)}}
Lane and Alcott collaborated on a major expansion of their educational theories into a [[Utopia]]n society. Alcott, however, was still in debt and could not purchase the land needed for their planned community. In a letter, Lane wrote, &quot;I do not see anyone to act the money part but myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 67&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1843, he purchased a {{convert|90|acre|m2|sing=on}} farm in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Packer148&gt;Packer, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Up front, he paid $1,500 of the total $1,800 value of the property; the rest was meant to be paid by the Alcotts over a two year period.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 240&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to the farm on June 1 and optimistically named it &quot;Fruitlands&quot; despite only ten old apple trees on the property.&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; In July, Alcott announced their plans in ''The Dial'': &quot;We have made an arrangement with the proprieter of an estate of about a hundred acres, which liberates this tract from human ownership&quot;.&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt;

Their goal was to regain access to [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] by finding the correct formula for perfect living, following specific rules governing agriculture, diet, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 57&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve this, they removed themselves from the economy as much as possible and lived independently;&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, 36&lt;/ref&gt; unlike a similar project named [[Brook Farm]], the participants at Fruitlands avoided interaction with local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Calling themselves a &quot;consociate family&quot;, they agreed to follow a strict vegetarian diet and to till the land without the use of animal labor.&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; After some difficulty, they relented and allowed some cattle to be &quot;enslaved&quot;.&lt;ref name=Felton132&gt;Felton, 132&lt;/ref&gt; They also banned coffee, tea, alcoholic drinks, milk, and warm bathwater.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 77&lt;/ref&gt; They only ate &quot;aspiring vegetables&quot; — those which grew upward — and refused those that grew downward like potatoes. As Alcott had published earlier, &quot;Our wine is water, — flesh, bread; — drugs, fruits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 56&lt;/ref&gt; For clothing, they prohibited leather because animals were killed for it, as well as cotton, silk, and wool, because they were products of slave labor.&lt;ref name=Felton132/&gt; Alcott had high expectations but was often away when the community most needed him as he attempted to recruit more members.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental community was never successful, partly because most of the land was not [[arable land|arable]].&lt;ref&gt;Delano, Sterling F. ''Brook Farm: The Dark Side of Utopia''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2004: 118. ISBN 0-674-01160-0&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott lamented, &quot;None of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed. So we fell apart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 221&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders were often away as well; in the middle of harvesting, they left for a lecture tour through [[Providence, Rhode Island]], New York City, and [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 225&lt;/ref&gt; In its seven months, only 13 people joined, included the Alcotts and Lanes.&lt;ref&gt;Felton, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Abby May and her daughters, only one other woman joined, Ann Page. One rumor is that Page was asked to leave after eating a fish tail with a neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Lane believed Alcott had misled him into thinking enough people would join the enterprise and developed a strong dislike for the [[nuclear family]]. He quit the project and moved to a nearby [[Shakers|Shaker]] family with his son.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 149&lt;/ref&gt; After Lane's departure, Alcott fell into a depression and could not speak or eat for three days.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 230&lt;/ref&gt; Abby May thought Lane purposely sabotaged her family. She wrote to her brother, &quot;All Mr. Lane's efforts have been to disunite us. But Mr. Alcott's... paternal instincts were too strong for him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mattoson161&gt;Matteson, 161&lt;/ref&gt; When the final payment on the farm was owed, Sam May refused to cover his brother-in-law's debts, as he often did, possibly at Abby May's suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 241&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment failed, the Alcotts had to leave Fruitlands.

The members of the Alcott family were not happy with their Fruitlands experience. At one point, Abby May threatened that she and their daughters would move elsewhere, leaving Bronson behind.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 228&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa May Alcott, who was ten years old at the time, later wrote of the experience in ''Transcendental Wild Oats'' (1873): &quot;The band of brothers began by spading garden and field; but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 148–149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Concord===
[[File:The Wayside Concord Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Wayside]], home in turn to the Alcott family, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and [[Margaret Sidney]]]]
In January 1844, Alcott moved his family to Still River, a village within Harvard&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Carruth, Gorton. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 62. ISBN 0195031865&lt;/ref&gt; but, on March 1, 1845, the family returned to Concord to live in a home they named &quot;The Hillside&quot; (later renamed &quot;[[The Wayside]]&quot; by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 174&lt;/ref&gt; Both Emerson and Sam May assisted in securing the home for the Alcotts.&lt;ref name=Bedell234&gt;Bedell, 234&lt;/ref&gt; While living in the home, Louisa began writing in earnest and was given her own room.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; She later said her years at the home &quot;were the happiest years&quot; of her life; many of the incidents in her novel ''[[Little Women]]'' (1868) are based on this period.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 98&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott renovated the property, moving a barn and painting the home a rusty olive color, as well as tending to over six acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 1845, Abby May was granted a sum from her father's estate which was put into a trust fund, granting minor financial security.&lt;ref name=Bedell234/&gt; That summer, Bronson Alcott let [[Henry David Thoreau]] borrow his ax to prepare his home at [[Walden Pond]].&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alcotts hosted a steady stream of visitors at The Hillside,&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 91&lt;/ref&gt; including fugitive slaves, which they hosted in secret as a station of the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott's opposition to slavery also fueled his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] which began in 1846. He considered the war a blatant attempt to extend slavery and asked if the country was made up of &quot;a people bent on conquest, on getting the golden treasures of Mexico into our hands, and of subjugating foreign peoples?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrand, 210–211&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Abby May insisted they leave Concord, which she called &quot;cold, heartless, brainless, soulless&quot;. The Alcott family put The Hillside up for rent and moved to Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; There, next door to Peabody's book store on West Street, Bronson Alcott hosted a series based on the &quot;Conversations&quot; model by Margaret Fuller called &quot;A Course on the Conversations on Man — his History, Resources, and Expectations&quot;. Participants, both men and women, were charged three dollars to attend or five dollars for all seven lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 135&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1853, Alcott was invited to teach fifteen students at [[Harvard Divinity School]] in an extracurricular, non-credit course.&lt;ref name=Bedell319&gt;Bedell, 319&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcott and his family moved back to Concord after 1857, where he and his family lived in the [[Orchard House]] until 1877. In 1860, Alcott was named superintendent of Concord Schools.&lt;ref&gt;Schriener, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War years and beyond===
[[File:OrchardHouseConcord2CMA.jpg|right|thumb|[[Orchard House]] in Concord, Massachusetts]]
Alcott voted in a presidential election for the first time in 1860. In his journal for November 6, 1860, he wrote: &quot;At Town House, and cast my vote for [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and the Republican candidates generally — the first vote I ever cast for a President and State officers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 209&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott was an abolitionist and a friend of the more radical William Lloyd Garrison.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 61&lt;/ref&gt; He had attended a rally led by [[Wendell Phillips]] on behalf of 17-year old [[Thomas Sims]], a fugitive slave on trial in Boston. Alcott was one of several who attempted to storm the courthouse; when gunshots were heard, he was the only one who stood his ground, though the effort was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; He had also stood his ground in a protest against the trial of [[Anthony Burns]]. A group had broken down the door of the Boston courthouse but guards beat them back. Alcott stood forward and asked the leader of the group, [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], &quot;Why are we not within?&quot; He then walked calmly into the courthouse, was threatened with a gun, and turned back, &quot;but without hastening a step&quot;, according to Higginson.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, Louisa moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to volunteer as a nurse. On January 14, 1863, the Alcotts received a telegram that Louisa was sick; Bronson immediately went to bring her home, briefly meeting Abraham Lincoln while there.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 281–283&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa turned her experience into the book ''[[Hospital Sketches]]''. Her father wrote of it, &quot;I see nothing in the way of a good appreciation of Louisa's merits as a woman and a writer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry David Thoreau died on May 6, 1862,&lt;ref name=Schreiner216&gt;Schreiner, 216&lt;/ref&gt; likely from an illness he caught from Alcott two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 271&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott assisted in arranging Thoreau's funeral in the church he had resigned, at Emerson's request.&lt;ref name=Schreiner216/&gt; Only two years later, neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne died as well. Alcott served as a pallbearer along with [[Louis Agassiz]], [[James Thomas Fields]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 186&lt;/ref&gt; With Hawthore's death, Alcott worried that few of the Concord notables remained. He recorded in his journal: &quot;Fair figures one by one are fading from sight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 223&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Lincoln was assassinated, which Alcott called &quot;appalling news&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 222&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, Alcott met with publisher Thomas Niles, an admirer of ''Hospital Sketches''. Alcott asked Niles if he would publish a book of short stories by his daughter; instead, he suggested she write a book about girls. Louisa May was not interested initially but agreed to try.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. ''Irving to Irving: Author-Publisher Relations 1800–1974''. New York: R. R. Bowker Company, 1974: 36. ISBN 0-8352-0772-2.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;They want a book of 200 pages or more&quot;, Alcott told his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 213&lt;/ref&gt; The result was ''Little Women'', published later that year. The book, which fictionalized the Alcott family during the girls' coming-of-age years, recast the father figure as a soldier, away from home while he fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Alcott spoke, as opportunity arose, before the &quot;[[lyceum]]s&quot; then common in various parts of the United States, or addressed groups of hearers as they invited him. These &quot;conversations&quot; as he called them, were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics, spiritual, aesthetic and practical, in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of American Transcendentalists led by Emerson, who was always his supporter and discreet admirer. He often discussed Platonic philosophy, the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with Spirit; upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature; and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life.

===Final years===
[[File:Concord School of Philosophy.jpg|left|thumb|Hillside Chapel, home to Alcott's Concord School of Philosophy]]
Alcott's published books, all from late in his life, include ''Tablets'' (1868), ''Concord Days'' (1872), ''New Connecticut'' (1881), and ''Sonnets and Canzonets'' (1882). Louisa May attended to her father's needs in his final years. She purchased a house for her sister Anna which had been the last home of Henry David Thoreau, now known as the [[Thoreau-Alcott House]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 45. ISBN 0-19-503186-5&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa and her parents moved in with Anna as well.&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 262–263&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his wife Abby May on November 25, 1877, Alcott never returned to Orchard House, too heartbroken to live there. He and Louisa May collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers, letters, and journals. &quot;My heart bleeds with the memories of those days&quot;, he wrote, &quot;and even long years, of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 387&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa noted her father had become &quot;restless with his anchor gone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reisen, 264&lt;/ref&gt; They gave up on the memoir project and Louisa burned many of her mother's papers.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 388&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 1879, Alcott and [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn]] wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 391&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the [[Concord School of Philosophy]] and Literature, which held its first session in 1879 in Alcott's study in the [[Orchard House]]. In 1880 the school moved to the Hillside Chapel, a building next to the house, where he held conversations and, over the course of successive summers, as he entered his eighties, invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy, religion and letters.  The school, considered one of the first formal adult education centers in America, was also attended by foreign scholars. It continued for nine years.

In April 1882, Alcott's friend and benefactor Ralph Waldo Emerson was sick and bedridden. After visiting him, Alcott wrote, &quot;Concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud.&quot; Emerson died the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;

As he was bedridden at the end of his life, Alcott's daughter Louisa May came to visit him at Louisburg on March 1, 1888. He said to her, &quot;I am going ''up. Come with me''.&quot; She responded, &quot;I wish I could.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 423&lt;/ref&gt; He died three days later on March 4; Louisa May died only two days after her father due to [[mercury poisoning]].

==Beliefs==
Alcott was fundamentally and philosophically opposed to [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] as a means of disciplining his students. Instead, beginning at the Temple School, he would appoint a daily student superintendent. When that student observed an infraction, he or she reported it to the rest of the class and, as a whole, they deliberated on punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, 87&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike, saying that any failing was the teacher's responsibility. The shame and guilt this method induced, he believed, was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment; when he used physical &quot;correction&quot; he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application, even including the student to be punished.

The most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay, &quot;Observations on the Principles and Methods of Infant Instruction&quot;. Alcott believed that early education must draw out &quot;unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child&quot; and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 53&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcott's ideas as an educator were controversial. Writer [[Harriet Martineau]], for example, wrote dubiously that, &quot;the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth; and that his business is to bring it out into expression&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in America, and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education. Many of Alcott's educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including &quot;teach by encouragement&quot;, art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists.

The Concord School of Philosophy, which closed following Alcott's death in 1888, was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s. It has continued functioning with a Summer Conversational Series in its original building at Orchard House, now run by the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association.

While many of Alcott's ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal/radical edge, they are still common themes in society, including vegetarian/[[veganism]], sustainable living, and temperance/self-control. Alcott described his sustenance as a &quot;Pythagorean diet&quot;: meat, eggs, butter, cheese, and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well-being to mental improvement. He further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and, in a sense, predicted modern [[environmentalism]] by condemning [[pollution]] and encouraging humankind's role in sustaining ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Mr Alcott's study.jpg|thumb|left|Alcott in his study at Orchard House]]
Alcott's philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent, hazy or abrupt. He formulated no system of philosophy, and shows the influence of [[Plato]], German [[mysticism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]] as filtered through the writings of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Margaret Fuller referred to Alcott as &quot;a philosopher of the balmy times of [[ancient Greece]]—a man whom the worldlings of Boston hold in as much horror as the worldlings of Athens held [[Socrates]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. (editor). ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 152. ISBN 086576008X&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, Alcott related a story from his boyhood: during a total [[solar eclipse]], he threw rocks at the sky until he fell and dislocated his shoulder. He reflected that the event was a prophecy that he would be &quot;tilting at the sun and always catching the fall.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matteson, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Emerson, Alcott was always optimistic, idealistic, and individualistic in thinking. Writer [[James Russell Lowell]] referred to Alcott in his poem &quot;Studies for Two Heads&quot; as &quot;an angel with clipped wings&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bedell319/&gt; Even so, Emerson noted that Alcott's brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing. &quot;When he sits down to write,&quot; Emerson wrote, &quot;all his genius leaves him; he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reisen35/&gt; His &quot;Orphic Sayings&quot;, published in ''The Dial'', became famous for their hilarity as dense, pretentious, and meaningless. In New York, for example, ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'' published a parody titled &quot;Gastric Sayings&quot; in November 1840. A writer for the ''Boston Post'' referred to Alcott's &quot;Orphic Sayings&quot; as &quot;a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger.&quot;&lt;ref name=Packer116/&gt;

Modern critics often fault Alcott for not being able to financially support his family. Alcott himself worried about his own prospects as a young man, once writing to his mother that he was &quot;still at my old trade—hoping.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiner, 51&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott held his principles above his well-being. Shortly before his marriage, for example, his future father-in-law Colonel Joseph May helped him find a job teaching at a school in Boston run by the Society of Free Enquirers, followers of [[Robert Owen]], for a lucrative $1,000 to $1,200 annual salary. He refused it because he did not agree with their beliefs, writing, &quot;I shall have nothing to do with them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

From the other perspective, Alcott's unique teaching ideas created an environment which produced two famous daughters in different fields, in a time when women were not commonly encouraged to have independent careers.

[[Image:Little Miss Muffet 2 - WW Denslow - Project Gutenberg etext 18546.jpg|thumb|250px|Though most arachnids are harmless, a person with arachnophobia may still panic or feel uneasy around one. Sometimes, even an object resembling a spider can trigger a panic attack in an arachnophobic individual. The above cartoon is a depiction of the nursery rhyme &quot;[[Little Miss Muffet]]&quot;, in which the title character is &quot;frightened away&quot; by a spider.]]
'''Arachnophobia''' or '''arachnephobia''' (from the {{lang-el|ἀράχνη}}, ''[[arachne|aráchnē]]'', &quot;spider&quot; and {{lang|el|φόβος}}, ''[[phobia|phóbos]]'', &quot;fear&quot;) is a [[specific phobia]], the fear of [[spider (animal)|spiders]] and other [[arachnid]]s such as [[scorpion]]s. It is a manifestation of [[zoophobia]], among the most common of all [[phobia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Fear Factor: Phobias&quot; By Heather Hatfield, [http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/fear-factor-phobias WebMD]&lt;/ref&gt; The reactions of arachnophobics often seem irrational to others (and sometimes to the sufferers themselves). People with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such as webs. If arachnophobics see a spider they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia. In some extreme cases, even a picture or a realistic drawing of a spider can also trigger fear. Arachnophobics may feel humiliated if such episodes occur in a social setting.

The fear of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias. As with all phobias, the strength of the associations means the individual must not actively pursue the consequences, and outsiders should not in any way undermine and &quot;play&quot; with the phobia in the meantime.  

An evolutionary reason for the phobias, such as arachnophobia, [[claustrophobia]], [[fear of snakes]] or [[Fear of mice|mice]], etc. remains unresolved. One view, especially held in [[evolutionary psychology]], is that the presence of venomous spiders led to the evolution of a fear of spiders or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there is variability in the intensity of fears of spiders, and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic. Spiders, for instance, being relatively small, don’t fit the usual criterion for a threat in the [[animal|animal kingdom]] where size is a factor, but nearly all species are [[Venom (poison)|venomous]], and although rarely dangerous to humans, some species are dangerous. Arachnophobes will spare no effort to make sure that their whereabouts are spider-free, hence they would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments. Therefore, arachnophobes may possess a slight advantage over non-arachnophobes in terms of survival. However, this theory is undermined by the disproportional fear of spiders in comparison to other, far more deadly creatures{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} that were present during ''Homo sapiens'' [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptiveness]]. Studies with crickets have shown that a fear of spiders can develop before birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35459615/ns/technology_and_science-science/|title=Fear of spiders can develop before birth |date=Feb. 18, 2010|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative view is that the dangers, such as from spiders, are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution. Instead, inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival, rather than being an aid.  For some communities such as in [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[South America]] (except [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]), spiders are included in traditional foods. This suggests arachnophobia may be a cultural, rather than genetic trait.

In Western societies as many as 55% of females and 18% of males are estimated to experience arachnophobia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webs.wichita.edu/depttools/depttoolsmemberfiles/psychology/publications/Wagener%20&amp;%20Zettle%20Paper.pdf Davey, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alabaster'''  is a name applied to varieties of two distinct [[mineral]]s, when used as a material: [[gypsum]] (a [[Hydroxyl|hydrous]] [[sulfur|sulfate]] of [[calcium]]) and [[calcite]] (a [[carbonate]] of calcium). The former is the alabaster of the present day; generally, the latter is the alabaster of the ancients.  Both are easy to work, with an attractive appearance, and have been used for making a variety of artworks and objects, especially small carvings.  

The two kinds are distinguished from one another readily, because of differences in their relative hardness. The gypsum kind is so soft as to be readily scratched with a fingernail ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 1.5 to 2), while the calcite kind is too hard to be scratched in this way ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 3), although it does yield readily to a knife. Moreover, the calcite alabaster, being a [[carbonate]], [[effervescence|effervesces]] upon being touched with [[hydrochloric acid]], whereas the gypsum alabaster, when thus treated, remains practically unaffected. 

Due to the characteristic color of white alabaster, the term has entered the vernacular as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for [[white]] things, particularly &quot;alabaster skin&quot;, which means very light and quite transparent, and no doubt derives from the use of alabaster for tomb effigies.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word, alabaster, is in Middle English, through Old French ''alabastre'', in turn derived from the [[Latin]] ''alabaster'' and that from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἀλάβαστρος'' (''alabastros'') or ''ἀλάβαστος'' (''alabastos''). The latter was a term used to identify a vase made of alabaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233809 Alabastos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; 

This name may derive further from the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian word ''a-labaste'', which refers to vessels of the Egyptian goddess [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]].  She was represented as a lioness and frequently depicted as such in figures placed atop these alabaster vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/alabaster alabaster - definition at YourDictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/alabaster &quot;alabaster&quot;], ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggestions include derivation from the town of [[Alabastron]] in Egypt.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

== Types ==
=== Calcite alabaster ===
This substance, the &quot;alabaster&quot; of the [[List of ancient Egyptians|Ancient Egyptians]] and [[Bible]], often is termed ''Oriental alabaster'', since the early examples came from the [[Far East]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''alabastrites'' is said to be derived from the town of Alabastron, in [[Egypt]], where the stone was quarried.  The locality probably owed its name to the mineral; the origin of the mineral name is obscure. 

The &quot;Oriental&quot; alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called [[alabastron|alabastra]], the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name. In Egypt craftsmen used alabaster for [[canopic jar]]s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects. A [[sarcophagus]], sculptured in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from Alabastron, is in the [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], [[London]]. This was discovered by [[Giovanni Belzoni]] in 1817 in the tomb of [[Seti I]] near [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. It was purchased by Sir [[John Soane]].

When cut in thin sheets, alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows.  It was used for this purpose in [[medieval]] churches, especially in [[Italy]]. Large alabaster sheets are used extensively in the contemporary [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]], which was dedicated in 2002 by the [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California Archdiocese]]. The cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque.

Calcite alabaster is found as either a [[stalagmite|stalagmitic]] deposit, from the floor and walls of [[limestone]] [[cavern]]s, or as a kind of [[travertine]], similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water. Its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross-section, whence it is known as onyx-marble or alabaster-onyx, or sometimes simply as [[onyx]].  The latter term should be restricted to siliceous minerals, however. 

Egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near [[Suez]] and [[Assiut]].  Many ancient quarries are found in the hills overlooking the plain of [[Tell el Amarna]]. 

[[Algeria]]n onyx-marble has been quarried largely in the province of [[Oran]]. In [[Mexico]], there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at [[La Pedrara]], in the district of [[Tecali]], near [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. Onyx-marble occurs also in the district of [[Tehuacán]] and at several localities in [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], and [[Virginia]].

=== Gypsum alabaster ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Henry IV of England]] --&gt;
When the term &quot;alabaster&quot; is used without any qualification, it invariably means a [[Granularity|fine-grained]] variety of gypsum. This mineral, or alabaster proper, occurs in England. The early use of alabaster for vessels dedicated for use in the cult of the deity, Bast, in the culture of the Ancient Egyptians is well documented, however, thousands of gypsum alabaster [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating to the late [[4th millennium BC]] also have been found in [[Tell Brak]] (present day [[Nagar, Syria|Nagar]]), in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;item=1988.323.8&amp;viewmode=0&amp;isHighlight=1&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesopotamia]], a gypsum alabaster [[sculpture]], believed to represent the deity, [[Abu (god)|Abu]], dates to the first half of the [[3rd millennium BC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=40%2E156&lt;/ref&gt;

Gypsum alabaster is a common mineral, which occurs in England in the [[Keuper]] [[marl]]s of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], especially at [[Chellaston]] in [[Derbyshire]], at Fauld in [[Staffordshire]], and near [[Newark, England|Newark]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Deposits at all of these localities have been worked extensively. In the fifteenth century its carving into small statues and sets of [[relief]] panels for [[altarpiece]]s was a valuable [[Nottingham Alabaster|local industry in Nottingham]], as well as a major English export. These were usually painted, or partly painted. It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on [[tomb monument]]s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble.  Beside examples of these carvings still in Britain (especially at the [[Nottingham Castle Museum]], [[British Museum]], and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), trade in mineral alabaster (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the [[Musée de Cluny]], Spain, and Scandinavia.

Alabaster also is found, although in smaller quantity, at [[Watchet]] in [[Somerset]], near [[Penarth]] in [[Glamorganshire]], and elsewhere. In [[Cumbria]] it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or &quot;floors&quot; in spheroidal masses known as &quot;balls&quot; or &quot;bowls&quot; and in smaller lenticular masses termed &quot;cakes.&quot; At Chellaston, where the local alabaster is known as &quot;Patrick,&quot; it has been worked into ornaments under the name of &quot;Derbyshire spar&quot;—a term more properly applied to [[fluorspar]]. 

In [[Europe]], the centre of the alabaster trade today is [[Florence, Italy]]. [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with [[marl]]s of [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] age. The mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries, in the district of [[Volterra]]. Several varieties are recognized—veined, spotted, clouded, agatiform, and others. The finest kind, obtained principally from [[Castellina Marittima|Castellina]], is sent to Florence for figure-sculpture, while the common kinds are carved locally, into vases, lights, and various ornamental objects. These items are objects of extensive trade, especially in Florence, [[Pisa]], and [[Livorno]]. Spain and many other countries have deposits which have been worked.

=== Black alabaster ===

''Black alabaster'' is a rare form of the gypsum-based mineral. This black form is only found in three veins in the world, one each in [[Oklahoma]] (USA), [[Italy]], and [[China]].

[[Alabaster Caverns State Park]], near [[Freedom, Oklahoma]] is home to a natural gypsum cave in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster. There are several types of alabaster found at the site, including pink, white, and the rare black alabaster.

== Uses ==
The finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an [[stone masonry|ornamental stone]], especially for [[ecclesiastical]] decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls. Its softness enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms, but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work. If alabaster with a smooth, polished surface is washed with washing-up liquid, it will become rough, dull and whiter, losing most of its translucency and lustre.

The purest alabaster is a snow-white material of fine tiniforni grain, but it often is associated with an oxide of [[iron]], which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone. The coarser varieties of alabaster are converted by calcination into [[plaster of Paris]], whence they sometimes are known as &quot;plaster stone.&quot;

In order to diminish the [[Translucent|translucency]] of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble, the statues are immersed in a bath of water and heated gradually—nearly to the boiling-point—an operation requiring great care, for if the temperature is not regulated carefully, the stone acquires a dead-white, chalky appearance. The effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum. If properly treated, it very closely resembles true marble and is known as marmo di Castellina. 

Sulphate of lime (gypsum) also was used by the ancients. It was employed, for instance, in Assyrian sculpture. So some of the ancient alabaster is identical to the modern stone. 

Alabaster may be stained to disguise it, by being heated in various pigmentary solutions. In this way a very misleading imitation of [[Coral (precious)|coral]] that is called alabaster coral is produced.

'''Ahab''' or '''Ach'av''' or '''Achab''' in [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]] ({{Hebrew Name|אַחְאָב|Aẖ'av|ʼAḥʼāḇ|&quot;Brother of the father&quot;}}; {{lang-el|Αχααβ}}; {{lang-la|Achab}}) was [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|king of Israel]] and the son and successor of [[Omri]] according to the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:29-34|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His wife was [[Jezebel]].

Ahab became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of [[Asa of Judah|Asa, king of Judah]], and reigned for twenty-two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:29|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William F. Albright]] dated his reign to 869 &amp;ndash; 850 BC, while [[E. R. Thiele]] offered the dates 874 &amp;ndash; 853 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951;  2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). ISBN 0-8254-3825-X, 9780825438257&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael D. Coogan]] dates his reign to 871-852 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[Omri]] (Ahabs father and founder of the short lived Omri Dynasty) seems to have been a successful military leader being reported within the text of the Moabite [[Mesha Stele]] to have &quot;oppressed Moab for many days&quot;.  Ahab was suceeded by [[Ahaziah]] and [[Jehoram]] who reigned over Israel until Jehu's revolt of 842 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009)239&lt;/ref&gt; Ahab married [[Jezebel]], the daughter of the King of Tyre, and the alliance was doubtless the means of procuring political support. [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]] has been identified as Ahab's fortified chariot and cavalry base.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin&gt;David Ussishkin, &quot;Jezreel—Where Jezebel Was Thrown to the Dogs&quot;, ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' July / August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 1 Kings chapters 16-22 tells the story of Ahab and Jezebel, and indicates that Jezebel was a bad influence on Ahab.&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Kings]] 16:31, 18:4-19, 19:1-2, 21:5-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Kings of Israel}}

==Ahab's reign==
[[Image:Karkar.jpg|thumb|150px|thumb|right|[[Shalmaneser III]]'s (859-824 BC) [[Kurkh Monolith]] names King Ahab.(see [[List of artifacts significant to the Bible]]]]
During Ahab's reign, [[Moab]], which had been conquered by his father, remained tributary; [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]], with whose king, [[Jehoshaphat]], he was allied by marriage, was probably his vassal; only with [[Aram Damascus]] is he believed to have had strained relations.

===Battle of Qarqar===
The [[Battle of Qarqar]] is mentioned in extra-biblical records, and was perhaps at [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] where [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] fought a great confederation of princes from [[Cilicia]], Northern [[Syria]], Israel, [[Ammon]], and the tribes of the Syrian desert (853 BC), including Ahab (''A-ha-ab-bu &lt;sup&gt;mat&lt;/sup&gt;'') (''Adad-'idri'').

Ahab's contribution was reckoned at 2,000 [[chariot]]s and 10,000 men. In reality, however, the number of chariots in Ahab's forces was probably closer to number in the hundreds (this due to archaelological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that had been found).&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael D. Coogan 2009&quot;&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 243&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], Judah, [[Edom]], and [[Moab]]. The Assyrian king claimed a victory, but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in 849 BC and 846 BC against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success. According to the [[Tanakh]], however, Ahab with 7,000 troops had previously overthrown [[Ben-hadad]] and his thirty-two kings, who had come to lay siege to Samaria, and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at [[Aphek (biblical)|Aphek]], probably in the [[plain of Sharon]] at [[Antipatris]] (''1 Kings'' 20). A treaty was made whereby Ben-hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from Ahab's father (that is, Omri, but see 15:20, ''[[Books of Kings|2 Kings]]'' 13:25), and trading facilities between Damascus and Samaria were granted.

===Ahab and the Prophets===
In the Biblical text, Ahab has four important encounters with prophets. 
The first encounter has to do with [[Elijah]], whom Ahab refers to as &quot;the troubler of Israel&quot; (1 Kings 18:17), in which Elijah predicts a drought (1 Kings 17:1). This encounter ends with Elijah victorious over the official [[Baal]] prophets of Israel in a contest held for the sake of the Israelites and their king, Ahab. The contest ends when Elijah's God consumes the offering which the Baal worshipers could not induce their god to touch, after which Elijah slaughters the Baal prophets (1 Kings 18:17-40). The second encounter is between Ahab and two unnamed prophets in 1 Kings 20:22. The third is when Elijah confronts Ahab over Ahab and [[Jezebel]]'s execution of [[Naboth]] and usurpation of his land in 1 Kings 21. The fourth encounter is with [[Micaiah]], the prophet who, when asked for advice on a military campaign, first assures Ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives Ahab a glimpse into God's plan for Ahab to die in battle (1 Kings 22).&lt;ref&gt;Achtemeier, Paul (Editor), The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, (New York: HarperCollins, 1996), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Ahab===
Three years later, war broke out on the east of the [[Jordan River]], and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover [[Battle of Ramoth-Gilead|Ramoth-Gilead]].  During this battle Ahab disguised himself, but was mortally wounded by a randomly shot arrow (ch. 22). The Hebrew Bible says that dogs licked his blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that &quot;pigs&quot; also licked his blood. Israelites of course abstained from pork, but Ahab was married to a Phoenician/Tyrian princess [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]], who was one of the most &quot;powerful and notorious women of monarchic times&quot; yet who died of a similarly seemingly random death like her husband,&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael D. Coogan 2009&quot;/&gt; and his capital of Samaria was said to follow Canaanite gods.  Ahab was succeeded by his sons, [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] and [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]].

==Order of events==
It is very difficult to obtain any clear idea of the order of these events (the [[Septuagint]] places ''1 Kings'' 21 immediately after 19). How the hostile kings of Israel and Syria came to fight a common enemy, and how to correlate the Assyrian and Biblical records, are questions which have perplexed all recent writers.  The reality of the difficulties will be apparent from the fact that it has been suggested{{by whom|date=February 2011}} that the Assyrian scribe wrote &quot;Ahab&quot; for his son &quot;Jehoram&quot;, and that the very identification of the name with Ahab of Israel has been questioned...&lt;!--yes...?--&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|possibly Jehu, described as &quot;son of [[Omri]]&quot;, or Jehu's ambassador,  kneeling at the feet of [[Shalmaneser III]] on the [[Black Obelisk]].]]

While the above passages from ''1 Kings'' do not view Ahab unfavourably, there are others which are less friendly. Essentially, 1 Kings 16:29 through 20:40 is the story of Ahab's reign. This reign is one which faces opposition from several prophets of [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]] through out as well as various consequences because of his marriage to Jezebel, because of his worship of Baal, disobedience to prophetic warnings and words, and also because of the murder of Naboth. The murder of [[Naboth]] (see [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]]), an act of royal encroachment, stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of certain of the prophets ([[Elijah]], [[Micaiah]], and a few unamed [[prophet]]s). Indeed, he is referred to, for this and other things as being &quot;more evil than all the kings before him&quot; (1 Kings 16:30). The followers of Yahweh found their champion in [[Elijah]], whose story reflects the prophetic teaching of more than one age. His denunciation of the royal dynasty of Israel, and his emphatic insistence on the worship of Yahweh and Yahweh alone, illustrated by the contest between Yahweh and Baal on [[Mount Carmel]], as told in 1 Kings 18, form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of [[Jehu]], an event in which Elijah's chosen disciple [[Elisha]] was the leading figure.

The '''Dasyproctidae''' are a family of large [[South America]]n [[rodent]]s, comprising the [[agouti]]s and [[acouchi]]s. Their fur is a reddish or dark colour above, with a paler underside. They are [[herbivore|herbivorous]], often feeding on ripe [[fruit]] that falls from trees. They live in burrows, and, like [[squirrel]]s, will bury some of their food for later use.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Bishop, Ian|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|page= 701|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algol''' (β Per, [[beta (letter)|Beta]] Persei), known colloquially as the '''Demon Star''', is a bright [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].  It is one of the best known [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], the first such star to be discovered, and also one of the first (non-[[nova]]) [[variable star]]s  to be discovered. Algol is actually a three-star system (Beta Persei&amp;nbsp;A, B, and&amp;nbsp;C) in which the large and bright primary Beta Persei&amp;nbsp;A is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer Beta Persei&amp;nbsp;B. Thus, Algol's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] is usually near-constant at&amp;nbsp;2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every two days, 20&amp;nbsp;hours and 49&amp;nbsp;minutes during the roughly 10-hour long partial eclipses. There is also a secondary eclipse when the brighter star occults the fainter secondary. This secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically.&lt;ref&gt;Beta Persei, American Association of Variable Star Observers.  http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/0199.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable, known as [[Algol variable]]s.

==Observation history==
The variability of Algol was first recorded in 1667 by [[Geminiano Montanari]], but it is probable that this property was noticed long before this time. The first person to propose a mechanism for the variability of this star was the British amateur astronomer [[John Goodricke]]. In May 1783 he presented his findings to the [[Royal Society]], suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by a dark body passing in front of the star (or else that the star itself has a darker region that is periodically turned toward the Earth.) For his report he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2003-08-06 | url = http://www.surveyor.in-berlin.de/himmel/Bios/Goodricke-e.html | title = John Goodricke, The Discovery of the Occultating Variable Stars  | accessdate = 2006-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the Harvard astronomer [[Edward Charles Pickering]] presented evidence that Algol was actually an eclipsing binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pickering | first = Edward C. | title=Dimensions of the Fixed Stars, with especial reference to Binaries and Variables of the Algol type | journal=Astronomical register | year=1881 | pages=253–256 | bibcode=1881AReg...19..253. | issue = 1-2 | doi= | volume=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed a few years later, in 1889, when the Potsdam astronomer [[Hermann Carl Vogel]] found periodic [[doppler shift]]s in the spectrum of Algol, inferring variations in the [[radial velocity]] of this binary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = A. H. Batten | title=Two Centuries of Study of Algol Systems | journal=Space Science Reviews  | year=1989 | volume=50 | issue=1/2 | pages=1–8 | bibcode=1989SSRv...50....1B  | doi = 10.1007/BF00215914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Algol became one of the first known [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic binaries]].

==System==

[[File:Eclipsing binary star animation 2.gif|thumb|left|Computer simulation on how Algol may rotate]]

Algol A and Algol&amp;nbsp;B are an eclipsing binary, because their [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] coincidentally contains the [[Earth]]'s [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]].  To be more precise, however, Algol is a triple-star system: the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only 0.062&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]], while the third star in the system (Algol&amp;nbsp;C) is at an average distance of 2.69&amp;nbsp;AU from the pair and the mutual [[orbital period]] is 681&amp;nbsp;days (1.86&amp;nbsp;years). The total mass of the system is about 5.8 solar masses, and the mass ratios of A, B and C are about 4.5&amp;nbsp;: 1&amp;nbsp;: 2.

Studies of Algol led to the '''[[Algol paradox]]''' in the theory of [[stellar evolution]]: although components of a binary star form at the same time, and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive ones, it was observed that the more massive component Algol&amp;nbsp;A is still in the [[main sequence]], while the less massive Algol&amp;nbsp;B is a [[subgiant star]] at a later evolutionary stage. The paradox can be solved by [[mass transfer]]: when the more massive star became a subgiant, it filled its [[Roche lobe]], and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence. In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Izold | last=Pustylnik | title=On Accretion Component of the Flare Activity in Algol | journal=Baltic Astronomy | year=1995 | volume=4 | issue=1-2 | pages=64–78 | bibcode=1995BaltA...4...64P | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system also exhibits variable activity in the form of [[x-ray]] and [[radio]] flares. The former is thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the AB&amp;nbsp;components interacting with the mass transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=M.J. Sarna, S.K. Yerli, A.G. Muslimov | title=Magnetic activity and evolution of Algol-type stars - II | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | year=1998 | volume=297 | issue=3 | pages=760–768 | bibcode=1998MNRAS.297..760S | doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01539.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio emissions may be created by magnetic cycles similar to [[sunspots]], but, as the magnetic fields around these stars are up to ten times stronger than that of the [[Sun]], these radio flares are more powerful and longer lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Blue | first = Charles E. | date = 2002-06-03 | url = http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2002/algol/ | title = Binary Stars &quot;Flare&quot; With Predictable Cycles, Analysis of Radio Observations Reveals | publisher = National Radio Astronomy Observatory  | accessdate = 2006-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algol is 92.8&amp;nbsp;[[light year]]s from Earth; however, about 7.3&amp;nbsp;million years ago it passed within 9.8&amp;nbsp;light years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Because the total mass of the system is 5.8&amp;nbsp;solar masses, and despite the fairly large distance at closest approach, this may have been enough to perturb the [[solar system]]'s [[Oort cloud]] slightly and to increase the number of [[comet]]s entering the inner solar system. However, the actual increase in net cratering rate is believed to have been quite small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. García-Sánchez, R.A. Preston, D.L. Jones, P.R.

==Etymology and cultural significance==
The name ''Algol'' derives from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''رأس الغول''' ''ra's al-ghūl'' : head (ra's) of the ogre (al-ghūl) (see &quot;[[ghoul]]&quot;). As an eclipsing binary, the star would undergo regular changes in brightness), which was given from its position in the [[constellation]] [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], representing the head of [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]]. The English names of ''Demon Star'' and ''Blinking Demon'' are direct translations.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard Hinckley | last=Allen | title=[[Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]] (revised edition) | publisher=Dover | year=1963 |pages=332–33| isbn= 0-486-21079-0 | oclc=185804232 637940}}, also online on Bill Thayer's site [[LacusCurtius|Lacus Curtius]]: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/home.html Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]&lt;/ref&gt; In Hebrew folklore it was known as ''Rōsh ha Sāṭān'' 'Satan's Head', via [[Edmund Chilmead]], who called it 'Divels head' or ''Rosch hassatan''. A [[Latin]] term from the 16th&amp;nbsp;century was ''Caput Larvae'' 'Spectre's Head'. It was also linked with [[Lilith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;/&gt; [[Hipparchus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] made this a separate, though connected, constellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;/&gt;

It is known as 大陵五 (the Fifth Star of the Mausoleum) in [[Chinese astronomy]], and also bore the grim name ''Tseih She'' (叠尸 - die2 shi1 in Modern Pinyin), meaning 'piled up corpses'.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Olney Hymns page 53 Amazing Grace.jpg|thumb|alt=An open right-hand side page of a book showing four stanzas of Hymn XL, then at page bottom &quot;I. Chronicles. Hymn XLI. Faith's review and expectation. Chap. xvii. 16, 17.&quot;, followed by a stanza &quot;Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound) / That sav'd a wretch like me! / I once was lost, but now am found, / Was blind, but now I see.&quot;|The bottom of page 53 of ''[[Olney Hymns]]'' shows the first stanza of what became &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.]]

&quot;'''Amazing Grace'''&quot; is a Christian [[hymn]] written by English poet and clergyman [[John Newton]] (1725–1807), published in 1779. With a message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of the sins people commit and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is one of the most recognizable songs in the English-speaking world.

Newton wrote the words from personal experience. He grew up without any particular religious conviction but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was [[Impressment|pressed]] into the [[Royal Navy]] and became a sailor, eventually participating in the slave trade. One night a terrible storm battered his vessel so severely that he became frightened enough to call out to God for mercy, a moment that marked the beginning of his spiritual conversion. His career in slave trading lasted a few years more until he quit going to sea altogether and began studying theology. 

Ordained in the [[Church of England]] in 1764, Newton became [[curate]] of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]], where he began to write hymns with poet [[William Cowper]]. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses, and it may have been chanted by the congregation without music. It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper's ''[[Olney Hymns]]'', but settled into relative obscurity in England. In the United States however, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was used extensively during the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century. It has been associated with more than 20 melodies, but in 1835 it was joined to a tune named &quot;New Britain&quot; to which it is most frequently sung today.  

Author Gilbert Chase writes that &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is &quot;without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Chase, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that it is performed about 10&amp;nbsp;million times annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;aitken224&quot;/&gt; It has had particular influence in [[folk music]], and become an emblematic [[Spiritual (music)|African American spiritual]]. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; saw a resurgence in popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century, sometimes appearing on popular music charts.

According to the ''Dictionary of American Hymnology'' &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.&lt;ref name=&quot;dah&quot;&gt;[http://www.hymnary.org/text/amazing_grace_how_sweet_the_sound Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound], ''Dictionary of American Hymnology''. Retrieved on October 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1725, Newton was born in [[Wapping]], a district in [[London]] near the [[Thames]]. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] but had [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the [[Anglican Church]]. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of [[tuberculosis]] when Newton was six years old.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next few years, Newton was raised by his distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated.&lt;ref&gt;Newton (1824), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an [[apprentice]]; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. 

As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed ''Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times'', a book by the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Earl of Shaftesbury]], with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, &quot;Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Newton (1824), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; After enduring humiliation for deserting,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Stripped of his rank, whipped in public, and subjected to the abuses directed to prisoners and other press-ganged men in the Navy, he demonstrated insolence and rebellion during his service for the next few months, remarking that the only reason he did not murder the captain or commit suicide was because he did not want Polly to think badly of him. (Martin [1950], pp. 41–47.)&lt;/ref&gt; he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Newton kept a series of detailed journals as a slave trader; these are perhaps the first primary source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the perspective of a merchant. (Moyers).  Women, naked or nearly so, upon their arrival on ship were claimed by the sailors, and Newton alluded to sexual misbehavior in his writings that has since been interpreted by historians to mean that he, along with other sailors, took whomever he chose. (Martin [1950], pp. 82-85)(Aitken, p. 64.)&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Newton j.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Engraving of an older heavyset man, wearing robes, vestments, and wig|[[John Newton]] in his later years]]
Newton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him that became so popular the crew began to join in.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered into disagreements with several colleagues which resulted in his being nearly starved to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced to work on a plantation in [[Sierra Leone]] near the [[Sherbro River]]. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Newton's father was friends with Joseph Manesty, who intervened several times in Newton's life. Newton was supposed to go to Jamaica on Manesty's ship, but missed it while he was with the Catletts. When Newton's father got his son's letter detailing his conditions in Sierra Leone, he asked Manesty to find Newton. Manesty sent the ''Greyhound'', which traveled along the African coast trading at various stops. An associate of Newton lit a fire signaling to ships he was interested in trading only 30 minutes before the ''Greyhound'' appeared. (Aitken, pp. 34–35, 64–65.)&lt;/ref&gt; Newton claimed the only reason he left was because of Polly.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

While aboard the ship ''Greyhound'', Newton gained notoriety for being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met. In a culture where sailors commonly used oaths and swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1748, while the ''Greyhound'' was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who had been standing where Newton was moments before.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Several retellings of Newton's life story claim that he was carrying slaves during the voyage in which he experienced his conversion, but the ship was carrying livestock, wood, and beeswax from the coast of Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, he offered a desperate suggestion to the captain, who ordered it so. Newton turned and said, &quot;If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Newton (1824), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the pump where he and another mate tied themselves to it to keep from being washed over. After an hour's rest, an exhausted Newton returned to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours where he pondered what he had said.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

About two weeks later, the battered ship and starving crew landed in [[Lough Swilly|Lough Swilly, Ireland]]. For several weeks before the storm, Newton had been reading ''The Christian’s Pattern'', a summary of the 15th-century ''[[The Imitation of Christ (book)|The Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas à Kempis]]. The memory of the uttered phrase in a moment of desperation did not leave him; he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable as he had not only neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, pp. 81–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's conversion was not immediate, but he contacted Polly's family and announced his intentions to marry her. Her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous. They knew he was profane, but they allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake.&lt;ref name=&quot;martin82-85&quot;&gt;Martin (1950), pp. 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt; He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only action he was able to free himself from was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed yet he retained the same attitude about slavery as his contemporaries&lt;ref group=note&gt;When Newton began his journal in 1750, not only was slave trading seen as a respectable profession by the majority of Britons, its necessity to the overall prosperity of the kingdom was communally understood and approved. Only [[Quaker]]s, who were much in the minority and perceived as eccentric, had raised any protest about the practice. (Martin and Spurrell [1962], pp. xi–xii.)&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in the trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in Africa—now as a captain—procured slaves being offered and sold them in larger ports to be sent to North or South America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip. After three shipping experiences in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as a captain on a ship with cargo unrelated to slavery, when at thirty years old, he collapsed and never sailed again.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Newton's biographers and Newton himself does not put a name to this episode other than a &quot;fit&quot; in which he became unresponsive, suffering dizziness and a headache. His doctor advised him not to go to sea again, and Newton complied. Jonathan Aitken called it a stroke or seizure, but it is unknown what caused it. (Martin [1950], pp. 140–141.)(Aitken, p. 125.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olney curate ==

Working as a [[customs]] agent in [[Liverpool]] starting in 1756, Newton began to teach himself Latin, Greek, and theology. He and Polly immersed themselves in the church community and Newton's passion was so impressive that his friends suggested he become a minister. He was turned down by the [[Bishop of York]] in 1758, ostensibly for having no university degree,&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), pp. 166–188.&lt;/ref&gt; although the more likely reasons were his leanings toward [[evangelism]] and tendency to socialize with [[Methodist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton continued his devotions, and after being encouraged by a friend, he wrote about his experiences in the slave trade and his conversion. The [[George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth|Earl of Dartmouth]], impressed with his story, sponsored Newton for ordination with the Bishop of Lincoln, and offered him the [[curate|curacy]] of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease;

Olney was a hamlet of about 2,500 residents whose main industry was making lace by hand. They were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;aitken224&quot;&gt;Aitken, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit; many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin. He was involved in his parishioners' lives and he was much loved although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1950), pp. 208–217.&lt;/ref&gt; His devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful however, and his mission he often said was to &quot;break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollock&quot;/&gt; He struck a friendship with [[William Cowper]], a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity, attempting suicide several times. Cowper enjoyed Olney—and Newton's company; he was also new to Olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to Newton's. Together, their effect on the local congregation was impressive. In 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting in order to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners. They also began writing lessons for children.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including [[Isaac Watts]]—whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;—and [[Charles Wesley]], with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother [[John Wesley|John]], the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Watts had previously written a hymn named &quot;Alas! And Did My Saviour Bleed&quot; that contained the lines &quot;Amazing pity! Grace unknown!/ And love beyond degree!&quot;. [[Philip Doddridge]], another well-known hymn writer wrote another in 1755 titled &quot;The Humiliation and Exaltation of God's Israel&quot; that began &quot;Amazing grace of God on high!&quot; and included other similar wording to Newton's verses. Newton biographer Jonathan Aitken states that Watts had inspired most of Newton's compositions. (Turner, pp. 82–83.)(Aitken, pp. 28–29.)&lt;/ref&gt; Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his on the [[Psalms]]. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the [[common meter]] in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner77-79&quot;&gt;Turner, pp. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Newton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on January 1, 1773.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner77-79&quot;/&gt; A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney were bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title ''[[Olney Hymns]]''. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in ''Olney Hymns''; &quot;1 Chronicles 17:16–17, Faith's Review and Expectation&quot; was the title of the poem with the first line &quot;Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dah&quot;/&gt;

=== Critical analysis ===
The general impact of ''Olney Hymns'' was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language driven from his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in ''Olney Hymns'' are faith in salvation, wonder at God's grace, his love for Jesus, and his ebullient exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in [[first-person narrative|first person]], admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in ''Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America'' considers &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh6&quot;&gt;Noll and Blumhofer, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Newton's hymns were recognized as great work (&quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was not among these) while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, an &quot;unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation&quot;, noting that only twenty-one of the words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Phipps in the ''Anglican Theological Review'' and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; as evidence of Newton's realization that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations.&lt;ref name=&quot;phipps&quot;&gt;Phipps, William (Summer 1990). &quot; 'Amazing Grace' in the hymnwriter's life&quot;, ''Anglican Theological Review'', '''72''' (3), pp. 306–313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;basker281&quot;/&gt; Newton joined forces with a young man named [[William Wilberforce]], the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. However, Newton became an ardent and outspoken [[abolitionist]] after he left Olney in the 1780s; he never connected the construction of the hymn that became &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to anti-slavery sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics in ''Olney Hymns'' were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective. For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress. At the same time he completed a diary—which has since been lost—that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing. The last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;aitken227&quot;&gt;Aitken, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ascribed to the hymn, &quot;[[1 Chronicles]] 17:16–17&quot;, refers to [[David]]'s reaction to the prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever. Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh8&quot;&gt;Noll and Blumhofer, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly,&lt;ref name=&quot;watson215&quot;/&gt; and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were &quot;blinded by the god of this world&quot; until &quot;mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired ... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aitken227&quot;/&gt;

The [[New Testament]] served as the basis for many of the lyrics of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. The first verse, for example, can be traced to the story of the [[Prodigal Son]]. In the [[Gospel of Luke]] the father says, &quot;For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found&quot;. The story of Jesus healing a blind man who tells the [[Pharisees]] that he can now see is told in the [[Gospel of John]]. Newton used the words &quot;I was blind but now I see&quot; and declared &quot;Oh to grace how great a debtor!&quot; in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752.&lt;ref name=&quot;aitken228&quot;&gt;Aitken, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation &quot;Amazing grace!&quot;, to be followed by a qualifying reply in &quot;how sweet the sound&quot;. In ''An Annotated Anthology of Hymns'', Newton's use of an expletive at the beginning of his verse is called &quot;crude but effective&quot; in an overall composition that &quot;suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;watson215&quot;&gt;Watson, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh6&quot;/&gt;

The sermon preached by Newton was the last of his William Cowper heard in Olney for Cowper's mental instability returned shortly thereafter. Steve Turner, author of ''Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song'', suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underneath is another hymn titled &quot;Cookham&quot;|An 1847 publication of ''[[Southern Harmony]]'', showing the title &quot;New Britain&quot; and [[shape note]] music]]
Although it had its roots in England, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; became an integral part of the Christian tapestry in the United States. More than 60 of Newton and Cowper's hymns were republished in other British hymnals and magazines, but &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was not, appearing only once in a 1780 hymnal sponsored by the [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Countess of Huntingdon]]. Scholar [[John D. Julian|John Julian]] commented in his 1892 ''[[A Dictionary of Hymnology]]'' that outside of the United States, the song was unknown and it was &quot;far from being a good example of Newton's finest work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Julian, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Only since the 1950s has it gained some popularity in the UK; not until 1964 was it published with the music most commonly associated with it. (Noll and Blumhofer, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1789 and 1799, four variations of Newton's hymn were published in the U.S. in [[Baptist]], [[Dutch Reformed]], and [[Congregationalist]] hymnodies;&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh8&quot;/&gt; by 1830  [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Methodist]]s also included Newton's verses in their hymnals.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh10&quot;&gt;Noll and Blumhofer, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, pp. 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The greatest influences in the 19th century that propelled &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to spread across the U.S. and become a staple of religious services in many denominations and regions were the [[Second Great Awakening]] and the development of shape note singing communities. A tremendous religious movement was overtaking the U.S. in the early 19th century that was marked by growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start in Kentucky and Tennessee. Unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended camp meetings where they came to experience salvation; preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner115-116&quot;&gt;Turner, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony, and made as plain and simple as possible; sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin. Witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings, where a congregation member or even a stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh10&quot;/&gt; &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons, although the contemporary style used a refrain, borrowed from other hymns, that employed simplicity and repetition such as:
{{clear}}
&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind but now I see.

Shout, shout for glory,
Shout, shout aloud for glory;
Brother, sister, mourner,
All shout glory hallelujah.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner115-116&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Simultaneously, an unrelated movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds to symbolize the basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as [[shape note]] singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing, to a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space with one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was religious, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung [[a cappella]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &quot;New Britain&quot; tune ===
[[File:Walker w.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Grainy portrait of a middle aged white man in a black suit characteristic of the 1840s|[[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]], the composer who first joined John Newton's verses to &quot;New Britain&quot;, to create the song that has become &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;]]
When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. At the time, hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in ''A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon’s Hymns'' (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune &quot;Hephzibah&quot; by English composer John Jenkins Husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hymntune.library.uiuc.edu/ The Hymn Tune Index], Search=&quot;Hephzibah&quot;. University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana Library website. Retrieved on December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]] assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named &quot;New Britain&quot;, which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (&quot;Gallaher&quot; and &quot;St. Mary&quot;) first published in the ''Columbian Harmony''  by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829).  Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's [[Centre College]], compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy &quot;the wants of the Church in her triumphal march.&quot;  Most of the tunes had been previously published, but &quot;Gallaher&quot; and &quot;St. Mary&quot; had not.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 120–122.&lt;/ref&gt;  As neither tune is attributed, and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate on the tune's origins. These guesses include a Scottish folk ballad as many of the new residents of Kentucky and Tennessee were immigrants from Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; or folk songs developed in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; or South Carolina, William Walker's home state.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh11&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, with the words written by Newton and joined with &quot;New Britain&quot;, the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook ''[[Southern Harmony]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindmarsh11&quot;&gt;Noll and Blumhofer, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It was, according to author Steve Turner, a &quot;marriage made in heaven...The music behind 'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful. There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about 600,000 copies all over the U.S. when the total population was just over 20 million.  Another shape note tunebook named ''[[The Sacred Harp]]'' (1844) by Georgia residents [[Benjamin Franklin White]] and Elisha J. King became widely influential and continues to be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner126&quot;&gt;Turner, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another verse was first recorded in [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s immensely influential 1852 anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. Three verses were emblematically sung by Tom in his hour of deepest crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; He sings the sixth and fifth verses in that order, and Stowe included another verse not written by Newton that had been passed down orally in African American communities for at least 50 years. It was originally one of between 50 to 70 verses of a song titled &quot;Jerusalem, My Happy Home&quot; that first appeared in a 1790 book called ''A Collection of Sacred Ballads'':

&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
When we've been there ten thousand years, 
Bright shining as the sun, 
We've no less days to sing God's praise, 
Than when we first begun.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Amazing Grace&quot; came to be an emblem of a religious movement and a symbol of the U.S. itself as the country was involved in a great political experiment, attempting to employ democracy as a means of government. Shape note singing communities, with all the members sitting around an open center, each song employing a different director, illustrated this in practice. Simultaneously, the U.S. began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The &quot;dangers, toils, and snares&quot; of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner126&quot;/&gt; This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861–1865). &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; set to &quot;New Britain&quot; was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers and with death so real and imminent, religious services in the military became commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban revival ===

Although &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; set to &quot;New Britain&quot; was popular, other versions existed regionally. [[Primitive Baptist]]s in the Appalachian region often used &quot;New Britain&quot; with other hymns, and sometimes sing the words of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to other folk songs, including titles such as &quot;[[In the Pines]]&quot;, &quot;Pisgah&quot;, &quot;Primrose&quot;, and &quot;Evan&quot;, as all are able to be sung in common meter, of which the majority of their repertoire consists.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Brett (January 1982). &quot;Shape-Note Tune Books and Primitive Hymns&quot;, ''Ethnomusicology'', '''26''' (1), pp. 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt; A tune named &quot;Arlington&quot; accompanied Newton's verses as much as &quot;New Britain&quot; for a time in the late 19th century. 

Two musical arrangers named [[Dwight Moody]] and [[Ira Sankey]] heralded another religious revival in the cities of the U.S. and Europe, giving the song international exposure. Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of [[gospel music]], and churches all over the U.S. were eager to acquire them.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 133–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the first line of the lyrics, or the name of the tune such as &quot;New Britain&quot;. A publisher named [[Edwin Othello Excell]] gave the version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; set to &quot;New Britain&quot; immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving &quot;New Britain&quot; some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910, and his version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; became the standard form of the song in American churches.&lt;ref&gt;Noll and Blumhofer, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 137–138, 140–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of recorded music and radio, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences. The ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to take on thousands of different forms in the 20th century. Where Edwin Othello Excell sought to make the singing of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; uniform throughout thousands of churches, records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience. [[Allmusic]] lists more than 6,000 versions of the song as of May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allmusic.com/ Allmusic search=Amazing Grace Song], Allmusic. Retrieved on January 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first recording is an [[a cappella]] version from 1922 by the Sacred Harp Choir. It was included from 1926 to 1930 in [[Okeh Records]]' catalog, which typically concentrated strongly on blues and jazz. Demand was high for black gospel recordings of the song by H.R. Tomlin and [[J. M. Gates]]. A poignant sense of nostalgia accompanied the recordings of several gospel and blues singers in the 1940s and 1950s who used the song to remember their grandparents, traditions, and family roots.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded with musical accompaniment for the first time in 1930 by [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], although to another folk hymn named &quot;At the Cross&quot;, not to &quot;New Britain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;loclist&quot;/&gt; &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is emblematic of several kinds of folk music styles, often used as the standard example to illustrate such musical techniques as [[lining out]] and [[call and response]], that have been practiced in both black and white folk music.&lt;ref name=&quot;tallmadge&quot;&gt;Tallmadge, William (May 1961). &quot;Dr. Watts and Mahalia Jackson: The Development, Decline, and Survival of a Folk Style in America&quot;, ''Ethnomusicology'', '''5''' (2), pp. 95–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gospel superstar [[Mahalia Jackson]]'s 1947 version received significant radio airplay, and as her popularity grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s, she often sang it at public events such as concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mahalia Jackson.&quot; ''Dictionary of American Biography'', Supplement 9: 1971–1975. Charles Scribner's Sons, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Author James Basker states that the song has been employed by African Americans as the &quot;paradigmatic Negro spiritual&quot; because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries.&lt;ref name=&quot;basker281&quot;&gt;Basker, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Heilbut, author of ''The Gospel Sound'', states that the &quot;dangers, toils, and snares&quot; of Newton's words are a &quot;universal testimony&quot; of the African American experience.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s with the [[African American Civil Rights Movement]] and [[opposition to the Vietnam War]], the song took on a political tone. Mahalia Jackson employed &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it &quot;to give magical protection—a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend.... I was not sure the magic worked outside the church walls ... in the open air of Mississippi. But I wasn't taking any chances.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk singer [[Judy Collins]], who knew the song before she could remember learning it, witnessed [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] leading marchers in [[Freedom Summer|Mississippi in 1964]], singing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. Collins also considered it a [[wikt:talisman|talisman]] of sorts, and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers, witnesses, and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;moyers&quot;/&gt; According to fellow folk singer [[Joan Baez]], it was one of the most requested songs from her audiences, but she never realized its origin as a hymn; by the time she was singing it in the 1960s she said it had &quot;developed a life of its own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It even made an appearance at the [[Woodstock Music Festival]] in 1969 during [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s performance.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins decided to record it in the late 1960s amid an atmosphere of counterculture introspection; she was part of an [[encounter group]] that ended a contentious meeting by singing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album ''[[Whales &amp; Nightingales]]''. Collins, who has a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to &quot;pull her through&quot; to recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;moyers&quot;/&gt; It was recorded in [[St. Paul's Chapel (Columbia University)|St. Paul's]], the chapel at [[Columbia University]], chosen for the acoustics. She chose an ''a cappella'' arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the [[Vietnam War]], to which she objected: &quot;I didn't know what else to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought ... but sing 'Amazing Grace'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], remaining on the charts for 15 weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; as if, she wrote, her fans had been &quot;waiting to embrace it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Kutner, and Warwick p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Collins used it as a catharsis for her opposition to the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]], senior [[Scottish regiment]] of the [[British Army]], recorded an instrumental version featuring a [[bagpipe]] soloist accompanied by a [[pipe and drum]] band. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns, where in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It hit number 1 in the [[UK singles chart]], spending 24 weeks total on the charts (the best-selling single in the UK in 1972&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Robert (2002) 'ABBA: Thank You for the Music - The Stories Behind Every Song', Carlton Books Limited: Great Britain, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;) and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Kutner, and Warwick p. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, it was the best-selling instrumental record in British history, and a controversial one, as it combined pipes with a military band. The pipe president of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to [[Edinburgh Castle]] and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Rod Stewart]] also recorded &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; around the same time, and both of their renditions were popular.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Franklin's version is a prime example of &quot;long meter&quot; rendition: she sings several notes representing a syllable and the vocals are more dramatic and lilting. Her version lasts over ten minutes in comparison to the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards' that lasts under three minutes. (Tallmadge)(Turner, pp. 150–151.)&lt;/ref&gt; All four versions were marketed to distinct types of audiences thereby assuring its place as a pop song.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Cash]] recorded it on his 1975 album ''[[Sings Precious Memories]]'', dedicating it to his older brother Jack, who had been killed in a mill accident when they were boys in [[Dyess, Arkansas]]. Cash and his family sang it to themselves while they worked in the cotton fields following Jack's death. Cash often included the song when he toured prisons, saying &quot;For the three minutes that song is going on, everybody is free. It just frees the spirit and frees the person.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;moyers&quot;/&gt;

The [[U.S. Library of Congress]] has a collection of 3,000 versions of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, some of which were first-time recordings by folklorists [[Alan Lomax|Alan and John Lomax]], a father and son team who in 1932 traveled thousands of miles across the South to capture the different regional styles of the song. More contemporary versions include samples from such popular music groups as [[Sam Cooke]] and [[The Soul Stirrers]] (1963), [[The Byrds]] (1970), [[Elvis Presley]] (1971), [[Skeeter Davis]] (1972), [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]] (1975), [[Willie Nelson]] (1976), and [[The Lemonheads]] (1992).&lt;ref name=&quot;loclist&quot;&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/html/grace/grace-timeline.html Amazing Grace: Special Presentation: Amazing Grace Timeline] United States Library of Congress Performing Arts Encyclopedia.

Following the appropriation of the hymn in secular music, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; became such an icon in American culture that it has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns, placing it in danger of becoming a [[cliché]]. It has been mass produced on souvenirs, lent its name to a [[Amazing Grace (comics)|Superman villain]], appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' to demonstrate the redemption of a murderous character named [[Sideshow Bob]], incorporated into [[Hare Krishna]] chants and adapted for [[Wicca]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 195–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn has been employed in several films, including ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]'', ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter]]'', and ''[[Silkwood]]''.

In recent years, the words of the hymn have been changed in some religious publications to downplay a sense of imposed self-loathing by its singers. The second line, &quot;That saved a wretch like me!&quot; has been rewritten as &quot;That saved and strengthened me&quot;, &quot;save a soul like me&quot;, or &quot;that saved and set me free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, William (2003). [http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0250.html Lenten Music] ''Arlington Catholic Herald''. Retrieved on February 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Norris in her book ''Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith'' characterizes this transformation of the original words as &quot;wretched English&quot; making the line that replaces the original &quot;laughably bland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means. Newton's Calvinistic view of redemption and divine grace formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was unable to change his life or be redeemed without God's help. Yet his lyrical subtlety, in Steve Turner's opinion, leaves the hymn's meaning open to a variety of Christian and non-Christian interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 213–214.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Wretch&quot; also represents a period in Newton's life when he saw himself outcast and miserable, as he was when he was enslaved in Sierra Leone; his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Bruner and Ware, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The communal understanding of redemption and human self-worth has changed since Newton's time. Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome in order to achieve a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, &quot;grace&quot; and the meaning behind the words of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; have become as individual as the singer or listener.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 218–220.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is due to the absence of any mention about God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins &quot;When we've been there ten thousand years&quot;), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. &quot;Grace&quot;, however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as he used the word to represent God or the [[Grace (Christianity)|power of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Noll and Blumhofer, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist [[Bill Moyers]] in a documentary released in 1990. Moyers was inspired to focus on the song's power after watching a performance at [[Lincoln Center]], where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollock&quot;&gt;Pollock, John (2009). &quot;Amazing Grace: The great Sea Change in the Life of John Newton&quot;, ''The Trinity Forum Reading'', The Trinity Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: &quot;there is a transformative power that is applicable...: the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Basker, p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moyers interviewed Collins, Cash, opera singer [[Jessye Norman]], Appalachian folk musician [[Jean Ritchie]] and her family, white Sacred Harp singers in Georgia, black Sacred Harp singers in Alabama, and a prison choir at the [[Huntsville Unit|Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville]]. Collins, Cash, and Norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday]], stated, &quot;I don't know whether it's the text—I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people—or whether it's that tune that everybody knows.&quot; A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: &quot;'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved&quot; by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer [[Marion Williams]] summed up its effect: &quot;That's a song that gets to everybody&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;moyers&quot;/&gt;

The ''Dictionary of American Hymnology'' claims it is included in over a thousand published hymnals, and recommends its use for &quot;occasions of worship when we need to confess with joy that we are saved by God's grace alone; as a hymn of response to forgiveness of sin or as an assurance of pardon; as a confession of faith or after the sermon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dah&quot;/&gt;

AOL is best known for its [[online]] [[software suite]], also called ''AOL'', that allowed customers to access the world's largest &quot;[[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden]]&quot; [[online community]] and eventually reach out to the Internet as a whole. At its prime, AOL's membership was over 30 million members worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;lessbemore&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2006/tc20060731_168094.htm |title=Will Less Be More for AOL? |first=Catherine |last=Holahan |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2006-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom accessed the AOL service through the AOL software suite.

On May 28, 2009, [[Time Warner]] announced that it would [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] AOL into a separate public company. The spinoff occurred on December 9, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/11/16/technology/tech-us-aol.html ''Time Warner to Spin Off AOL on December 9'']&quot;  Retrieved on November 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ending the eight year relationship between the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://money.usnews.com/money/business-economy/technology/articles/2009/05/28/time-warner-to-spin-off-aol-ending-ill-fated-deal.html ''Time Warner to spin off AOL, ending ill-fated deal''].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

With regional branches around the world, the former American &quot;[[goliath]] among [[Internet service provider]]s&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lessbemore&quot; /&gt; once had more than 30 million subscribers&lt;ref name=&quot;lessbemore&quot; /&gt; on several continents.  It ranked fourth (behind the Web itself, e-mail, and graphic user interfaces) in a 2007 USA TODAY retrospective on the 25 events that shaped the first 25 years of the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/top25-internet.htm | work=USA Today | title=How the Internet took over | date=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named to the &quot;.com 25&quot; by a panel of Silicon Valley influencers on the occasion of the same anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.25yearsof.com/thedotcom25/ | title=The .com25 Honorees |publisher=thedotcom25 | accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, AOL and [[Time Warner]] announced plans to merge. The terms of the deal called for AOL shareholders to own 55% of the new, combined company. The deal closed on January 11, 2001 after receiving regulatory approval from the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]], the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and the [[European Union]].

'''AOL Time Warner, Inc.''', as the company was then called, was led by executives from AOL, SBI, and Time Warner. [[Gerald Levin]], who had served as [[CEO]] of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. [[Steve Case]] served as [[Board of Directors|Chairman]], J. Michael Kelly (from AOL) was the [[Chief Financial Officer]], [[Robert W. Pittman]] (from AOL) and [[Dick Parsons]] (from Time Warner) served as Co-[[Chief Operating Officer]]s. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrapcharge&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060727/wr_nm/media_timewarner_aol_dc_7 |title=AOL expected to scrap charges |first=Kenneth |last=Li |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |date=2006-07-26 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060818100420/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060727/wr_nm/media_timewarner_aol_dc_7 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, its customer base decreased to 10.1 million subscribers as of November 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;custBase&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9046103&amp;intsrc=news_ts_head |title=AOL revenue, subscribers plummet |first=Linda |last=Rosencrance |publisher=ComputerWorld |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2007-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just narrowly ahead of [[Comcast]] and [[AT&amp;T Yahoo!]]. As of June 2010, AOL's subscriber base dropped to 4.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468516/000119312510176095/d10q.htm | title=Form 10-Q | publisher=[[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AOL old logo.svg|thumb|150px|left|The second logo for AOL, used from 2006–2009]]
News reports in late 2005 identified companies such as [[Yahoo!]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Google]] as candidates for turning AOL into a joint venture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

AOL was rated both one of the best and worst Internet suppliers in the UK, according to a poll by [[Watchdog (TV series)|BBC Watchdog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate = 2007-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 1997, the short-lived [[eWorld]] was purchased by AOL. The [[Internet service provider|ISP]] side of AOL UK was bought by [[The Carphone Warehouse]] in October 2006 to take advantage of their 100,000 [[Local loop unbundling|LLU]] customers which made The Carphone Warehouse the biggest LLU provider in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6039740.stm | work=BBC News | title=Carphone Warehouse buying AOL UK | date=October 11, 2006 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://topupguru.com/2009/05/28/time-warner-to-spinoff-aol/ Topupguru.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Warner]] announced that it would spin AOL off as an independent company once [[Google]]'s shares ceased at the end of the fiscal year, and AOL's page and logo changed afterward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30979493/ MSN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

AOL ceased to be a part of [[Time Warner]] on December 9, 2009. The company declared an [[IPO]] on that day, under the stock symbol NYSE:AOL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/AOLs-decision-to-rebrand-as-Aol-takes-a-bad-brand-and-makes-it-worse/1259015785 BetaNews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

AOL began as a short-lived venture called '''Control Video Corporation''' (or '''CVC'''), founded by [[Bill von Meister]]. Its sole product was an online service called [[GameLine]] for the [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]] after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by [[Warner Brothers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Alec |title=Stealing Time: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner |origyear=2003 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-5984-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subscribers bought a [[modem]] from the company for $49.95 and paid a one-time $15 setup fee. GameLine permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of $1 per game.  The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine's Master Module and playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.

The original technical team was composed of Marc Seriff, Tom Ralston, Ken Huntsman, Janet Hunter, Dave Brown, Steve Trus, Ray Heinrich, Craig Dykstra, and Doug Coward.

In January 1983, [[Steve Case]] was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, [[Jim Kimsey]] became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend [[Frank Caufield]], an investor in the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein2003&quot; /&gt; Von Meister quietly left the company in early 1985. Control Video was reorganized as Quantum Computer Services, Inc. on May 24, 1985, with Kimsey as [[Chief Executive Officer]] and [[Marc Seriff]] as [[Chief Technology Officer]]. Out of 100 employees from Control Video, only 10 remained in the new company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein2003&quot; /&gt; Case himself rose quickly through the ranks; Kimsey promoted him to vice-president of marketing not long after becoming CEO, and later promoted him further to executive vice-president in 1987. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to ascend to the rank of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.

Kimsey changed the company's strategy, and in 1985 launched a dedicated online service for [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128|128]] computers, originally called [[Quantum Link]] (&quot;Q-Link&quot; for short). The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from [[PlayNET|PlayNet, Inc]], (founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl). In May 1988, Quantum and Apple launched [[AppleLink]] Personal Edition for [[Apple II family|Apple II]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for IBM-compatible [[personal computer|PCs]] developed in a joint venture with the [[Tandy Corporation]]. After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service's name to America Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm |title=History of Computing Industrial Era (1985–1990) |work=The History of Computing Project |accessdate=2005-09-24 |date=2006-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html |title=Apple II history chapter 22 |date=2002-12-31 |accessdate=2005-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, AOL included [[online games]] in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. In the early years of AOL the company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including:
* Graphical chat environments [[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]] (1986–1988) and [[Club Caribe]] (1988) from [[LucasArts]].
* The first online interactive fiction series [[QuantumLink Serial]] by [[Tracy Reed (writer)|Tracy Reed]] (1988).
* [[Quantum Space]], the first fully automated [[Play-by-mail game|Play by email]] game (1989–1991).
* The original [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] title ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' from [[Stormfront Studios]] (1991–1997), the first Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ([[MMORPG]]) to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text (1991).
* The first chat room-based text role-playing game [[Black Bayou]] (1996–2004), a horror role-playing game from Hecklers Online and ANTAGONIST, Inc.

In 2008 Neverwinter Nights was honored (along with [[Everquest]] and [[World of Warcraft]]) at the 59th Annual [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]]s for advancing the art form of [[MMORPG]] games.

In February 1991 AOL for [[DOS]] was launched using a [[GeoWorks]] interface followed a year later by AOL for Windows. This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]], and [[GEnie]]. AOL discontinued Q-Link and PC Link in the fall of 1994.

[[Steve Case]] positioned AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with [[computer]]s, in particular contrast to [[CompuServe]], which had long served the technical community. The PlayNet system that AOL licensed was the first online service to require use of [[proprietary software]], rather than a standard terminal program; as a result it was able to offer a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) instead of command lines, and was well ahead of the competition in emphasizing communication among members as a feature.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In particular was the [[Chat Room]] concept from PlayNet, as opposed to the previous paradigm of [[Citizens' band radio|CB]]-style channels. Chat Rooms allowed a large group of people with similar interests to convene and hold conversations in real time, including:
* Private rooms – created by any user. Hold up to 23 people.
* Conference rooms – created with permission of AOL. Hold up to 48 people and often moderated.
* Auditoriums – created with permission of AOL. Consisted of a stage and an unlimited number of rows. What happened on the stage was viewable by everybody in the auditorium but what happened within individual rows, of up to 27 people, was viewable only by the people within those rows.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Another area of early AOL leadership was education.  Between 1990-94, AOL launched services with the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, National Geographic, the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, Pearson, Scholastic, ASCD, NSBA, NCTE, Discovery Networks, Turner Education Services (CNN Newsroom), National Public Radio, The Princeton Review, Stanley Kaplan, Barron's, Highlights for Kids, the US Department of Education, and many other education providers.  AOL's offered the first real-time homework help service (the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards), the first service by kids, for kids (Kids Only Online, 1991), the first online service for parents (the Parents Information Network, 1991), the first online courses (1988), the first omnibus service for teachers (the Teachers' Information Network, 1990), the first online exhibit (Library of Congress, 1991), the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.

In September 1993, AOL added [[USENET]] access to its features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/September-that-never-ended.html Catb.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This is commonly referred to as the &quot;[[Eternal September]]&quot;.

AOL quickly surpassed [[GEnie]], and by the mid-1990s, it passed [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] (which for several years allowed AOL advertising) and [[CompuServe]].

Originally, AOL charged its users an hourly fee, but in October 1996 this changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95. During this time, AOL connections would be flooded with users trying to get on, and many canceled their accounts due to constant [[busy signal]]s (this was often joked &quot;AOL&quot; standing for &quot;Always Off-Line&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}A commercial featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night to fix the problem was made. Within three years, AOL's userbase grew to 10 million people.

[[File:Aol subscribers Q201-Q407.png|thumb|right|350px|U.S. AOL Subscribers 2Q 2001 – 2Q 2009]]
Since its merger with Time Warner (the owners of the aforementioned Warner Bros.) in 2001, the value of AOL has dropped significantly from its $240 billion high. Its subscriber base has seen no quarterly growth since 2002. AOL has since attempted to reposition itself as a content provider similar to companies such as [[Yahoo!]] as opposed to an Internet service provider.
* In 2004 along with the launch of AOL 9.0 Optimized, AOL also made available the option of personalized greetings which would enable the user to hear his or her name while accessing basic functions and mail alerts, or while logging in or out.
* AOL eventually announced plans to offer subscribers classic television programs for free with commercials inserted via its new [[IN2TV]] service. At the time of launch, AOL made available [[Warner Bros. Television]]'s vast library of programs, with ''[[Welcome Back Kotter]]'' as its marquee offering.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
* In 2005, AOL broadcast the [[Live 8]] concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months.
* In 2005, AOL (along with [[Telepictures Productions]]) launched [[TMZ.com]], one of the leading celebrity news and gossip sources on the web. TMZ.com has become known for its quickness to break celebrity news, often accompanied by exclusive videos and photos.
* In 2006, AOL informed its American customers that it would be increasing the price of its [[dial-up access]] to [[United States dollar|$]]25.90. The increase was part of an effort to migrate the service's remaining dial-up users to broadband, as the increased price was the same price they had been charging for monthly [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] access.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.com.com/AOL+hanging+up+on+dial-up+customers/2100-1025_3-6043910.html?tag=nl |title=AOL hanging up on dial-up customers? |last=Mills |first=Elinor |publisher=CNET |accessdate=August 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, AOL has since started offering their services for $9.95 a month for unlimited dial-up access.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://free.aol.com/thenewaol/plan_choice.adp |title=AOL price plans |accessdate=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 3, 2006, AOL announced that it was retiring the full name &quot;America Online&quot;; the official name of the service became &quot;AOL&quot;, and the full name of the TimeWarner subdivision became &quot;AOL, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pr&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1179447,00.html |title=America Online Changes Its Name to AOL |date=2006-04-03 |accessdate=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 2, 2006, AOL announced that they would give away e-mail accounts and software previously available only to its paying customers provided the customer accessed AOL or AOL.com through a non-AOL-owned access method (otherwise known as &quot;third party transit&quot;, &quot;bring your own access&quot;, or &quot;BYOA&quot;).  The move was designed to reduce costs associated with the &quot;Walled Garden&quot; business model by reducing usage of AOL-owned access points and shifting members with high-speed internet access from client-based usage to the more lucrative advertising provider, AOL.com.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The change from paid to free was also designed to slow the rate of members canceling their accounts and defecting to [[Microsoft]] [[Hotmail]], [[Yahoo!]], or other free e-mail providers.  According to AOL CEO Randy Falco, as of December 2007, the conversion rate of accounts from paid access to free access was over 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alleyinsider.com/2007/12/aol-twx-randy-falcos-yearend-love-note-to-aolers.html |title=AOL (TWX): Randy Falco's Year-End Love Note to AOLers |accessdate=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other employees whose groups were due for phase-out as part of the restructuring were informed on October 16, 2007 that they would be kept on until December 14, 2007 to complete any outstanding tasks, after which they would be laid off.  The reduction in force was so large that virtually every conference room within the Dulles complex was reserved for the day as a &quot;Special Purpose Room&quot;, where various aspects of the layoff process were conducted for outgoing employees; remaining employees at Dulles were quick to dub the mass layoff &quot;Bloody Tuesday&quot; in online blogs and news reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOL TWX: Live Layoff Coverage&quot; /&gt; An unspecified number of staff at the former [[Compuserve]] facility in [[Columbus, Ohio]] were also released, as well as the entire [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] Quality Analysis shop, a number of AOL employees working at the former Netscape facility in [[Mountain View, California]], the development team in France, and practically the entire [[Moncton|Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada]] member services call center site. The end result was a near 40% layoff across the board at AOL, including a substantial number of Systems Operations personnel, a significant change from previous layoffs where SysOps employees routinely suffered only minor personnel reductions.  An additional round of layoffs, mostly confined to analysis groups and the staff at AOL Voice Services in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], occurred on December 11 and 12, 2007.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

{{Criticism section|date=September 2009}}

=== Community leaders ===
Prior to mid 2005, AOL used [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers]] called [[AOL Community Leader Program|Community Leaders]], or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries. AOL's use of [[virtual volunteering|remote volunteers]] dated back to the establishment of its [[Quantum Link]] service in 1985. Some community leaders were recruited for content design and maintenance using a proprietary language and interface called [[RAINMAN]], although most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees.

Two former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a class action lawsuit against AOL citing violations of U.S. labor laws in its use of community leaders. The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999 which subsequently was followed by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years old as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion closing their investigation in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;cisn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members citing the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company. Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment. 

In February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a $15 million USD payment. This payment was then divided by one third, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five Million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams then approved by the Courts for distribution. One such charity, The Remote Area Medical Foundation (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of $1.2 million USD for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.

Prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL. Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts and no longer would be given unlimited access without invoice. During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual &quot;strike&quot; or &quot;sit-in&quot; to protest the new charges the community leaders were being asked to now pay. This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in; Row 800. Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved. Quickly following the release of these community leaders was the reinstatement of each one terminated with exception to Williams, which AOL was not willing to review due to the role he played within the cause of the protest. During this time, Williams role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).

=== Billing disputes ===
AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 11 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 13 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.

AOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office.  In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to [[Florida]] consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&amp;compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=2008-01-22 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Account cancellation ===
In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies. The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or &quot;save&quot; subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, consumer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or &quot;save&quot; half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or &quot;save&quot; percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum &quot;save&quot; rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.

Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25 million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&amp;compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=2008-01-22 |publisher=Better Business Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2006, a man named Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=13 June 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13447232/ |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/exclusive/aol-retention-manual-uploaded-in-full-188310.php America Online: AOL Retention Manual Uploaded in Full&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2006, [[Time Warner]] announced that the company would be dissolving AOL's retention centers due to its profits hinging on $1 billion in cost cuts. The company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/aol/timewarner-dissolves-aol-retention-centers-191878.php AOL: TimeWarner Dissolves AOL Retention Centers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct marketing of disks ===
Prior to 2006, AOL was infamous for the unsolicited mass [[direct mail]] of [[CD-ROM]]s and 3½&quot; [[floppy disks]] containing their software. They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic, and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/internet/10/17/aol.discs/ |title=Campaign: Send AOL CDs back |work=CNN.com |author=Rusty Dornin |date=2002-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by many people and led to protest groups.  One such was '''No More AOL CDs''', a web-based effort by two IT workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030423062842/http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/home/aol_discs/ What to do with those AOL CDs], a March 2003 [[CBC News]] article&lt;/ref&gt; to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to AOL.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomore&quot;/&gt;  The website was started in August 2001, and an estimated 410,176 CDs were collected by August 2007 when the project was shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomore&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070820184342/http://www.nomoreaolcds.com/ Internet Archive Wayback Machine 2007 Aug 20 archive of NoMoreAOLCDs.com main page]&lt;/ref&gt; AOL CDs were recognized as #1 on [[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld's]] top ten list of most annoying tech products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/130647/your_top_10_most_annoying_tech_products.html|title=Your Top 10 Most Annoying Tech Products | date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2009-06-26 | publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
* In 2000, AOL was served with an $8 billion lawsuit alleging that its AOL 5.0 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third-party Internet service providers. The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15 million, without admission of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardencitygroup.com/cases/pdf/AOL/AOLNotice.pdf Gardencitygroup.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The AOL software then was given a feature called AOL Dialer, or AOL Connect on Mac OS X. This feature allowed users to connect to the ISP without running the full interface. This allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use, especially if they do not favor the AOL Browser.
* AOL 9.0 was once identified by [[Stopbadware]] as being ''under investigation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol082706 Stopbadware.org]&lt;/ref&gt; for installing additional software without disclosure, and modifying browser preferences, toolbars, and icons. However, as of the release of AOL 9.0 VR (Vista Ready) on 26 January 2007, it was no longer considered badware due to changes AOL made in the software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol90vr StopBadware.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usenet newsgroups ===
When AOL gave clients access to [[Usenet]] in 1993, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: ''alt.aol-sucks''. AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to &quot;Flames and complaints about America Online&quot;. With AOL clients swarming [[Usenet]] newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as [[Eternal September]].

Later, AOL discontinued providing access to Usenet on 25 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betanews.com/article/AOL_Pulls_Plug_on_Newsgroup_Service/1106664611 BetaNews | AOL Pulls Plug on Newsgroup Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access, except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third-party, [[Google Groups]].  AOL then provided community-based [[Internet Forum|message boards]] in lieu of Usenet.

=== Terms of Service (TOS) ===
AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service, known as the [[Terms of Service]] (TOS, also known as Conditions of Service, or COS in the UK).  It is separated into three different sections: ''Member Agreement'', ''Community Guidelines'' and ''Privacy Policy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.channels.aol.com/kjump.adp?articleId=221224 AOL Member Agreement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.aol.co.uk/conditions-of-service/article/20060802090809990001 Conditions of Service - AOL Help&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service.

There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user's conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolwatch.org/censory.htm Aolwatch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?ID=3912 Thetruthseeker.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], The Truth Seeker - Internet Censorship&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fglaysher.com/bahaicensorship/AOLcensorship1.htm Censorship on AOL Late 1998–1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/Censorship/Online_services/?f=aol_secret_tos.manual.txt EFF.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certified e-mail ===
In early 2005, AOL stated its intention to implement a [[certified e-mail]] system called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by [[spam filter]]s.

This decision drew fire from [[MoveOn]], which characterized the program as an &quot;e-mail tax&quot;, and the [[EFF]], which characterized it as a shakedown of non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004398.php | title=AOL, Yahoo and Goodmail: Taxing Your Email for Fun and Profit | author=[[Cindy Cohn]] |publisher=[[EFF]] |date=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A website called Dearaol.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070104175854/http://www.dearaol.com/ |title=Stop AOL's Email Tax |publisher=dearaol.com |accessdate=28 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched, with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL's use of Goodmail.

[[Esther Dyson]] defended the move in a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial saying &quot;I hope Goodmail succeeds, and that it has lots of competition. I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients. Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and EON, they will also be shared with the individual recipients.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/opinion/17dyson.html?ex=1300251600&amp;en=04138dcf8237c907&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |title=You've Got Goodmail | author=[[Esther Dyson|Dyson, Esther]] |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of the antispam and blogging community were broadly critical of moveon.org and the EFF's attempts to characterize this as a &quot;shakedown&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Tim Lee of the [http://www.techliberation.com/archives/038303.php Technology Liberation Front] posted an article that questioned the EFF's adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies.  Lee's article cited a series of discussions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politechbot.com/2006/04/15/debate-over-dearaolcom/ | title = Debate over DearAOL.com between Suresh Ramasubramanian and Danny O'Brien |publisher=politechbot.com |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Declan McCullagh]]'s Politechbot mailing list on this subject between the EFF's Danny O'Brien and antispammer Suresh Ramasubramanian, who has also compared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/eff_use_of_propaganda_karl_rove/ |title=EFF and Its Use of Propaganda: Could Karl Rove do better? Probably |first=Suresh |last=Ramasubramanian |date=May 12, 2006  |publisher=CircleID |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EFF's tactics in opposing Goodmail to tactics used by Republican political strategist [[Karl Rove]]. [[Spamassassin]] developer Justin Mason posted some criticism of the EFF's and Moveon's &quot;going overboard&quot; in their opposition to the scheme.

The dearaol.com campaign lost momentum and disappeared, with the last post to the now defunct dearaol.com blog—&quot;AOL starts the shakedown&quot; being made on 9 May 2006.

[[Comcast]], who also used the service, announced on its website that Goodmail has ceased operations and of as February 4, 2011 they will no longer use the service.&lt;ref&gt;http://security.comcast.net/certifiedemail/?cid=NET_33_1210&amp;fss=certified%20email date=February 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Search data ===
{{Main|AOL search data scandal}}

On August 4, 2006, AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing twenty million search [[Index term|keyword]]s for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period between March 1, 2006 and May 31, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others.  Derivative research, titled [http://www.ir.iit.edu/~abdur/publications/pos-infoscale.pdf ''A Picture of Search''] was published by authors Pass, Chowdhury and Torgeson for [http://www.cs.hku.hk/infoscale06/ The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems].

The data were used by Web sites such as AOLstalker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolstalker.com |title=AOLstalker homepage }}&lt;/ref&gt; for entertainment purposes, where users of AOLstalker are encouraged to judge AOL clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior.

== International versions ==
AOL has several versions of its service for different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corp.aol.com/about-aol/international-sites/ AOL.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online security services ==
AOL's software incarnations have provided different combinations of security features, usually involving [[McAfee]]'s VirusScan and Firewall software.

=== Timeline ===
* In late 2005, AOL released AOL Safety &amp; Security Center, a bundle of McAfee anti-virus, [[Computer Associates|CA]] anti-spyware, and proprietary firewall and phishing protection software. The software was offered free of charge, but only to users with an AOL e-mail address or an AOL My eAddress running Microsoft Windows XP or 2000.
* On June 8, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1201969,00.html AOL Launches Free Software To Improve PC Security For All Internet Users&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; AOL offered a new program called AOL Active Security Monitor. This is a diagnostic tool to check the local PC's security status, and recommends additional security software from AOL or [[Download.com]]. The program rated the computer on a variety of different areas of security and general computer health.
* On August 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.aol.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1025 AOL News and Broadcast Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; AOL released [[AOL Active Virus Shield]]. This software was developed by [[Kaspersky Lab]]. Active Virus Shield software was free and did not require an AOL account, only an internet e-mail address.
* On July 18, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.aol.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1269 AOL News and Broadcast Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; AOL released &quot;[[McAfee VirusScan]] Plus: Special Edition from AOL&quot; (VSP) to its free members, and a premium version, &quot;McAfee Internet Security Suite: Special Edition from AOL&quot; (MIS), to its paid subscribers. These replaced both the &quot;AOL Safety and Security Center&quot; and the now-defunct &quot;AOL Active Virus Shield&quot;. MIS contained all components of VSP plus includes tools like automatic back-up.

== Free services ==
On August 2, 2006, AOL announced a plan to offer &quot;many&quot; of its services free, with or without an AOL Internet connection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* Among the announced plans were '''free email services'''. AOL kept its promise by launching an e-mail service free of cost, and with unlimited storage space.
* AIM (AOL Instant Messenger '''Chat rooms''' were included with the free service, but users were required to verify the age of an account created under the free plan using a credit card. AOL charged $1 to the credit card provided and then immediately refunded the charge.
* '''[http://video.aol.com/ AOL Video]''' featured professional content and allowed users to upload videos as well. The original user-orientated video service was called UnCut Video, but was abandoned.
* '''AOL Local''' comprised its [http://cityguide.aol.com/ CityGuide], [http://yellowpages.aol.com/ Yellow Pages], and [http://local.aol.com/ Local Search] services to help users find local information like restaurants, local events, and directory listings.
* AOL provided free usage of a custom [[domain name]], which it called an '''AOL My eAddress'''. This allowed users to create an e-mail address like 'example@whateveryouwant.com', and allowed up to 100 other addresses to be created. These e-mail accounts could be accessed in a manner similar to other AOL and AIM e-mail accounts.
* '''[[Xdrive (website)|Xdrive]]''' was a service offered by AOL which allowed users to back up their files over the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pogue&quot;&gt;{{cite news

This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.

We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are still alive.
I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are still alive.
Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa
THAT WAS A JOKE.
HAHA. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist.
Look at me still talking
when there's Science to do.
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are still alive.
And believe me I am still alive.
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.

[[Image:Scriptorium.jpg|frame|[[Dionysius Exiguus]] invented ''Anno Domini'' years to [[computus|date Easter]].]]

'''''{{lang|la|Anno Domini}}''''' (abbreviated as '''AD''' or '''A.D.''', sometimes found in the form ''{{lang|la|Anno Domine}}'') and '''Before Christ''' (abbreviated as '''BC''' or '''B.C.''') are designations                                 used to label or number years in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s.  The AD or the Christian  [[calendar era]] is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], with ''AD'' counting years after the start of this [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and ''BC'' denoting years before the start of the epoch.  There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&amp;nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC.  This dating system was devised in 525, but was not widely used until after 800,&lt;ref name=Teresi1997&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm|authorlink=Dick Teresi|first=Dick|last=Teresi|title=Zero|publisher=The Atlantic|date=July 1997}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and even after that, other systems were still widely used throughout Europe.

The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Universal Postal Union]]. Though the Western calendars spread around the world over the past four centuries as a result of western power, in modern times the Gregorian calendar and AD year numbering has been adopted by many non-Western countries with no Christian heritage. It has been adopted for pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation and commercial integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html|author=Eastman, Allan|title=A Month of Sundays|publisher=Date and Time|accessdate=4 May 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also become a basis of scholarly dating.
 
The term ''Anno Domini'' is [[Medieval Latin]], translated as ''In the year of (the/Our) Lord''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Anno%20Domini|title=Anno Domini|encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary|year=2003|publisher= Merriam-Webster|quote=Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord|accessdate=3 February 2008}}

It is sometimes specified more fully as ''Anno Domini Nostri Iesu (Jesu) Christi'' (&quot;In the Year of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;).
Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotquestions.org/BC-AD.html What is the meaning of BC and AD (B.C. and A.D.)?] – ''Got Questions Ministries''. Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., after the death of Jesus. If that were true, the thirty-three or so years of his life would not be in any era.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brians. (n.d.). [http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/ad.html &quot;A.D.&quot;] in [http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/index.html ''Common Errors in English Usage''.] (Washington State University faculty website.) Retrieved 2 February 2010
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Traditionally, [[English language|English]] has copied [[Latin]] usage by placing the abbreviation before the year number for AD.&lt;ref&gt;This convention comes from grammatical usage. ''Anno 500'' means &quot;in the year 500&quot;; ''anno domini 500'' means &quot;in the year 500 of Our Lord&quot;. Just as &quot;500 in the year&quot; is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas &quot;AD 500&quot; preserves syntactic order when translated.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Since BC is not derived from Latin it is placed after the year number (for example: 68&amp;nbsp;BC, but AD&amp;nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}). However, placing the AD after the year number (as in &quot;{{CURRENTYEAR}}&amp;nbsp;AD&quot;) is also becoming common usage.  The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in &quot;fourth century AD&quot; or &quot;second millennium AD&quot; (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.

== History ==
The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]], who used it to [[computus|compute the date]] of the  [[Christian]] [[Easter]] festival, and to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year — he himself stated that the &quot;present year&quot; was &quot;the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]&quot;, which was 525 years &quot;since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus' Incarnation occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred.

:&quot;However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, Olympiad, year of the world, or regnal year of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.&quot;&lt;ref name=BHS/&gt;{{rp|778}}

Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:&lt;ref name=BHS/&gt;{{rp|778–9}}
*In modern times Incarnation is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered Incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity
*The civil, or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August
*There were inaccuracies in the list of consuls
*There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years

=== Birth of Jesus ===
:''See also: [[Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Nativity of Jesus]] and [[Chronology of Jesus#Year of birth|Chronology of Jesus]]''

According to Doggett, &quot;Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Doggett 1992, 579.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Matthew 2:1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Matthew 2:16]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:16|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herod the Great|King Herod the Great]] was alive when [[Chronology of Jesus|Jesus was born]], and ordered the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] in response to his birth. Blackburn and Holford-Strevens fix King Herod's death shortly before [[Passover]] in 4 BC&lt;ref name=BHS/&gt;{{rp|770}}, and say that those who accept the story of the Massacre of the Innocents sometimes associate the star that led the [[Biblical Magi]] with the [[Conjunction (astronomy)|planetary conjunction]] of 15 September 7 BC or [[Comet Halley|Halley's comet]] of 12 BC (less likely since comets were usually considered bad omens); even historians who do not accept the Massacre accept the birth under Herod as a tradition older than the written gospels.&lt;ref name=BHS/&gt;{{rp|776}}

The [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Jesus was conceived during the reign of Herod the Great{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:5}} (''i.e.'', before 4 BC) while also stating that Jesus was born when [[Quirinius|Cyrenius]] (or Quirinius) was the governor of [[Syria]] and carried out the [[Census of Quirinius|census]] of the Roman provinces of Syria and Iudaea.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:1-3}} The Jewish historian [[Josephus]], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (''ca.'' AD 93), indicates that Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6, and that the census occurred sometime between AD 6-7,&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus. [http://books.google.com/books?id=E5dCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=josephus+antiquities+of+the+jews&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 18, Chapters 1-2]. Josephus indicates that the census under Cyrenius (''i.e.'', Quirinius) occurred in the 37th year after Octavian's (''i.e.'', Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus') victory over Marc Antony at Actium, which secular historical records date to September 2, 31 BCE. Therefore 31 BCE + 37 years = 6-7 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; which is incompatible with a conception prior to 4 BC. On this point, Blackburn and Holford-Strevens state that &quot;St. Luke raises greater difficulty ... Most critics therefore discard Luke&quot;. Some scholars rely on John 8:57&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||John|8:57|KJV|}}&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;thou are not yet fifty years old&quot;, to place Christ's birth c. 18 BC.&lt;ref name=BHS/&gt;{{rp|776}}

=== Popularization ===
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]], who was familiar with the work of [[Dionysius Exiguus]], used Anno Domini dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', finished in 731. In this same history he also used another [[Latin]] term, &quot;''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus''&quot; (&quot;the time before the Lord's true incarnation&quot;), equivalent to the [[English language|English]] &quot;before Christ&quot;, to identify years before the first year of this era,&lt;ref&gt;Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.&lt;/ref&gt;
thus establishing the standard of not using a [[year zero]],&lt;ref&gt;Compare Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence, with Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; even though he used zero in his [[computus]]. Both Dionysius and Bede regarded Anno Domini as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but &quot;the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25&quot; (''Annunciation style'').&lt;ref name=BHS/&gt;{{rp|881}}

On the continent of [[Europe]], Anno Domini was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by [[Alcuin]]. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings|his successors]] popularizing the usage of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[pope]]s continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in [[Roman Catholic]] countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;Gerard, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when [[Russia]] did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Even though Anno Domini was in widespread use by the 9th century, Before Christ (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression &quot;''anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam''&quot; (before the Incarnation of the Lord) twice. &quot;''Anno an xpi nativitate''&quot; (before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. &quot;xpi&quot; is the [[Greek language|Greek]] χρι in Latin letters, which is a cryptic abbreviation for ''christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno christi'' or its cryptic form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios—left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis Pétau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for &quot;Before Christ&quot;) to mark years prior to AD.&lt;ref&gt;

===Change of year===
When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation started replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, different people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, year number changed on different days, which created slightly different styles in chronology:&lt;ref&gt;[http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf C.R. Cheney, ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history'', Cambridge University Press, 1945-2000, pp. 8-14.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* from 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in [[1 BC]]), i.e. from the incarnation of Jesus. That first &quot;Annunciation style&quot; appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called &quot;calculus pisanus&quot; since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.
* from 25 December 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in [[1 BC]]), i.e. from the birth of Jesus. It was called &quot;Nativity style&quot; and had been spread by [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] together with the Anno Domini in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the year of Grace from [[Christmas]] was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) till the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany till the second quarter of the 13th century.
* from 25 March 754 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in AD 1). That second &quot;Annunciation style&quot; may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to the one of Pisa, so it got the name of &quot;calculus florentinus&quot;. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1751.
* from Easter, starting in 754 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (AD 1). That &quot;mos gallicanus&quot; bound to a movable feast was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (1165-1180-1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered over England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With those various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101. The Annunciation style also caused a major problem: in some years, there was no Easter, and in other years, that feast was celebrated twice; for example, Easter occurred on 23 March 1504 (i.e. in 1505 for us) and on 12 April 1506, but not in 1505.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/easter/easter_text2a.htm Easter Sunday/Jewish Passover calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other eras===
{{further|[[Calendar era]]}}
During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]]. 

Although the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for all of the years of their reign alongside their regnal years.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this Incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were only used, and are still only used, in [[Ethiopia]], accounting for the eight- or seven-year discrepancy between the Gregorian and the [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the World. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', &quot;year of the world&quot; (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the Christian world. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|''Chronicle'']] used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;

The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]], and is still used officially by the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] church. It also used to be used by the [[Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] {{dn}} church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion]] of Jesus Christ, which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in the occasional medieval manuscript.

== Common Era ==
{{Main|Common Era}}
Anno Domini is sometimes referred to as the Common Era, Christian Era, or Current Era (abbreviated as ''C.E.'' or ''CE''). CE is often preferred by those who desire a term not explicitly related to Christian conceptions of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm|author=Robinson, B.A.|title=Controversy over the use of &quot;CE/BCE&quot; or &quot;AD/BC&quot; dating notation|publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org|date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/magazine/bc-ad-or-bce-ce.html?pagewanted=1|author=William Safire|title=On Language: B.C./A.D. or B.C.E./C.E.?|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|date=17 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that &quot;B.C.E./C.E. …do not presuppose faith in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and hence are more appropriate for [[interfaith dialog]] than the conventional B.C./A.D.&quot; Upon its foundation, the [[Republic of China]] adopted the Western calendar in 1912 and the translated term was 西元 (lit. Western Era). Later, in 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] reiterated the use of the Gregorian calendar and accepted the term ''gōngyuán'' (公元, lit. Common Era).  Regardless of name, the dating scheme remains the same.

==No year zero ==
{{see|0 (year)|Astronomical year numbering|Millennium}}
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]]s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year &quot;0&quot; between them. Because of this, most experts agree that a new century begins in a year with the last digits being &quot;01&quot; (1801, 1901, 2001); new millennia likewise began in 1001 and 2001.  A common misconception is that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.);&lt;ref name=&quot;Teresi1997&quot;/&gt; moreover, this convention  was widely used to celebrate the new millennium in the year 2000.  For computational reasons [[astronomer]]s and the [[ISO 8601]] standard use a time scale ([[astronomical year numbering]]) in which AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc.&lt;ref&gt;To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero).  For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0). [Doggett, 1992, p. 579]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcuin of York''' ({{lang-la|Alcuinus}}) or '''Ealhwine''', nicknamed '''Albinus''' or '''Flaccus''' (730s or 740s – 19 May 804) was an English scholar, [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastic]], poet and teacher from [[York]], [[Northumbria]]. He was born around 735 and became the student of [[Ecgbert (Archbishop of York)|Archbishop Ecgbert]] at York. At the invitation of [[Charlemagne]], he became a leading scholar and teacher at the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian court]], where he remained a figure in the 780s and 790s. He wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. He was made Abbot of Saint Martin's at [[Tours]] in 796, where he remained until his death. &quot;The most learned man anywhere to be found&quot; according to [[Einhard]]'s ''Life of Charlemagne'',&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagn'', §25.&lt;/ref&gt; he is considered among the most important architects of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.

==Biography==
Alcuin of York had a long career as a teacher and scholar, first at the school at York founded in AD 627 (now known as [[St Peter's School, York]]) and later as [[Charlemagne]]'s leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational matters. From 796 until his death he was Abbot of the great monastery of St. Martin of [[Tours]].

The majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. There are also autobiographical sections in Alcuin's poem on York and in the ''Vita Alcuini'', a ''[[hagiography|Life]]'' written for him at Ferrières in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils.

===Background===
Alcuin was born in [[Northumbria]], presumably sometime in the 740s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullough, Alcuin, p. 164&quot;&gt;Bullough, ''Alcuin'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullough, Alcuin, p. 164&quot;/&gt; In common hagiographical fashion, the ''Vita Alcuini'' asserts that Alcuin was 'of noble English stock,' and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils, father of the missionary saint [[Willibrord]]; and Beornred, abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens, who was more distantly related. In his ''Life'' of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a ''paterfamilias'', had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the [[Humber]], which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing, ''paterfamilias'' (&quot;head of a family, householder&quot;) usually referred to a [[ceorl]], [[Donald A. Bullough]] suggests that Alcuin's family was of [[churl|cierlisc]] status: ''i.e.,'' free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Alcuin'', pp. 146-7, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, &quot;Alcuin.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as [[Deira]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Alcuin'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===York===
The young Alcuin came to the [[cathedral church]] of [[York]] during the golden age of Archbishop [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Ecgbert]] and Northumbrian King [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]. Egbert had been a disciple of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]], who urged him to raise York to an [[archbishopric]]. King Eadbert and his brother Egbert oversaw the re-energising and re-organisation of the [[History of the Church of England|English church]], with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Egbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage. It was in York that Alcuin formed his love of classical poetry, though he was sometimes troubled by the fact that it was written by non-Christians.

The York school was renowned as a centre of learning, in the liberal arts, literature and science as well as in religious matters.&lt;ref name=RenewAmerica&gt;{{cite web | title=A cure for the educational crisis: Learn from the extraordinary educational heritage of the West | work=RenewAmerica analyst | url=http://www.renewamerica.us/analyses/060601hutchison.htm|accessdate=2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from here that Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the [[Franks|Frankish]] court. He revived the school with the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] disciplines. He wrote a [[codex]] on the trivium and his student [[Rabanus Maurus|Hraban]] wrote one on the quadrivium.&lt;ref name=RenewAmerica /&gt;

Alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]], began after [[Ethelbert of York|Aelbert]] became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time Alcuin became a [[deacon]] in the church. He was never ordained as a priest and there is no real evidence that he became an actual monk, but he lived his life as one.

In 781, King [[Ælfwald I of Northumbria|Elfwald]] sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York’s status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, [[Eanbald I]]. On his way home he again met Charlemagne, this time in the Italian city of [[Parma]].

===Charlemagne===
Alcuin's love of the church and his intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars that Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], [[Rado]] and [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. Alcuin would later write that &quot;the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles.&quot;

He was welcomed at the [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Palace]] School of Charlemagne in [[Aachen]] (''Urbs Regale'') in 782. It had been founded by the king’s ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the [[liberal arts]] and, most importantly, the study of the religion that he held sacred. From 782-790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pepin]] and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], the young men sent to be educated at court and the young clerics attached to the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]]. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionized the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.

In this role as adviser, he tackled the emperor over his policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, &quot;Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe.&quot; His arguments seem to have prevailed - Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Dr. N.R., ''Two Thousand Years of Christ’s Power, Part Two: The Middle Ages'', Grace Publications, 2000, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne was a master at gathering the best men of every land in his court. He himself became far more than just the king at the center. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king [[David (biblical king)|David]]. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, to whom he gave nicknames to be used for work and play.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'.

Alcuin’s friendships also extended to the ladies of the court, especially the queen mother and the king's daughters. His relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him. Modern commentators,&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality''&lt;/ref&gt; have identified the homo-erotic tone of some of Alcuin's poetry, emphasising the spiritual and idealistic aspects of his love for his friends and his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;David Bromell in ''Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History'', London, 2000 (Ed. Wotherspoon and Aldrich)&lt;/ref&gt; While at [[Aachen]], his pupils were given pet names, derived from classical allusions (mainly from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'').

===Return to Northumbria and back to Francia===
In 790 Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to his own country, to which he had always been greatly attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] heresy which was at that time making great progress in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the old capital of the [[Visigoths]] and still a major city for the Christians under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule in Spain]]. He is believed to have had contacts with [[Beatus of Liébana]], from the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], who fought against Adoptionism. At the [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine and obtained the condemnation of the heresiarch [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]]. Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King [[Æthelred I of Northumbria|Æthelred]] in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home. 

He was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid 792, writing a series of letters to Æthelred, to [[Hygbald]], Bishop of [[Lindisfarne]], and [[Æthelhard]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the succeeding months, which dealt with the [[Viking]] attack on Lindisfarne in July 792. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject ''De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii'' provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. 

In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote:- &quot;''Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of [[St Cuthbert]], splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments''.&quot;

===Tours and death===
In 796 Alcuin was in his sixties. He hoped to be free from court duties and was given the chance upon the death of Abbot Itherius of [[Saint Martin at Tours]], when Charlemagne put [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)|Marmoutier Abbey]] into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel.
&lt;!--Mention John Boswell.--&gt;

Alcuin died on 19 May 804, some ten years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin’s Church under an epitaph that partly read:
{{quote|Dust, worms, and ashes now...&lt;br /&gt; Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved,&lt;br /&gt; Pray, reader, for my soul.}}

==Carolingian Renaissance figure and legacy==
===Literary influence===
Alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful [[calligraphy]], the [[Carolingian minuscule]] based on round and legible [[uncial]] letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to [[Arno of Salzburg|Arno, bishop of Salzburg]] and above all to [[Charlemagne]]. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of [[humanism]] during the [[Carolingian]] age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died.

Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of [[Theodulf of Orléans|Theodulf, the Visigoth]] is preponderant.

We owe to him, too, manuals used in his educational work - a [[grammar]] and works on [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]]. They are written in the form of [[dialogues]] and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several [[theological]] treatises: a ''De fide Trinitatis'', commentaries on the [[Bible]], etc.

Alcuin transmitted to the [[Franks]] the knowledge of Latin culture which had existed in Ango-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. His letters and his poetry are equally interesting. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [[Venantius Fortunatus]], he wrote some long poems and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae''.

===Alcuin as a mathematician===
{{Main|Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes}}
The textbook ''Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes''&lt;ref name=&quot;propositiones&quot;&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/X/LAT0602.HTM The first few problems of Alcuin's on original Latin] (English: ''Problems to sharpen the young'',  proper title ''Propositiones Alcuini Doctoris Caroli Magni Imperatoris ad Acuendes Juvenes''—{{lang-en|Propositions of Alcuin, A Teacher of Emperor Charlemagne, for Sharpening Youths}})&lt;/ref&gt; is usually attributed to Alcuin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson-2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_11_21_05.html Ivars Peterson's MathTrek Nov 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson-2005&quot;&gt;Atkinson, L. 2005. 'When the Pope was a mathematician'. ''College Mathematics Journal'' '''36''' (November): 354-362&lt;/ref&gt;
It contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve [[river crossing problem|river crossings]], including the [[problem of three jealous husbands]], each of whom can't let another man be alone with his wife&lt;ref name=&quot;3-jealous-husbands&quot;&gt;[http://www.tan-gram.de/alkuin.pl Animation of the problem of the three jealous husbands (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; (Problem 17); the [[Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle|problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage]] (Problem 18); and the problem of &quot;the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults&quot; (Problem 19).

==Legacy==

In several churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], Alcuin is celebrated on [[20 May]], the first available day after the day of his death (as [[Dunstan]] is celebrated on [[19 May]]).

[[Alcuin College]], one of the colleges of the [[University of York]], England, is named after him.

Saint '''Angilbert''' (died 18 February 814) was a [[Franks|Frank]] who served [[Charlemagne]] as a diplomat, abbot, poet and semi-son-in-law. He was of noble Frankish parentage, and educated at the palace school in ''Aquae Grani'' ([[Aachen]]) under [[Alcuin]]. He is [[Calendar of saints|venerated]] as a [[saint]], on the day of his death—18 February.

When Charlemagne sent his young son [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]] to Italy as King of the [[Lombards]] Angilbert went along as ''primicerius palatii,'' a high administrator of the satellite court. As the friend and adviser of Pepin, he assisted for a while in the government of Italy. Angilbert delivered the document on [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]] from the Frankish Synod of Frankfurt to [[Pope Adrian I]], and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794 and 796.

In 790 he was named abbot of Centulum, also called ''Sancti Richarii monasterium'' ([[Saint-Riquier]]) in northern France, where his brilliant rule gained for him later the renown of a saint.  It was not uncommon for the [[Merovingian]], [[Carolingian]], or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries;  the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation.  Angilbert, in contrast, spent a great deal rebuilding Saint-Riquier, and when he completed it Charlemagne spent Easter of the year 800 there.

Angilbert's non-sacramental relationship with Bertha was evidently recognized by the court – if she had not been the daughter of the King historians might refer to her as his ''concubine.''  They had at least two sons, one of whom, [[Nithard]], became a notable figure in the mid-9th century.  Control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the [[Middle Ages]].  Bertha and Angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices.

His poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family. He accompanied Charlemagne to Rome in 800 and was one of the witnesses to his will in 814. Angilbert was the [[Homer]] of the emperor's literary circle, and was the probable author of an [[epic poetry|epic]], of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between Charlemagne and Leo III. It is a mosaic from [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] and [[Venantius Fortunatus]], composed in the manner of Einhard's use of Suetonius, and exhibits a true poetic gift. Of the shorter poems, besides the greeting to Pippin on his return from the campaign against the [[European Avars|Avars]] (796), an epistle to David (Charlemagne) incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. The reference to Bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation.

Angilbert's poems have been published by [[E. Dummler]] in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''. For criticisms of this edition see [[Traube]] in ''Roederer's Schriften für germanische Philologie'' (1888). See also [[A. Molinier]], ''Les Sources de l'histoire de France''.

'''Amines''' are [[organic compound]]s and [[functional group]]s that contain a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[nitrogen]] [[atom]] with a [[lone pair]]. Amines are [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s of [[ammonia]], wherein one or more [[hydrogen]] atoms have been replaced by a [[substituent]] such as an [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{McMurray3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important amines include [[amino acid]]s, [[biogenic amine]]s, [[trimethylamine]], and [[aniline]]; see [[:Category:Amines]] for a list of amines.  [[Inorganic]] derivatives of [[ammonia]] are also called amines, such as chloramine (NClH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Compounds with the nitrogen atom attached to a [[carbonyl]] of the structure R-C(=O)NR'R'‌' are called [[amide]]s and have different chemical properties from amines.

==Classes of amines==
=== Aliphatic amines ===
Primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an [[alkyl]]. Important primary alkyl amines include [[methylamine]], [[ethanolamine]] (2-aminoethanol), and the [[buffering agent]] [[tris]]).  Secondary amines have two alkyl substituents bound to N together with one hydrogen. Important representatives include [[dimethylamine]] and [[methylethanolamine]].
In tertiary amines, all three hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic substituents. Examples include [[trimethylamine]], a distinctively fishy smell.  [[Cyclic compound|Cyclic]] amines are either secondary or tertiary amines.  Examples of cyclic amines include the 3-member ring [[aziridine]] and the six-membered ring [[piperidine]].  N-methylpiperidine is a cyclic tertiary amine.  It is also possible to have four alkyl substituents on the nitrogen. These compounds are not amines but are called [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s, have a charged nitrogen center, and necessarily come with an anion.

=== Aromatic amines ===
{{main|Aromatic amine}}
Aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an [[aromatic]] ring as in [[aniline]]s. The aromatic ring decreases the [[base (chemistry)|alkalinity]] of the amine, depending on its substituents. The presence of an amine group strongly increases the reactivity of the aromatic ring, due to an electron-donating effect.

== Naming conventions ==
Amines are named in several ways. Typically, the compound is given the prefix &quot;amino-&quot; or the suffix: &quot;-amine.&quot;  The prefix &quot;N-&quot; shows substitution on the nitrogen atom. An organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine, triamine, tetraamine and so forth.

Systematic names for some common amines:

| Lower amines are named with the suffix ''-amine''.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Methylamine.png|100px]]&lt;br /&gt;

[[Image:2-amino-pentane.png|150px]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''2-aminopentane'''&lt;br/&gt;(or sometimes: ''pent-2-yl-amine'' or ''pentane-2-amine'')
|}

== Physical properties ==
[[Hydrogen bonding]] significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines.&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the [[boiling point]] of amines is higher than those of the corresponding [[phosphine]]s, but generally lower than those of the corresponding [[alcohol]]s. For example, methylamine and [[ethylamine]] are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohols are liquids.  Gaseous amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive &quot;fishy&quot; smell.

Also reflecting their ability to form hydrogen bonds, most aliphatic amines display some solubility in water. Solubility decreases with the increase in the number of carbon atoms.  Aliphatic amines display significant solubility in organic [[solvent]]s, especially polar organic solvents. Primary amines react with [[ketone]]s such as [[acetone]].

The aromatic amines, such as [[aniline]], have their lone pair electrons [[conjugated system|conjugated]] into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished.  Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water low

[[Image:Inversion of Amine.PNG|200px|right|amine inversion]]

=== Chirality ===
Amines of the type NHRR' and NRR'R&quot; are [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]: the nitrogen atom bears four substituents counting the lone pair. The energy barrier for the [[nitrogen inversion|inversion]] of the stereocenter is relatively low, e.g., ~7 kcal/mol for a trialkylamine. The interconversion of the stereoisomers has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella in to a strong wind. Because of this low barrier, amines such as NHRR' cannot be resolved optically and NRR'R&quot; can only be resolved when the R, R', and R&quot; groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as [[aziridines]]. Quaternary ammonium salts with four distinct groups on the nitrogen are capable of exhibiting optical activity.

=== Properties as bases ===
Like ammonia, amines are [[base (chemistry)|bases]]. Compared to alkali metal hydroxides, amines are weaker (see table for examples of [[conjugate acid]] K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values). The basicity of amines depends on:

# The electronic properties of the substituents (alkyl groups enhance the basicity, aryl groups diminish it).
# [[Steric hindrance]] offered by the groups on nitrogen.
# The degree of solvation of the protonated amine.

The nitrogen atom features a [[lone electron pair]] that can bind H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form an [[ammonium ion]] R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water [[solubility]] of simple amines is largely due to [[hydrogen bonding]] between protons in the water molecules and these lone electron pairs.

: +I effect of [[alkyl]] groups raises the energy of the lone pair of electrons, thus elevating the basicity. Thus the basicity of an amine may be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine. However, there is no strict trend in this regard, as basicity is also governed by other factors mentioned above. Consider the Kb values of the methyl amines given above. The increase in Kb from methylamine to dimethylamine may be attributed to +I effect; however, there is a decrease from dimethylamine to trimethyl amine due to the predominance of steric hindrance offered by the three methyl groups to the approaching [[Bronsted acid|Brönsted acid]].

: -M effect of aromatic ring delocalises the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen into the ring, resulting in decreased basicity. Substituents on the aromatic ring, and their positions relative to the amine group may also considerably alter basicity as seen above.

* The degree of solvation of protonated amines:

|}

In sterically hindered amines, as in the case of trimethylamine, the protonated form is not well-solvated.  For this reason the parent amine is less basic than expected. In the case of aprotic polar solvents (like [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] and [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]]), wherein the extent of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents (like water and methanol), the basicity of amines is almost solely governed by the electronic factors within the molecule.
&lt;!-- the following statement is incorrect or excessively vague: &quot;Protonated ammonia is heavily solvated, making the cation most stable.&quot; --&gt;

== Synthesis ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;

===Alkylation===
The most industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by [[alkylation]] with alcohols:
:ROH  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →   RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
These reactions require catalysts, specialized apparatus, and additional purification measures since the selectivity can be problematic.  Treatment of [[halogenoalkane|Haloalkanes]] with amines give the corresponding alkyl-substituted amine, with the release of a halogen acid, which in turn reacts with the amine product or precursor:
:RX  +  2 R'NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   RR'NH  +  [RR'NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]X
Such reactions, which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Karsten Eller, Erhard Henkes, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut Höke &quot;Amines, Aliphatic&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a02_001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reductive routes===
Via the process of [[hydrogenation]], [[nitrile]]s are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst.  Reactions are sensitive acidic or alkaline conditions, which can cause hydrolysis of -CN group. LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale.  Similarly, LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reduces [[amide]]s to amines.  Many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via [[reductive amination]], which can use either catalytic hydrogenation or stoichiometric reagents.

Aniline and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics. In industry, hydrogen is the preferred reductant, whereas in the laboratory, tin and iron are often employed.

===Specialized methods===
Many laboratory methods exist for the preparation of amines, many of these methods being rather specialized.

== Reactions==
===Alkylation, acylation, and sulfonation===
The dominant reactivity of amines is their [[nucleophilic acyl substitution|nucleophilicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{March4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most primary amines are good [[ligand]]s for metal ions to give [[coordination complex]]es. Amines are alkylated by alkyl halides. [[Acyl chloride]]s and [[acid anhydride]]s react with primary and secondary amines to form [[amide]]s (the &quot;[[Schotten-Baumann reaction]]&quot;).
[[Image:Amide formation from amine.gif|center|Amide formation]]
Similarly, with sulfonyl chlorides, one obtains [[Sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamides]].  This transformation, known as the [[Hinsberg reaction]], is a chemical test for the presence of amines.

Because amines are basic, they neutralize [[acid]]s to form the corresponding [[ammonium salt]]s R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. When formed from carboxylic acids and primary and secondary amines, these salts thermally dehydrate to form the corresponding [[amide]]s.
[[Image:Amine plus Carboxylic Acid.PNG|center|Amine reaction with carboxylic acids]]

===Diazotization===
Amines react with [[nitrous acid]] to give diazonium salts.  The most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as [[aniline]] (&quot;phenylamine&quot;) (Ar = aryl or naphthyl):
:ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HX  →   ArN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Anilines and naphthylamines form more stable [[diazonium]] salts, which can be isolated in the crystalline form.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = &amp;beta;-Naphthylmercuric chloride | author = A. N. Nesmajanow | collvol = 2 | collvolpages = 432 | year = 1943 | prep = cv2p0432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diazonium salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group with anions. For example,  [[cuprous cyanide]] gives the corresponding nitriles:
:ArN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  +  Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  →   ArY  +  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

Aryldiazonium couple with electron-rich aromatic compounds such as a [[phenol]] to form [[azo compound]]s, which are widely used as dyes. The alkyl diazonium salts are of little synthetic importance because the diazonium derivatives are too unstable.

===Conversion to imines===
[[Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution|Imine formation]] is an important reaction. Primary amines react with [[ketone]]s and [[aldehyde]]s to form [[imine]]s. In the case of [[formaldehyde]] (R' = H), these products typically exist as cyclic [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]]s.
: RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  R'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=O  →   R'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NR  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Reduction of these imines gives secondary amines:
: R'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NR + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →    R'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH-NHR

Similarly, secondary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form [[enamine]]s:
: R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH  +  R'(R&quot;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)C=O   →   R&quot;CH=C(NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)R'  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

== Biological activity ==
Amines are ubiquitous in biology. The breakdown of [[amino acid]]s releases amines, famously in the case of decaying fish which smell of [[trimethylamine]]. Many [[neurotransmitter]]s are amines, including [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[histamine]]. [[Protonated]] [[amino group]]s (-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are the most common positively charged moieties in [[protein]]s, specifically in the amino acid [[lysine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1997.1498 Miguel A. Andrade, Sean I. O'Donoghue, Burkhard Rost, Adaptation of protein surfaces to subcellular location, Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 276, Issue 2, 20 February 1998, Pages 517-525, ISSN 0022-2836]&lt;/ref&gt; The anionic polymer [[DNA]] is typically bound to various amine-rich proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. &quot;Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry&quot; 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. ISBN 1-57259-153-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the charged ammonium centers on lysine form [[Salt bridge (protein and supramolecular)|salt bridges]] with [[carboxylate]] groups of other amino acids in [[polypeptide]]s, which influences the three-dimensional structures of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00483a001 Dominant forces in protein folding, Ken A. Dill, Biochemistry 1990 29 (31), 7133-7155 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of amines ==
=== Dyes ===
Primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of [[azo dye]]s. It reacts with nitric(III) acid to form diazonium salt, which can undergo coupling reaction to form azo compound. As azo-compounds are highly coloured, they are widely used in dyeing industries, such as:

* [[Methyl orange]]
* [[Direct brown 138]]
* [[Sunset yellow]] FCF
* [[Ponceau]]

=== Drugs ===
Many drugs are designed to mimic or to interfere with the action of natural amine neurotransmitters, exemplified by the amine drugs:

* [[Chlorpheniramine]] is an antihistamine that helps to relieve allergic disorders due to cold, hay fever, itchy skin, insect bites and stings.
* [[Chlorpromazine]] is a tranquillizer that sedates without inducing sleep. It is used to relieve anxiety, excitement, restlessness or even mental disorder.
* [[Ephedrine]] and [[Phenylephrine]], as amine hydrochlorides, are used as decongestants.
* [[Amphetamine]], [[Methamphetamine]], and [[Methcathinone]] are amines that are listed as controlled substances by the [[Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]].
* [[Amitriptyline]], [[Imipramine]], [[Lofepramine]] and [[Clomipramine]] are [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s and tertiary amines
* [[Nortriptyline]], [[Desipramine]], and [[Amoxapine]] are tricyclic antidepressants and secondary amines
* (The tricyclics are grouped by the nature of the final amine group on the side chain.)
* Serotonin, Melatonin, Psilocibin ....

=== Gas treatment ===
* Aqueous [[monoethanolamine]] (MEA), diglycolamine (DGA), [[diethanolamine]] (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA) and [[N-methyl-diethanolamine|methyldiethanolamine]] (MDEA) are widely used industrially for removing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) from natural gas streams and refinery process streams. They may also be used to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from combustion gases / flue gases and may have potential for abatement of greenhouse gases.

==Safety==
Low molecular weight amines are toxic, and some are easily absorbed through the skin.  Many higher molecular weight amines are highly active biologically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Other uses2|Absolute Zero}}
'''Absolute zero''' is the theoretical [[temperature]] at which [[entropy]] reaches its minimum value. The [[laws of thermodynamics]] state that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means.

A system at absolute zero still possesses [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[zero-point energy]], the energy of its ground state. The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed. However, in the classical interpretation it is zero and the [[thermal energy]] of matter vanishes.

Absolute zero is the null point of any [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale. By international agreement, it is defined as {{gaps|0|K}} on the [[Kelvin]] scale and as −273.15 °C on the [[Celsius]] scale.&lt;ref name=sib2115&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit of thermodynamic temperature (kelvin)|work=SI Brochure, 8th edition|pages=Section 2.1.1.5 |url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|year=1967 |accessdate=2010-03-13}} IMPORTANT: The triple point of water is 0.01 °C, not 0 °C; do not edit Absolute zero to purport 0 K to be −273.16 °C instead of the correct −273.15°C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arora&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; This equates to −459.67 °F on the [[Fahrenheit]] scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;arora&quot; /&gt; Scientists have achieved temperatures very close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits [[Bose–Einstein condensate|quantum effects]] such as [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluid]]ity.

==History==
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero.]]
One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]]. His 1665 ''New Experiments and Observations touching Cold'', articulated the dispute known as the ''primum frigidum''. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four so-called 'elements'), others within water, others air, and some more recently within [[niter|nitre]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. But all of them seemed to agree that, &quot;There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Robert|title=New Experiments and Observations touching Cold|year=1665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limit to the 'degree of cold'===
The question whether there is a limit to the degree of cold possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first attacked by the French physicist [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1702, in connection with his improvements in the air thermometer. In his instrument, temperatures were indicated by the height at which a column of mercury was sustained by a certain mass of air, the volume or &quot;spring&quot; which varied with the heat to which it was exposed. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air in it was reduced to nothing. On the scale he used, the boiling-point of water was marked at +73 and the melting-point of ice at 51, so that the zero of his scale was equivalent to about −240 on the Celsius scale. 

This close approximation to the modern value of −273.15&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;sib2115&quot;/&gt; for the zero of the air-thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who observed that −270&amp;nbsp;°C might be regarded as absolute cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Values of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing-point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. [[John Dalton]] in his ''Chemical Philosophy'' gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted −3000&amp;nbsp;°C as the natural zero of temperature.

===Lord Kelvin's work===
After [[James Prescott Joule|J.P. Joule]] had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature which was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based solely on the fundamental [[laws of thermodynamics]]. It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at −273.15&amp;nbsp;°C, at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Cold|title=Cold|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=Eleventh|year=1911 |publisher=The LoveToKnow Wiki|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Very low temperatures==
[[File:Boomerang nebula.jpg|thumb|right|The rapid expansion of gases leaving the [[Boomerang Nebula]] causes the lowest observed temperature outside a laboratory.]]
The average temperature of the universe due to [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] today is 2.73 K. 

Absolute zero cannot be achieved artificially, although it is possible to reach temperatures close to it through the use of [[cryocoolers]]. [[Laser cooling]] is a technique used to take temperatures to within a billionth of a degree of 0 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmos Online – Verging on absolute zero|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/online/2176/verging-absolute-zero}}&lt;/ref&gt; At very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero, matter exhibits many unusual properties including [[superconductor|superconductivity]], [[superfluid]]ity, and [[Bose-Einstein condensate|Bose-Einstein condensation]]. In order to study such [[phenomenon|phenomena]], scientists have worked to obtain ever lower temperatures. 

* The current world record was set in 1999 at 100 picokelvins by cooling a piece of [[rhodium]] metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ltl.tkk.fi/wiki/LTL/World_record_in_low_temperatures|title = World record in low temperatures|accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In November 2000, [[nuclear spin]] temperatures below 100&amp;nbsp;pK were reported for an experiment at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]'s Low Temperature Lab.

==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==
At temperatures near 0&amp;nbsp;K, nearly all molecular motion ceases and, when [[entropy]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S'', Δ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]]. Pure substances can (ideally) form perfect [[crystal]]s as ''T'' → 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] [[Nernst heat theorem|''heat theorem'']] makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as ''T'' → 0:
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{T \to 0} \Delta S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Third Law of Thermodynamics|Nernst postulate]] identifies the [[isotherm]] T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] the T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature.'' (≈&amp;nbsp;Callen, pp.&amp;nbsp;189–190)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An even stronger assertion is that ''It is impossible by any procedure to reduce the temperature of a system to zero in a finite number of operations.'' (≈&amp;nbsp;Guggenheim, p.&amp;nbsp;157)

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] which have two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of &quot;chemical degeneracy&quot;. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.

Perfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous materials, simply get &quot;frozen in&quot; at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.

Using the [[Peter Debye|Debye]] model, the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/sup&gt;. (Guggenheim, p.&amp;nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&amp;nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated. 

Since the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \,&lt;/math&gt;

thus, as ''T'' decreases, Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' approach each other (so long as Δ''S'' is bounded). [[Experiment]]ally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilbrium]]. If Δ''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition Δ''G''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 may imply that Δ''H''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''Δ''S'' term is large enough.

Moreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. This ensures that Δ''G'' and Δ''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one which evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e. an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&amp;nbsp;186–187)

One model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermions]], have to be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that an electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The [[Fermi temperature]] is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical [[equipartition theorem]] for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.

==Relation with Bose–Einstein condensates==
{{Main|Bose–Einstein condensate}}

[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|250px|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms at a temperature within a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero. Left: just before the appearance of a Bose–Einstein condensate. Center: just after the appearance of the condensate. Right: after further evaporation, leaving a sample of nearly pure condensate.]]
A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a [[state of matter]] of a dilute gas of weakly interacting [[boson]]s confined in an external [[potential]] and cooled to [[temperature]]s very near to absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest [[quantum state]] of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a [[macroscopic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|volume=412|pages=295–299|year=2001|title=Dynamics of collapsing and exploding Bose–Einstein condensates|author=Elizabeth A. Donley ''et al.''|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6844/abs/412295a0.html|pmid=11460153|issue=6844|doi=10.1038/35085500|arxiv = cond-mat/0105019 |bibcode = 2001Natur.412..295D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This state of matter was first predicted by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]] in 1924–25. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the [[quantum statistics]] of light quanta (now called [[photon]]s). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper himself from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, &quot;Einstein: The Life and Times&quot; (Avon Books, 1971) pp.408–9 ISBN 0-380-01159-X&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy years later, the first gaseous [[condensate]] was produced by [[Eric Allin Cornell|Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] in 1995 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]-[[JILA]] lab, using a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms cooled to 170 [[kelvin|nanokelvin]] (nK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = New State of Matter Seen Near Absolute Zero|url=http://physics.nist.gov/News/Update/950724.html|publisher=NIST}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{val|1.7|e=-7|u=K}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Levi|first = Barbara Goss|title = Cornell, Ketterle, and Wieman Share Nobel Prize for Bose–Einstein Condensates|work = Search &amp; Discovery|publisher = Physics Today online| year = 2001|url = http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html|accessdate = 2008-01-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024134547/http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p14.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A record cold temperature of 450&amp;nbsp;±80&amp;nbsp;pK in a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (BEC) of sodium atoms was achieved in 2003 by researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cooling Bose–Einstein Condensates Below 500 Picokelvin'', A. E. Leanhardt ''''et al.'', Science '''301''', 12 Sept. 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;1515&lt;/ref&gt; It's noteworthy that this record's peak emittance black-body wavelength of 6,400 kilometers is roughly the radius of Earth.

==Absolute temperature scales==
Absolute, or [[thermodynamic temperature|thermodynamic]], temperature is conventionally measured in [[kelvin]]s ([[Celsius]]-scaled increments) and in the [[Rankine scale]] ([[Fahrenheit]]-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the &quot;degree&quot;, so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose-Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level.&lt;ref name=&quot;sib2115&quot;/&gt;

==Negative temperatures==
{{Main|Negative temperature}}

Temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]] scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[system (thermodynamics)|system]]s can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvin) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase&quot;/&gt; As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state, so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures.  However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

In [[thermodynamics]], an '''adiabatic process''' or an '''isocaloric process''' is a [[thermodynamic process]] in which the net [[heat]] transfer to or from the working [[fluid]] is zero. Such a process can occur if the container of the system has thermally-insulated walls or the process happens in an extremely short time, so that there is no opportunity for significant heat exchange&lt;ref&gt;http://buphy.bu.edu/~duffy/semester1/c27_process_adiabatic_sim.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The term &quot;adiabatic&quot; literally means impassable&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adiabatic&lt;/ref&gt;, coming from the Greek roots ἀ- (&quot;not&quot;), διὰ- (&quot;through&quot;), and βαῖνειν (&quot;to pass&quot;); this etymology corresponds here to an absence of [[heat transfer]]. Conversely, a process that involves heat transfer (addition or loss of heat to the surroundings) is generally called '''diabatic'''.  Although the terms [[adiabatic]] and isocaloric can often be interchanged, adiabatic processes may be considered a subset of [[isocaloric process]]es; the remaining complement subset of isocaloric processes being processes where net heat transfer does not diverge regionally such as in an idealized case with mediums of infinite thermal conductivity or non-existent thermal capacity.

In an adiabatic irreversible process, dQ=0 is not equal to TdS (TdS&gt;0). dQ=TdS=0 holds for reversible processes only.
For example, an '''adiabatic boundary''' is a boundary that is impermeable to heat transfer and the system is said to be adiabatically (or thermally) insulated; an insulated wall approximates an adiabatic boundary. Another example is the [[adiabatic flame temperature]], which is the temperature that would be achieved by a [[fire|flame]] in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings. An adiabatic process that is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] is also called an [[isentropic process]].  Additionally, an adiabatic process that is irreversible and extracts no work is in an [[isenthalpic]] process, such as viscous drag, progressing towards a nonnegative change in entropy.

One opposite extreme&amp;mdash;allowing heat transfer with the surroundings, causing the temperature to remain constant&amp;mdash;is known as an [[isothermal process]]. Since temperature is thermodynamically [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to [[entropy]], the isothermal process is conjugate to the adiabatic process for reversible transformations.

A transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered adiabatic when it is quick enough that no significant heat is transferred between the system and the outside. At the opposite extreme, a transformation of a thermodynamic system can be considered isothermal if it is slow enough so that the system's temperature remains constant by heat exchange with the outside.

==Adiabatic heating and cooling==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Water]] --&gt;
Adiabatic changes in temperature occur due to changes in [[pressure]] of a [[gas]] while not adding or subtracting any [[heat]]. In contrast, [[free expansion]] is an [[isothermal]] process for an ideal gas.

'''Adiabatic heating''' occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g. a [[piston]].  [[Diesel engines]] rely on adiabatic heating during their compression stroke to elevate the temperature sufficiently to ignite the fuel.

Adiabatic heating also occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] when an [[air mass]] descends, for example, in a [[katabatic wind]] or [[Foehn wind]] flowing downhill. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases, thus increasing the internal energy.

'''Adiabatic cooling''' occurs when the pressure of a substance is decreased as it does work on its surroundings. Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is [[adiabatic demagnetization|adiabatic demagnetisation]], where the change in [[magnetic field]] on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] with [[orographic lifting]] and [[lee waves]], and this can form [[Pileus (meteorology)|pileus]] or [[lenticular cloud]]s if the air is cooled below the [[dew point]]. Also, the contents of an [[expanding universe]] (to first order) can be described as an adiabatically cooling fluid. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air decreases, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls and internal energy decreases.

Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption.

Such temperature changes can be quantified using the [[ideal gas law]], or the [[hydrostatic equation]] for atmospheric processes.

No process is truly adiabatic.  Many processes are close to adiabatic and can be easily approximated by using an adiabatic assumption, but there is always some heat loss; as no perfect insulators exist.

==Ideal gas (reversible process)==
{{main|Reversible adiabatic process}}
{{Technical|date=September 2010}}

[[Image:Adiabatic.svg|thumb|341px|For a simple substance, during an adiabatic process in which the volume increases, the [[internal energy]] of the working substance must decrease]]
The mathematical equation for an [[ideal gas]] undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process is
: &lt;math&gt; P V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} \qquad &lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is specific or molar volume, and
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma = {C_{P} \over C_{V}} = \frac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha}, &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C_{P} &lt;/math&gt; being the [[specific heat]] for constant pressure,
&lt;math&gt; C_{V} &lt;/math&gt; being the specific heat for constant volume, γ is the [[adiabatic index]], and &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] divided by 2 (3/2 for monatomic gas, 5/2 for diatomic gas). &lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/adiab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For a monatomic ideal gas, &lt;math&gt; \gamma = 5/3 \,&lt;/math&gt;, and for a diatomic gas (such as [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], the main components of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]) &lt;math&gt; \gamma = 7/5 \,&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the above formula is  only applicable to classical ideal gases and not [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose-Einstein]] or [[Fermionic condensate|Fermi gases]].

For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that

: &lt;math&gt; P^{1-\gamma}T^{\gamma}= \operatorname{constant}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; VT^\alpha = \operatorname{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is an absolute temperature.

This can also be written as

: &lt;math&gt; TV^{\gamma - 1} = \operatorname{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

===Example of adiabatic compression===

Let's now look at a common example of adiabatic compression- the compression stroke in a [[gasoline engine]].  We will make a few simplifying assumptions: that the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is 1000cc's (one liter), that the gas within is nearly pure nitrogen (thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; = 7/5), and that the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1000 cc volume of uncompressed gas will compress down to 100 cc when the piston goes from bottom to top).  The uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 degC or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar ~ 100,000 Pa, or about 14.7 PSI, or typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).

&lt;math&gt; P V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} = 100,000 \operatorname{pa} * 1000^{7/5} = 100 \times 10^3 * 15.8 \times 10^3 = 1.58 \times 10^9 &lt;/math&gt;

so our adiabatic constant for this experiment is about 1.58 billion.

The gas is now compressed to a 100cc volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas).  The new volume is 100 ccs, but the constant for this experiment is still 1.58 billion:

&lt;math&gt; P * V^{\gamma} = \operatorname{constant} = 1.58 \times 10^9 = P * 100^{7/5} &lt;/math&gt;

so solving for P:

&lt;math&gt; P = 1.58 \times 10^9 / {100^{7/5}} = 1.58 \times 10^9 / 630.9 =  2.50 \times 10^6 \operatorname{ pa} &lt;/math&gt; 

or about 362 PSI or 24.5 atm.  Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas has also heated the gas and the hotter gas will have a greater pressure even if the volume had not changed.   

We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law.
Our initial conditions are 100,000 pa of pressure, 1000 cc volume, and 300 K of temperature, so our experimental constant is:

&lt;math&gt; {P V \over T} = \operatorname {constant} = {{ 10^5 * 10^3 } \over {300} } = 3.33 \times 10^5 &lt;/math&gt;

We know the compressed gas has V = 100 cc and P = 2.50E6 pascals, so we can solve for temperature by simple algebra:

&lt;math&gt; {P V \over {\operatorname{constant}}} = T = {{2.50 \times 10^6 * 100} \over {3.33 \times 10^5}} = 751 &lt;/math&gt; 

That's 751 Kelvins, or 477 °C, or 892 °F.  This is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause [[engine knocking]] when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a [[supercharger]] and [[intercooler]] to provide a lower temperature at the same pressure would be advantageous.  A [[diesel engine]] operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature which insures immediate ignition of injected fuel.

===Adiabatic Free Expansion of a Gas===

For an adiabatic free expansion process, the gas is contained in an insulated container and a vacuum. The gas is then let to expand in the vacuum. The work done by or on the system is zero, because the volume of the container does not change. The First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.

===Derivation of continuous formula===
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, &lt;math&gt;\delta Q=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then, according to the [[first law of thermodynamics]],

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(1)} \qquad d U + \delta W = \delta Q = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''dU'' is the change in the internal energy of the system and ''δW'' is work done
''by'' the system.  Any work (''δW'') done must be done at the expense of internal energy ''U'', since no heat ''δQ'' is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure-volume work ''δW'' done ''by'' the system is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(2)} \qquad \delta W = P \, dV. &lt;/math&gt;

However, ''P'' does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but
instead changes along with ''V''.

It is desired to know how the values of ''dP'' and
''dV'' relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds.
For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(3)} \qquad U = \alpha n R T, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]] and ''n'' is the
number of moles in the system (a constant).

Differentiating Equation (3) and use of the [[ideal gas law]], &lt;math&gt;P V = n R T&lt;/math&gt;, yields

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(4)} \qquad d U = \alpha n R \, dT
                  = \alpha \, d (P V)
                  = \alpha (P \, dV + V \, dP). &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (4) is often expressed as &lt;math&gt; d U = n C_{V} \, d T &lt;/math&gt;
because &lt;math&gt; C_{V} = \alpha R &lt;/math&gt;.

Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain

: &lt;math&gt; -P \, dV = \alpha P \, dV + \alpha V \, dP,&lt;/math&gt;

simplify:

: &lt;math&gt; - (\alpha + 1) P \, dV = \alpha V \, dP,&lt;/math&gt;

and divide both sides by ''PV'':

: &lt;math&gt; -(\alpha + 1) {d V \over V} = \alpha {d P \over P}. &lt;/math&gt;

After integrating the left and right sides from &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; to V and from &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; to P and changing the sides respectively,

: &lt;math&gt; \ln \left( {P \over P_0} \right)
= {-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}} \ln \left( {V \over V_0} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiate both sides,

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right)
=
\left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{-{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}},  &lt;/math&gt;

and eliminate the negative sign to obtain

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right)
=
\left( {V_0 \over V} \right)^{\alpha + 1 \over \alpha}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt; \left( {P \over P_0} \right) \left( {V \over V_0} \right)^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; P V^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P_0 V_0^{\alpha+1 \over \alpha} = P V^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation of discrete formula===

The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(1)} \qquad \Delta U = \alpha R n_2T_2 - \alpha R n_1T_1 = \alpha R (n_2T_2 - n_1T_1) &lt;/math&gt;

At the same time, the work done by the pressure-volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(2)} \qquad W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}P\, dV &lt;/math&gt;

Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(3)} \qquad \Delta U + W = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

By the previous derivation,

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(4)} \qquad P V^\gamma = \text{constant} = P_1 V_1^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging (4) gives

:&lt;math&gt; P = P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into (2) gives

:&lt;math&gt; W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma\, dV &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating,

:&lt;math&gt; W = P_1 V_1^\gamma \frac{V_2^{1-\gamma}-V_1^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; W = - \alpha P_1 V_1^{\gamma} \left( V_2^{1-\gamma} - V_1^{1-\gamma} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging,

:&lt;math&gt; W = - \alpha P_1 V_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases),

:&lt;math&gt; W = - \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

By the continuous formula,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_2}{P_1}=\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{-\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

Or,

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{-1 \over \gamma}=\frac{V_2}{V_1} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the previous expression for &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; W = - \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this expression and (1) in (3) gives

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha n R (T_2 - T_1) = \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying,

:&lt;math&gt; T_2 - T_1 =  T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{T_2}{T_1}-1 =  \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying,

:&lt;math&gt; T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Graphing adiabats==
An adiabat is a curve of constant [[entropy]] on the P-V diagram. Properties of adiabats on a P-V diagram are:
#Every adiabat [[Asymptote|asymptotically approaches]] both the V axis and the P axis (just like [[isotherms]]).
#Each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once.
#An adiabat looks similar to an isotherm, except that during an expansion, an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm, so it has a steeper inclination (more vertical).
#If isotherms are concave towards the &quot;north-east&quot; direction (45 °), then adiabats are concave towards the &quot;east north-east&quot; (31 °).
#If adiabats and isotherms are graphed severally at regular changes of entropy and temperature, respectively (like altitude on a contour map), then as the eye moves towards the axes (towards the south-west), it sees the density of isotherms stay constant, but it sees the density of adiabats grow.  The exception is very near absolute zero, where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare (see [[Nernst's theorem]]).

The following diagram is a P-V diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms:

[[Image:Entropyandtemp.PNG]]

The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.

The adiabats are isentropic.

Volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.

[[Image:Formamide-MO-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|180px|Amides possess a [[conjugated system]] spread over the O, C and N atoms, consisting of [[molecular orbital]]s occupied by [[delocalized electron]]s.  One of the [[pi bond|''π'' molecular orbitals]] in [[formamide]] is shown above.]]
In [[chemistry]], an '''amide''' is an [[organic compounds|organic compound]] that contains the [[functional group]] consisting of a [[carbonyl]] group (R-C=O) linked to a nitrogen atom ([[Nitrogen|N]]).  The term refers both to a class of compounds and a functional group within those compounds. The term ''amide'' also refers to [[deprotonated]] form of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or an [[amine]], often represented as anions R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. The remainder of this article is about the [[carbonyl]]-[[nitrogen]] sense of ''amide''.  For discussion of these &quot;[[anionic]] amides,&quot; see the articles [[sodium amide]] and [[lithium diisopropylamide]].

==Structure and bonding==
The simplest amides are derivatives of ammonia wherein one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an acyl group.  The ensemble is generally represented as RC(O)NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Closely related and even more numerous are amides derived from primary amines (R'NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with the formula RC(O)NHR'.  Amides are also commonly derived from [[secondary amine]]s (R'R''NH) with the formula RC(O)NR'R''.   Amide are usually regarded as derivatives of [[carboxylic acid]]s in which the [[hydroxyl]] group has been replaced by an amine or ammonia.
:[[Image:AmideResonance.png|300px|Amide resonance:]]
The lone pair of [[electron]]s on the [[nitrogen]] is delocalized into the carbonyl, thus forming a partial [[double bond]] between N and the [[carbonyl]] [[carbon]]. Consequently the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal.  It is estimated that acetamide is described by [[resonance structure]] A for 62% and by B for 28%&lt;ref name = Kemnitz&gt;''&quot;Amide Resonance&quot; Correlates with a Breadth of C-N Rotation Barriers'' Carl R.

==Nomenclature==
{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Amines and Amides}}
In the usual nomenclature, one adds the term &quot;amide&quot; to the stem of the parent acid's name. Thus, the simplest amide derived from acetic acid is named [[acetamide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  IUPAC recommends [[ethanamide]], but this and related formal names are rarely encountered.  When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substitutents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name.   Thus the amide formed from [[dimethylamine]] and acetic acid is ''N,N''-dimethylacetamide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where Me = CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  Usually even this name is simplified to [[dimethylacetamide]]. Cyclic amides are called [[lactam]]s; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides.  Functional groups consisting of -P(O)NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and -SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[phosphonamides]] and [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]]s, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-821. Amides http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_540.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--kinda specialized: Compounds in which a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]] on [[nitrogen]] from [[ammonia]] or an [[amine]] is replaced by a [[metal]] [[cation]] are also known as amides or '''azanides'''.--&gt;

===Pronunciation===
Some chemists make a pronunciation distinction between the two, saying {{IPA-en|əˈmiːd|}} for the [[carbonyl]]-[[nitrogen]] compound and {{IPA-en|ˈæmaɪd||En-uk-amide.ogg}} for the [[anion]]. Others substitute one of these with {{IPA|/ˈæmɨd/}}, while still others pronounce both {{IPA|/ˈæmɨd/}}, making them [[homonym]]s.

==Properties==
===Basicity===
Compared to [[amine]]s, amides are very weak [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s. While the [[conjugate acid]] of an [[amine]] has a [[pKa]] of about 9.5, the [[conjugate acid]] of an amide has a pKa around -0.5. Therefore amides don't have as clearly noticeable [[acid-base]] properties in [[water]]. This lack of basicity is explained by the [[electron]]-withdrawing nature of the [[carbonyl group]] where the lone pair of [[electron]]s on the [[nitrogen]] is delocalized by [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]].  On the other hand, amides are much stronger [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s than [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[ester]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s (conjugated acid pKa between -6 and -10). It is estimated  [[in silico]] that [[acetamide]] is represented by [[resonance structure]] A for 62% and by B for 28%.&lt;ref name = Kemnitz/&gt; Resonance is largely prevented in the very strained [[quinuclidone]].

Because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N-C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, to a lesser extent a N-C dipole, allows amides to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary amides, the presence of N-H dipoles allows amides to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N-H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.

The proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions; its p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is usually well above 15.  Conversely, under extremely acidic conditions, the carbonyl [[oxygen]] can become protonated with a p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' of roughly -1.

===Solubility===
The solubilities of amides and esters are roughly comparable. Typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds.  Tertiary amides, with the important exception of N,N-dimethylformamide, exhibit low solubility in water.

==Characterization==
The presence of the functional group is generally easily established, at least in small molecules. They are the most common non-basic functional group.  They can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups by their [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]]. Amides exhibit a moderately intense ν&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; band near 1650&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  By &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H [[NMR spectroscopy]], CON''H''R signals occur at low fields.  In X-ray crystallography, the C(O)N center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane.

==Applications and occurrence==
Amides are pervasive in nature and technology as structural materials. The amide linkage is easily formed, confers structural rigidity, and resists [[hydrolysis]].  Nylons are polyamides as are the very resilient materials [[Aramid]], [[Twaron]], and [[Kevlar]].  Amide linkages in a [[biochemistry|biochemical]] context are called [[peptide link]]ages.  Amide linkages constitute a defining molecular feature of [[protein]]s, the [[secondary structure]] of which is due in part to the [[hydrogen bonding]] abilities of amides.  Low molecular weight amides, such as dimethylformamide (HC(O)N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) , are common solvents.  Many drugs are amides, including [[penicillin]] and [[LSD]].

==Amide synthesis==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;
Amides are commonly formed via reactions of a [[carboxylic acid]] with an [[amine]].  Many methods are known for driving the unfavorable equilibrium to the right:
:RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  R'R&quot;NH   &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{\leftarrow}&lt;/math&gt;   RC(O)NR'R&quot;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
For the most part, these reactions involve &quot;activating&quot; the carboxylic acid and the best known method, the [[Schotten-Baumann reaction]], which involves conversion of the acid to the [[acid chloride]]s:

===Other methods===
The seemingly simple direct reaction between an [[alcohol]] and an [[amine]] to an amide was not tried until 2007 when a special [[ruthenium]]-based [[catalyst]] was reported to be effective in a so-called dehydrogenative acylation:&lt;ref&gt;''Direct Synthesis of Amides from Alcohols and Amines with Liberation of H2'' Chidambaram Gunanathan, Yehoshoa Ben-David, [[David Milstein]] Science 10 August 2007: Vol. 317. no. 5839, pp. 790 - 792 {{DOI|10.1126/science.1145295}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[Image:DehydrogenativeAmidation.svg|500px|Synthesis of Amides from Alcohols and Amines with Liberation of H2]]
:The generation of hydrogen gas compensates for unfavorable thermodynamics. The reaction is believed to proceed by one dehydrogenation of the alcohol to the [[aldehyde]] followed by formation of a [[hemiaminal]] and the after a second dehydrogenation to the amide. Elimination of water in the hemiaminal to the imine is not observed.

== Amide reactions ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;
Amides undergo many chemical reactions, usually through an attack on the [[carbonyl]] breaking the carbonyl double bond and forming a tetrahedral intermediate.  [[Thiols]], [[hydroxyls]] and [[amines]] are all known to serve as nucleophiles. Owing to their resonance stabilization, amides are less reactive under physiological conditions than [[ester]]s.  Enzymes, e.g. [[peptidase]]s or artificial catalysts, are known to accelerate the hydrolysis reactions.  They can be hydrolysed in hot [[alkali]], as well as in strong [[acid]]ic conditions. Acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia.  Amides are also versatile precursors to many other [[functional group]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Animism''' (from [[Latin]] ''anima'' &quot;[[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[life]]&quot;)&lt;ref name = &quot;ooviqc&quot;&gt;Segal, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Animism&quot;, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the belief that non-human entities are spiritual beings, or at least embody some kind of life-principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iannone, A. Pablo|chapter=animism|title=Dictionary of world philosophy|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=9780415179959|page=54|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animism encompasses the beliefs that there is no separation between the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[physical]] (or [[material]]) worlds, and [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s or [[spirit]]s exist, not only in [[human]]s, but also in all other [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[rock (geology)|rock]]s, natural phenomena such as [[thunder]], [[geographic]] features such as [[mountain]]s or [[river]]s, or other entities of the natural environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;bob&quot;&gt;&quot;The concept that humans possess souls and that souls have life apart from human bodies before and after death are central to animism, along with the ideas that animals, plants, and celestial bodies have spirits&quot; (Wenner).&lt;/ref&gt; Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, [[true name]]s, or metaphors in [[mythology]]. Animism is particularly widely found in the [[folk religion|religions of indigenous peoples]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird-David-67&quot;&gt;Bird-David, 1999: p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also found in [[Shinto]], and some forms of [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Neopaganism]].

Throughout European history, philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], among others, contemplated the possibility that souls exist in animals, plants, and people; however, the currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the 19th century by [[Sir Edward Tylor]], who created it as &quot;one of [[anthropology]]'s earliest concepts, if not the first&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird-David-67&quot;/&gt;

While having similarities to [[totemism]], animism differs in that it, according to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], focuses on individual spirit beings, which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself, or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups, such as that of the [[Australian Aborigines]], are more typically totemic, whereas others, like the [[Inuit]], are more typically animistic in their worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Tim. (2000). ''Totemism, Animism and the Depiction of Animals'' in ''The Perception of the Environment: Essays on Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill''. London: Routledge. pp. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Edward Burnett Tylor|Sir Edward Tylor]] was responsible for forming the definition of animism currently accepted in anthropology.]]
The term ''animism'' appears to have been first developed as ''animismus'' by German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]], circa 1720, to refer to the &quot;doctrine that animal life is produced by an immaterial soul.&quot; The actual English language form of ''animism'', however, can only be attested to 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Douglas. (2001). http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=animism&lt;/ref&gt; The term was taken and redefined by the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Sir Edward Tylor]] in his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'', in which he defined it as &quot;the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E.B. [http://books.google.com/books?ei=ZHSWTJCnEcL38AbutNWMDA&amp;ct=result&amp;output=text&amp;id=AucLAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=primitive+culture&amp;q=doctine+of+souls#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20doctrine%20of%20souls%20and%20other%20spiritual%20beings%20in%20general%22&amp;f=false Primitive Culture]. London: John Murray, 1871. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious scholar Robert Segal, Tylor saw all religions, &quot;modern and primitive alike&quot;, as forms of animism.&lt;ref name = &quot;ooviqc&quot;/&gt;

According to Tylor, animism often includes &quot;an idea of pervading life and will in nature&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E.B. [http://books.google.com/books?ei=ZHSWTJCnEcL38AbutNWMDA&amp;ct=result&amp;output=text&amp;id=AucLAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=primitive+culture&amp;q=doctine+of+souls#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20doctrine%20of%20souls%20and%20other%20spiritual%20beings%20in%20general%22&amp;f=false Primitive Culture]. London: John Murray, 1871. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. As a self-described &quot;confirmed scientific rationalist&quot;, Tylor believed that this view was &quot;childish&quot; and typical of &quot;cognitive underdevelopment&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Bird-David, 1999: pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was therefore common in &quot;primitive&quot; peoples such as those living in [[hunter gatherer]] societies.

Tylor's definition of animism has since largely been followed by anthropologists, such as [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Tim Ingold]]. However, some anthropologists, such as Nurit Bird-David, have criticised the Tylorian concept of animism, believing it to be outdated.&lt;ref&gt;Bird-David, 1999: {{page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
{{See|anthropology of religion|psychology of religion}}
Animism in the widest sense, i.e., thinking of objects as animate, and treating them as if they were animate, is near-universal.
[[Jean Piaget]] applied the term in [[child psychology]] in reference to an implicit understanding of the world in a child's mind which assumes that all events are the product of intention or consciousness. Piaget explains this with a cognitive inability to distinguish the external world from one's own psyche. [[Developmental psychology]] has since established that the distinction of animate vs. inanimate things is an abstraction acquired by [[learning]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The justification for attributing life to objects was stated by [[David Hume]] in his ''[[The Natural History of Religion|Natural History of Religion]]'' (Section III): &quot;There is a universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object those qualities with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=zp97KA1prvUC&amp;pg=PR19&amp;lpg=PR19&amp;dq=%22There+is+an+universal+tendency+among+mankind+to+conceive+all+beings+like+themselves,+and+to+transfer+to+every+object+those+qualities+with+which+they+are+familiarly+acquainted,+and+of+which+they+are+intimately+conscious%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=HOqvUgffdx&amp;sig=uFjv8xMCN1l3BpJCsDFD5Bzylcg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPR20,M1 The Natural History of Religion. D. Hume. p. xix].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lists of phenomena, from the contemplation of which &quot;the savage&quot; was led to believe in animism, have been given by Sir [[E. B. Tylor]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Andrew Lang]], and others; a controversy arose between the former as to the priority of their respective lists.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Among these phenomena are [[Altered state of consciousness|trance states]], [[dream]]s, and [[hallucination]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Animism and religion==
Animism is a belief held in many religions around the world, and is not, as some have purported, a type of religion in itself. It is a belief, such as [[shamanism]], [[polytheism]] or [[monotheism]], that is found in several religions.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Origin of religion===
Some theories have been put forward that the anthropocentric belief in animism among early humans was the basis for the later evolution of religions. In one such theory, put forward by Sir E. B. Tylor, early humans initially, through mere observation, recognized what might be called a soul, life-force, spirit, breath or animus within themselves; that which was present in the body in life and absent in death. These early humans equated this soul with figures which would appear in dreams and visions. These early human cultures later interpreted these spirits to be present in animals, the living plant world, and even in natural objects in a form of animism. Eventually, these early humans grew to believe that the spirits were invested and interested in human life, and performed rituals to propitiate them. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of “developed” religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced the society, the less that society believed in Animism; however, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented “survivals” of the original animism of early humanity.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===World view===
In many animistic world views found in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Therefore, it is morally imperative to treat these agents with respect. In this world view, humans are considered a part of nature, rather than superior to, or separate from it. In such societies, ritual is considered essential for survival, as it wins the favor of the spirits of one's source of food, shelter, and fertility and wards off malevolent spirits. In more elaborate animistic religions, such as [[Shinto]], there is a greater sense of a special character to humans that sets them apart from the general run of animals and objects, while retaining the necessity of ritual to ensure good luck, favorable harvests, and so on.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Death===
Most animistic belief systems hold that the spirit survives physical death. In some systems{{Which?|date=July 2009}}, the spirit is believed to pass to an easier world of abundant game or ever-ripe crops, while in other systems, the spirit remains on earth as a ghost, often malignant. Still other systems combine these two beliefs, holding that the soul must journey to the spirit world without becoming lost and thus wandering as a ghost (''e.g.'', the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] religion). [[Funeral]], [[mourning]] rituals, and ancestor worship performed by those surviving the deceased are often considered necessary for the successful completion of this journey.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

From the belief in the survival of the dead arose the practice of offering food, lighting fires, etc., at the grave, at first, maybe, as an act of friendship or filial piety, later as an act of [[ancestor worship]]. The simple offering of food or shedding of blood at the grave develops into an elaborate system of [[sacrifice]]. Even where ancestor worship is not found, the desire to provide the dead with comforts in the future life may lead to the sacrifice of wives, slaves, animals, and so on, to the breaking or burning of objects at the grave or to the provision of the [[Charon (mythology)|ferryman's]] toll: a coin put in the mouth of the corpse to pay the traveling expenses of the soul.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

But all is not finished with the passage of the soul to the land of the dead. The soul may return to avenge its death by helping to discover the murderer, or to wreak vengeance for itself. There is a widespread belief that those who die a violent death become malignant spirits and endanger the lives of those who come near the haunted spot. In Malay folklore, the woman who dies in childbirth becomes a [[Pontianak (folklore)|pontianak]], a vampire-like spirit who threatens the life of human beings. People resort to magical or religious means of repelling spiritual dangers from such malignant spirits.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

It is not surprising to find that many peoples respect and even worship animals (see ''[[totem]]'' or ''[[animal worship]]''), often regarding them as relatives. It is clear that widespread respect was paid to animals as the abode of dead ancestors, and much of the [[cult]]s to dangerous animals is traceable to this principle; though there is no need to attribute an animistic origin to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;&quot;Animism&quot;, ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[Shrunken head|head shrinking]] among [[Jivaroan]] and [[Urarina]] peoples derives from an animistic belief that if the spirit of one's mortal enemies, i.e., the nemesis of ones being, are not trapped within the head, they can escape slain bodies. After the spirit [[transmigrates]] to another body, they can take the form of a [[predator]]y animal and even exact revenge.

===Mythology===
A large part of mythology is based upon a belief in souls and spirits — that is, upon animism in its more general sense. [[Urarina]] myths that portray plants, inanimate objects, and non-human animals as personal beings are examples of animism in its more restrictive sense.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida ISBN 978-081303378 [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many mythologies focus largely on corporeal beings rather than &quot;spiritual&quot; ones; the latter may even be entirely absent. Stories of transformation, [[deluge (mythology)|deluge]] and doom myths, and myths of the origin of death do not necessarily have any animistic basis.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

As mythology began to include more numerous and complex ideas about a future life and purely spiritual beings, the overlap between mythology and animism widened. However, a rich mythology does not necessarily depend on a belief in many spiritual beings.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Philosophy===
The term &quot;animism&quot; has been applied to many different philosophical systems. It is used to describe [[Aristotle]]'s view of the relation of soul and body held also by the [[Stoics]] and [[Scholastics]]. On the other hand [[monadology]] ([[Leibniz]]) has also been termed animistic. The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], a view mainly associated with [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] and revived by [[Francisque Bouillier]] (1813–1899), which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that all cannot be traced back to chemical and mechanical processes, but that there is a directive force which guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the world soul (anima mundi), held by [[Plato]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and others.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Distinction from Pantheism===
Animism is not the same as Pantheism, although the two are sometimes confused. Some faiths and religions are even both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In Pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Contemporary animist traditions==
{{See|Folk religion|Shamanism}}

*[[African traditional religions]], a group of beliefs in various spirits of nature, are not commonly described as animistic, yet this fact has for many years been disputed by leading cultural anthropologists.{{Who|date=July 2010}}
*In the [[Canary Islands]] ([[Spain]]), aboriginal [[Guanches]] professed an animistic religion. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*[[Shinto]], the traditional religion of [[Japan]], is highly animistic. In Shinto, spirits of nature, or [[kami]], are believed to exist everywhere, from the major (such as the goddess of the sun), which can be considered [[polytheism|polytheistic]], to the minor, which are more likely to be seen as a form of animism.
*There are some [[Hinduism|Hindu]] groups which may be considered animist. The coastal [[Karnataka]] has a different tradition of praying to spirits. See also [[Folk Hinduism]]
*Many traditional Native American religions are fundamentally animistic. See, for example, the Lakota Sioux prayer [[Mitakuye Oyasin]]. The [[Iroquois|Haudenausaunee]] Thanksgiving Address, which can take an hour to recite, directs thanks towards every being - plant, animal and other.
*The [[New Age]] movement commonly purports animism in the form of the existence of nature spirits and fairies.
*Modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], especially Eco-Pagans,&lt;ref&gt;Adler, p. ??&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} sometimes like to describe themselves as animists, meaning that they respect the diverse community of living beings and spirits with whom humans share the world/cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham, p. ??&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Some [[Wicca]]ns may use the term animist to refer to the idea that a [[Mother Goddess]] and [[Horned God]] consist of everything that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p. ??&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}{{Dubious|date=July 2010}}

[[File:Antonio Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Antonio Vivaldi in 1725]]
[[File:Antonio Vivaldi signature.svg|200px|right]]

'''Antonio Lucio Vivaldi''' (4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741), nicknamed {{lang|it|''il Prete Rosso''}} (&quot;The Red Priest&quot;) because of his red hair, was an Italian [[Baroque music|Baroque]] composer, [[priest]], and [[virtuoso]] [[violin]]ist, born in [[Venice]]. Vivaldi is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread over [[Europe]]. Vivaldi is known mainly for composing instrumental [[concerto]]s, especially for the [[violin]], as well as sacred choral works and over 40 [[operas]]. His best known work is a series of [[violin concerto]]s known as ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''.

Many of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the ''Ospedale della Pietà'', a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi worked between 1703 and 1740.  Vivaldi also had some success with stagings of his operas in Venice, [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]].  After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna hoping for preferment.  The Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and the composer died a pauper, without a steady source of income.

Though Vivaldi's music was well received during his lifetime, it later declined in popularity until its vigorous revival in the first half of the 20th century.  Today, Vivaldi ranks among the most popular and widely recorded Baroque composers.

==Childhood==
[[File:San Giovanni Battista in Bragora Venezia.jpg|right|thumb|The church where Vivaldi was baptised: San Giovanni Battista in Bragora, Sestiere di Castello, Venice.]]

Antonio Lucio Vivaldi was born in [[Venice]], the capital of the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1678. He was [[baptized]] immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, which led to the belief that his life was somehow in danger. Though not known for certain, the immediate baptism was most likely due either to his poor health or to an earthquake that shook the city that day.  In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Vivaldi's official church baptism (the rites that remained other than the baptism itself) did not take place until two months later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1978), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Vivaldi's parents were Giovanni Battista Vivaldi and Camilla Calicchio, as recorded in the register of San Giovanni in Bragora.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, ''Vivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vivaldi had five siblings: Margarita Gabriela, Cecilia Maria, Bonaventura Tomaso, Zanetta Anna, and Francesco Gaetano.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Giovanni Battista, a barber before becoming a professional [[violin]]ist, taught Antonio to play the violin, and then toured Venice playing the violin  with his young son.  He probably taught him at an early age, judging by Vivaldi's extensive musical knowledge at the age of 24 when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni Battista was one of the founders of the ''Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia'', an association of musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1978), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the ''Sovvegno'' was [[Giovanni Legrenzi]], a composer of the early Baroque and ''maestro di cappella'' at [[St. Mark's Basilica]]. It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition.  The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned in the early liturgical work ''Laetatus sum'' ([[Ryom Verzeichnis|RV]] Anh 31, written in 1691 at the age of 13) the influence of Legrenzi's style.  Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled ''La Fedeltà sfortunata'' was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi, and this was the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia:&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Rosso&quot; is Italian for &quot;Red&quot;, and would have referred to the colour of his hair, a family trait.

Vivaldi's health was problematic.  His symptoms, ''strettezza di petto'' (&quot;tightness of the chest&quot;), have been interpreted as a form of asthma.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  This did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing or taking part in musical activities,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; although it did stop him from playing wind instruments. In 1693, at the age of 15, he began studying to become a priest.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, ''Vivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was ordained in 1703, aged 25.  He was soon nicknamed ''il Prete Rosso'', &quot;The Red Priest&quot;, because of his red hair.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not long after his ordination, in 1704, he was given a reprieve from celebrating the [[Holy Mass]] because of his ill health.  Vivaldi only said mass as a priest a few times. He appears to have withdrawn from priestly duties, but he remained a priest. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==At the ''Conservatorio dell'Ospedale della Pietà''==
In September 1703, Vivaldi became ''maestro di violino'' (master of violin) at an [[orphanage]] called the Pio [[Ospedale della Pietà]] (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt; While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as &quot;the famous composer and violinist&quot; and said that &quot;Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, V''ivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà.  Over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; There were four similar institutions in Venice; their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned, or whose families could not support them. They were financed by funds provided by the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached 15. The girls received a musical education, and the most talented stayed and became members of the Ospedale's renowned orchestra and choir.

Shortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too.  Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1704, the position of teacher of ''viola all'inglese'' was added to his duties as violin instructor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, ''Vivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The position of ''maestro di coro'', which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work.  He had to compose an oratorio or concerto at every feast and teach the orphans both music theory and how to play certain instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

His relationship with the board of directors of the Ospedale was often strained. The board had to take a vote every year on whether to keep a teacher. The vote on Vivaldi was seldom unanimous, and went 7 to 6 against him in 1709.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; After a year as a freelance musician, he was recalled by the Ospedale with a unanimous vote in 1711; clearly during his year's absence the board realized the importance of his role.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He became responsible for all of the musical activity of the institution&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; when he was promoted to ''maestro di' concerti'' (music director) in &lt;!-- Was he promoted in 1713 or 1716?  Article apparently stated both --&gt; 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1705, the first collection (''Connor Cassara'') of his works was published by Giuseppe Sala:&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; his Opus 1 is a collection of 12 sonatas for two violins and basso continuo, in a conventional style.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 1709, a second collection of 12 sonatas for violin and basso continuo appeared, his Opus 2.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, ''Vivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; A real breakthrough as a composer came with his first collection of 12 concerti for one, two, and four violins with strings, ''[[L'estro Armonico|L'estro armonico]]'' Opus 3, which was published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1711 by [[Estienne Roger]],&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, ''Vivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to Grand Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany.  The prince sponsored many musicians including Alessandro Scarlatti and Handel.  He was a musician himself, and Vivaldi probably met him in Venice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''L'estro armonico'' was a resounding success all over Europe.  It was followed in 1714 by ''[[La stravaganza]]'' Opus 4, a collection of concerti for solo violin and strings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Talbot 1978&quot;&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to an old violin student of Vivaldi's, the Venetian noble Vettor Dolfin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, Vivaldi (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1711, Vivaldi and his father traveled to [[Brescia]], where his setting of the [[Stabat Mater]] ([[Stabat Mater (Vivaldi)|RV 621]]) was played as part of a religious festival. The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is one of his early masterpieces.

Despite his frequent travels from 1718, the Pietà paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Talbot 1978&quot;/ The Pietà's records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.

==Opera impresario==
[[File:Vivaldis first edition of Juditha triumphnas.jpg|right|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Juditha triumphans''&lt;ref name=&quot;Baroque music&quot;&gt;[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html Baroque Music] ''As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Pietà perform his first great oratorio, Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric. [''[[sic]]''] This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians over the Turks  in August 1716.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In early 18th century Venice, [[opera]] was the most popular musical entertainment.  It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro Sant'Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year. In 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader.  The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success.  In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera composed entirely by him, ''Arsilda regina di Ponto'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance.  The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.

At this period, the ''Pietà'' commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two [[oratorio]]s.  ''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is lost.  The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the victory of the Republic of Venice against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfù]].  Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces.  All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the Pietà, both the female and male roles.  Many of the arias include parts for solo instruments&amp;mdash;recorders, oboes, clarinets{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, violas d'amore, and mandolins&amp;mdash;that showcased the range of talents of the girls.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, ''Vivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost).  It was also performed in [[Prague]] in 1732. In the following years, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.

His progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians, like [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing him and his operas. The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks Vivaldi without mentioning him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure writing under the picture mentions non-existent places and names: ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of ''A. Vivaldi''.

In a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio, he makes reference to his &quot;94 operas&quot;.  Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists.  Vivaldi may have exaggerated, but it is possible that he did write 94 operas.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never reached the prominence of other great composers like Alessandro Scarlatti, Leonardo Leo, and Baldassare Galuppi, as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for any period of time in any major opera house.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'' (Hong Kong: Amadeus Press, 1997), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  His most successful operas were ''La constanza trionfante'' and ''Farnace'' which garnered six revivals each.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a new prestigious position as ''Maestro di Cappella'' of the court of prince [[Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt]], governor of [[Mantua]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among which was ''[[Tito Manlio]]'' (RV 738). In 1721, he was in [[Milan]], where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734, 9 arias survive).  He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Gesù'' (RV 645, also lost). In 1722 he moved to [[Rome]], where he introduced his operas' new style.  The new pope [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.

During this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos depicting scenes appropriate for each season.  Three of the concerti are of original conception, while the first, &quot;Spring&quot;, borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of his contemporaneous opera &quot;''Il Giustino''&quot;.  The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua.  They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires.  Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in [[Amsterdam]] by [[Le Cène]] in 1725.

During his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer Anna Tessieri Giro who was to become his student, protégée, and favorite prima donna.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, became part of Vivaldi's entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation about the nature of Vivaldi's and Giro's relationship, but no evidence to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration.  Although Vivaldi's relationship with Anna Giro was questioned, he adamantly denied any romantic relationship in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
During the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. The wedding cantata ''Gloria e Imeneo'' (RV 687) was written for the marriage of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La Cetra (Vivaldi)|La Cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while he was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to [[Vienna]]. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La Cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.

[[File:Teatro alla moda.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]

Accompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera ''[[Farnace]]'' (RV 711) was presented.&lt;ref&gt;Vivaldi's connections with musical life in Prague and his association with [[Antonio Denzio]], the impresario of the [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Sporck theater in Prague]] are detailed in Daniel E. Freeman, ''The Opera Theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' (Stuyvesant, N.Y.: Pendragon Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. ''[[L'Olimpiade]]'' and ''[[Catone in Utica]]'' were written by [[Pietro Metastasio]], the major representative of the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadian]] movement and court poet in Vienna. ''[[La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]].

Like many composers of the time, the final years of Vivaldi's life found him in financial difficulties. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once were in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Giro.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 180.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also likely that Vivaldi went to Vienna to stage operas, especially since he took up residence near the [[Kärntnertortheater]]. Shortly after Vivaldi's arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, a stroke of bad luck that left the composer without royal protection or a steady source of income. Vivaldi died a pauper&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon supplies this assertion and furthermore quotes the report of Vivaldi's death which reached Venice in the ''Commemorali Gradenigo'': &quot;Abbe Lord Antonio Vivaldi, incomparable virtuoso of the violin, known as the Red Priest, much esteemed for his compositions and concertos, who earned more than 50,000 ducats in his life, but his disorderly prodigality caused him to die a pauper in Vienna.&quot;  Landon, ''Vivaldi: Voice of the Baroque'' Thames and Hudson 1993, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; not long after the emperor, on the night between 27 and 28 July 1741 at the age of 63,&lt;ref name=&quot;day_of_death&quot;&gt;Talbot (pg.69) gives the 27th as the day of death. Formichetti (pg.194) reports that he died during the night and his death was the first registered on the next day. Heller (pg.263) states: &quot;The composer's death is noted in the official coroner's report and in the burial account book of St. Stephen's Cathedral Parish as having occurred on 28 July 1741&quot;. But the so-called ''Totenbeschauprotokoll'' is not a reliable source, since the date can refer to when the entry was made, not to the actual time of death.&lt;/ref&gt; of &quot;internal infection&quot;, in a house owned by the widow of a Viennese saddlemaker. On 28 July he was buried in a simple grave at the Hospital Burial Ground in Vienna. Vivaldi's funeral took place at St. Stephen's Cathedral, where the young [[Joseph Haydn]] was then a choir boy. The cost of his funeral included a ''Kleingeläut'' (pauper's peal of bells).&lt;ref&gt;Compared to a noble's funeral at upwards of 100 fl, this was meager treatment.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried next to [[Karlskirche]], in an area now part of the site of the [[Vienna University of Technology|Technical Institute]]. The house Vivaldi lived in while in Vienna was torn down; the Hotel Sacher is built on part of the site. Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations as well as a Vivaldi &quot;star&quot; in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltplatz.

Only three portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting. The engraving, by Francois Morellon La Cave, was made in 1725 and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music. The ink sketch was done by Ghezzi in 1723 and shows only Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile. The oil painting found in the Liceo Musicale of Bologna gives us possibly the most accurate picture and shows Vivaldi's red hair under his blond wig.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influence==
Vivaldi's music was innovative.  He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes; many of his compositions are flamboyantly, almost playfully, exuberant.&lt;!-- some compositions before Vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant, what does this tell us? --&gt;

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his ''[[St John Passion]]'', ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', and [[Bach cantata|cantatas]]). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard, three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and basso continuo (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo ([[Ryom Verzeichnis|RV]] 580).

==Posthumous reputation==
During his lifetime, Vivaldi's popularity quickly made him famous in other countries, including France where musical taste was less dictated by fashion than elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This popularity dwindled.  After the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti were relatively unknown, and largely ignored, even after [[Felix Mendelssohn]] rekindled interest in Bach.  Even Vivaldi's most famous work, ''The Four Seasons'', was unknown in its original edition.

In the early 20th century, [[Fritz Kreisler]]'s Vivaldi-styled concerto (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar Marc Pincherle to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, and were acquired by the National University of Turin Library with generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons.  This led to renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, [[Alfredo Casella]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Olga Rudge]], [[Desmond Chute]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Arnold Schering]], and [[Louis Kaufman]].  These figures were instrumental in the Vivaldi revival of the 20th century.

In 1926, in a monastery in Piedmont, researchers discovered 14 folios of Vivaldi's work, previously thought lost during the Napoleonic wars.  Some volumes in the numbered set were missing; these turned up in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century.  The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Vivaldi biography by Alexander Kuznetsov and Louise Thomas, a booklet attached to the CD &quot;The best of Vivaldi&quot;, published and recorded by Madacy Entertainment Group Inc, St. Laurent Quebec Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

The resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in 1939 organised the historic ''Vivaldi Week'', in which the rediscovered [[Gloria (Vivaldi)|''Gloria'']] (RV 589) and ''l'Olimpiade'' were first revived.  Since World War II, Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success.  In 1947, the Venetian businessman [[Antonio Fanna]] founded the [[Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi]], with the composer [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] as its artistic director, having the purpose of promoting Vivaldi's music and publishing new editions of his works.  [[Historically informed performance]]s seem to have increased Vivaldi's fame further.  Unlike many of his contemporaries, whose music is rarely heard outside an academic or special-interest context, Vivaldi is popular among modern audiences.

Recent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two [[psalm]] settings of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803, in eight movements) and ''Dixit Dominus'' (RV 807, in eleven movements), identified in 2003 and 2005, respectively, by the Australian scholar [[Janice Stockigt]].  Vivaldi scholar [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]] called RV 803 &quot;arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since... the 1920s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, liner notes to the CD ''Vivaldi: Dixit Dominus'', Körnerscher Sing-Verein Dresden (Dresdner Instrumental-Concert), Peter Kopp, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] 2006, catalogue number 4776145&lt;/ref&gt;  Vivaldi's lost 1730 [[opera]] ''[[Argippo]]'' (RV 697) was re-discovered in 2006 by harpsichordist and conductor Ondřej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at Prague Castle on May 3, 2008, its first performance since 1730.

A movie titled ''Vivaldi, a Prince in Venice'' was completed in 2005 as an Italian-French co-production under the direction of [[Jean-Louis Guillermou]], featuring [[Stefano Dionisi]] in the title role and [[Michel Serrault]] as the bishop of Venice. Another film inspired by the life of the composer was in a preproduction state for several years and has the working title ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469879/ Vivaldi]''. Filming was scheduled to begin in 2007, but was canceled and tentatively rescheduled for 2009.

The music of Vivaldi, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], and [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], has been included in the theories of [[Alfred Tomatis]] on the effects of music on human behaviour and used in [[music therapy]].

{{Main|List of compositions by Antonio Vivaldi|List of operas by Vivaldi}}

A Vivaldi work is identified by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], which refers to its place in the &quot;Ryom-Verzeichnis&quot;  or &quot;Répertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi&quot;, a catalog created in the 20th century by musicologist [[Peter Ryom]].

[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|''Le quattro stagioni'' (The Four Seasons)]] of 1723 is his most famous work.  It is part of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'' (&quot;The Contest between Harmony and Invention&quot;). It depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons. This work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre-19th Century [[program music]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Schwarz, ''Musically Speaking - The Great Works Collection: Vivaldi'' (CVP, Inc., 1995), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivaldi wrote more than 500 other concertos.  About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for bassoon, cello, oboe, flute, viola d'amore, recorder, lute, or mandolin.  About 40 are for two instruments and strings, and about 30 are for three or more instruments and strings.

As well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music.  Other works include sinfonias, about 90 sonatas, and chamber music.

Some sonatas for [[flute]], published as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by [[Nicolas Chédeville]].

'''Adrian''' is a form of the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[given name]] ''Hadrianus'' (see [[Hadrian]]). Several [[saints]] and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages, though it was not popular until modern times.

==Course==
[[File:Aletschgebiet aus dem Flugzeug.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Unteraar Glacier|Lower Aar Glacier]]]]

The Aar rises in the great [[Aar Glaciers]] of the [[Bernese Alps|Bernese]] [[Swiss Alps|Alps]], in the [[canton of Bern]] and west of the [[Grimsel Pass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CVDE&quot;/&gt; It runs east to the Grimsel [[Hostel|Hospice]], below the [[Finsteraarhorn]], and then northwest through the [[Haslital]], forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}, past [[Guttannen]], and piercing the limestone barrier of the Kirchet by a major [[canyon]], before reaching [[Meiringen]], situated on a [[plain]]. A little past Meiringen, near [[Brienz]], the river expands into [[Lake Brienz]] where it becomes navigable. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important [[tributary]], the [[Lütschine]]. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between [[Interlaken]] and [[Unterseen]] before flowing into [[Lake Thun]].&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt;

[[File:Ausgang Aareschlucht.jpg|thumb|The Aar at [[Innertkirchen]]]]
Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the [[Kander (Germany)|Kander]], which has just been joined by the [[Simme]]. On flowing out of the lake it passes through [[Thun]], and then flows through the city of [[Bern]], passing beneath [[List of Aar bridges in Berne|eighteen bridges]] and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the [[Old City of Berne|Old City]] is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the [[Saane/Sarine|Saane or Sarine]] it turns north until it nears [[Aarberg]]. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the [[Jura water correction]], the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a [[swampland]] through frequent flooding, was diverted by the [[Hagneck Canal]] into [[Lake of Bienne]]. From the upper end of the lake the river issues through the [[Nidau-Büren channel]] and then runs east to [[Büren]]. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the &quot;vegetable garden of Switzerland&quot;.

From here the Aar flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town [[Solothurn]]&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt; (below which the Grosse [[Emme (river)|Emme]] flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), [[Olten]], [[Aarau]],&lt;ref name=CVDE /&gt; near which is the junction with the [[Suhre]], and Wildegg, where the Hallwiler Aa falls in on the right. A short distance further, below [[Brugg]] it receives first the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]], and shortly afterwards the [[Limmat]]. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself an tributary of the [[Rhine]], which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Koblenz]] (Switzerland), opposite [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]], Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the [[North Sea]] after crossing into the [[Netherlands]].

==Aar Gorge==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aareschlucht]] --&gt;
[[File:Aareschlucht 166 7.jpg|thumb|Inside the Aar Gorge]]
The Aar Gorge (''Aareschlucht'') is a section of the river that carves through a [[limestone]] ridge near the town of [[Meiringen]]. The gorge is an indirect product of [[glaciation]]; 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, just as the [[Ice Age]] was coming to an end, torrential runoff water from melting [[glacier]]s eroded a deep, narrow chasm through the limestone barrier. Although barely one mile long, this passage is bordered by sheer cliffs up to 165&amp;nbsp;feet (50&amp;nbsp;m) high on either side. At the bottom of this steep drop the river is only a few metres wide.

The gorge has been opened to the public since 1889, by building walking paths along the Gorge. Before then, the only way was to go through the dangerous river torrent, which provided fables by travellers, who claimed to see large snakes and monsters. Since then, the gorge is a popular tourist attraction for many visitors who like natural beauty and are attracted by the [[Reichenbach Falls]], which Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] selected as the proper set for [[Sherlock Holmes]]' murder by [[Professor Moriarty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abbotsford Morris edited.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Abbotsford in 1880.]]
'''Abbotsford''' is a [[historic house]] in the region of the [[Scottish Borders]] in the south of [[Scotland]], near [[Melrose]], on the south bank of the [[River Tweed]]. It was formerly the residence of [[historical novel]]ist and [[poet]], [[Walter Scott]]. It is a Category A [[Listed Building]].

The nucleus of the estate was a small farm of 110 acres (0.4&amp;nbsp;km²), called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and was bought by Scott on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel.  He first built a small villa and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a ford nearby where previously [[abbot]]s of [[Melrose Abbey]] used to cross the river. Scott then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland.  In it he gathered a large library, a collection of ancient [[furniture]], arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with [[Scottish history]].

The last and principal acquisition was that of Toftfield (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817.  The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.  
[[Image:Abbotsford.House.ground.plan.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ground plan of Abbotsford House.]]
The general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed.  Abbotsford’s picturesque and irregular architecture is the progenitor of the [[Scottish Baronial]] style of architecture in which identifiably Scottish precedents and elements
of architecture, including steeply pitched slate roofs, turrets, bartizans, and crowstepped
gables reminiscent of ancient castles, keeps and fortified houses, are used
to evoke a sense of national identify. Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh|old Tolbooth]] in [[Edinburgh]].

Abbotsford’s interiors are essentially unchanged since Scott’s time and are now, possibly, the best-preserved suite of late Georgian interiors in Scotland.  Abbotsford’s interiors are exemplars of the Romantic period defined in part by the objects they contain and in part by the motives of those who created them. 

While Scott is known as a writer, his surmounting interest, which gave him the most pleasure, was gardening.  At Abbotsford, Sir Walter created enclosed gardens and parkland to complement the house, and laid out the largely unimproved land to form an extended wooded agricultural landscape, that remains uniquely adapted to its Tweedside setting.  [[Historic Scotland]] has classified the landscape and gardens created by Scott as of outstanding aesthetic, scenic and architectural importance, and, as the creation of Scott, of international significance.  Scott wrote on tree planting and landscape gardening and kept detailed records of his landscaping at Abbotsford, all of which add significantly to the historical value of the Abbotsford Estate.  His landscape design at Abbotsford influenced many of his peers and neighbours, informing garden design across the UK.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  

The house at Abbotsford stands at the top and south east side of a terraced slope, which was shaped from the natural gravel escarpment that rises to a height of 12 metres above the Tweed.  On the south east side, Scott created a formal entrance courtyard, the first of three enclosed garden spaces, each enclosed by high walls.  To the north and extending westwards from the north side of the house, Scott's descendents developed the Morris Garden and the impressive kitchen garden.

Much of the gardens and landscape remain as they were in the time of Sir Walter, with some modest additions and alterations.  This, coupled with the association with Scott, make the Gardens at Abbotsford among the most historically important in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Scott had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt.  In 1830 the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors.  The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by [[Robert Cadell]], the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir Walter's works.  

Scott's only son Walter did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from [[India]] in 1847.  Among subsequent possessors were Scott's son-in-law, [[John Gibson Lockhart]], [[James Hope-Scott|J. R. Hope Scott]], [[Q.C.]], and his daughter (Scott's great-granddaughter), the Hon. Mrs Maxwell Scott.  

Abbotsford gave its name to the &quot;Abbotsford Club&quot;, a successor of the [[Bannatyne Club|Bannatyne]] and Maitland clubs, founded by [[William Barclay Turnbull]] in 1834 in Scott's honour, for printing and publishing historical works connected with his writings.  Its publications extended from 1835 to 1864.

Abbotsford opened to the public in 1833 (a year after the death of Scott, and among the first historic houses to become a public attraction) and from the outset, it was a huge hit with visitors.  This resulted in his descendents extending the house and adapting the garden and landscape to cope with the huge numbers that visited.  These early adaptations are considered to be of significant historical value in terms of the history of tourism in the United Kingdom.

[[Image:Abbotsford Aug2009 01.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2|Abbotsford House as seen from the gardens.]]
Scott's descendants continued to live in the house until 2004. The last of his direct descendants to inhabit Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott (8 June 1923 - 5 May 2004). She inherited it from her elder sister Patricia in 1998. The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house. It had electricity installed only in 1962. Dame Jean was at one time a lady-in-waiting to [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], patron of the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier|Dandie Dinmont]] Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir Walter Scott's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir Wattie, ridden by Ian Stark, won two silver medals at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 13 July 2004, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Dame Jean Maxwell Scott, a charitable trust, the Abbotsford Trust (Charity No SCO37425) was established to safeguard the house for current and future generations.  The trust embarked upon an ambitious £10 million campaign to save Abbotsford in 2009.  This campaign will see the repair and restoration of the house and grounds and the creation of a new visitor centre.  The visitor centre will feature a permanent and free to access exhibition on the life and works of Sir Walter Scott.  It is envisaged that this redevelopment work will be completed in early 2013.

In keeping with its many Walter Scott references, Rose Street in Edinburgh has a bar called the &quot;[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]&quot;, along with one named the &quot;Abbotsford&quot;.

Sir Walter Scott rescued the &quot;[[jougs]]&quot; from [[Threave Castle]] in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Napier&quot;&gt;Napier, George G. (1897). ''The Home and Haunts of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.'' James Maclehose, Glasgow. P. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham''' ([[hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang-he-a|אַבְרָהָם|He-Avraham.ogg}}, [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern]]: Avraham, [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]]: ''{{unicode|ʼAḇrāhām}}'', {{lang-ar|إبراهيم}}, ''[[Ibrahim|{{Unicode|Ibrāhīm}}]]'', ''{{Unicode|ʼAbrəham}}'', {{lang-el|Aβραάμ}}), whose birth name was '''Abram''', is the eponym of the [[Abrahamic religions]], among which are [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. According to both the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11–25&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Qur'an]], Abraham is the forefather of many tribes, including the [[Hebrews]], [[Israelites]], [[Ishmael]]ites, [[Edom]]ites, [[Midianites]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, ''[[Al-An'am|The Cattle]]'', Verse 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Abraham was a descendant of [[Noah]]'s son, [[Shem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:10-32|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, M. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=RPyAG2cduiAC Our Father Abraham: Jewish roots of the Christian Faith]'' (ISBN 0802804233, ISBN 9780802804235), 1989, p. 3, 4&lt;/ref&gt; Among Abraham's descendants are counted [[Moses]] and [[Jesus]], through [[Isaac]], Abraham's second son, while [[Muhammad]] was a descendant of [[Ishmael]], his first son. The [[Book of Genesis]] narrative that records the life of Abraham presents his role as one that could only be fulfilled through a monotheistic [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] established between him and God (Hebrew: ''[[Yahweh]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--Most of the article below is referencing narratives from the Bible--&gt; In [[Islam]], Abraham is recognized as a [[prophet]], [[patriarch]], and [[messenger]], archetype of the perfect [[Muslim]], and reformer of the [[Kaaba]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mecca'', Martin Lings, c. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham is mentioned collectively in around 25 chapters of the [[Qur'an]], at times briefly and at times in detail.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Ibrahim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The past four or five decades have seen a growing consensus that the Genesis narrative of Abraham originated from literary circles of the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m1V1DeBS6P0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Judaism,+the+first+phase:+the+place+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LBvGbmdYft&amp;sig=G6O6KoUiTSyeYOppa7HS4bH_r0k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jbAcTJCHHcmDcJDL1K8N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Zion%20theology&amp;f=false Joseph Blenkinsopp, &quot;Judaism, the first phase&quot;] p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Abraham==
===Etymology===
Abraham first appears as ''Abram'' in the book of Genesis until he is renamed by Yahweh ([[YHWH in the Hebrew Bible|YHWH]]) in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:5|HE}}. The narrative indicates that ''abraham'' means “the father of a multitude&quot; ([[Hebrew]]: ʼaḇ-hămôn goyim).&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Meyers &amp; Beck. ''Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible'' (ISBN 0802824005, ISBN 9780802824004), 2000, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars do not accept the narrative's definition to be the etymology of Abraham because, though &quot;ab-&quot; means &quot;father&quot;, &quot;-hamon&quot; is not the second element, and &quot;-Raham&quot; is not a word in Hebrew. The word in Hebrew for &quot;multitude&quot; is ''rabim''. [[Johann Friedrich Karl Keil]] suggested that there was once a word ''raham'' (רָהָם) in Hebrew that meant &quot;multitude&quot;, on analogy with the Arabic ''ruhâm'' which does have this meaning, but there is no evidence to support this;&lt;ref&gt;K.F. Keil. ''Biblical commentary on the Old Testament.'', Vol. 1, 1869, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; another possibility is that the first element should be ''abr-'', which means &quot;chief&quot;, but this yields a meaningless second element, &quot;-aham&quot;. [[David Rohl]] suggests the name comes from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] &quot;the father loves&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;David Rohl. ''The Lost Testament'' (ISBN 0712669930), 2002&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars would prefer an origin based on Hebrew.

===Chronology===
The standard [[Masoretic]] text of the Hebrew Bible places Abraham's birth 1,948 years after the Creation, or 1948 AM ([[Anno Mundi]], &quot;Year of the World&quot;). The two other major textual traditions have different dates, the translated Greek [[Septuagint]] putting it at 3312 AM and the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]] at 2247 AM. All three agree that he died at the age of 175.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grisda.org/origins/07023.htm |title=G.F. Hasel, &quot;Chronogenealogies in the Biblical History of Beginnings&quot; |publisher=Grisda.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been over two hundred attempts to match the biblical chronology to dates in history, two of the more influential being the traditional Jewish dates (Abraham lived 1812 BCE to 1637 BCE), and those of the 17th century Archbishop [[James Ussher]] (1976 BCE to 1801 BCE); but the most that can be said with some degree of certainty is that the standard Hebrew text of Genesis places Abraham in the earlier part of the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03731a.htm |title=&quot;Biblical Chronology&quot;, Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1908-11-01 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally recognised by scholars that there is nothing in the Genesis stories that can be related to the history of Canaan of the early 2nd millennium: none of the kings mentioned is known, Abimelech could not be a Philistine (they did not arrive till centuries later), Ur could not become known as &quot;Ur of the Chaldeans&quot; until the early 1st millennium, and Laban could not have been an Aramean, as the Arameans did not become an identifiable political entity until the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=hd28MdGNyTYC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=Reconstructing+the+Society+of+Ancient+Israel++By+Paula+M.+McNutt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aE91cj05u4&amp;sig=Jl3tjrv1Qfr0S3wcWYTDc7FFZ9M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VGhZS46fMM-IkAWng9mhAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Paula McNutt, Reconstructing the Society of Ancient Israel&quot;, p.41]&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Blenkinsopp,  Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]], notes that the past four or five decades have seen a growing consensus that the Genesis narrative of Abraham originated from literary circles of the 6th and 5th centuries BCE as a mirror of the situation facing the Jewish community under the Babylonian and early [[Persian empire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m1V1DeBS6P0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Judaism,+the+first+phase:+the+place+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LBvGbmdYft&amp;sig=G6O6KoUiTSyeYOppa7HS4bH_r0k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jbAcTJCHHcmDcJDL1K8N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Zion%20theology&amp;f=false Joseph Blenkinsopp, &quot;Judaism, the first phase&quot;] p.39&lt;/ref&gt;  Blenkinsopp describes two conclusions about Abraham that are widely held in biblical scholarship: the first is that, except in the triad &quot;Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,&quot; he is not clearly and unambiguously attested in the Bible earlier than the [[Babylonian exile]] (he does not, for example, appear in prophetic texts earlier than that time); the second is that he became, in the Persian period, a model for those who would return from Babylon to Judah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m1V1DeBS6P0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Judaism,+the+first+phase:+the+place+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LBvGbmdYft&amp;sig=G6O6KoUiTSyeYOppa7HS4bH_r0k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jbAcTJCHHcmDcJDL1K8N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Zion%20theology&amp;f=false Joseph Blenkinsopp, &quot;Judaism, the first phase&quot;] p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this the Abraham story (and those of Isaac and Jacob/Israel) served a theological purpose following the destruction of Jerusalem, the Temple and the Davidic kingship: despite the loss of these things, Yahweh's dealings with the ancestors provided a historical foundation on which hope for the future could be built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Xx9YzJq2B9wC&amp;dq=Rainer+Albertz,+%22Israel+in+exile%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HtlsTK7mFpO8sAPKzYmgCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Albertz, R, &quot;Israel in exile: the history and literature of the sixth century B.C.E.&quot; (Society of Biblical Literature, 2003)] p.246&lt;/ref&gt; There is basic agreement that his connection with Haran, Shechem and Bethel is secondary and originated when he became identified as the father of Jacob and ancestor of the northern tribes; his association with Mamre and Hebron, on the other hand (in the south, in the territory of Jerusalem and Judah), suggest that this region was the original home of his cult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dictionary+of+deities+and+demons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFute0p0_x&amp;sig=ES0qi7jA4zyCXLIMs3sac2cyvOg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wSYLTavKBsnprAfZuenxCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham&amp;f=false &quot;Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible&quot;, K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst (eds) (Wm.

==Genesis narrative==
The life of Abraham is recorded in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:26-25:10|HE}} of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|thumb|left|Abraham's Departure, by [[József Molnár]]]]

===Abram's nativity===
Terah, the tenth in descent from [[Noah]], fathered Abram, [[Nahor]] and [[Haran]], and Haran fathered [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]. Haran died in his native Ur of the Chaldees (which is perhaps [[Ur]]), and Abram married [[Sarah|Sarai]], who was barren. Terah, with &lt;!-- NOT Nahor, --&gt;Abram, Sarai and Lot, then departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named [[Haran (Biblical place)|Haran]] (which may be [[Harran]]), where Terah died at the age of 205. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:27-11:32|HE}})

[[File:Abraham Journeying into the Land of Canaan.png|thumb|250px|right|Abram Journeying into the Land of Canaan (engraving by [[Gustave Doré]] from the 1865 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]

=== Abram's calling ===
[[Yahweh|God]] told Abram to leave his native land and his father’s house for a land that God would show him, promising to make of him a great nation, [[blessing|bless]] him, make his name great, bless those who blessed him, and curse those who cursed him. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:1–3|HE}})  Following God’s command, at age 75, Abram took his wife [[Sarah|Sarai]], his nephew Lot, and the wealth and persons that they had acquired in Haran, and traveled to the [[Pistacia palaestina|terebinth]] (KJV: plain) of [[Moreh]], at [[Shechem]] in [[Canaan]]. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:4–6|HE}}) God appeared to Abram to tell him that God would give [[Land of Israel|the land]] to his heirs, and Abram built an [[altar]] to God. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:7|HE}})  Abram then moved to the hill country east of [[Bethel]] and built an altar to God there and invoked God by name. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:8|HE}})  Then Abram journeyed toward the [[Negeb]] (the south.) ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:9|HE}})

[[File:Tissot Abram's Counsel to Sarai.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Abram’s Counsel to Sarai (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]

===Abram and Sarai===
There was a sore famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, travelled south to &lt;!-- northern --&gt;[[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. In route, Abram told his wife Sarai, to say that she was his sister, so that the [[Military history of Ancient Egypt#Military Organization|Egyptians]] would not kill him. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:10–13|HE}}) When they entered Egypt, the princes of Pharoah praised Sarai's beauty to the [[Pharaoh]], and she was taken into his palace, and Abram was given provisions: &quot;oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.&quot; However, God afflicted the Pharaoh and his household with great plagues, ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:14–17|HE}}) and after discovering that Sarai was really Abram's wife, the Pharaoh wanted nothing to do with them. He demanded that he and his household leave immediately, along with all their goods. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:18–20|HE}})

===Abram and Lot separate===
When they came back to the Bethel and Hai area, Abram's and Lot's sizeable numbers of livestock occupied the same pastures, (&quot;and the [[Canaan]]ite and the [[Perizzite]] dwelled then in the land.&quot;) This became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family’s cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram graciously suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict amongst &quot;brethren&quot;. But Lot chose to go east to the plain of [[Jordan river|Jordan]] where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward Sodom. Abram went south to [[Hebron]] and settled in the plain of [[Mamre]], where he built another altar unto the {{LORD}}. ({{bibleref|Genesis|13:1-18|KJV}})

=== Abram and Chedorlaomer ===

{{Main|Battle of the Vale of Siddim}}
[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Meeting of Abram and Melchizedek (painting circa 1464–1467 by [[Dirk Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]])]]
During the rebellion of the [[Cities of the Plain|Jordan River cities]] against [[Elam]], ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:1–9|HE}}) Abram’s nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading [[Elamite]] forces. The Elamite army came to collect booty from the spoils of war, after having just defeated the King of Sodom’s armies. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:8–12|HE}}) Lot and his family, at the time, were settled on the outskirts of the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Kingdom of Sodom]] which made them a visible target. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|13:12|HE}})

One person that escaped capture came and told Abram what happened. Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram’s elite force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim|Battle of Siddim]]. When they caught up with them at [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], Abram devised a battle strategy plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram’s unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King [[Chedorlaomer]] at Hobah, just north of [[Damascus]]. They freed Lot, his household, possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that were taken. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:13–16|HE}})

Upon Abram’s return, King [[Bera (Bible)|Bera]] of Sodom came out to meet with him in the [[King's dale|Valley of Shaveh]], the &quot;king's dale.&quot; Also, [[Melchizedek]] king of Salem ([[Jerusalem]]), a priest of [[Elyon|God Most High]], brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a [[tithe|tenth]] of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people. Though he released the captives, Abram refused any reward from the King of Sodom, other than the share his allies were entitled to. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:17–24|HE}})

=== Abrahamic covenant ===
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 024.png|thumb|left|200px|The Vision of the Lord Directing Abram to Count the Stars (woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]] from the 1860 ''Bible in Pictures'')]]
After ten years, since the time Abraham left Haran,&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:4|HE}} with {{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:16|HE}} noting that Ishmael was born one year after the covenant in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:18|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:1-4|HE}} Abram’s most important encounter is recorded when the {{LORD}} made a covenant with him.  The day started with a vision where Abram expressed his concerns about being childless. God then reminds him of his original promise to make him a father of a “great nation” and then revealed that he would have a son born to him. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:1-4|HE}})

Later that day, at the drawing of the evening, Abram fell into a deep sleep where he encountered God again. God then prophesied to Abram that the nation born to him would be removed to another land where they must be trialed for four hundred years and afterward, they would be greatly blessed with many possessions and occupy their own land. This prophecy was that of the Israelites in subjection to Egypt, for four hundred years, before returning back to Canaan to claim it as their own. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:12-18|HE}}) It was at this drawing of the night hour that Abram entered into a covenant with Yahweh who declared all of the regions of land that his offspring would claim:
&lt;br&gt;
{{blockquote|
&quot;To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates, the land of the [[Kenite]]s, [[Kenizzite]]s, [[Kadmonite]]s, [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]], [[Perizzite]]s, [[Rephaite]]s, [[Amorite]]s, [[Canaan]]ites, [[Girgashite]]s and [[Jebusite]]s.&quot;
:—{{Bibleverse||Genesis|15:18–21|HE}}
}}

===Abram and Hagar===
{{see also|Hagar (Bible)}}
[[File:Adriaen van der Werff Sarah presenting Hagar to Abraham.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Sarah Presenting Hagar to Abraham (1699 painting by [[Adriaen van der Werff]])]]
Abram and Sarai were trying to make sense of how he will become a progenitor of nations since it has already been 10 years of living in Canaan, and still no child has been born from Abram's seed. Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaid, [[Hagar]], for Abram to consort with her so that she may have a child by her, as a wife. Abram consented and had intercourse with Hagar. The result of these actions created a hostile relationship between Hagar and her mistress, Sarai. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:1-6|HE}})

After a harsh encounter with Sarai, Hagar fled toward [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]. In route, an angel of Yahweh appeared to Hagar at the well of a spring. He instructed her to return to Sarai for she will bear a son who “shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.”  She was told to call her son: [[Ishmael]]. Hagar then referred to God as “[[El Roi|El-roi]],” meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her. From that day, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. She then did as she was instructed by returning to Abram in order to have her child. Abram was eighty-six years of age when Ishmael was born.({{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:7-16|HE}})

===Abraham and Sarah===
{{Bibleverse||Genesis|17|HE}} records the inauguration of Abram into Yahweh’s covenant that was initiated thirteen years ago, as was stated in Genesis 15. Abram is now ninety-nine when Yahweh declares Abram’s new name: “Abraham, a father of many nations.” Abram then received the instructions for the inauguration rite into God’s covenant because the time was approaching for him to have a son by his wife, Sarai. The initiation rite was that in order to be part of this “great nation”, whether by bloodline or inducted, every male must be [[circumcised]] otherwise it was a breach of contract. Then Yahweh declared Sarai’s new name: “[[Sarah]]” and blessed her. Immediately after Abram’s encounter with his God, he had his entire household of men, including himself and Ishmael, circumcised. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:1-27|HE}})

===Abraham's three visitors===
 [[File:Tissot Abraham and the Three Angels.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Abraham and the Three Angels (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]

Not long afterward, during the heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the [[Pistacia palaestina|terebinths]] of [[Mamre]]. He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and [[Bowing (social)|bowed]] to the ground to welcome them.  Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread of which they assented. Abraham rushed to [[Sarah]]’s tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:1–8|HE}})
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having child at their ages. The visitor inquired to Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child for her age as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.

===Abraham's plea===

{{Main|Sodom and Gomorrah|Lot (Biblical)}}

[[File:Tissot Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames.jpg|thumb|left|198px|Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by James Tissot)]]

After eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the ''Cities of the Plain'' to discusses the fate of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved Yahweh to action. Because Abraham’s nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors leave for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to the Lord and pleaded with him that 'if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?' For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:17-33|HE}})

When the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square, more than likely to see how they would be received by the locals. However, Abraham’s nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two “men” stay at his house for the night. This is the first subtle indication that it would be unsafe for anyone, especially outsiders, to be in the public eye. As it turns out, a rally of men stood outside of Lot’s home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may “know” them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters to be “known” by the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break Lot’s doors down to get to his male guests,&lt;ref&gt;({{Bibleverse||Genesis|19:1-9|HE}})&lt;/ref&gt; thus confirming the “outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah” and sealing their doom. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|19:12-13|HE}})

Early the next morning, Abraham awoke and went to the elevation that looked over the River Jordan plain, at the very spot where he stood before God, the day prior. From his vantage point, he saw what became of the cities of the plain as “dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.” ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|19:27-29|HE}}) This meant that there was not even ten righteous people in any of those cities. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:32|HE}}) This was the last recorded event that Abraham had anything to do with his nephew, Lot.

===Abraham and Abimelech===
Abraham settled between [[Kadesh (South of Israel)|Kadesh]] and [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]] in the land of the [[Philistine]]s. While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham openly mentioned that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King [[Abimelech]] had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman to a prophet of [[Yahweh]]. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he this God would slay an innocent man, especially since it was told to him that Abraham and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continues to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:1-7|HE}})

Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that Gerar of Philistia had no fear of God in them and the only way for this kingdom to recognize the fear of God was to do what he had done. Then Abraham justified what was said as not being a lie at all: &quot;And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and so she became my wife.&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:12|HE}}) Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, then gave him sheep, oxen, and slaves, and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech’s lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all. Abraham then prayed in behalf of Abimelech and the women in his household, so that they bore children, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:8–18|HE}})

After living for some time in the land of the Philistines, [[Abimelech]] and [[Phicol]], the chief of his troops, approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant's aggressive attacks and the seizing of Abraham’s well. Abimelech, however, acted in ignorance. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: [[Beersheba]]. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to [[Philistia]], Abraham planted a [[Tamarix|tamarisk]] tree to invoke God’s name. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:22-34|HE}})

=== Abraham and Ishmael ===
Abraham was fond of his son Ishmael who had grown up to be fourteen years old when Isaac was born.
However, with Sarah, things were never the same with Ishmael's mother, Hagar, back in her life. Now that Sarah has finally bore her own child, she could no longer stand the sight of either [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] or [[Ishmael]]. When the teenager was jesting around, Sarah told Abraham to send the two of them away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. The Lord told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. The LORD reassured Abraham that &quot;Isaac shall seed be called to thee.&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:12|HE}}) He also said that Ishmael would make a nation, &quot;because he is thy seed&quot;, too. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:9-13|HE}})

Early the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread and water and sent them away. The two wandered the wilderness of [[Beersheba]] until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst in tears. The boy then called to God and upon hearing him, an [[angel]] of Yahweh confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled [[Archery|archer]] living in the wilderness of [[Desert of Paran|Paran]]. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her native country, the land of Egypt. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:14-21|HE}})

[[File:Abraham.jpg|thumb|''Abraham Sacrificing Isaac'', by [[Laurent de La Hire]], 1650 ([[Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Orléans]])]]

===Abraham and Isaac===
{{Main|Binding of Isaac}}
{{see also|Isaac#Binding of Isaac}}

At some point in [[Isaac]]'s youth, Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of [[Moriah]]. The patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that God taught him. He commanded the servant to remain while he and Isaac proceeded alone to the mountain, Isaac carrying the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac repeatedly asked Abraham where the animal for the burnt offering was. Abraham then replied that God would provide one. Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was prevented by an [[angel]], and given on that spot a [[Domestic sheep|ram]] which he sacrificed in place of his son. As a reward for his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity. After this event, Abraham did not return to Hebron, Sarah's encampment, but instead went to [[Beersheba]], Keturah's encampment, and it is to Beersheba that Abraham's servant brought [[Rebecca]], Isaac's patrilineal parallel cousin who became his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|22|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Sarah is said to have died at the age of 127, and Abraham buried her in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] (also called the Cave of Machpelah), near [[Hebron]] which he had purchased, along with the adjoining field, from Ephron the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]].

After the death of Sarah, he took another wife, or concubine, named [[Keturah]], who bore Abraham six sons: [[Zimran]], [[Jokshan]], [[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medan]], [[Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian]], [[Ishbak]], and [[Shuah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|25:1-6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham is said to have died at the age of 175 years. Jewish legend says that he was meant to live to 180 years, but God purposely took his life because he felt that Abraham did not need to go through the pain of seeing [[Esau]]'s wicked deeds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Bible says he was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|25:9|HE}} and {{Bibleverse||Genesis|23:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sons of Abraham}}

==Abraham in religious traditions==
In Islamic and Jewish traditions, Abraham is referred to as &quot;our Father&quot;, (Hebrew: ''Avraham Avinu'', Arabic: ''abeena Ibraheem''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahadees.com/arabic-surah-22-78.html Qu'ran 22:78]&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Islamic tradition, Abraham is considered a [[prophet of Islam]], the ancestor of [[Muhammad]], through his firstborn son, [[Ishmael]] whose mother’s name is nowhere mentioned in the [[Qu'ran]].

In Jewish tradition, Abraham is also the father of the Israelites through his second born child, [[Isaac]] whose mother was [[Sarah]]. Accordingly, the mother of his firstborn son, Ishmael is identified as [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], Sarah’s Egyptian handmaiden.

In Christian tradition, God's promise to Abraham would be fulfilled, in its entirety, through [[Jesus Christ]] who provides the opportunity for all mankind to be under the same covenant that was offered to Abraham and all of his people. Just as Israelite men were [[circumcise]]d to identify themselves as part of the Abrahamic covenant, Christians today are identified through [[baptism]].

[[Image:Tomb of Abraham.jpg|thumb|250px|Jews praying in front of the Tomb of Abraham on the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron]]

===Judaism===

Abraham’s life can be read in the weekly [[Torah]] reading portions, predominantly in the [[Parashah|Parashot]]: [[Lech-Lecha]] ( '''לֶךְ-לְךָ''' ), [[Vayeira]] ( '''וַיֵּרָא''' ), [[Chayei Sarah]] ( '''חַיֵּי שָׂרָה''' ), and [[Toledot]] ( '''תּוֹלְדֹת''' )

====Abraham in the Writings of Second Temple Judaism====

[[Second Temple Judaism]] refers to the religion of [[Judaism]] during the period between the construction of the [[Second Temple|second Jewish temple in Jerusalem]] in 515 BCE, and its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction by the Romans in 70 CE]] This period witnessed major historical upheavals and significant religious changes. The origins of the [[Development of the Jewish Bible canon|authority of scripture]], of the [[Noahide Law|centrality of law and morality in religion]], of the [[synagogue]] and of [[Jewish eschatology|apocalyptic expectations for the future]] all developed in the Judaism of this period. The primary literary sources for information about late Second Temple Judaism are the [[Apocrypha]], Old Testament [[pseudepigrapha]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and the works of [[Josephus]] and [[Philo]].

'''Philo'''

====Abram’s birthplace disputed====
{{see also|Noach (parsha)}}

11th and 12th century Rabbis [[Rashi]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] agree that Abram’s native homeland was [[Ur Kaśdim]], better known as ''Ur of the Chaldees'', a [[Mesopotamian]] location settled by the descendants of [[Ham (son of Noah)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;&gt;Singer, Binyamin. &quot;Ramban: Bereishis &amp; Shemos&quot;, Vol. 1: ''Ramban: Classic Themes in Nachmanides' Chumash Commentary'', 2005 (ISBN 1568713428, ISBN 9781568713427), p. 89-91&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern Jewish studies identify this location to be the same as the [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Michael. This is Judaism, 1996, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scharfstein, Sol. Jewish History and You, 2002, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, this [[Persian Gulf]] city in [[Iraq]] is only a candidate among others to be the actual Ur Kaśdim, as well as the most popularly debated one since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan. ''The Flood Myth'', 1988, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Nahmanides]], known as ''the Ramban'', was a medieval Jewish scholar of the 13th century who disagreed with Rashi and Ibn Ezra concerning Abram’s birthplace. The Ramban states that because Ur Kaśdim was settled by Ham’s descendants, this could not be Abram’s birthplace as he was a descendant of [[Shem]]. However, everyone does agree that Abram’s family under the headship of his father, [[Terah|Terach]], had all lived in Ur Kaśdim before being called to move to [[Land of Canaan|Canaan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;/&gt;

The three Rabbis also agree that Terach’s native homeland was Charan, the biblical place known as Haran in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|11:31,32|NIV}}, where the ''House of Terach'' was located.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:1|NIV|Gen.12:1}} &lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;/&gt; Since this settlement was established by Shem’s descendants, only Ramban assumed that Charan had to be Abram’s birthplace. He further concluded that Terach and his three sons eventually moved from Charan to Ur Kaśdim, then later by [[Yahweh]]’s command, they headed to Canaan. Of course, they stopped back at Terach’s hometown of Charan, where the father stayed there rather than going to Canaan after all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;/&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Abraham window.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The Abraham stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina]]
In the [[New Testament]] Abraham is mentioned prominently as a man of faith (see e.g. [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 11), and the apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] uses him as an example of [[salvation]] by faith, as the progenitor of the [[Christ]] (or [[Messiah]]) (see [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Galatians|3:16|KJV}}).

The New Testament also sees Abraham as an obedient man of God, and Abraham's interrupted attempt to offer up Isaac is seen as the supreme act of perfect faith in God. &quot;By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, 'In Isaac your seed shall be called', concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:17-19|KJV}}) The imagery of a father sacrificing his son is seen as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of [[God the Father]] offering [[Son of God|his Son]] on [[Golgatha]].

The traditional view in [[Christianity]] is that the chief promise made to Abraham in ''Genesis'' 12 is that through Abraham's seed all the people of earth would be blessed. Notwithstanding this, [[John the Baptist]] specifically taught that merely being of Abraham's seed was no guarantee of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|3:1-9|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise in Genesis is considered to have been fulfilled through Abraham's seed, Jesus. It is also a consequence of this promise that Christianity is open to people of all races and not limited to Jews.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] calls Abraham &quot;our father in Faith&quot;, in the [[Eucharistic prayer]] of the [[Roman Canon]], recited during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (see [[Abraham in the Catholic liturgy]]). He is also commemorated in the [[calendar of saints|calendars of saints]] of several denominations: on August 20 by the [[Maronite Church]], August 28 in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with the full [[daily office|office]] for the latter), and on October 9 by the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]]. He is also regarded as the [[patron saint]] of those in the hospitality industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holweck&quot;&gt;*[[Frederick George Holweck|Holweck, F. G.]], ''A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints''. St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] commemorates him as the &quot;Righteous Forefather Abraham&quot;, with two [[feast day]]s in its [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]]. The first time is on October 9 (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], October 9 falls on October 22 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]), where he is commemorated together with his nephew &quot;Righteous Lot&quot;. The other is on the &quot;Sunday of the Forefathers&quot; (two Sundays before [[Christmas]]), when he is commemorated together with other [[Genealogy of Jesus|ancestors of Jesus]]. Abraham is also mentioned in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of [[Saint Basil the Great]], just before the Anaphora. Abraham and Sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the [[priest]] over a newly married couple at the [[Sacred Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] of [[Christian views of marriage#View of the Eastern Orthodox Church|Crowning]] (i.e., the Sacrament of Marriage).

====Abraham in the Writings of the Church Fathers====

[[Sextus Julius Africanus]] (c.160 – c.240) was a Christian traveller and historian of the late 2nd and early 3rd century AD. He is important chiefly because of his influence on Eusebius, on all the later writers of Church history among the Fathers, and on the whole Greek school of chroniclers. He wrote a history of the world (Chronographiai, in five books) from Creation to the year AD 221.

According Julius Africanus,&lt;ref name = &quot;Africanus&quot; &gt;Roberts, Alexander &amp; Donaldson, James. (Ed.) (1885). Julius Africanus: Subsections: [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.viii.html ''Of Abraham''] followed by [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.v.v.ix.html ''Of Abraham and Lot''].

&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham entered the promised land of Canaan in the year of the world 3277.&lt;ref name = &quot;Africanus&quot;/&gt; He mentions the accounts of Abram's pretending to be the brother of Sarai, of Lot separating from Abram and living near Sodom, of the war of the kings by the Dead Sea. His list of the kings agrees with the Septuagint rather than the Masoretic text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/Genesis/index.htm Brenton, C. L. (1851). ''Genesis 14.''

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic view of Abraham}}
Abraham is supremely important in [[Islam]] and is recognized as a [[prophet]], [[patriarch]] and [[messenger]] by all [[Muslim]]s.
He is the archetype of the perfect [[Muslim]] and is revered as the reformer of the [[Kaaba]], in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mecca'', Martin Lings, c. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham is mentioned collectively in around 25 chapters of the [[Qur'an]], at times briefly and at times in detail.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Ibrahim''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narrative in the Qur'an====
''This is a summary of all the references to Abraham in the Qur'an''

There are numerous references to Abraham in the [[Qur'an]], including, twice, to the [[Scrolls of Abraham]] (LXXXVII: 18; LIII: 36); in the latter passage, it is mentioned that Abraham &quot;fulfilled his commandments&quot; (LIII: 36), a reference to all the trials that Abraham had succeeded in. In a whole series of chapters, the [[Qur'an]] relates how Abraham preached to his community as a youth and how he specifically told his father, named [[Azar]] in VI:74, to leave idol-worship and come to the worship of [[God]] (XXXVII: 83-98; XXVI: 69-89).&lt;ref&gt;Other verses dealing with Abraham's early preaching include XIX: 41-50, XLIII: 26-28, XXI: 51-73, XXIX: 16-27 and VI: 74-84&lt;/ref&gt; Some passages of the [[Qur'an]], meanwhile, deal with the story of how God sent angels to Abraham with the announcement of the punishment to be imposed upon [[Lot]]'s people in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] (LI: 24-34; XV: 51-60).&lt;ref&gt;Other verses dealing with the announcement include  XI: 69-76 and  XXIX: 31f.&lt;/ref&gt; Other verses mention the near-sacrifice of Abraham's son (XXXVII: 100-111), whose name is not given but is presumed to be [[Ishmael]] as the following verses mention the birth of [[Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', C. Glasse, ''Ishmael''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qur'an]] also repeatedly establishes Abraham's role as [[patriarch]] and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including [[Isaac]] (XV: 53), [[Jacob]] (XIX: 49)&lt;ref&gt;Other verses mentioning Jacob as a &quot;gift&quot; to Abraham include XXI: 72, XXIX: 27, VI: 84, XI: 71, XXXVIII: 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ishmael]] (II: 132-133). In the later chapters of the [[Qur'an]], Abraham's role becomes yet more prominent. The Qur'an mentions that Abraham and Ishmael were the reformers who set up the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] as a center of pilgrimage for [[monotheism]] (II: 124:141; III: 65-68, 95-97).&lt;ref&gt;Other verses dealing with the raising of the holy house include IV: 125, XXII: 26-29, 78&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an consistently refers to [[Islam]] as the &quot;religion of Abraham&quot; (''millat Ibrahim'') (II: 135) and Abraham is given a title as ''Hanif'' (''The Pure''; III: 67). The [[Qur'an]] also mentions Abraham as one whom God took as a friend (''Khalil''; IV: 125), hence Abraham's title in [[Islam]], ''Khalil-Ullah'' (''Friend of God''). Other instances in the [[Qur'an]] which are described in a concise manner are the rescue of Abraham from the fire into which he was thrown by his people (XXXVII: 97; XXI: 68-70); his pleading for his father (XIX: 47); his quarrel with an unrighteous and powerful king (II: 58) and the miracle of the dead birds (II: 260).

All these events and more have been embellished upon in [[Muslim]] [[tradition]], and especially in the ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'' and works of universal Islamic theology.&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Ibrahim''; ''Tales of the Prophets'', Kisa'i, ''Ibrahim''&lt;/ref&gt; Certain episodes from the life of Abraham have been more heavily detailed in Muslim literature, such as the arguments between Abraham and the evil king [[Nimrod]], the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of [[Hagar]] and [[Ishmael]], which [[Muslim]]s commemorate when performing [[pilgrimage]] in [[Mecca]]. In some cases, these legends in Muslim literature have influenced later [[Jewish]] [[tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Eisenberg, ''EI'', ''Ibrahim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] depicts a set of biblical stories, including Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. These sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] used for the burial of [[Junius Bassus]]. He died in [[359]].  This sarcophagus has been described as &quot;probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_early_christian_studies/v001/1.1.rutgers.html Journal of Early Christian Studies], Leonard Victor Rutgers, ''The Iconography of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus'' (review of Malbon book), Volume 1, Number 1, Spring 1993, pp. 94–96; for Janson it is also the &quot;finest Early Christian sarcophagus&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]],  was rediscovered in 1597,&lt;ref&gt;or 1595, see Elsner, p. 86n.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]) in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].  The base is approximately 4 × 8 × 4 feet. The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ's sacrifice in the [[New Testament]], in an early form of [[Typology (theology)|typology]].  Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion's den and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.

'''''Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael''''' by [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]. The artist created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models. The human condition was central to his concerns. On several occasions, Segal turned to the Old Testament as a source for his imagery. This sculture depicts the dilemma faced by Abraham when Sarah demanded that he expel Hagar and Ishmael. In the sculpture, the father's tenderness, Sarah's rage, and Hagar's resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. The sculpture was donated to the Miami Art Museum after the artist's death in 2000. This footnote provides a link to a picture of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiartmuseum.org/collection-selected-segalgeorge.asp Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael. ''George Segal.''

=== Literature ===

'''''[[Fear and Trembling]]''''' (original [[Danish language|Danish]] title: ''Frygt og Bæven'') is an influential philosophical work by [[Søren Kierkegaard]], published in [[1843]] under the pseudonym ''Johannes de silentio'' (''John the Silent'').  Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. … Anxiety is freedom’s possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all their deceptiveness. And no [[Tomás de Torquemada|Grand Inquisitor]] has such dreadful torments in readiness as anxiety has, and no secret agent knows as cunningly as anxiety to attack his suspect in his weakest moment or to make alluring the trap in which he will be caught, and no discerning judge understands how to interrogate and examine the accused as does anxiety, which never lets the accused escape, neither through amusement, nor by noise, nor during work, neither by day nor by night.&quot;—Vigilius Haufniensis ([[Pseudonym]]), ''The Concept of Anxiety'' by Soren Kierkegaard p. 155–156, Reidar Thomte, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; that must have been present in Abraham when God asked him to sacrifice his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022:1-2&amp;version=NASB Gen 22: 1–2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In each stanza, someone describes an unusual problem that is ultimately resolved on Highway 61. In Stanza 1, God tells Abraham to &quot;[[Binding of Isaac|kill me a son]]&quot;. God wants the killing done on Highway 61. Abram, the original name of the biblical Abraham, is also the name of Dylan's own father.

{{gnosticism}}

The word '''Abrasax''' ([[Greek language|Gk.]] ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ, which is far more common in the sources than the variant form '''Abraxas''', ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ) was a word of mystic meaning in the system of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[Basilides]], being there applied to the “Great [[Archon]]” (Gk., ''megas archōn''), the ''princeps'' of the 365 spheres (Gk., ''ouranoi'').&lt;ref&gt;''Cf''. Hippolytus, ''Refutatio'', vii. 14; Irenaeus, ''Adversus hæreses'', I. xxiv. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In Gnostic cosmology, the 7 letters spelling its name represent each of the [[classical planet|7 classic planets]]—Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;“He who has His seat within the Seven Poles—ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩ,” in the Magical Papyri. {{cite book|last=Mead|first=G.R.S.|url=http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th145.htm|chapter=XI. Concerning the Æon-Doctrine|title=Thrice-Greatest Hermes|volume=1|year=1906|location=London and Benares|publisher=The Theosophical Publishing Society|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is found in Gnostic texts such as the ''[[Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians|Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit]]'', and also appears in the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]. It was engraved on certain [[Engraved gem|antique gemstones]], called on that account '''Abraxas stones''', which were used as [[amulets]] or charms. As the initial spelling on stones was 'Abrasax' (Αβρασαξ), the spelling of  'Abraxas' seen today probably originates in the confusion made between the Greek letters [[Sigma]] and [[Xi]] in the Latin [[transliteration]]. The word may be related to [[Abracadabra]], although other explanations exist. 

There are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about Basilides' teaching, ancient Gnostic texts, the larger Greco-Roman magical traditions, and modern magical and esoteric writings. Opinions abound on Abraxas, who in recent centuries has been claimed to be both an [[Egypt]]ian god and a [[demon]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Demonographers have made him a demon, who has the head of a king and serpents for feet.&quot; {{cite book | authorlink = Collin de Plancy | last = Collin de Plancy | first = Jacques Auguste Simon | title = [[Dictionnaire Infernal]] | year = 1818 | chapter=Abracax or Abraxas | url = http://www.lucifer.tw/fantasy/artist/devil/pic/plancy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Psychologist [[Carl Jung]] wrote a short Gnostic treatise in 1916 called ''[[The Seven Sermons to the Dead]]'', which called Abraxas a God higher than the Christian God and Devil, that combines all opposites into one Being.

==Sources==
It is uncertain what the actual role and function of Abrasax was in the [[Basilideans|Basilidian system]], as our authorities often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of [[Basilides]] himself.

===As an archon===
[[Image:Abraxas3.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gemstone carved with Abrasax, obverse and reverse.]]

In the system described by [[Irenaeus]], &quot;the Unbegotten Father&quot; is the progenitor of ''[[Nous]]'', and from ''Nous [[Logos]]'', from ''Logos Phronesis'', from ''Phronesis [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'' and ''Dynamis'', from ''Sophia'' and ''Dynamis'' principalities, powers, and angels, the last of whom create &quot;the first heaven.&quot; They in turn originate a second series, who create a second heaven. The process continues in like manner until 365 heavens are in existence, the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world. &quot;The ruler&quot; [''principem, i.e.''. probably ''ton [[archon]]ta''] of the 365 heavens &quot;is Abraxas, and for this reason he contains within himself 365 numbers.&quot; 

The name occurs in the ''[[Philosophumena|Refutation of all Heresies]]'' (vii. 26) by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], who appears in these chapters to have followed the ''Exegetica'' of Basilides. After describing the manifestation of the Gospel in the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, he adds that the Basilidians have a long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several 'stages' of the upper world (''diastemata''), in which they speak of 365 heavens and say that &quot;their great [[archon]]&quot; is Abrasax, because his name contains the number 365, the number of the days in the year; i.e. the sum of the numbers denoted by the Greek letters in ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ according to the rules of [[isopsephy]] is 365:

:Α = 1, Β = 2, Ρ = 100, Α = 1, Σ = 200, Α = 1,  Ξ = 60

===As a god===
[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] (''[[Panarion|Haer]]''. 69, 73 f.) appears to follow partly Irenaeus, partly the lost Compendium of Hippolytus.&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius, R. A., ''Zur Quellenkritik d. Epiphanios'' 99 f.&lt;/ref&gt; He designates Abrasax more distinctly as &quot;the power above all, and First Principle,&quot; &quot;the cause and first archetype&quot; of all things; and mentions that the Basilidians referred to 365 as the number of parts (''mele'') in the human body, as well as of days in the year. 

The author of the appendix to Tertullian ''De Praescr. Haer''. (c. 4), who likewise follows Hippolytus's Compendium,&lt;ref&gt;Lipsius 33 f. &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; adds some further particulars; that 'Abraxas' gave birth to Mind (''nous''), the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by Irenaeus and Epiphanius; that the world, as well as the 365 heavens, was created in honour of 'Abraxas;' and that Christ was sent not by the Maker of the world but by 'Abraxas.'

Nothing can be built on the vague allusions of [[Jerome]], according to whom 'Abraxas' meant for Basilides &quot;the greatest God&quot; (''De vir. ill''. 21), &quot;the highest God&quot; (''Dial. adv. Lucif''. 23), &quot;the Almighty God&quot; (''Comm. in Amos'' iii. 9), and &quot;the Lord the Creator&quot; (''Comm. in Nah''. i. 11). The notices in [[Theodoret]] (''Haer. fab''. i. 4), [[Augustine]] (''Haer''. 4), and 'Praedestinatus' (i. 3), have no independent value.

It is evident from these particulars that Abrasax was the name of the first of the 365 Archons, and accordingly stood below Sophia and Dynamis and their progenitors; but his position is not expressly stated, so that the writer of the supplement to Tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with &quot;the Supreme God.&quot;

===As an Aeon===
With the availability of primary sources, such as the those in [[Nag Hammadi library]], the identity of Abrasax remains unclear. The ''Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit'', for instance, refers to Abrasax as an [[Aeon]] dwelling with [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] and other Aeons of the [[Pleroma]] in the light of the luminary Eleleth. In several texts, the luminary Eleleth is the last of the luminaries (Spiritual Lights) that come forward, and it is the Aeon Sophia, associated with Eleleth, who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the Demiurge's rule of this world, and the salvage effort that ensues.  As such, the role of Aeons of Eleleth, including Abrasax, Sophia, and others, pertains to this outer border of the Pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of Lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality.

== Abrasax stones ==
A vast number of engraved stones are in existence, to which the name &quot;Abrasax-stones&quot; has long been given. One particularly fine example was included as part of the [[Thetford treasure]] from fourth century Norfolk, UK. The subjects are mythological, and chiefly grotesque, with various inscriptions, in which ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ often occurs, alone or with other words. Sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription. In certain obscure magical writings of Egyptian origin ἀβραξάς or ἀβρασάξ is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gems;&lt;ref&gt;Reuvens (1830). ''Lett, à M. Letronne s. I. Pap. bilingues'', etc., Leyden&lt;/ref&gt; it is also found on the Greek metal ''tesseræ'' among other mystic words. The meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible: but some of the gems are amulets; and the same may be the case with nearly all.

=== Anguipede===
[[Image:Abraxas, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|Engraving from an Abrasax stone.]]
In a great majority of instances the name Abrasax is associated with a singular composite figure, having a [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]-like appearance somewhat resembling a [[basilisk]] or the Greek primordial god [[Chronos]] (not to be confused with the Greek titan [[Cronus]]). According to [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], &quot;as a Pantheus, i.e. All-God, he appears on the amulets with the head of a cock ([[Phœbus]]) or of a lion ([[Ra]] or [[Mithras]]), the body of a man, and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions, types of the [[Agathodaemon|Agathodaimon]]. In his right hand he grasps a club, or a flail, and in his left is a round or oval shield.&quot; This form was also referred to as the [[Anguipede]]. Budge surmised that Abrasax was &quot;a form of the [[Adam Kadmon]] of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] and the Primal Man whom God made in His own image.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = E. A. Wallis Budge | last = Budge |first = E. A. Wallis | title = Amulets and Superstitions | year = 1930 | pages = 209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parts at least of the figure above mentioned are [[solar symbol]]s, and the Basilidian Abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun. J. J. Bellermann has speculated that &quot;the whole represents the Supreme Being, with his Five great Emanations, each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem. Thus, from the human body, the usual form assigned to the Deity, forasmuch as it is written that God created man in his own image, issue the two supporters, ''Nous'' and ''Logos'', symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding, as typified by the serpents, for the same reason that had induced the old Greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to Pallas. His head—a cock's—represents ''Phronesis'', the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance. His two hands bear the badges of ''Sophia'' and ''Dynamis'', the shield of Wisdom, and the scourge of Power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased by {{cite book | authorlink = Charles William King | last = King | first = Charles William | title = The Gnostics and Their Remains | year = 1887 | page = 246| url = http://sacred-texts.com/gno/gar/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hebraic names===
These Abrasax-stones often bear Hebraic names of God: [[Iao]], [[Sabaoth]], [[Adonai]], [[Elohim|Eloai]]. The name ΙΑΩ, to which ΣΑΒΑΩΘ is sometimes added, is found with this figure even more frequently than ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ, and they are often combined. Beside an Abrasax figure the following, for instance, is found: IAΩ ABPAΣAΞ AΔΩN ΑΤΑ, &quot;Iao Abrasax, thou art the Lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bellermann, ''Versuch,'' iii., No. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Abrasax-shield are also found the divine names Sabaoth Iao, Iao Abrasax, Adonai Abrasax, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Baudissin, ''Studien zur Semitischen Religionsgeschichte,'' i. 189 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magical papyri===
The [[Greek Magical Papyri|magic papyri]] reflect the same ideas as the Abrasax-gems. The following example will suffice: &quot;Iao Sabaoth, Adonai . . . Abrasax&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wessely, ''Neue Zauberpapyri,'' p. 27, No. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The patriarchs are sometimes addressed as deities; for which fact many instances may be adduced. In the group &quot;Iakoubia, Iaosabaoth Adonai Abrasax,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. p. 44, No. 715&lt;/ref&gt; the first name seems to be composed of [[Jacob]] and Ya. 

The Leyden papyrus recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon:
{{quote|[24] Ho! Sax, Amun, Sax, Abrasax; for thou art the moon, (25) the chief of the stars, he that did form them, listen to the things that I have(?) said, follow the (words) of my mouth, reveal thyself to me, Than, (26) Thana, Thanatha, otherwise Thei, this is my correct name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leiden (The Leyden Papyrus)|author=Griffith, F. Ll. and Thompson, Herbert|year=1904|chapter=Col. XXIII|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/dmp/dmp26.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The magic word &quot;Ablanathanalba,&quot; which reads in Greek the same backward as forward, also occurs in the Abrasax-stones as well as in the magic papyri. This word is usually conceded to be derived from the Hebrew (Aramaic), meaning &quot;Thou art our father&quot; (אב לן את), and also occurs in connection with Abrasax; the following inscription is found upon a metal plate in the Carlsruhe Museum:

&lt;center&gt;АВРАΣАΞ&lt;br&gt;
ΑΒΛΑΝΑΘ&lt;br&gt;
ΑΝΑΛΒΑ&lt;/center&gt;

===Origin===
In the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of a name known as Basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as a sufficient mark of origin, and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of Gnostics. During the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems which had no claim to be considered in any sense Gnostic, or specially Basilidian, or connected with Abrasax. The subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants, but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes:
* ''Abrasax'', or stones of Basilidian origin
* ''Abrasaxtes'', or stones originating in ancient forms of worship, and adapted by the Gnostics
* ''Abraxoïdes'', or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of Basilides

While it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of Gnostics, there is no valid reason for attributing any or all of them to such an origin. The fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock, a lion, or an ass, and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what Irenaeus says about the followers of Basilides: 

{{quote|These men, moreover, practise magic, and use images, incantations, invocations, and every other kind of curious art. Coining also certain names as if they were those of the angels, they proclaim some of these as belonging to the first, and others to the second heaven; and then they strive to set forth the names, principles, angels, and powers of the 365 imagined heavens.|''Adversus hæreses'', I. xxiv. 5; ''cf''. Epiph. ''Haer''. 69 D; Philastr. ''Suer''. 32}}
 
Incantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid Gnosticism planted in [[Spain]] and southern [[Gaul]] at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth, which [[Jerome]] connects with Basilides, and which (according to his ''Epist''., lxxv.) used the name Abrasax.

It is therefore not unlikely that some Gnostics used amulets, though the confident assertions of modern writers to this effect rest on no authority. [[Isaac de Beausobre]] properly calls attention to the significant silence of [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] in the two passages in which he instructs the Christians of [[Alexandria]] on the right use of rings and gems, and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them (''Paed''. 241 ff.; 287 ff.). But no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of Gnostic mythology has had any success, and ''Abrasax'' is the only Gnostic term found in the accompanying legends which is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies. The present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the Basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown. 

Having due regard to the magic papyri, in which many of the unintelligible names of the Abrasax-stones reappear, besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes, it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic.

==Etymology==
[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (''Fab''. 183) gives ''Abrax Aslo Therbeeo'' as names of horses of the sun mentioned by '[[Homer]]us.' The passage is miserably corrupt: but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make Abraxas.

The proper form of the name is evidently ''Abrasax'', as with the Greek writers, Hippolytus, Epiphanias, Didymus (''De Trin''. iii. 42), and Theodoret; also [[Augustine]] and 'Praedestinatus'; and in nearly all the legends on gems. By a probably euphonic inversion the translator of Irenaeus and the other Latin authors have ''Abraxas'', which is found in the magical papyri, and even, though most sparingly, on engraved stones.

The attempts to discover a derivation for the name, Greek, Hebrew, Coptic, or other, have not been entirely successful:

===Egyptian===
*[[Claudius Salmasius]] thought it Egyptian, but never gave the proofs which he promised.
*[[Friedrich Münter]] separates it into two Coptic words signifying “new fangled title.”
*J. J. Bellermann thinks it a compound of the Egyptian words ''abrak'' and ''sax'', meaning “the honorable and hallowed word,” or “the word is adorable.”
*[[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]] finds in it an Egyptian invocation to the Godhead, meaning “hurt me not.”

===Hebrew===
* Abraham Geiger sees in it a Grecized form of ''ha-berakhah'', “the blessing,” a meaning which C.W. King declares philologically untenable.
*J. B. Passerius derives it from ''abh'', “father,” ''bara'', “to create,” and ''a-'' negative—“the uncreated Father.”
*Giuseppe Barzilai goes back for explanation to the first verse of the prayer attributed to Rabbi [[Nehunya ben ha-Kanah]], the literal rendering of which is “O [God], with thy mighty right hand deliver the unhappy [people],” forming from the initial and final letters of the words the word ''Abrakd'' (pronounced Abrakad), with the meaning “the host of the winged ones,” i.e., angels. But this extremely ingenious theory would at most explain only the mystic word ''Abracadabra'', whose connection with Abrasax is by no means certain.

===Greek===
* Wendelin discovers a compound of the initial letters, amounting to 365 in numerical value, of four Hebrew and three Greek words, all written with Greek characters: ''ab, ben, rouach, hakadōs; sōtēria apo xylou'' (“Father, Son, Spirit, holy; salvation from the cross”).
*According to a note of Isaac de Beausobre’s, [[Jean Hardouin]] accepted the first three of these, taking the four others for the initials of the Greek ''anthrōpoussōzōn hagiōi xylōi'', “saving mankind by the holy cross.”
*[[Isaac de Beausobre]] derives Abrasax from the Greek ''habros'' and ''saō'', “the beautiful, the glorious Savior.”

Perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by [[Adolf von Harnack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Adolf von|last=Harnack|title=Über das gnostische Buch Pistis-Sophia|journal=TU|volume=vii. 2|year=1891|pages=86–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; “which belong to no known speech, and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect, or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration.” 

Yet we may with better reason suppose that it came originally from a foreign mythology, and that the accident of its numerical value in Greek merely caused it to be singled out at Alexandria for religious use. It is worth notice that [[Mithras|ΜΕΙΘΡΑΣ]] and [[Nile|ΝΕΙΛΟΣ]] have the same value. The Egyptian author of the book ''[[De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum|De Mysteriis]]'' in reply to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (vii. 4) admits a preference of 'barbarous' to vernacular names in sacred things, urging a peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations, as the Egyptians and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]; and Origen (''Contra Cels''. i. 24) refers to the 'potent names' used by Egyptian sages, [[Persia]]n [[Magi]], and Indian [[Brahmin]]s, signifying deities in the several languages.

===Carl Jung (Seven Sermons to the Dead)===
{{Main|Seven Sermons to the Dead}}

Abraxas is an important figure in ''Seven Sermons'', a representation of the driving force of individuation (synthesis, maturity, oneness), referred with the figures for the driving forces of differentiation (emergence of consciousness and opposites), Helios God-the-Sun, and the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeller S. A., The Gnostic Jung and The Seven Sermons to the Dead, Quest Books, Wheaton, 2006, ISBN 978-0-8356-0568-7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;There is a God about whom you know nothing, because men have forgotten him. We call him by his name: Abraxas. He is less definite than God or Devil....

&quot;Abraxas is activity: nothing can resist him but the unreal.... Abraxas stands above the sun[-god] and above the devil.... If the Pleroma were capable of having a being, Abraxas would be its manifestation.&quot;|2nd Sermon}}

{{quote|&quot;That which is spoken by God-the-Sun is life; that which is spoken by the Devil is death; Abraxas speaketh that hallowed and accursed word, which is life and death at the same time. Abraxas begetteth truth and lying, good and evil, light and darkness in the same word and in the same act. Wherefore is Abraxas terrible.&quot;|3rd Sermon}}

===Aleister Crowley===
Abraxas is invoked in the [[The Gnostic Mass]] of the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]]:

[[Image:Gustave dore bibel death of absalom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Death of Absalom by [[Gustave Dore]]]]
According to the [[Bible]], '''Absalom''' or '''Avshalom''' ({{Hebrew Name|אַבְשָלוֹם|Avshalom|ʼAḇšālôm|&quot;Father/Leader of/is peace&quot; or &quot;Salem is my Father&quot;}}) was the third son of [[David (biblical king)|David]], [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King of Israel]] with [[Maachah]], daughter of [[Talmai]], King of [[Geshur]]. ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3|HE}}) 

{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:25|NIV}} describes him as the most handsome man in the kingdom.  Absalom eventually rebelled against his father and was killed during the Battle of Ephraim Wood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sam%2014:25&amp;version=49 2 Samuel 14:25]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Amnon==
[[File:Convito di Ansalonne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[The Banquet of Absalom]] attributed to [[Niccolò de Simone]] around 1650]]
After his full sister [[Tamar (David's daughter)|Tamar]] was raped by their half-brother, [[Amnon]], David's eldest son Absalom waited two years and avenged her by sending his servants to murder Amnon at a feast to which he had invited all the king's sons. ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13|NIV}})

After this deed he fled to [[Talmai]], the king of [[Geshur]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13:37|NIV}}) (see also {{bibleverse||Joshua|12:5|NIV}} or {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|13:2|NIV}}), his maternal grandfather, and it was not until three years later that he was fully reinstated in his father's favour and finally returned to Jerusalem. ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13-14|NIV}}) (see [[Joab]])

==The Revolt at Hebron==
While at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself among the populace by promising justice for all &quot;if only I were appointed judge in the land&quot;, and by showing humility by kissing those who approached him rather than accepting supplication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20samuel%2015&amp;version=NIV Bible Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:InsideAbsalom'sPillar.jpg|thumb|[[Valley of Jehoshaphat]] and [[Hinnom]] [[Jerusalem]]. Stairway in Absalom's Pillar; Another view inside [[Absalom's Pillar]]]]
After forty years he decided to declare himself king, sleeping with his father's concubines, then raised a revolt at [[Hebron]], the former capital.  All Israel and Judah flocked to his side, and David, attended only by the [[Cherethites]] and [[Pelethites]] and some recent recruits from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained behind in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies.  Absalom reached the capital and took counsel with the renowned [[Ahithophel]] (sometimes spelled Achitophel).

David took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the [[Jordan River]].  However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, [[Hushai]], to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it.  Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead prepare his forces for a major attack.  This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the coming battle.

==The Battle of Ephraim Wood==

[[Image:Yerushalayim Tomb of Absalom 1860s.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of [[Tomb of Absalom|Absalom's Tomb]] in Kidron Valley - 1860s]]
A fateful battle was fought in the [[Wood of Ephraim]] (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2016-18&amp;version=NASB 2 Samuel 16-18]&lt;/ref&gt;  Absalom himself was caught by his head in the boughs of an oak-tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it - an irony given that he was previously renowned for his abundant hair and handsome head. He was discovered hanging there still alive by one of David's men, who reported the matter to [[Joab]], the king's commander. Joab avenged David by fatally striking and killing Absalom, by the use of three spears, followed by a group of swordsmen, an act that caused David great sorrow.

==Memorial to Absalom==

Another monument near [[Jerusalem]] (not the modern &quot;Absalom Tomb&quot; - &quot;[[Yad Avshalom]]&quot; which is of later origin) was erected by Absalom in his lifetime to perpetuate his name ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:18|NIV}}):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's monument''.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Abydos''' ({{IPA-en|əˈbaɪd.ɒs}}) is the common [[English language|English]] name of one of the most ancient cities of [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]], and also of the eight [[Nome (Egypt)|Upper Nome]] of which it was the capital city. It is located about 11&amp;nbsp;kilometres (6.8&amp;nbsp;mi) west of the [[Nile]] at latitude 26° 10' N, near the modern Egyptian towns of [[el-'Araba el Madfuna]] and [[al-Balyana]].  The city was called '''Abdju''' in the ancient [[Egyptian language]] ('''''3b&lt;u&gt;d&lt;/u&gt;w''''' or '''''AbDw''''' as [[Manuel de Codage|technically transcribed]] from [[hieroglyph]]s) meaning &quot;the hill of the symbol or reliquary&quot;, a reference to a [[reliquary]] in which the sacred head of [[Osiris]] was preserved.

Considered one of the most important archaeological sites of [[Ancient Egypt]], the sacred city of Abydos was the site of many ancient [[Egyptian temple|temples]], including [[Umm el-Qa'ab]], a royal [[necropolis]] where early [[pharaohs]] were entombed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/abydos/abydoskingstombs.html |title=Tombs of kings of the First and Second Dynasty |accessdate=2008-01-15 |publisher=UCL |work=Digital Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tombs began to be seen as extremely significant burials and in later times it became desirable to be buried in the area, leading to the growth of the town's importance as a cult site.

Today, Abydos is notable for the memorial temple of [[Seti I]], which contains an inscription from the nineteenth dynasty known to the modern world as the [[Abydos King List]]. It is a chronological list showing [[cartouche]]s of most dynastic [[pharaoh]]s of Egypt from [[Menes]] until [[Ramesses I]], Seti's father.&lt;ref name=TEwjb&gt;{{cite web |author=Misty Cryer |title=Travellers in Egypt - William John Bankes |year=2006 |work=TravellersinEgypt.org |url=http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2004/10/william_john_bankes.html TravEgypt-WJB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Temple and most of the [[Kom el-Sultan|ancient town]] are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the Seti temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/abydos/abydostown.html|title=Abydos town |accessdate=2008-01-15 |publisher=UCL |work=Digital Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the original structures and the artifacts within them are considered irretrievable and lost; many may have been destroyed by the new construction.

The English name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Άβυδος, a name borrowed by Greek geographers from the unrelated city of [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]] on the [[Hellespont]].

==History==

{{Hiero|1=Name of Abydos|2=&lt;hiero&gt;Ab-b-Dw:O49&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=Egypt}}

[[File:Abydos.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Abydos on the map of [[Egypt]]]]
Abydos was occupied by the rulers of the [[Predynastic Period of Egypt|Predynastic period]],&lt;ref&gt;[[William Flinders Petrie]], ''Abydos'', ii. 64&lt;/ref&gt; whose town, temple and tombs have been found there. The temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|thirtieth dynasty]], and the cemetery was used continuously.

The pharaohs of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]] were buried in Abydos, including [[Narmer]], who is regarded as founder of the first dynasty, and his successor, [[Hor-Aha|Aha]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this time period that the [[Ancient Egyptian Boats (First Dynasty) – Abydos|Abydos boats]] were constructed. Some pharaohs of the second dynasty were also buried in Abydos. The temple was renewed and enlarged by these pharaohs as well. Funerary enclosures, misinterpreted in modern times as great 'forts', were built on the desert behind the town by three kings of the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|second dynasty]]; the most complete is that of [[Khasekhemwy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/abydos/abydosfuneraryenclosures.html|title= The Funerary Enclosures of Abydos|accessdate=2008-01-15|work=Digitial Egypt|publisher=UCL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|fifth dynasty]], the deity [[Khenti-Amentiu|Khentiamentiu]], '''''foremost of the Westerners''''', came to be seen as a manifestation of the dead pharaoh in the underworld. [[Pepi I]] ([[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|sixth dynasty]]) constructed a funerary chapel which evolved over the years into the Great Temple of [[Osiris]], the ruins of which still exist within the town enclosure. Abydos became the centre of the worship of the [[Isis]] and Osiris cult.

During the [[First Intermediate Period]], the principal deity of the area, Khentiamentiu, began to be seen as an aspect of [[Osiris]], and the deities gradually merged and became regarded as one, with Osiris being assigned the [[epithet]], ''Foremost of the Westerners''. In the [[twelfth dynasty of Egypt|twelfth dynasty]] a gigantic tomb was cut into the rock by [[Senusret III]]. Associated with this tomb was a ''cenotaph'', a cult temple and a small town known as ''Wah-Sut'', that was used by the workers for these structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;bvzwvt&quot;&gt;Harvey, EA24, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFEC-ABYDOS-2010-056.JPG|thumb|200px|Part of the ''Abydos King List'']]
The building during the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]] began with a large chapel of [[Ahmose I]]. Then [[Thutmose III]] built a far larger temple, about 130 × 200&amp;nbsp;ft (40 x 61&amp;nbsp;m). He also made a processional way leading past the side of the temple to the cemetery beyond, featuring a great gateway of granite.

[[Seti I]], in the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|nineteenth dynasty]], founded a temple to the south of the town in honor of the ancestral pharaohs of the early dynasties; this was finished by [[Ramesses II]], who also built a lesser temple of his own. [[Merneptah]] added the  [[Osireion]] just to the north of the temple of Seti.&lt;ref name=&quot;bvzwvt&quot; /&gt;

[[Ahmose II]] in the twenty-sixth dynasty rebuilt the temple again, and placed in it a large monolith shrine of red granite, finely wrought. The foundations of the successive temples were comprised within approximately 18&amp;nbsp;ft (5.5&amp;nbsp;m). depth of the ruins discovered in modern times; these needed the closest examination to discriminate the various buildings, and were recorded by more than 4000 measurements and 1000 levellings.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Abydos'', ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest building was a new temple of [[Nectanebo I]], built in the thirtieth dynasty. From the [[Ptolemaic Period|Ptolemaic]] times of the Greek occupancy of Egypt, that began three hundred years before the Roman occupancy that followed, the structure began to decay and no later works are known.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Abydos'', i. and ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult centre==
[[File:Journey of the dead to Abydos.jpg|right|thumb|Tomb relief depicting the vizier Nespeqashuty and his wife, KetjKetj, making the journey of the dead to the holy city of Abydos - from [[Deir el-Bahri]], [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], [[twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]], reign of [[Psammetichus I]]]]
From earliest times, Abydos was a cult centre, first of the local deity, Khentiamentiu, and from the end of the Old Kingdom, the rising cult of Osiris and Isis.

A tradition developed that the [[Umm el-Qa'ab|Early Dynastic cemetery]] was the burial place of Osiris and the tomb of [[Djer]] was reinterpreted as that of Osiris.

Decorations in tombs throughout Egypt, such as the one displayed to the right, record journeys to and from Abydos, as important pilgrimages made by individuals who were proud to have been able to make the vital trip.

==Major constructions==
===Great Osiris Temple===
[[File:SFEC-L-ABYDOS11.JPG|thumb|300px|Panel from the Osiris temple: Horus presents royal regalia to a worshipping pharaoh.]]
[[File:Osireion.jpg|thumb|300px|]]

Successively from the first dynasty to the [[twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|twenty-sixth dynasty]], nine or ten temples were built on one site at Abydos. The first was an enclosure, about 30 × 50&amp;nbsp;ft (9 x 15&amp;nbsp;m), surrounded by a thin wall of unbaked bricks. Incorporating one wall of this first structure, the second temple of about 40&amp;nbsp;ft (12&amp;nbsp;m) square was built within a wall about 10&amp;nbsp;ft (3&amp;nbsp;m) thick. An outer ''temenos'' (enclosure) wall surrounded the grounds. This outer wall was thickened about the second or [[Third dynasty of Egypt|third dynasty]]. The old temple entirely vanished in the fourth dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes.

Pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and probably were the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by [[Khufu (pharaoh)|Khufu]] (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.

At an undetermined date, a great clearance of temple offerings had been made and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered has yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty. A vase of [[Menes]] with purple [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces found. The noble statuette of Cheops in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh.

The temple was rebuilt entirely on a larger scale by [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi I]] in the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|sixth dynasty]]. He placed a great stone gateway to the temenos, an outer temenos wall and gateway, with a colonnade between the gates. His temple was about 40 × 50&amp;nbsp;ft (12 x 15&amp;nbsp;m) inside, with stone gateways front and back, showing that it was of the processional type. In the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|eleventh dynasty]] [[Mentuhotep I]] added a colonnade and altars. Soon after, [[Mentuhotep II]] entirely rebuilt the temple, laying a stone pavement over the area, about 45&amp;nbsp;ft (14&amp;nbsp;m) square, and added subsidiary chambers. Soon thereafter in the twelfth dynasty, [[Senusret I]] laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor. A great temenos was laid out enclosing a much larger area and the new temple itself was about three times the earlier size.

===Temple of Seti===
[[File:Abydos Seti I.jpg|thumb|250px|Temple of Seti I, Abydos]]

The temple of Seti I was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described. This surviving building is best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight. A principal purpose of it was the adoration of the early pharaohs, whose cemetery, for which it forms a great funerary chapel, lies behind it. The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties—recognized by Seti—are carved on a wall and known as the &quot;[[Abydos King List]]&quot; (showing the [[cartouche]] name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first, [[Narmer]] or [[Menes]], until his time)- with the exception of those noted above. There were significant names deliberately left out of the list. So rare as an almost complete list of pharaoh names, the Table of Abydos, re-discovered by [[William John Bankes]], has been called the &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; of Egyptian archaeology, analogous to the [[Rosetta Stone]] for Egyptian writing, beyond the [[Narmer Palette]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Misty Cryer, &quot;Travellers in Egypt - William John Bankes&quot; (2006), TravellersinEgypt.org, web: [http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2004/10/william_john_bankes.html TravEgypt-WJB]: re-discovered Table of Abydos.&lt;/ref&gt;

There also were seven chapels built for the worship of the pharaoh and principal deities. At the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as [[The Osirion]] thought to be connected with the worship of [[Osiris]] (Caulfield, ''Temple of the Kings''); and probably from those chambers led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah (Murray, ''The Osireion at Abydos''). The temple was originally 550&amp;nbsp;ft (168&amp;nbsp;m) long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about
250&amp;nbsp;ft (76&amp;nbsp;m) long and 350&amp;nbsp;ft (107&amp;nbsp;m) wide, including the wing at the side.

Except for the list of pharaohs and a [[panegyric]] on [[Ramesses II]], the subjects are not historical, but mythological. The work is celebrated for its delicacy and artistic refinement, but lacks the life and character of that in earlier ages. The sculptures had been published mostly in hand copy, not facsimile, by [[Auguste Mariette]] in his ''Abydos'', i.

===Ramesses II temple===

The adjacent temple of Ramesses II was much smaller and simpler in plan; but it had a fine historical series of scenes around the outside that lauded his achievements, of which the lower parts remain. The outside of the temple was decorated with scenes of the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. His list of pharaohs, similar to that of Seti I, formerly stood here; but the fragments were removed by the French consul and sold to the [[British Museum]].

==Tombs==
{{main|Umm el-Qa'ab}}
[[File:SFEC-ABYDOS-2010-060.JPG|thumb|200px|left| Seti I, wearing the [[Deshret]] crown of Lower Egypt, with Prince Rammeses, (Rammeses II) is ready to rope the sacred bull for sacrifice]]
The Royal necropolis of the earliest dynasties were placed about a mile into the great desert plain, in a place now known as [[Umm el-Qa'ab]], ''The Mother of Pots'', because of the shards remaining from all of the devotional objects left by religious pilgrims. The earliest burial is about 10×20&amp;nbsp;ft (3 x 6&amp;nbsp;m) inside, a pit lined with brick walls, and originally roofed with timber and matting. Others also built before Menes are 15×25&amp;nbsp;ft (4.6 x 7.6&amp;nbsp;m).

The probable tomb of Menes is of the latter size. Afterward the tombs increase in size and complexity. The tomb-pit is surrounded by chambers to hold offerings, the [[sepulchre]] being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick-lined pit. Rows of small pits, tombs for the servants of the pharaoh surround the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual. Some of the offerings included sacrificed animals, such as the asses found in the tomb of [[Merneith]]. Evidence of human sacrifices exists in the early tombs, but this practice was changed into symbolic offerings later.

By the end of the second dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage bordered with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies, covered a space of over
3,000 square kilometres (740,000&amp;nbsp;acres), however it is possible for this to be several tombs which have met in the making of a tomb; the Egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs. The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The seals of various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Royal Tombs'', i. and ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery of private persons began during the first dynasty with some pit-tombs in the town. It was extensive in the twelfth and thirteenth dynasties and contained many rich tombs. A large number of fine tombs were made in the eighteenth to twentieth dynasties, and members of later dynasties continued to bury their dead here until Roman times. Many hundreds of funeral steles were removed by Mariette's workmen, without any record of the burials being made.&lt;ref&gt;Mariette, ''Abydos'', ii. and iii.&lt;/ref&gt; Later excavations have been recorded by [[Edward R. Ayrton]], Abydos, iii.; Maclver, ''El Amrah and Abydos''; and [[Garstang]], ''El Arabah''.

==&quot;Forts&quot;==
Some of the tomb structures, referred to as &quot;forts&quot; by modern researchers, lay behind the town. Known as [[Shunet ez Zebib]], it is about 450 × 250&amp;nbsp;ft (137 x 76&amp;nbsp;m) over all, and one still stands 30-ft (9&amp;nbsp;m) high. It was built by [[Khasekhemwy]], the last pharaoh of the second dynasty. Another structure nearly as large adjoined it, and probably is older than that of Khasekhemwy. A third &quot;fort&quot; of a squarer form is now occupied by the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] convent; its age cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Ayrton, Abydos, iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The &quot;mysterious&quot; hieroglyphs in Temple of Seti I==
[[File:Hieroglif_z_Abydos.jpg|thumb|250px|The mysterious hieroglyphs in Temple of Seti I. which are said to represent modern vehicles as a helicopter, a submarine, a zeppelin and a glider. ]]
Some of the hieroglyphs carved over an arch on the site have been miss-interpreted in esoteric mysticist and &quot;ufological&quot; circles as depicting modern technology.

Often described as a helicopter, a battle tank or submarine, and a fighterplane or even a U.F.O.. But this is partly based on widely distributed retouched images that removed key details from the carvings. When examining the original hieroglyphs the provocative images are commonly explained as being the result of erosion, and later adjustments, or re-writing over the original inscriptions that left parts of the older text visible creating the illusion of modern looking machines. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufocom.org/pages/v_us/m_archeo/Abydos/abydos.html ufocom.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catchpenny.org/abydos.html Pharaoh's Helicopter?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~A_U_R_A/abydos.html &quot;Helicopter Hieroglyph&quot; Explained!]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thracian chersonese.png|thumb|Abydos and the Hellespont]]
[[File:Etty Parting 1827.jpg|thumb|[[Hero and Leander]]]]
'''Abydos''' (Greek: Άβυδος), an ancient city of [[Mysia]], in [[Asia Minor]], situated at Nara Burnu or [[Nagara Point]] on the best harbor on the Asiatic shore of the [[Hellespont]]. Across Abydos lies [[Sestus]] on the European side marking the shortest point in the [[Dardanelles]], scarcely a mile broad. The strategic site has been a prohibited zone in the twentieth century. [[Hero and Leander]]'s story took place near Abydos.   

Abydos was first mentioned in the catalogue of Trojan allies (''[[Iliad]]'' ii.836). It probably was  a [[Thracians|Thracian]] town, as [[Strabo]] has it, but was afterwards colonized by [[Miletus|Milesians]], with the consent of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges, king of Lydia]], around 700 BC.  It was occupied by the Persians in [[514 BC]], and [[Darius]] burnt it in [[512 BC|512]].  Here [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] built two bridges of boats and crossed the strait in [[480 BC]] when he [[Greco-Persian Wars|invaded Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]].  ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 7.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abydos thereafter became a member of the [[Delian League]], until it revolted from Athenian rule in [[411 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]].  ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/jthucbk8rv2.htm 8.61-2].&lt;/ref&gt;  It allied itself to [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], until [[394 BC]]; King [[Agesilaus]] of Sparta crossed here while returning to Greece.  Abydos then passed under [[Achaemenid]] rule, until [[334 BC]].  [[Alexander the Great]] threw a spear to Abydos while crossing the strait and claimed Asia as his own.

Abydos is celebrated for the vigorous resistance it made against [[Philip V of Macedon]] in [[200 BC]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]].  ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/16*.html 16.29-34]&lt;/ref&gt; and is famed in myth as the home of [[Hero and Leander|Leander]].  It minted coins from the early fifth century BC to the mid-third century AD. 

The town remained until late Byzantine times an important toll and customs station of the Hellespont, its importance thereafter being transferred to the [[Dardanelles]], after the building of the &quot;Old Castles&quot; by Sultan [[Mehmet II]] (c. 1456).

'''''Acacia''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|k|eɪ|ʃ|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|i|ə}}) is a [[genus]] of [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s belonging to the [[subfamily]] [[Mimosoideae]] of the family [[Fabaceae]], first described in [[Africa]] by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1773. Many non-Australian species tend to be [[Thorns, spines and prickles|thorny]], whereas the majority of [[Australia]]n acacias are not. They are [[Legume|pod]]-bearing, with sap and leaves typically bearing large amounts of [[tannin]]s and [[condensed tannin]]s that historically in many species found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.

The generic name derives from ακακία (''akakia''), the name given by early Greek botanist-physician [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (ca. 40-90) to the medicinal tree ''[[Acacia nilotica|A. nilotica]]'' in his book ''[[Materia medica|Materia Medica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Acacia-nilotica.htm |title=''Acacia nilotica'' (acacia) |work=Plants &amp; Fungi |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for its characteristic thorns, ακις (''akis,'' '''thorn''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=esMPU5DHEGgC |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names |volume=1 A-C |year=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-2675-2 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species name ''nilotica'' was given by Linnaeus from this tree's best-known range along the [[Nile]] river.

Acacias are also known as '''thorntrees''', '''[[whistling thorn]]s''' or '''wattles''', including the '''yellow-fever acacia''' and '''umbrella acacias'''.

Until 2005, there were thought to be roughly 1300 [[species]] of acacia worldwide, about 960 of them native to Australia, with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm-[[temperate]] regions of both hemispheres, including [[Europe]], Africa, southern [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]]. However, the genus was then divided into five, with the name ''Acacia'' retained for the Australian species (and a few in tropical Asia, [[Madagascar]] and [[Pacific Islands]]), and most of the species outside Australia divided into ''[[Vachellia]]'' and ''[[Senegalia]]''. The two final genera, ''[[Acaciella]]'' and ''[[Mariosousa]]'', only contain about a dozen species from the Americas each.

== Classification ==
[[File:Acacia pycnantha Golden Wattle.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;''[[Acacia pycnantha]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[File:Acacia-berlandieri-flowers4.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''[[Acacia berlandieri]]&lt;/center&gt;'']]
[[File:Acacia smallii 2.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''[[Acacia smallii]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]

The genus ''Acacia'' is evidently not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. This discovery has led to the breaking up of ''Acacia'' into five new genera as discussed in: [[List of Acacia species]]. In common parlance, the term &quot;acacia&quot; is occasionally misapplied to species of the genus ''[[Robinia]]'', which also belongs in the [[pea]] family. ''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]'', an American species locally known as Black Locust, is sometimes called &quot;false acacia&quot; in [[cultivation]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

== Geography ==
The southernmost species in the genus are ''[[Acacia dealbata]]'' (Silver Wattle), ''[[Acacia longifolia]]'' (Coast Wattle or Sydney Golden Wattle), ''[[Acacia mearnsii]]'' (Black Wattle), and ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]'' (Blackwood), reaching 43°30' S in [[Tasmania]], Australia, while ''[[Acacia caven]]'' (''Espinillo Negro'') reaches nearly as far south in northeastern [[Chubut Province]] of [[Argentina]]. Australian species are usually called wattles, while African and American species tend to be known as acacias.

[[File:Acacia melanoxylon2.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;''[[Acacia retinodes]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]

''[[Acacia albida]]'', ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'' and ''Acacia iraqensis'' can be found growing wild in the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] desert and the [[Jordan River|Jordan]] valley. It is found in the savanna vegetation of the tropical continental climate. It grows wild in Montserrat West Indies; there it is locally referred to as 'cusha.'

== Description ==
The [[Leaf|leaves]] of acacias are compound [[pinnate]] in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and [[Pacific islands]] species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]) become vertically flattened, and serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as [[phyllode]]s. The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight, as with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light so fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as ''[[Acacia glaucoptera]]'') lack leaves or phyllodes altogether, but possess instead [[cladode]]s, modified leaf-like [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] stems functioning as leaves.
[[File:Acacia dealbata.jpg||thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''[[Acacia dealbata]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]

The small [[flower]]s have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long [[stamens]], and are arranged in dense globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, even purple (''Acacia purpureapetala'') or red (''[[Acacia leprosa]]'' Scarlet Blaze). ''Acacia'' flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, ''[[Albizia]]'',  by their stamens which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual ''[[Mimosa]]'' flowers, those of ''Acacia'' have more than 10 stamens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurcharan|title=Plant Systematics: An Integrated Approach|publisher=Science Publishers|year=2004|page=445|isbn=978-1-57808-351-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=In_Lv8iMt24C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches which have become short, hard and pungent, or sometimes leaf-[[stipule]]s. ''[[Acacia armata]]'' is the Kangaroo-thorn of Australia and ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'' is the Camelthorn of Africa.

Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80&amp;nbsp;°C) and manual seed coat chipping can improve yields to approximately 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J Clemens, PG Jones, NH Gilbert|date=|year=1977|month=|title=Effect of seed treatments on germination in Acacia|journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=269–267 |pmid=|doi=10.1071/BT9770269|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/65/paper/BT9770269.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbiosis==
[[File:Acacia collinsii3.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''Acacia collinsii'' Thorns&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the [[Central American]] ''[[Acacia sphaerocephala]]'', ''[[Acacia cornigera]]'', and ''[[Acacia collinsii]]'' (collectively known as the ''bullthorn acacias''), the large thorn-like stipules are hollow and afford shelter for several species of [[Pseudomyrmex]] ants, which feed on a secretion of sap on the leaf-stalk and small, [[lipid]]-rich food-bodies at the tips of the leaflets called [[Beltian body|Beltian bodies]]. In return, the [[ant]]s add protection to the plant against [[herbivores]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Some species of ants will also fight off competing plants around the acacia, cutting off the offending plant's leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing it. Other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts.

Similar mutualisms with ants occur on Acacia trees in Africa, such as the [[Whistling Thorn]] acacia. The acacias provide shelter for ants in the thorns and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants such as ''[[Crematogaster mimosae]]''. In turn, the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem-boring beetles that damage the plant.

== Pests ==
In Australia, ''Acacia'' species are sometimes used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of [[Hepialidae|hepialid]] [[moth]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Aenetus]]'' including ''A. ligniveren''. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other [[Lepidoptera]] larvae which have been recorded feeding on ''Acacia'' include [[Brown-tail]], ''[[Endoclita|Endoclita malabaricus]]'' and [[Turnip Moth]]. The leaf-mining larvae of some [[Bucculatricidae|bucculatricid]] [[moth]]s also feed on ''Acacia'': ''[[idae|Bucculatrix agilis]]'' feeds exclusively on ''[[Acacia horrida]]'' and ''[[Bucculatricidae|Bucculatrix flexuosa]]'' feeds exclusively on ''[[Acacia nilotica]]''.

Acacias contain a number of [[organic compound]]s that defend them from pests and grazing animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;chem&quot;&gt;[http://uvalde.tamu.edu/pdf/chemtdaf.pdf Chemistry of Acacias from South Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
=== Food uses ===
[[File:Hauxya Botana.jpg|thumb|Acacia seed pods, also known as Guajes, served as part of a [[botana]] in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico.]]
[[File:AcaciaSeeds.JPG|thumb|Acacia seeds in the [[Negev]], [[Israel]].]]
[[Acacia seed]]s are often used for food and a variety of other products.

In [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]], the feathery shoots of ''Acacia pennata'' (common name ''cha-om'', ชะอม and ''su pout ywet'' in Burmese) are used in [[soup]]s, [[curry|curries]], [[omelette]]s, and [[stir fry|stir-fries]].

In [[Mexico]] the seeds are known as Guajes.  Guajes or huajes are the flat, green pods of an acacia tree. The pods are sometimes light green or deep red in color—both taste the same. Guaje seeds are about the size of a small lima bean and are eaten raw with guacamole, sometimes cooked and made into a sauce. They can also be made into fritters. The ground seeds are used to impart a slightly garlicy flavor to a mole called guaxmole (huaxmole). The dried seeds may be toasted and salted and eaten as a snack referred to as &quot;cacalas&quot;.

The predominantly herbivorous spider ''[[Bagheera kiplingi]]'', which is found in Central America and Mexico, feeds on nubs at the tips of the acacia leaves, known as [[Beltian body|Beltian bodies]], which contain high concentrations of protein.  These nubs are produced by the acacia as part of a symbiotic relationship with certain species of [[ant]], which also eat them.&lt;ref&gt;Meehan, Christopher J.; Olson, Eric J.; Curry, Robert L. (21 August 2008): [http://eco.confex.com/eco/2008/techprogram/P12401.HTM|Exploitation of the Pseudomyrmex–Acacia mutualism by a predominantly vegetarian jumping spider (Bagheera kiplingi)]. The 93rd ESA Annual Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acacia is listed as an ingredient in [[Sun Drop]], [[Fresca]], a [[citrus]] [[soft drink]], [[RC Cola]], [[Barq's]] [[root beer]], [[Full Throttle (drink)|Full Throttle]] Unleaded [[Energy Drink]], Strawberry-Lemonade [[Powerade]]&lt;ref name=test&gt;[https://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10052&amp;catalogId=1&amp;productId=480288 Powerade Ion4 Sports Drink, B Vitamin Enhanced, Strawberry Lemonade&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124; Wegmans]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Läkerol]] [[pastille]] [[candy|candies]], [[Altoids]] [[breath mint|mints]], Langer's Pineapple coconut Juice, [[Wrigley's]] Eclipse [[chewing gum]] and M&amp;Ms Pretzel.

[[Honey]] labeled under the term '[[Monofloral_honey#Some_types_of_monofloral_honey|Acacia Honey]]' is a type of honey produced by bees from a false acacia known as [[black locust]] in North America, but called by the misnomer  'acacia' in Europe, hence this liquid honey which practically doesn't crystallize does not come from true acacias.

===Gum===
Various species of acacia yield gum. True [[gum arabic]] is the product of ''[[Acacia senegal]]'', abundant in dry tropical West Africa from [[Senegal]] to northern [[Nigeria]].

''[[Acacia arabica]]'' is the gum-Arabic tree of [[India]], but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic.

[[File:Acacia covenyi02.jpg||thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;''[[Acacia covenyi]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Medicinal uses===
Many Acacia species have important uses in traditional medicine. Most of the uses have been shown to have a scientific basis since chemical compounds found in the various species have medicinal effects.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In [[Ayurvedic medicine]], ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' is considered a remedy that is helpful for treating [[premature ejaculation]].
A 19th century Ethiopian medical text describes a potion made from an Ethiopian species of Acacia (known as ''grar'') mixed with the root of the ''tacha'', then boiled, as a cure for [[rabies]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia'' (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1990), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[astringent]] medicine high in [[tannin]]s, called [[catechu]] or cutch, is procured from several species, but more especially from ''[[Acacia catechu]]'', by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/usdisp/uncaria-gamb.html An OCR'd version of the US Dispensatory by Remington and Wood, 1918.] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornamental uses===
A few species are widely grown as ornamentals in [[garden]]s; the most popular perhaps is ''[[Acacia dealbata]]'' (Silver Wattle), with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as &quot;mimosa&quot; in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus ''[[Mimosa]]''.

Another ornamental acacia is ''[[Acacia xanthophloea]]'' (Fever Tree).
Southern European florists use ''Acacia baileyana'', ''Acacia dealbata'', ''Acacia pycnantha'' and ''Acacia retinodes'' as cut flowers and the common name there for them is mimosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewattle.com/schools/uses.php World Wide Wattle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ornamental species of acacia are also used by homeowners and [[landscape architect]]s for [[home security]]. The sharp thorns of some species deter unauthorized persons from entering private properties, and may prevent break-ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes. The aesthetic characteristics of acacia plants, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a considerable alternative to artificial [[fence]]s and [[wall]]s.

===Paints===
The ancient Egyptians used Acacia in paints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.ca/dp/product-description/0609803670 Excerpt from A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Fifth Edition (Paperback) Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfume===
[[File:Acaciafarnesiana1web.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Acacia farnesiana]]'']]
''[[Acacia farnesiana]]'' is used in the [[perfume]] industry due to its strong fragrance. The use of Acacia as a fragrance dates back centuries. In the [[Bible]], burning of acacia wood as a form of [[incense]] is mentioned several times.

===Symbolism and ritual===
The Acacia is used as a symbol in [[Freemasonry]], to represent purity and endurance of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and as funerary symbolism signifying resurrection and immortality. The tree gains its importance from the description of the burial of [[Hiram Abiff]], the builder of King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.

Several parts (mainly bark, root and resin) of Acacia are used to make [[incense]] for rituals. Acacia is used in incense mainly in India, Nepal, and China including in its Tibet region. Smoke from Acacia bark is thought to keep [[demon]]s and [[ghost]]s away and to put the gods in a good mood. Roots and resin from Acacia are combined with [[rhododendron]], [[acorus]], [[cytisus]], [[salvia]] and some other components of incense. Both people and elephants like an alcoholic beverage made from acacia fruit.&lt;ref name=&quot;fachforum&quot;&gt;[http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:XL1yXM2FygQJ:www.naturheilpraxis.de/exclusiv/nh-online/2005/nhp05/a_nh-ff02.html+%22Acacia+farnesiana%22+tryptamine+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=us Naturheilpraxis Fachforum (German)] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Easton's Bible Dictionary, the Acacia tree may be the “burning bush” ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:2) which [[Moses]] encountered in the desert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastonsbibledictionary.com/b/bush.htm Easton's Bible Dictionary: Bush]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, when God gave Moses the instructions for building the [[Tabernacle]], he said to &quot;make an ark &quot; and &quot;a table of acacia wood&quot; (Exodus 25:10 &amp; 23, [[Revised Standard Version]])

In [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and other countries it is customary to present women with yellow mimosas (among other flowers) on [[International Women's Day]] (March 8). These &quot;mimosas&quot; are actually from ''[[Acacia dealbata]]'' (Silver Wattle).

===Tannin===
[[File:Bottle of tannic acid.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of [[tannic acid]].]]
The bark of various Australian species, known as wattles, is very rich in [[tannin]] and forms an important article of export; important species include ''[[Acacia pycnantha]]'' (Golden Wattle), ''[[Acacia decurrens]]'' (Tan Wattle), ''[[Acacia dealbata]]'' (Silver Wattle) and ''[[Acacia mearnsii]]'' (Black Wattle).

Black Wattle is grown in plantations in [[South Africa]]. Most Australian acacia species introduced to South Africa have become an enormous problem, due to their naturally aggressive propagation. The pods of ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (under the name of neb-neb), and of other African species are also rich in [[tannin]] and used by tanners.

===Wood===

[[File:Acacia Negev.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Acacia tree near the end of its range in the [[Negev]] Desert of southern [[Israel]].]]
Some Acacia species are valuable as [[timber]], such as ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]'' (Blackwood) from [[Australia]], which attains a great size; its wood is used for [[furniture]], and takes a high polish; and ''Acacia omalophylla'' (Myall Wood, also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments. ''[[Acacia seyal]]'' is thought to be the [[Shittah-tree]] of the [[Bible]], which supplied shittim-wood. According to the [[Book of Exodus]], this was used in the construction of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. ''[[Koa|Acacia koa]]'' from the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and ''[[Acacia heterophylla]]'' from [[Réunion]] island are both excellent timber trees. Depending on abundance and regional culture, some Acacia species (e.g. Acacia fumosa), are traditionally used locally as firewoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maugh, T.H.II.|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-tree25-2009apr25,0,402549.story|title=New species of tree identified in Ethiopia|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2009-04-24|accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]] (mainly in [[Sumatra]]) and in [[Malaysia]] (mainly in [[Sarawak]]) plantations of ''[[Acacia mangium]]'' are being established to supply [[pulpwood]] to the paper industry.

===Land Reclamation===
Acacia can be planted for erosion control, especially after mining or construction damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barr, D. A., and Atkinson, W. J.|date=|year=1970 |month=|title=Stabilization of coastal sands after mining|journal=J. Soil Conserv. Serv. N.S.W. |volume=26 |issue= |pages=89–105. |pmid=|doi=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological invasion ==
For the same reasons it is favored as an erosion-control plant, with its easy spreading and resilience, some varieties of acacia, namely [[Acacia mearnsii]], are potentially an invasive species.  Introduced worldwide it has become an invasive plant which is taking over grasslands and the abandoned agricultural areas, especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate propagates its spreading.  Australian/New Zealand Weed Risk Assessment gives it a &quot;high risk, score of 15&quot; rating and it is considered one of the world's 100 most invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hear.org/pier/species/acacia_mearnsii.htm Acacia mearnsii (PIER species info)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties as this fast-growing plant, once introduced, spreads fast and is extremely difficult to eradicate.

==Phytochemistry of ''Acacia''==
===Alkaloids===
[[File:Philae Temple Egypt Goddess Isis As Angel Mural Artwork 2004-10-11.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Egyptian goddess Isis&lt;/center&gt;]]

As mentioned previously, Acacias contain a number of [[organic compound]]s that defend them from pests and grazing animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;chem&quot;/&gt; Many of these compounds are [[psychoactive]] in humans.
The [[alkaloids]] found in Acacias include [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), [[5-MeO-DMT|5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine]] (5-MeO-DMT) and [[N-methyltryptamine]] (NMT). The plant leaves, stems and/or roots are sometimes made into a brew together with some [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]]-containing plant and consumed orally for healing, ceremonial or religious uses. [[Egyptian mythology]] has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the [[tree of life]] (see the article on the [[Myth of Osiris and Isis]]).

===Cyanogenic glycosides===
Nineteen different species of Acacia in the Americas contain [[glycoside|cyanogenic glycosides]], which, if exposed to an [[enzyme]] which specifically splits glycosides, can release [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) in the acacia &quot;leaves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0038-4909%2819871209%2932%3A4%3C499%3ACGIAOM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage Cyanogenic Glycosides in Ant-Acacias of Mexico and Central America David S. Seigler, John E. Ebinger The Southwestern Naturalist, Vol. 32, No. 4 (December 9, 1987), pp. 499-503 doi:10.2307/3671484]&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes results in the poisoning death of [[livestock]].

If fresh plant material spontaneously produces 200 ppm or more HCN, then it is potentially toxic. This corresponds to about 7.5 μmol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia &quot;leaves&quot; lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides.&lt;ref name=&quot;chemotaxonomie&quot; /&gt;

Some Acacia species containing cyanogens:
* ''[[Acacia erioloba]]''
* ''Acacia cunninghamii''
* ''Acacia obtusifolia''
* ''Acacia sieberiana''
* ''Acacia sieberiana'' var. ''woodii''&lt;ref name=&quot;juliflora&quot;&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad317e/AD317E05.htm FAO Kamal M. Ibrahim, The current state of knowledge on Prosopis juliflora...] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Species ==
There are over 1,300 species of Acacia. See [[List of Acacia species]] for a more complete listing.

==Famous acacia==
Perhaps the most famous acacia is the [[Arbre du Ténéré]] in [[Niger]]. The reason for the tree's fame is that it used to be the most isolated tree in the world, approximately {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} from any other tree. The tree was knocked down by a truck driver in 1973.

'''Acapulco''' (officially known as '''Acapulco de Juárez''') is a [[city]], [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] and major [[port|sea port]] in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Guerrero]] on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Mexico]], {{convert|300|km}} southwest from [[Mexico City]]. Acapulco is located on a deep, [[Semicircle|semi-circular]] [[bay]] and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico’s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12001a.htm  |title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de  Guerrero Acapulco de Juárez |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a port of call for [[shipping]] and [[Cruise line|cruising lines]] running between [[Panama]] and [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.apiacapulcoport.com/whois_api.html |title= History of API Acapulco |publisher= Administracion Portuaria Integral |location=Acapulco, Guerrero accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital [[Chilpancingo]] and as well, [[Mexico]]'s largest beach and [[balneario]] resorted city.&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-01-10 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msVc9rGy | archivedate = 2010-01-18| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is best known as one of Mexico’s oldest and most well-known beach resorts, which came into prominence by the 1950s as a getaway for [[Hollywood]] stars and millionaires.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nileguide.com/destination/acapulco/overview/history |title= History for Acapulco |publisher=Niles’ Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acapulco is still famous for its nightlife and still attracts many vacationers, although most are now from Mexico itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Confían en salvar temporada turística |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=30 December 2009 |page=12 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Trusting in saving the tourist season }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010001.html |title= Introduction to Acapulco |publisher=Frommer’s Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resort area is divided into two: The north end of the bay is the “traditional” area, where the famous in the mid 20th century vacationed and the south end is dominated by newer luxury high rise hotels.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/705-the-sunniest-acapulco |title= The sunniest Acapulco |first=Mike |last=Oliver |coauthors=Rita Oliver |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Acapulco&quot; comes from [[Nahuatl]] language ''Aca-pōl-co'', and means &quot;At the big reeds&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot; robelo &quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Diccionario de Aztequismos |last=Robelo |first=Cecelio A. |year=1912 |publisher= Imp. del Museo N. de Arquelogía, Historia y Etnología |location=Mexico |pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or “At the broken reeds.”  “de Juárez” was added to the official name in 1885 to honor [[Benito Juárez]], the former [[president of Mexico]]. The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

==History==
By the eighth century, there was a small culture in the Acapulco area, which would first be dominated by the [[Olmec]]s, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period. In Acapulco bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarrón. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers. Later, [[Teotihuacan]] influence made its way here via [[Cuernavaca]] and Chilpancingo. Then [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] influence arrived from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and through what is now [[Oaxaca]]. This history is known through the archeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta and Tambuco.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;
In the 11th century, new waves of migration of [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the [[Aztec]]s.  Acapulco formally became part of the [[Aztec Empire]] in 1486 during the reign of [[Ahuizotl]]. It was part of a tributary province called Tepecuacuilco, but control here was relatively unorganized.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Puerto de Acapulco Boot 1628.png|left|thumb|A 1628 relief map of Acapulco Bay.]]
There are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], [[Hernán Cortés]] sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cerón was authorized by Cortés to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on 13 December 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;
The first [[encomendero]] was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably [[Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte]], left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hernán Cortés was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

Cortés established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqués, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an “alcadia” (major province or town).&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

Spanish trade in the [[Far East]] would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of [[New Spain]]. Galleons started arriving here from Asia by 1550, and in that year  thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; Acapulco would become the second most important port, after [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], due to its direct trade with the [[Philippines]]. This trade would focus on the yearly [[Manila Galleon]], which was the nexus of all kinds on communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Carl Saltzmann - View of Acapulco, 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|''View of Acapulco'', 1879, oil painting by [[Carl Saltzmann]]]]
The [[Manila Galleon]] would make its yearly run from the mid 16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch [[pirates]],  such as  [[Francis Drake]], [[Henry Morgan]] and [[Thomas Cavendish]], who called it “The Black Ship.”&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; To protect the port and the cargo of ships coming here the San Diego Fort was built. Despite the fort’s existence, a Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town and fort before being driven off. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt in 1783.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;
At the beginning of the 19th Century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, soon after the [[Mexican War of Independence]] began.  In 1810, [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] attacked and burnt down the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Parés at the Battle of Tres Palos.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;
Acapulco’s importance as a port recovered during the [[California Gold Rush]] in the mid 19th century, with ships going to and coming from [[Panama]] stopping here.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;

In 1911, [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary forces]] took over the main plaza of Acapulco.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;
In 1920, the [[Prince of Wales]] and future [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by an East Texas businessman named Albert B.Pullen from Corrigan, Tx. in the area now known as Old Acapulco.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; But some of Acapulco’s best known hotels were built by others.  In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acapulcoenlinea.com.mx/content/view/2754/91/ Portal de Acapulco - Acapulco y su Arquitectura]&lt;/ref&gt; with 12 rooms on the cliffs of [[La Quebrada, Mexico|La Quebrada]]. Wolf Shoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Al Polin built the Las Americas Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;

In the mid 1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses has been built.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt; In the early 1950s President [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]] upgraded the port’s infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;

The economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaires Hollywood stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; Former Swing Musician [[Teddy Stauffer]], so called &quot;Mister Acapulco&quot;, was a hotelowner (&quot;Villa Vera&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;), who attracted a lot of celebrities to Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stockpress.de/2010/08/05/teddy-stauffer-der-swingkonig-im-paradies/ Teddy Stauffer: Der Swingkönig im Paradies - STOCKPRESS.de &amp;#124; STOCKPRESS.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s,&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; by the early 1960s Acapulco had a population of about 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;''World Book Encyclopedia'', 1967 Edition, Vol. 1, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, The Diocese of Acapulco was created by [[Pope Pius XII]]. It would become an archdiocese in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;arquid&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arquidiocesisacapulco.org/ |title= Historia de la Arquidiócesis |publisher=Archdiocese of Acapulco |location=Acapulco, Guerrero |language=Spanish |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco, the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur.&lt;ref name=&quot;lacey&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Acapulco, Long Dotted With Tourists, Is Now Home to Drug War |first=Marc |last=Lacey |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/world/americas/09mexico.html |newspaper=New York Timnes |location=New York, NY |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acapulco - Palmasola-Punto-mas-alto.JPG|thumb|The Bay of Santa Lucia from the top of Palma Sola.]]
In the 70s there was a significant expansion of the port.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt;

During the 1990s, the road known as the Ruta del Sol was built, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey only takes about three and a half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt;

The city was devastated by [[Hurricane Pauline]] in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the [[shantytown]]s that surround the city, built on steep hillsides. Other victims were swept away by thirty foot waves and {{convert|150|mph|0|abbr=on}} winds. The main road, Avenida Costera became a fast-moving three foot river of sludge.&lt;ref name=&quot;davison&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=109 dead as Hurricane Pauline batters Mexico |first=Phil |last= Davison |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/109-dead-as-hurricane-pauline-batters-mexico-1234952.html |newspaper= The Independent |location= London |date=10 October 1997  |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the drug war in Mexico has had a negative effect on tourism here are rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from [[South America]] as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006. A major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers .&lt;ref name=&quot;lacey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ellingwood&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Acapulco shootout leaves 18 dead |first=Ken  |last= Ellingwood |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-shootout8-2009jun08,0,7718575.story |newspaper= |publisher= Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back.&lt;ref name=&quot;ellingwood&quot;/&gt; However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajuarez&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Desciende ocupación |first=Alfonso |last=Juárez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=6 January 2010 |page=12 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Occupation falls  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010 and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011.  Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww4report.com/node/8451 Mexico: Guerrero narco-violence breaks grisly record &amp;#124; World War 4 Report]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second incident the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Senderos shopping center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12143227 | work=BBC News | title=Mexico violence: Headless bodies found in Acapulco | date=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain. Another forty percent is semi flat, and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to {{convert|1699|m|ft|0|abbr=none}}. The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas and Alto Camarón. There is one major river, the Papagayo, which runs through the municipality, along with a number of arroyos. There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca. along with a number of thermal springs.

Acapulco features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]]. The climate here is hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, more even temperatures between seasons than resorts further north in Mexico, but this vary depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical Storms and Hurricanes are threat from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna mostly consists of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of birds of both land and sea as well as marine animals such as turtles.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
Tourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy three percent of the municipality’s population is involved in commerce and most of this is related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employs less than twenty percent and only about five percent are dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is mostly limited to bottling, milk products, cement products, ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers and melons.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/


===Tourism===
[[File:Acapulco - PlayaManzanillo.JPG|thumb|Manzanillo beach, a beach in the tourist area of Acapulco.]]
Acapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale.&lt;ref name=&quot;devlin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/439-walking-the-walk-talking-the-talk-cita-with-the-shady-lady-on-acapulco |title= Walking the walk, talking the talk – cita with the shady 'lady' in Acapulco |first=Wendy |last=Devlin |date=2007-02-16 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But nowadays, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with local corrupt police who steal money by extortion, and intimidate visitors with threats to jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.realacapulco.com/en/article/dealing-with-the-police | work=Real Acapulco | title=Dealing with the Police | accessdate=February 23, 2011 | date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=1703088&amp;start=15 | work=Lonely Planet | title=corrupt mexican police story | accessdate=February 23, 2011 | date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowTopic-g150787-i177-k434754-Beware_of_Police_Corruption-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html | work=Trip Advisor | title=( Beware of Police Corruption) | accessdate=February 23, 2011 | date=January 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “original” Acapulco, where hotels owned by personalities such as [[Johnny Weismuller]] and [[John Wayne]] are located, is on the northern end of the bay. This is where the boardwalk and main square are and today the area is filled with modern, Mexican style hotels, with discothèques and restaurants in walking distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; This side of the bay is also known as “Tradicional” or “Nautica.”

The south end of the bay holds the newer constructions, including the high rise hotels. This area includes Punta Diamante, Puerto Marqués, and stretches from the airport to the Papagayo River which separates it from the older section of town. In this area, no one walks as almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; The older section of town now mostly caters to middle class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to international visitors and the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;devlin&quot;/&gt; This area also has the higher hotel occupancy rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;devlin&quot;/&gt;

Acapulco's reputation is that of a high-energy party town, where one can have dinner at midnight, dance until dawn then relax in the daytime on the beach crowded with sexy bodies in bikinis. The nightlife has made this place famous for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt; From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the [[Elizabeth II]], the [[MS Rotterdam]], [[Crystal Harmony]] as well as all the Princess liner ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; Despite its international fame, most of Acapulco’s visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt;

For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals adding 785 million pesos to the economy.  Eighty percent arrive by land and 18 percent by air.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgUni&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Guerrero-Turismo |agency= Agencia el Universal. |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=4 January 2010 |page=12 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guerrero-Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;/&gt; Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and wealthy, such as [[Luis Miguel]], Plácido Domingo and [[Dolores Olmedo]], who maintain homes here.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;

[[File:JLNYCAcapulcoBay.jpg|left|thumb|Marqués port.]]
While much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a “passé” resort, eclipsed by the newer [[Cancún]] and [[Cabo San Lucas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt; Over the years a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches such as Tamarindos, who offer everything from newspapers to massages are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach but the government says is difficult to eradicate as there is a lot of unemployment and poor here.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambulantaje&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Combaten ambulantaje en Acapulco |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=30 December 2009 |page=12 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Combating wandering vendors in Acapulco }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the city are many shantytowns that cling onto the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. Prostitution is also common here as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;devlin&quot;/&gt; In the last decade, drug related violence has caused problems for the tourism trade here.&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt;

Another problem is garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash that is cleaned up during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.&lt;ref name=&quot;limpiar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Buscan en Guerrero limpiar fondo de mar |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=28 December 2009 |page=8 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Seeking to clean the bottom of the sea in Guerrero }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attractions===
Acapulco’s main attraction is its nightlife, and has been for many decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nightfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010030.html |title= Nightlife |publisher=Frommer’s Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nightclubs change names and owners frequently but there are generalities. Cover charges vary but are almost always higher for men than women, and most clubs are not in operation until after 11pm. Most of the action happens after midnight and goes until to at least four or five in the morning. The high-rise hotels have their own bars and sometimes dance clubs. Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. This area is especially popular during [[spring break]]. There is also a [[bungee jump]] in this area as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:Cliffdivers in La Quebrada, Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|[[La Quebrada Cliff Divers]].]]
Another enigmatic attraction at Acapulco are the [[La Quebrada Cliff Divers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt; The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive.&lt;ref name=&quot;guaddive&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=44994 |title= Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe Cliff Diving   |publisher=Frommer’s Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the divers are professionals,&lt;ref name=&quot;guaddive&quot;/&gt; diving from heights of forty meters into [[La Quebrada, Mexico|an inlet that is only seven meters wide and four meters deep]], after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt; On 12 December, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives ranges from the simple to the complicated and end with the “Ocean of Fire” when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for.&lt;ref name=&quot;guaddive&quot;/&gt; The spectacle can be seen from a public area, which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010029.html |title= Attractions |publisher=Frommer’s Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarrón, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqués there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first= Beatriz |editor1-last= Quintanar Hinojosa |year=2007 |month=May |title= Acapulco más brillante de nunca |trans_title=Acapulco, more brilliant than ever |journal= Mexico Desconocido Rutas Turisticas Guerrero El destino del Mundo  |volume=135 |pages=8–26 |publisher= Grupo Editorial Impresiones Aéreas |location=Mexico City |issn=0188-5146 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, a small zoo and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers that died here. Many of the scuba diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010020.html |title= Active Pursuits &amp; Acapulco Historical Museum  |publisher=Frommer’s Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular activity is deep sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200&amp;nbsp;pounds. [[Sailfish]] are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything the trip is free.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;/&gt;

In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Zócalo with shade trees and lined with cafes and shops. At the north end of the Nuestra Señora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but when was later adapted into a church.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;/&gt; Acapulco’s most historic building is the San Diego Fort, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from [[pirate]] attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt; The fort was partially destroyed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the mid 17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;diegofromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=93584 |title= San Diego Fort &amp; Acapulco Historical Museum  |publisher=Frommer’s Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oliver&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/704-dynamic-women-of-acapulco |title= Dynamic women of Acapulco  |first=Mike |last=Oliver |coauthors=Rita Oliver |date=2001-01-01 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the fort serves as the Museo Histórico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port’s history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are also temporary exhibits as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt;

The Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantial or CICI is a sea life and aquatic  park located on Costera Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt; Another place popular with children is the Parque Papagayo which is a large family park which has life-sized replicas of a Spanish galleon and the space shuttle Columbia, three artificial lakes, aviary, skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt;

The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by [[Diego Rivera]] that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as [[Quetzalcoatl]]. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals are able to be seen by the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;oliver&quot;/&gt;

There is a small museum called Casa de la Máscara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and are divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The [[Huichol people|Huichol]]s and the Jaguar, Alebrijes and Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt;
The Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pacifico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many are in danger of extinction, such as the [[Peltogyne mexicana]] or purple stick tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt;

The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and gourmet food fair. The Cinépolis Galerías Diana and the Teatro Juan Ruíz de Alarcón show French and French literary figures give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs will feature French DJs.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=158831 |title= Acapulco French Festival  |publisher=Frommer’s Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other festivals celebrated here include  [[Carnival]], the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May and a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China in November.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqués course, the latter designed by [[Robert Trent Jones]] in 1972 for the [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup Golf Tournament]]. The Mayan Palace course was designed by [[Pedro Guericia]] and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center.  The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by [[Robert von Hagge]]. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;/&gt;

Acapulco also has a [[bullring]], called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;/&gt;

===Spring break===
Over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults travel to resort areas and [[balneario]]s throughout Mexico over [[spring break]] each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;stategov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/spring_break_mexico/spring_break_mexico_2812.html |title= SPRING BREAK IN MEXICO – &quot;Know Before You Go!&quot; |publisher=United States State Department |accessdate=January 11, 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625203348/http%3A//travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/spring_break_mexico/spring_break_mexico_2812.html |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason students head to Mexico is the 18 year old drinking age (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] have become restrictive on drinking and other behaviors. This has pushed spring break visitation to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;leinwand&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Alcohol-soaked spring break lures students abroad |first= Donna |last= Leinwand |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-01-05-spring-break-usat_x.htm |newspaper= |publisher= USA TODAY |date=5 January 2003 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:El Azteca in Palladium Acapulco Discothèque (2).jpg|thumb|left|Palladium nightclub.]]
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, [[Cancún]] had been favored at the spring break destination of choice. However, Cancun has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This has led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that the flight is longer and more expensive than to Cancun for many travelers. Many are attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco’s famous nightlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Acapulco heat for spring-break |first=Will |last=Weissert |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7119929/ |newspaper=MSNBC |date=7 March 2005 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, mostly due to the economic situation in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;crisis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Springbreak baja por crisis, no por violencia: hoteleros |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/583257.html |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate= January 11, 2010|language=Spanish |trans_title=Spring Break lower because of crisis, not violence }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |title= At Spring Break in Mexico, Revelry Mixes With New Caution |first=Marc |last= Lacey |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/americas/11cancun.html?_r=1|newspaper= New York Times |location=New York, NY |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate= January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]] will transmit special programming from Acapulco in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtvu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtvu.com/shows/spring-break/mtvu-spring-break-2010-here-we-come/ |title= Spring Break 2010  |publisher=Music Television (MTV) |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_3028.html {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warning—a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel debacle—took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break.  The New York Times tracked the travels of another Penn student on spring break in Acapulco just a week after the dissemination of the email, while [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] devoted a segment of his show, [[The O'Reilly Factor]], to urge students to stay away from Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/americas/11cancun.html | work=The New York Times | title=At Spring Break in Mexico, Revelry Mixes With New Caution | first=Marc | last=Lacey | date=March 11, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009 a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets involving large-caliber weapons and grenades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/06/08/mexico.violence/index.html | work=CNN | title=3 Mexican officers killed in Acapulco - CNN.com | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | date=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no incidents of violence against spring breakers were reported.

==Transportation==
[[File:Acapulco - Aeropuerto Internacional Juan N. Álvarez.JPG|thumb|Juan N. Álvarez International Airport.]]
From the U.S., many [[airline]]s now fly to [[General Juan N. Álvarez International Airport|Acapulco Airport]] year-round. While in the city, there are many [[bus]]es and [[Taxicab|taxi]] services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 10 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first come first served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs mainly travel to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, which is where most of the hotels for visitors are, but also includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly up to his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.

The bus system is highly complex, and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form other than walking in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have [[air conditioning]], while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco! painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their [[windshield]]s or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decaling and home made interior designs that range from [[comic book]] scenes, to [[Pornography|adult themes]], and even to &quot;[[Hello Kitty]]&quot; themes.

==Government==
{{Main|Acapulco (municipality)}}
[[File:S5001846.JPG|thumb|Convention Center in Alcapulco.]]
As the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities,&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI&quot;/&gt; which together have a territory of 1,880.60&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, [[Juan R. Escudero (municipality)|Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada)]], [[San Marcos, Guerrero|San Marcos]], [[Coyuca de Benítez]] with the Pacific Ocean to the south.

The metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Juárez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.&lt;ref name=&quot;zmpdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/geografia/publicaciones/delimex05/DZMM-2005_17.pdf |title=Delimitación de las zonas metropolitanas de México 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=INEGI |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans_title=Defining metropolitan areas of Mexico 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Acapulco is the city mentioned in the song ''Amor Eterno,'' written by [[Juan Gabriel]] and first recorded, most famously, by [[Rocio Durcal]].
Acapulco Bay is also mentioned in Frank Sinatra's hit recording of the song &quot;Come Fly With Me.&quot;

'''Alan Curtis Kay''' (born May 17, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]], known for his early pioneering work on [[object-oriented programming]] and [[Window (computing)|windowing]] [[graphical user interface]] design, and for coining the phrase, &quot;The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&quot; 

He is the president of the [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He is also on the advisory board of [[TTI/Vanguard]]. Until mid 2005, he was a Senior Fellow at [[HP Labs]], a Visiting Professor at [[Kyoto University]], and an Adjunct Professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/2005/07/hp_converting_s.html HP converting storied garage into recycling center | Good Morning Silicon Valley] - Posted by John Paczkowski on July 21st, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and work ==
Alan Kay showed remarkable ability at an early age, learning to read fluently at three years old. In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd. Alan Kay said, &quot;I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three. So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade. And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Alan Kay on education|url=http://vimeo.com/20673320|work=The Generational Divide|publisher=The Davis Group|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Kay attended the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], earning a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Mathematics and Molecular Biology. Before and during this time, he worked as a professional [[jazz]] guitarist.

In 1966, he began graduate school at the [[University of Utah]] [[University of Utah College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], earning a Master's degree and a Ph.D. degree. There, he worked with [[Ivan Sutherland]], who had done pioneering graphics programs including [[Sketchpad]]. This greatly inspired Kay's evolving views on objects and programming. As he grew busier with [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|ARPA]] research, he quit his career as a professional musician.

In 1968, he met [[Seymour Papert]] and learned of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] [[computer programming|programming]] [[programming language|language]], a [[Programming language dialect|dialect]] of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] optimized for [[education]]al use. This led him to learn of the work of [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], and of [[Constructionist learning]]. These further influenced his views.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Alan-Kay.jpg|thumb|left|Alan Kay in the 1990s.]] --&gt;
In 1970, Kay joined [[Xerox]] Corporation's [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] Research Center, [[PARC (company)|PARC]]. In the 1970s he was one of the key members there to develop prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language [[Smalltalk]]. These inventions were later commercialized by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in their [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]] computers.

Kay is one of the fathers of the idea of [[object-oriented programming]], which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC and predecessors at the [[Norwegian Computing Center]]. He conceived the [[Dynabook]] concept which defined the conceptual basics for [[laptop]] and [[tablet computer|tablet]] computers and [[E-book]]s, and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

After 10 years at Xerox PARC, Kay became [[Atari]]'s chief scientist for three years.

== Recent work and recognition ==
Starting in 1984, Kay was an Apple Fellow at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] until the closing of the ATG ([[Advanced Technology Group]]), one of the company's R&amp;D divisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-programmer.info/history/8-people/438-alan-kay.html?start=1&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] as a [[Disney Fellow]] and remained there until Disney ended its Disney Fellow program. After Disney, in 2001 he founded [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.

Later, Kay worked with a team at [[Applied Minds]], then became a Senior Fellow at [[Hewlett-Packard]] until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005. He is currently head of Viewpoints Institute.

=== Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet ===
In December 1995, when he was still at Apple, Kay collaborated with many others to start the open source [[Squeak]] dynamic media software, and he continues to work on it. As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] system. More recently he started, along with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David A. Smith]], [[David P. Reed]], Andreas Raab, Rick McGeer, [[Julian Lombardi]], and [[Mark McCahill]], the [[Croquet Project]], which is an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.

=== Tweak ===
In 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do. Andreas Raab was a researcher working in Kay's group, then at Hewlett-Packard. He proposed defining a &quot;script process&quot; and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Events, Scripts &amp; Multiple Processes | url=http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/ | author=Andreas Raab | date=2001-07-06 | accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future. [[Tweak programming environment|Tweak]] added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/ Tweak: Whitepapers]&lt;/ref&gt; Its underlying object system is [[Class (computer science)|class-based]], but to users (during programming) it acts like it is [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.

=== Children's Machine ===
In November 2005, at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world. It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the [[One Laptop per Child]] program, the Children's Machine, and the [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]]. The program was begun and is sustained by Kay's friend, [[Nicholas Negroponte]], and is based on Kay's [[Dynabook]] ideal. Kay is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.

=== Reinventing programming ===
Kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the Computer Revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.  Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled &quot;The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet&quot; were informed by his experiences with [[Sketchpad]], [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], and the bloated code of commercial software.
 
On 31 August 2006, Kay's proposal to the [[United States]] [[National Science Foundation]], NSF, was granted, thus funding [[Viewpoints Research Institute]] for several years. The proposal title is: Steps Toward the Reinvention of Programming: A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irbseminars.intel-research.net/AlanKayNSF.pdf Proposal to NSF – Granted on August 31st 2006 - Steps Toward The Reinvention of Programming - A Compact And Practical Model of Personal Computing As A Self-Exploratorium] - Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Yoshiki Ohshima, Ian Piumarta, Andreas Raab&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of what Kay is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: &quot;The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days. We wonder: how small could be an understandable practical &quot;Model T&quot; design that covers this functionality? 1M lines of code? 200K LOC? 100K LOC? 20K LOC?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Kay| first=Alan| title=How Simply and Understandably Could The &quot;Personal Computing Experience&quot; Be Programmed? | url=http://www.intel-research.net/berkeley/viewseminarabstract.asp?index=605 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070625105727/http://www.intel-research.net/berkeley/viewseminarabstract.asp?index=605 | archivedate=2007-06-25 | date=2006-11-27 | accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It is concise, using symbols rather than words and applying functions to entire [[array data structure|arrays]] without using explicit loops.
* It is solution focused, emphasizing the expression of algorithms independently of machine architecture or operating system.
* It has just one simple, consistent, and recursive precedence rule: the right argument of a function is the result of the entire expression to its right.

==History==
The first incarnation of what was later to be the APL programming language was published and formalized in ''A Programming Language'',&lt;ref name=&quot;aplbook&quot; /&gt; a book describing a notation invented in 1957 by [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] while at [[Harvard University]]. Iverson had developed a [[mathematical notation]] for manipulating arrays that he taught to his students.

In 1960, he began work for [[International Business Machines|IBM]] and working with [[Adin Falkoff]], created APL based on the notation he had developed. This notation was used inside IBM for short research reports on computer systems, such as the [[Burroughs B5000]] and its stack mechanism when stack machines versus [[register machine]]s were being evaluated by IBM for upcoming computers.

Also in 1960, Iverson was already also using his notation in a draft copy of Chapter 6 called &quot;A programming language&quot; for the book he was writing with [[Fred Brooks]], ''Automatic Data Processing'', which would later be published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Kenneth E., [http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/apl/book/Iverson-AutomaticDataProcessing-color.pdf/view &quot;Automatic Data Processing: Chapter 6: A programming language&quot;], 1960, DRAFT copy for Brooks and Iverson 1963 book, &quot;Automatic Data Processing&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Brooks|Brooks, Fred]]; Iverson, Kenneth, (1963), ''Automatic Data Processing'', John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1962, the notation described in ''A Programming Language'' was recognizable yet distinct from later APL.

As early as 1962, the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after Falkoff discussed with Dr. William C. Carter his work in the standardization of the instruction set for the machines that later became the [[IBM System/360]] family.

In 1963, Dr. Herbert Hellerman, working at the IBM Systems Research Institute, implemented a part of the notation on an [[IBM 1620]] computer, and it was used by students in a special high school course on elementary functions. This implementation of a portion of the notation was called PAT (Personalized Array Translator).&lt;ref&gt;Hellerman, H.,  &quot;Experimental  Personalized  Array  Translator  System&quot;, ''Communications of the ACM'', 7, 433 (July, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Falkoff, Iverson, and Edward H. Sussenguth Jr., all working at IBM, used the notation for a formal description of the [[IBM System/360]] series machine architecture and functionality which resulted in a paper published in IBM Systems Journal in 1964. After this was published, the team turned their attention to an implementation of the notation on a computer system. One of the motivations for this focus of implementation was the interest of John L. Lawrence who had new duties with [[Science Research Associates]], an educational company bought by IBM in 1964. Lawrence asked Iverson and his group to help utilize the language as a tool for the development and use of computers in education.&lt;ref&gt;Falkoff, Adin D.; Iverson, Kenneth E., [http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APLEvol.htm &quot;The Evolution of APL&quot;], ACM SIGPLAN Notices 13, 1978-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Lawrence M. Breed]] and [[Philip S. Abrams]] of Stanford University joined the team at IBM Research, they continued their prior work on an implementation programmed in [[Fortran|FORTRAN IV]] for a portion of the notation was done for the [[IBM 7090]] computer running under the [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS|IBSYS]] operating system. This work was finished in late 1965 and later known as IVSYS (Iverson System). The basis of this implementation was described in detail by Abrams in a Stanford University Technical Report, &quot;An Interpreter for Iverson Notation&quot; in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Philip S., [http://infolab.stanford.edu/TR/CS-TR-66-47.html ''An interpreter for &quot;Iverson notation&quot;''], Technical Report: CS-TR-66-47, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, August 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Hellerman's PAT system earlier, this implementation did not include the APL character set but used special English reserved words for functions and operators. The system was later adapted for a time-sharing system and, by November 1966, it had been reprogrammed for the IBM/360 Model 50 computer running in a time sharing mode and was used internally at IBM.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, Thomas, &quot;Biographies: Kenneth E. Iverson&quot;, ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A key development in the ability to use APL effectively, before the widespread use of CRT terminals, was the development of a special [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] interchangeable typeball with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism, such as the [[IBM 1050]] and [[IBM 2741]] terminal. Keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could actually type in and see real APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and not be forced to use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typeballs, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them.&lt;ref name=&quot;APLQQ91&quot;&gt;Breed, Larry, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=138094.140933 &quot;The First APL Terminal Session&quot;], ''APL Quote Quad'', Association for Computing Machinery, Volume 22, Number 1, September 1991, p.2-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an IBM Selectric typeball for the APL character set.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/?setdate=19/12/2009 Adin Falkoff] - Computer History Museum. &quot;Iverson credited him for choosing the name APL and the introduction of the IBM golf-ball typewriter with the replacement typehead, which provided the famous character set to represent programs.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBM 2741 keyboard layout with the APL typeball print head inserted looked this way to the programmer:
:[[Image:APL-keybd2.svg|600px]]

Some APL symbols, even with the APL characters on the typeball, still had to be typed in by over-striking two existing typeball characters. An example would be the &quot;grade up&quot; character which had to be made from a &quot;delta&quot; (shift-H) and a &quot;[[Sheffer stroke]]&quot; (shift-M). This was necessary because the APL character set was larger than the 88 characters allowed on the Selectric typeball.

The first APL interactive login and creation of an APL workspace was in 1966 by Larry Breed using a 1050 terminal at the IBM Mohansic Labs near [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]], the home of APL, in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;APLQQ91&quot;/&gt;

IBM was chiefly responsible for the introduction of APL to the marketplace.

APL was first available in 1967 for the [[IBM 1130]] as ''APL\1130''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.vector.org.uk/archive/v223/APL_1130.htm|title=How We Got to APL\1130|author=Larry Breed|authorlink=Larry Breed|journal=Vector (British APL Association)|volume=22|issue=3|month=August | year=2006|issn=0955-1433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/1130/lang/1130-03.3.001_APL_1130_May69.pdf APL\1130 Manual], May 1969&lt;/ref&gt; It would run in as little as 8k 16 bit words of memory, and used a dedicated 1 megabyte hard disk.

APL gained its foothold on mainframe timesharing systems from the late 1960s through the early 1980s.  Additional improvements in performance for selected [[IBM 370]] mainframe systems included the &quot;APL Assist Microcode&quot; in which some support for APL execution was included in the actual firmware as opposed to APL being exclusively a software product.   Somewhat later, as suitably performing hardware was finally becoming available in the mid to late-1980s, many users migrated their applications to the personal computer environment.

Early IBM APL interpreters for [[IBM 360]] and [[IBM 370]] hardware implemented their own multi-user management instead of relying on the host services, thus they were timesharing systems in their own right.  First introduced in 1966, the ''APL\360''&lt;ref name=&quot;IBM APL\360 1968&quot;&gt;Falkoff, Adin; Iverson, Kenneth E., [http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/apl/APL_360_Users_Manual_Aug68.pdf &quot;APL\360 Users Guide&quot;], IBM Research, Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, August 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/apl/APL_360_Terminal_System_Mar67.pdf &quot;APL\360 Terminal System&quot;], IBM Research, Thomas J. Watson Research Center, March 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apl360&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pakin|first=Sandra|title=APL\360 Reference Manual|publisher=Science Research Associates, Inc.|year=1968|isbn=0-574-16135-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; system was a multi-user interpreter. The ability to programmatically communicate with the operating system for information and setting interpreter system variables was done through special privileged &quot;I-beam&quot; functions, using both monadic and dyadic operations.&lt;ref&gt;Falkoff, Adin D.; Iverson, Kenneth E.,[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/174/ibmrd1704F.pdf ''The Design of APL''], ''IBM Journal of Research and Development'', Volume 17, Number 4, July 1973. &quot;These environmental defined functions were based on the use of still another class of functions — called &quot;I-beams&quot; because of the shape of the symbol used for them — which provide a more general facility for communication between APL programs and the less abstract parts of the system. The I-beam functions were first introduced by the system programmers to allow them to execute System/360 instructions from within APL programs, and thus use APL as a direct aid in their programming activity. The obvious convenience of functions of this kind, which appeared to be part of the language, led to the introduction of the monadic I-beam function for direct use by anyone. Various arguments to this function yielded information about the environment such as available space and time of day.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, IBM released ''APL.SV'' which was a continuation of the same product, but which offered [[Shared Variables|shared variables]] as a means to access facilities outside of the APL system, such as operating system files. In the mid 1970s, the IBM mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the [[IBM 5100]] desktop computer, which had a small CRT and an APL keyboard, when most other small computers of the time only offered BASIC.  In the 1980s, the ''VSAPL'' program product enjoyed widespread usage with [[Conversational Monitor System|CMS]], [[Time Sharing Option|TSO]], [[VSPC]], [[MUSIC/SP]] and [[CICS]] users.

In 1973-1974, Dr. Patrick E. Hagerty directed the implementation of the University of Maryland APL interpreter for the Sperry Univac 1100 Series mainframe computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minker|first=Jack|title=Beginning of Computing and Computer Sciences at the University of Maryland|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/department/dept-history/minker-report.pdf|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=23 May 2011|location=Section 2.3.4|page=38|format=PDF|month=January|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, Sperry had nothing. In 1974, student Alan Stebbens was assigned the task of implementing an internal function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stebbens|first=Alan|title=How it all began|url=http://lathwellproductions.ca/wordpress/film-synopsis/comments-from-linkedin/#comment-15|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And student Bill Linton caused massive dumps to occur as he practiced developing APL programs in the third-floor TTY room, causing Dr. Hagerty to burst through the TTY door to halt the practice until Dr. Hagerty fixed the APL interpreter bug.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several timesharing firms sprang up in the 1960s and 1970s which sold APL services using modified versions of the IBM APL\360&lt;ref name=&quot;apl360&quot; /&gt; interpreter.  In North America, the better-known ones were [[I. P. Sharp Associates]], [[Scientific Time Sharing Corporation]], and [[The Computer Company]] (TCC).  With the advent first of less expensive mainframes such as the [[IBM 4300]] and later the personal computer, the timesharing industry had all but disappeared by the mid 1980s.

''Sharp APL'' was available from [[I. P. Sharp Associates]], first on a timesharing basis in the 1960s, and later as a program product starting around 1979.  ''Sharp APL'' was an advanced APL implementation with many language extensions, such as ''packages'' (the ability to put one or more objects into a single variable), file system, nested arrays, and [[Shared Variables|shared variables]].

APL interpreters were available from other mainframe and mini-computer manufacturers as well, notably [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]], [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]], [[Data General]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Harris Corporation|Harris]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Xerox]], and others.

[[Garth Foster]] of [[Syracuse University]] sponsored regular meetings of the APL implementers' community at Syracuse's Minnowbrook Conference Center in rural upstate [[New York State|New York]]. In later years, Eugene McDonnell organized similar meetings at the [[Asilomar Conference Grounds]] near Monterey, California, and at Pajaro Dunes near Watsonville, California.  The SIGAPL special interest group of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] continues to support the APL community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigapl.org/ SIGAPL Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Iverson received the [[Turing Award]] for his work on APL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=9147499&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=140&amp;ao=AM
