{{Place of articulation}}
In [[articulatory phonetics]], a '''consonant''' is a [[speech sound]] that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the [[vocal tract]]. Examples are {{IPA|[p]}}, pronounced with the lips; {{IPA|[t]}}, pronounced with the front of the tongue; {{IPA|[k]}}, pronounced with the back of the tongue; {{IPA|[h]}}, pronounced in the throat; {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[s]}}, pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel ([[fricative]]s); and {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}, which have air flowing through the nose ([[nasal consonant|nasals]]). Contrasting with consonants are [[vowel]]s. 

Since the number of possible sounds in all of the world's languages is much greater than the number of letters in any one [[alphabet]], [[Linguistics|linguists]] have devised systems such as the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) to assign a unique and unambiguous [[symbol]] to each attested consonant. In fact, the [[Latin alphabet]], which is used to write English, has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s like &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;th&quot;, and &quot;zh&quot; are used to extend the alphabet, and some letters and digraphs represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled &quot;th&quot; in &quot;this&quot; is a different consonant than the &quot;th&quot; sound in &quot;thin&quot;. (In the IPA they are transcribed {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[θ]}}, respectively.)

==Terminology==
The word ''consonant'' comes from [[Latin]] oblique stem ''cōnsonant-,'' from ''cōnsonāns (littera)''  &quot;sounding-together (letter)&quot;, a [[calque]] of Greek σύμφωνον ''sýmphōnon'' (plural ''sýmphōna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|su/mfwnos|σύμφωνος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Barnhart, ''ed.'', ''Chambers Dictionary of Etymology'', Previously published as ''The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology'', originally ©1988 The H.W. Wilson Company; Edinburgh, reprinted 2001: Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd., p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dionysius Thrax]] calls consonants ''sýmphōna'' &quot;pronounced with&quot; because they can only be pronounced with a vowel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius Thrax]]. τέχνη γραμματική (Art of Grammar), [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante02/DionysiosThrax/dio_tech.html#06 ς´ περὶ στοιχείου (6. On the Sound)]:
:σύμφονα δὲ τὰ λοιπὰ ἑπτακαίδεκα· β γ δ ζ θ κ λ μ ν ξ π ρ σ τ φ χ ψ. σύμφοναι δὲ +λέγονται+, ὅτι αὐτὰ μὲν καθ᾽ ἑαυτὰ φωνὴν οὐκ ἔχει, συντασσόμενα δὲ μετὰ τῶν φωνηέντων φωνὴν ἀποτελεῖ.
:The remaining seventeen are consonants: b, g, d, z, th, k, l, m, n, x, p, r, s, t, ph, ch, ps. They are called consonants because they do not have a sound on their own, but when arranged with vowels, they produce a sound.&lt;/ref&gt; He divides them into two subcategories: ''hēmíphōna'', semivowels (literally &quot;half-pronounced&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|h(mi/fwnos|ἡμίφωνος|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; which correspond to modern [[continuant]] consonants, not [[semivowel]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Thrax:
:τούτων ἡμίφωνα μέν ἐστιν ὀκτώ· ζ ξ ψ λ μ ν ρ σ. ἡμίφωνα δὲ λέγεται, ὅτι παρ᾽ ὅσον ἧττον τῶν φωνηέντων εὔφωνα καθέστηκεν ἔν τε τοῖς μυγμοῖς καὶ σιγμοῖς.
:Of these, eight are semivowels [half-pronounced]: z, x, ps, l, m, n, r, s. They are called semivowels, because, though a little weaker than the vowels, they are still harmonious [well-sounding] in their moaning and hissing.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''áphōna'', mute or silent consonants (literally &quot;unvoiced&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/fwnos|ἄφωνος|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; which correspond to modern [[stop consonant|stops]] or plosives, not to modern unvoiced or [[voiceless]] consonants.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Thrax:
:ἄφωνα δέ ἐστιν ἐννέα· β γ δ κ π τ θ φ χ. ἄφωνα δὲ λέγεται, ὅτι μᾶλλον τῶν ἄλλων ἐστὶν κακόφωνα, ὥσπερ ἄφωνον λέγομεν τὸν τραγωιδὸν τὸν κακόφωνον.
:Nine are silent [unpronounced]: b, g, d, k, p, t, th, ph, ch. They are called silent, because, more than the others, they are discordant [ill-sounding], just as we call the ill-sounding tragedy &quot;silent&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

This description does not apply to some [[Natural language|human languages]], such as the [[Salishan languages]], in which stop consonants sometimes occur without vowels (see [[Nuxálk language|Nuxálk]]), and the modern conception of consonant does not require cooccurrence with vowels. It is not a vowel and is not followed by any vowels.

==Letters==
{{main|Writing system}}
The word '''consonant''' is also used to refer to a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] of an [[alphabet]] that denotes a consonant sound. Consonant letters in the English alphabet are [[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[P]], [[Q]], [[R]], [[S]], [[T]], [[V]], [[X]], [[Z]], and usually [[W]] and [[Y]]: The letter Y stands for the consonant {{IPA|[j]}} in &quot;yoke&quot;, the vowel {{IPA|[ɪ]}} in &quot;myth&quot; and the Y in &quot;funny&quot; {{IPA|[i]}}, for example; W is almost always a consonant except in rare words  (mostly [[loanword]]s from [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) like &quot;crwth&quot; &quot;cwm&quot;.
There are 21 letters that are consonants.

==Consonants versus vowels==
Consonants and vowels correspond to distinct parts of a [[syllable]]: The most sonorous part of the syllable (that is, the part that's easiest to sing), called the ''syllabic peak'' or ''[[syllable nucleus|nucleus]],'' is typically a vowel, while the less sonorous margins (called the ''[[syllable onset|onset]]'' and ''[[syllable coda|coda]]'') are typically consonants. Such syllables may be abbreviated CV, V, and CVC, where C stands for consonant and V stands for vowel. This can be argued to be the only pattern found in most of the world's languages, and perhaps the primary pattern in all of them. However, the distinction between consonant and vowel is not always clear cut: there are syllabic consonants and non-syllabic vowels in many of the world's languages.

One blurry area is in segments variously called ''[[semivowel]]s, semiconsonants,'' or ''glides''. On the one side, there are vowel-like segments which are not in themselves syllabic, but which form [[diphthong]]s as part of the syllable nucleus, as the ''i'' in English ''boil'' {{IPA|[ˈbɔɪ̯l]}}. On the other, there are [[approximant]]s which behave like consonants in forming onsets, but are articulated very much like vowels, as the ''y'' in English ''yes'' {{IPA|[ˈjɛs]}}. Some phonologists model these as both being the underlying vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, so that the English word ''bit'' would [[phoneme|phonemically]] be {{IPA|/bit/}}, ''beet'' would be {{IPA|/bii̯t/}}, and ''yield'' would be phonemically {{IPA|/i̯ii̯ld/}}. Similarly, ''foot'' would be {{IPA|/fut/}}, ''food'' would be {{IPA|/fuu̯d/}}, ''wood'' would be {{IPA|/u̯ud/}}, and ''wooed'' would be {{IPA|/u̯uu̯d/}}. However, there is a (perhaps allophonic) difference in articulation between these segments, with the {{IPA|[j]}} in {{IPA|[ˈjɛs]}} ''yes'' and {{IPA|[ˈjiʲld]}} ''yield'' and the {{IPA|[w]}} of {{IPA|[ˈwuʷd]}} ''wooed'' having more constriction and a more definite place of articulation than the {{IPA|[ɪ]}} in {{IPA|[ˈbɔɪ̯l]}} ''boil'' or {{IPA|[ˈbɪt]}} ''bit'' or the {{IPA|[ʊ]}} of {{IPA|[ˈfʊt]}}. 

The other problematic area is that of syllabic consonants, segments articulated as consonants but occupying the nucleus of a syllable. This may be the case for words such as ''church'' in [[rhotic]] dialects of English, although phoneticians differ in whether they consider this to be a syllabic consonant, {{IPA|/ˈtʃɹ̩tʃ/}}, or a rhotic vowel, {{IPA|/ˈtʃɝtʃ/}}: Some distinguish an approximant {{IPA|/ɹ/}} that corresponds to a vowel {{IPA|/ɝ/}}, for ''rural'' as {{IPA|/ˈɹɝl/}} or {{IPA|[ˈɹʷɝːl̩]}}; others see these as a single phoneme, {{IPA|/ˈɹɹ̩l/}}. 

Other languages use fricative and often trilled segments as syllabic nuclei, as in [[Czech language|Czech]] and several languages in [[Congo]] and [[China]], including [[Mandarin Chinese]]. In Mandarin, they are historically allophones of {{IPA|/i/}}, and spelled that way in [[Pinyin]]. Ladefoged and Maddieson&lt;ref name=SOWL&gt;{{SOWL}}&lt;/ref&gt; call these &quot;fricative vowels&quot; and say that &quot;they can usually be thought of as syllabic fricatives that are allophones of vowels.&quot; That is, phonetically they are consonants, but phonemically they behave as vowels. 

Many [[Slavic languages]] allow the trill {{IPA|[r̩]}} and the lateral {{IPA|[l̩]}} as syllabic nuclei (see [[Words without vowels]]), and in languages like [[Nuxálk language|Nuxalk]], it is difficult to know what the nucleus of a syllable is (it may be that not all syllables have nuclei), though if the concept of 'syllable' applies, there are syllabic consonants in words like {{IPA|/sx̩s/}} 'seal fat'.

==Features==
{{Manner of articulation}}
Each spoken consonant can be distinguished by several phonetic ''[[Distinctive feature|features]]'':&lt;ref name=SOWL/&gt;
* The [[manner of articulation]] is how air escapes from the vocal tract when the consonant or [[approximant]] (vowel like) sound is made. Manners include stops, fricatives and nasals.
* The [[place of articulation]] is where in the vocal tract the obstruction of the consonant occurs, and which speech organs are involved. Places include [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] (both lips), [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (tongue against the gum ridge), and [[velar consonant|velar]] (tongue against soft palate). Additionally, there may be a simultaneous narrowing at another place of articulation, such as [[palatalisation]] or [[pharyngealisation]].
* The [[phonation]] of a consonant is how the [[vocal cords]] vibrate during the articulation. When the vocal cords vibrate fully, the consonant is called [[voiced]]; when they do not vibrate at all, it's [[voiceless]]. 
* The [[voice onset time]] (VOT) indicates the timing of the phonation. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is a feature of VOT.
* The [[airstream mechanism]] is how the air moving through the vocal tract is powered. Most languages have exclusively [[pulmonic egressive]] consonants, which use the lungs and diaphragm, but [[ejective]]s, [[click consonant|click]]s and [[implosive]]s use different mechanisms.
* The [[gemination|length]] is how long the obstruction of a consonant lasts. This feature is borderline distinctive in English, as in &quot;wholly&quot; {{IPA|[hoʊlli]}} vs. &quot;holy&quot; {{IPA|[hoʊli]}}, but cases are limited to morpheme boundaries. Unrelated roots are differentiated in various languages such as Italian, Japanese and Finnish, with two length levels, &quot;single&quot; and &quot;[[geminate]]&quot;. [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and some [[Sami languages]] have three phonemic lengths: short, geminate, and long geminate, although the distinction between the geminate and overlong geminate includes suprasegmental features.
* The articulatory force is how much muscular energy is involved. This has been proposed many times, but no distinction relying exclusively on force has ever been demonstrated.

All English consonants can be classified by a combination of these features, such as &quot;voiceless alveolar stop consonant&quot; {{IPA|[t]}}. In this case the airstream mechanism is omitted.

Some pairs of consonants like ''p::b'', ''t::d'' are sometimes called [[fortis and lenis]], but this is a [[phonology|phonological]] rather than phonetic distinction.

Consonants are scheduled by their features in a number of IPA charts:
{{IPA consonant chart}}

==Examples==
The extinct [[Ubykh language]] had only 3 vowels but had 80 or 81 native consonants&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil and Tevfik Esenç, 1975, ''Le verbe oubykh: études descriptives et comparatives''. Adrien Maisonneuve: Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;; the [[Taa language]] has 77 consonants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vistawide.com/languages/language_statistics.htm World Language Statistics and Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; The types of consonants used in various languages are by no means universal. For instance, nearly all [[Australian languages]] lack fricatives; a large percentage of the world's languages, for example [[Mandarin Chinese]], lack voiced stops such as {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}. Most languages, however, do include one or more fricatives, with {{IPA|[s]}} being the most common, and a [[liquid consonant]] or two, with {{IPA|[l]}} the most common. The approximant {{IPA|[w]}} is also widespread, and virtually all languages have one or more [[nasal consonants]], though a very few, such as the Central dialect of [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], lack even these.

===Most common===
The most common consonants around the world are the three voiceless plosives {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[k]}} and the two nasals {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}. However, even these common five are not universal. Several languages in the vicinity of the [[Sahara Desert]], including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], lack {{IPA|[p]}}. Several languages of North America, such as [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], lack both of the labials {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[m]}}. The [[Wichita language|Wichita]] language of [[Oklahoma]] and some West African languages such as [[Ijo languages|Ijo]] lack the consonant {{IPA|/n/}} on a phonemic level, but do use it as an [[allophone]] of another consonant (of {{IPA|/l/}} in the case of Ijo, and of {{IPA|/ɾ/}} in Wichita). A few languages on [[Bougainville Island]] and around [[Puget Sound]], such as [[Makah language|Makah]], lack both of the nasals {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. The 'click language' [[Nǀu language|Nǀu]] lacks {{IPA|[t]}},&lt;ref&gt;Nǀu has a {{IPA|[ts]}} instead. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to lack a {{IPA|[t]}}, but it actually has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and colloquial [[Samoan language|Samoan]] lacks both alveolars, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Samoan words written with the letters ''t'' and ''n'' are pronounced with {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} except in formal speech. However, Samoan does have an alveolar consonant, {{IPA|[l]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the 80-odd consonants of [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], it lacks the plain velar {{IPA|/k/}} in native words, as do the related [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] and [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] languages. But with a few striking exceptions, such as [[Xavante language|Xavante]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] - which have no dorsal consonants whatsoever - nearly all other languages have at least one velar consonant: the few languages which do not have a simple {{IPA|[k]}} usually have a consonant that is very similar.&lt;ref&gt;The Niʻihau–Kauaʻi dialect of [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to have no {{IPA|[k]}}, but as in other dialects of Hawaiian it has a consonant which varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}, with {{IPA|[t]}} before {{IPA|[i]}} but {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginnings of words, though they are often in [[free variation]].&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, an areal feature of the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast is that historical *{{IPA|[k]}} has become palatalized in many languages, so that [[Saanich language|Saanich]] for example has {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[kʷ]}} but no plain {{IPA|[k]}};&lt;ref&gt;Ian Maddieson and Sandra Ferrari Disner, 1984, ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/feature/18 The World Atlas of Language Structures Online: Absence of Common Consonants]&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, historical *{{IPA|[k]}} in the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] became palatalized to {{IPA|/kʲ/}} in [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] and {{IPA|/ʧ/}} in most [[Circassian languages|Circassian]] dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Viacheslav A. Chirikba, 1996, ''Common West Caucasian: the reconstruction of its phonological system and parts of its lexicon and morphology'', p. 192. Research School CNWS: Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most ''frequent'' consonant (that is, the one appearing most often in speech) in many languages is {{IPA|[k]}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[File:Swatch Bijoux Jewelry.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Swatch]] Bijoux &lt;ref&gt;''Bijoux'' is French for &quot;jewels&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewelry]]

'''Costume jewelry''' (also called '''fashion jewelry''', '''junk jewelry''', '''fake jewelry''', or '''fallalery''') is [[jewelry]] manufactured as ornamentation to complement a particular fashionable [[costume]] or garment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;&gt;Baker, Lillian. Fifty Years of Collectable Fashion Jewelry. Paducah: Collector Books, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Costume jewelry came into being in the 1930s as a cheap, disposable accessory meant to be worn with a specific outfit. It was intended to be fashionable for a short period of time, [[Planned obsolescence|outdate itself]], and then be repurchased to fit with a new outfit or new fashion style. Its main use is in [[fashion]], as opposed to &quot;real&quot; (fine) jewelry which may be regarded primarily as collectibles, keepsakes, or investments. Costume jewelry is made of less valuable materials including [[base metals]], glass, plastic, and synthetic stones; in place of more valuable materials such as [[precious metals]] and gems.

==Etymology==
The term costume jewelry dates back to the early 20th century. It reflects the use of the word &quot;costume&quot; to refer to what is now called an &quot;[[outfit]]&quot;; for example, a &quot;handsome street costume of maroon brown velvet&quot;. Costume jewelry is meant to complement a particular fashionable garment or &quot;costume&quot;; Hence the name, &quot;costume jewelry&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot; /&gt;

==Components==
[[Image:A002.jpg|thumb|right|An example of gold plated jewelry]]
Originally, costume or fashion jewelry was made of inexpensive simulated gemstones, such as [[rhinestone]]s or [[lucite]], set in [[pewter]], [[silver]], [[nickel]] or [[brass]]. During the depression years, rhinestones were even down-graded by some manufacturers to meet the cost of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot; /&gt;An interesting phenomenon occurred during the World War II era, when sterling silver was often incorporated into costume jewelry designs.  This was driven by primarily two factors:
1. The components used for base metal were needed for war time production (i.e., military applications) and a ban was placed on their use in the private sector.
2. Base metal was originally popular because it could approximate platinum's color, sterling silver fulfilled the same function. 
This resulted in a number of years during which sterling silver costume jewelry was produced and some can still be found in today's vintage jewelry marketplace.

Modern costume jewelry incorporates a wide range of materials. High end [[crystals]], [[cubic zirconia]] simulated diamonds, and some semi-precious stones are used in place of precious stones. Metals include gold- or silver-plated brass, and sometimes vermeil or sterling silver. Lower-priced jewelry may still use gold plating over pewter, nickel or other metals; items made in countries outside the United States may contain [[lead]]. Some pieces incorporate [[plastic]], [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]], [[leather]] or wood.

==Historical expression==
Costume jewelry can be characterized by the period in history in which it was made.

===Art Deco period (1920–1930s)===
The [[Art Deco]] movement was an attempt to combine the harshness of mass production with the sensitivity of art and design. It was during this period that Coco Chanel introduced costume jewelry to complete the costume. The Art Deco movement died with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://emptyeasel.com/2007/08/21/the-art-deco-movement-technology-and-geometry-combined-with-modern-art/ &quot;The Art Deco Movement: Technology and Geometry Combined with Modern Art.&quot;] 2005. Empty Easel.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Schiffer, some of the characteristics of the costume jewelry in the Art Deco period were:&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiffer&quot; /&gt; 
*Free-flowing curves were replaced with a harshly geometric and symmetrical theme
*Long pendants, bangle bracelets, cocktail rings, and elaborate accessory items such as cigarette cases and holders

===Retro period (1935 to 1950)===
In the Retro period, designers struggled with the art versus [[mass production]] dilemma. Natural materials merged with plastics. Jewelry featured produced American-made jewelry that took on the American look. With the war in Europe, many European jewelry firms were shut down and several designers immigrated to the U.S. Europe was in a deep depression and the U.S. was enjoying an economic recovery.

According to Schiffer, some of the characteristics of the costume jewelry in the Retro period were:&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiffer&quot; /&gt;
*Glamour, elegance, and sophistication
*Flowers, bows, and sunburst designs with a Hollywood flair
*Moonstones, horse motifs, military influence, and ballerinas
*[[Bakelite]] and other plastic jewelry

===Art Modern period (1945 to 1960)===
In the Art Modern period following World War II, jewelry designs became more traditional and understated. The big, bold styles of the Retro period went out of style and were replaced by the more tailored styles of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot; /&gt;

According to Schiffer, some of the characteristics of the costume jewelry in the Art Modern period were:&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiffer&quot; /&gt;
*Bold, lavish jewelry
*Large, chunky bracelets, charm bracelets, Jade/opal, charm bracelets, citrine, [[topaz]]
*Poodle pins, Christmas tree pins, and other Christmas jewelry
*Rhinestones

==General history==
Costume jewelry has been part of culture for almost 300 years. During the 18th century cheap jewelry made with glass started getting made. After almost a century, in the 19th century, costume jewelry made of semi precious material came into the market. The use of semi precious material made the jewelry available in the hands of the common people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiffer&quot;&gt;Schiffer, Nancy. ''The Best of Costume Jewelry''. Atglen: Schiffer Publishing, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the real golden era for the costume jewelry began in the middle of the 20th century. The new [[middle class]] desired to own beautiful but affordable jewelry, and this desire was realized by its perfect timing: it came during the machine-age and the [[industrial revolution]]. All this made possible the production of carefully executed replicas of beautiful and admired [[heirloom]] pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot; /&gt;

As the class structure in America changed, so did measures of real wealth. Women in all social stations, even the working-class woman, could own a small piece of costume jewelry. The average town and country woman could acquire and wear a considerable amount of this mass-produced jewelry that was both affordable and stylish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiffer&quot; /&gt;

Many feel{{who|date=November 2010}} that the machine has spoilt the beauty of the hand-made costume jewelry; the truth{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} is that the machine has made fashion jewelry more affordable and has enabled people to produce enough of this jewelry to fuel the interest of millions of ladies from all around the world.

Costume jewelry was further made popular by various designers in the mid-20th century. Some of the most remembered names in costume jewelry include both the high and low priced brands: Crown Trifari, [[Dior]], [[Chanel]], [[Monet]], [[Napier Company (jewellery)|Napier]], [[Corocraft]] and [[Coventry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot; /&gt;

A significant factor in the popularisation of costume jewellery was the Hollywood movie. The leading female stars of the 1940s and 1950s often wore and then endorsed the pieces produced by a range of designers. If you admired a necklace worn by [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'', you could buy a copy from Joseff of Hollywood, who made the original. Stars such as [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jane Russell]] appeared in adverts for the pieces and the availability of the collections in shops such as [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] made it possible for ordinary women to own and wear such jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;See Tanenbaum, C. (2006) ''Fabulous Fakes: A Passion for Vintage Costume Jewelry'', ISBN 13: 9781579652920&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coco Chanel]] greatly popularized the use of [[fake|faux]] jewelry in her years as a fashion designer, bringing costume jewelry to life with gold and faux pearls.
[[Kenneth Jay Lane]] has since the 1960s been known for creating unique pieces for [[Jackie Onassis]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Diana Vreeland]], and [[Audrey Hepburn]]. He is probably best-known for his three-strand faux pearl necklace worn by [[Barbara Bush]] to her husband's [[inaugural]] ball.

In many instances, high-end fashion jewelry has achieved a &quot;collectible&quot; status, and increases in value over time. Today, there is a substantial secondary market for [[vintage]] fashion jewelry. The main collecting market is for 'signed pieces', that is pieces which have the maker's mark, usually stamped on the reverse. Amongst the most sought after are [[Miriam Haskell]], [[Coro]], Crown Trifari and Sphinx. However, there is also demand for good quality 'unsigned' pieces, especially if they are of an unusual design.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. (2007) ''Costume Jewellery'', ISBN 1405318120&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business and industry ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Costume jewelry is considered a discrete category of [[fashion accessory]], and as such it displays many of the characteristics of a self-contained industry. Costume jewelry manufacturers are located throughout the world, with a particular concentration in parts of China and India, where entire city-wide and region-wide economies are dominated by the trade of these goods. There has been considerable controversy in the United States and elsewhere about the lack of regulations in the manufacture of such jewelry—these range from [[human rights]] issues surrounding the treatment of labor, to the use of manufacturing processes in which small, but potentially harmful, amounts of [[toxic metals]] are added during production. In the United States a scandal broke when it was discovered during testing that cheap costume jewelry from China contained unsafe levels of the metal [[cadmium]]. The wider issues surrounding imports, exports, trade laws, and [[globalization]], also apply to the costume jewelry trade.

As part of the [[supply chain]], wholesalers in the United States and other major nations purchase costume jewelry from manufacturers and typically import or export it to wholesale distributors and suppliers who deal directly with retailers. Wholesale costume jewelry merchants would traditionally seek out new suppliers at [[trade shows]]. As the [[internet]] has become increasingly important in global trade, however, this model has been modified, as many retailers can now select from a large number of wholesalers through the World Wide Web. Some of these sites also market directly to consumers who can purchase costume jewelry at greatly reduced prices. Some of these sites include [[fashion jewelry]] as a separate category, while some use this term in favor of costume jewelry. The trend of jewelry-making at home by hobbyists for personal enjoyment or for sale on sites like [[Etsy]] has resulted in the common practice of buying wholesale costume jewelry in bulk and using it for parts.

[[File:Channel islands location.png|right|thumb|240px|A map of the location of the Channel Islands, located between the south coast of the United Kingdom and Northern France.]]

The '''Channel Islands''' ([[Norman language|Norman]]: ''Îles d'la Manche'', [[French language|French]]: ''Îles Anglo-Normandes'' or ''Îles de la Manche'') are an [[archipelago]] of British [[Crown Dependencies]] in the [[English Channel]], off the [[France|French]] coast of [[Normandy]]. They include two separate [[bailiwick]]s: the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and the [[Bailiwick of Jersey]], neither of which is part of the [[United Kingdom]]; rather they are considered the remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/ChannelIslands.aspx Royal.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; They have a total population of about 158,000 and their respective [[Capital (political)|capitals]], [[St. Peter Port]] and [[St. Helier]], have populations of 16,488 and 28,310. The total area of the islands is 194&amp;nbsp;km².

The Bailiwicks have been administered separately from each other since the late 13th century, and although those unacquainted with the islands often assume they form one political unit, common institutions are the exception rather than the rule. The two Bailiwicks have no common laws, no common elections, and no common representative body (although their politicians consult regularly). There is no common newspaper or radio station, but there is a common television station, [[Channel Television|ITV Channel Television]], as well as a common BBC television news opt-out [[Spotlight (BBC News)|BBC Channel Islands News]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Wyspy Normandzkie.png|thumb|right|240px|Map of Channel Islands and adjacent coast of France.]]
[[File:Jethou Herm Sark viewed from Jersey.jpg|thumb|Viewed from Jersey's north coast, [[Jethou]], [[Herm]] and [[Sark]] are hazy outlines on the horizon.]]

The inhabited islands of the Channel Islands are [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]], [[Alderney]], [[Sark]], [[Herm]] (the main islands); [[Jethou]], [[Brecqhou]] (Brechou) and [[Lihou]]. All of these except Jersey are in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. In addition there are the following uninhabited islets: the [[Minquiers]], [[Écréhous]], [[Les Dirouilles]] and Les [[Pierres de Lecq]] (the Paternosters), are part of the Bailiwick of Jersey, and [[Burhou]] and the [[Casquets]] lie off Alderney. As a general rule, the larger islands have the ''-ey'' suffix, and the smaller ones have the ''[[-hou]]'' suffix; this is believed to be from the [[Old Norse]] ''ey'' and ''holmr'', respectively.

The [[Chausey]] Islands south of Jersey are not generally included in the geographical definition of the Channel Islands but occasionally described as 'French Channel Islands' in English in view of their French jurisdiction. They were historically linked to the Duchy of Normandy, but they are part of the French territory along with continental Normandy, and not part of the [[British Isles]] or of the Channel Islands in a political sense. They are an incorporated part of the commune of Granville ([[Manche]]). While popular with visitors from France they are rarely visited by Channel Islanders, as there are no direct transport links from the other islands.

In official Jersey French (see [[Jersey Legal French]]), the islands are called 'Îles de la Manche', while in France, the term 'Îles anglo-normandes' (Anglo-Norman isles) is used to refer to the British 'Channel Islands' in contrast to other islands in the Channel. Chausey is referred to as an 'Île normande' (as opposed to ''anglo-normande''). 'Îles Normandes' and 'Archipel Normand' have also, historically, been used in Channel Island French to refer to the islands as a whole.

The very large tidal variation provides an environmentally rich inter-tidal zone around the islands, and some sites have received [[Ramsar Convention]] designation (see ''[[:Category:Ramsar sites in the Channel Islands]]'').

The waters around the islands include the following:
*[[The Swinge]] (between Alderney and Burhou)
*The Little Swinge (between Burhou and Les Nannels)
*La Déroute (between Jersey and Sark, and Jersey and the Cotentin)
*Le Raz Blanchard, or Race of Alderney (between Alderney and the Cotentin)
*The [[Great Russel]] (between Sark, Jéthou and Herm)
*The [[Little Russel]] (between Guernsey, Herm and Jéthou)
*Souachehouais (between Le Rigdon and L'Étacq, Jersey)
*Le Gouliot (between Sark and Brecqhou)
*La Percée (between Herm and Jéthou)

The highest point in the islands is [[Les Platons]] in Jersey at 143 metres (469&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. The lowest point is the [[Atlantic Ocean]], (Sea Level).

[[File:La Gran'mère du Chimquière Guernsey.jpg|thumb|''La Gran'mère du Chimquière'', [[Statue menhir]], [[Saint Martin, Guernsey]]]]

===Prehistory===
The earliest evidence of human occupation of the Channel Islands has been dated to 25,000 years ago when they were attached to the landmass of continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/la-cotte/ Thisisjersey.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The islands became detached by rising sea-levels in the Neolithic period. The numerous [[dolmen]]s and other archaeological sites extant and recorded in history demonstrate the existence of a population large enough and organised enough to undertake constructions of considerable size and sophistication, such as the burial mound at [[La Hougue Bie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/la-hougue-bie/ Thisisjersey.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in Jersey or the [[statue menhir]]s of Guernsey.

===From the Iron Age===

Hoards of [[Armorica]]n coins have been excavated, providing evidence of trade and contact in the Iron Age period. Evidence for Roman settlement is sparse, although evidently the islands were visited by Roman officials and traders. The traditional Latin names of the islands (Caesarea for Jersey; Sarnia for Guernsey, Riduna for Alderney) derive (possibly mistakenly) from the [[Antonine Itinerary]]. Gallo-Roman culture was adopted to an unknown extent in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) ISBN 1-86077-065-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century Christian missionaries visited the islands. [[Samson of Dol]], [[Helier]], [[Marculf]] and [[Magloire]] are among saints associated with the islands. Although originally included within the [[diocese of Dol]], in the 6th century the islands were transferred to the [[diocese of Coutances]], perhaps under the influence of [[Prætextatus (Bishop of Rouen)|Prætextatus]].

From the beginning of the 9th century Norse raiders appeared on the coasts. Norse settlement succeeded initial attacks, and it is from this period that many placenames of Norse origin appear, including the modern names of the islands.

===From the Duchy of Normandy===

The islands were annexed to the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in 933. In 1066, [[William I of England|William II of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] to the king of France, invaded and conquered [[England]], becoming William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. In the period 1204-1214, King [[John of England|John]] lost the Angevin lands in northern France, including mainland Normandy, to King [[Philip II of France]]; in 1259 his successor, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] officially surrendered his claim and title to the Duchy of Normandy, while retaining the Channel Islands. Since then, the Channel Islands have been governed as possessions of [[the Crown]] separate from the Kingdom of England and its successor kingdoms of Great Britain and the United Kingdom.

The islands were invaded by the French in 1338 who held some territory until 1345. Owen of Wales attacked Jersey and Guernsey in 1372, and in 1373 [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] besieged [[Mont Orgueil]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/bertrand-du-guesclin/ Bertrand du Guesclin: The Black Dog of Brittany] Thisisjersey.com, copyright 2010, accessed 2010-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jersey was occupied by the French (as part of the [[Wars of the Roses]]) from 1461-1468. In 1483 a [[Papal Bull]] decreed that the islands would be neutral during time of war. This privilege of neutrality enabled islanders to trade with both France and England and was respected until 1689 when it was abolished by [[Order in Council]] following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in Great Britain.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Various attempts to transfer the islands from the diocese of Coutances (to Nantes (1400), Salisbury (1496) and Winchester (1499)) had little effect until an Order in Council of 1569 brought the islands formally into the [[diocese of Winchester]]. Control by the bishop of Winchester was ineffectual as the islands had turned overwhelmingly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and the episcopacy was not restored until 1620 in Jersey and 1663 in Guernsey.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Sark in the 16th century was uninhabited until colonised from Jersey in the 1560s. The grant of seigneurship from [[Elizabeth I of England]] forms the basis of Sark's constitution today.

Over a dozen [[windmills]] are known to have existed in the Channel Isles. They were mostly [[tower mill]]s used for grinding corn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===From the 17th century===

During the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Jersey held out strongly for the Royalist cause, providing refuge for [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1646 and 1649–1650, while the more strongly Presbyterian Guernsey more generally favoured the parliamentary cause (although [[Castle Cornet]] was, on 15 December 1651, the last Royalist stronghold in the British Isles to surrender).&lt;ref&gt;''Portrait of the Channel Islands'', Lemprière, London 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands acquired commercial and political interests in the [[North America]]n colonies. Islanders became involved with the [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] fisheries in the 17th century. In recognition for all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] gave [[George Carteret]], Bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies, which he promptly named [[New Jersey]], now part of the [[United States|United States of America]]. [[Edmund Andros]] of Guernsey was an early colonial governor in North America, and head of the short-lived [[Dominion of New England]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===20th century===
[[File:Bunker in Alderney.JPG|right|300px|thumb|To this day, the Channel Islands remain covered in German [[fortification]]s built in the [[World War II|Second World War]].]]

====World War II====
The islands were the only part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] to be [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by the German Army]] during [[World War II]]. The German occupation of 1940–45 was harsh: over 2,000 Islanders were deported by the Germans,&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot;&gt;''The German Occupation of the Channel Islands'', Cruikshank, Oxford 1975 ISBN 0192850873&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] sent to [[concentration camp]]s; [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance and retribution; accusations of [[collaborationism|collaboration]]; and slave labour (primarily [[Russia]]ns and eastern Europeans) brought to the islands to build [[fortification]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/german-occupation Thisisjersey.com]/&lt;/ref&gt; with
65,718 landmines laid in Jersey alone.&lt;ref&gt;''German Fortifications in Jersey'', Ginns &amp; Bryans, Jersey 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government demilitarised the islands in June 1940 and the Lieutenant-Governors were withdrawn on 21 June, leaving the insular administrations to continue government as best they could under impending military occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt;

Before German troops landed during 30 June through 4 July 1940, evacuation took place (many young men had already left to join the Allied armed forces): 6,600 left Jersey (out of 50,000); 17,000 left Guernsey (out of 42,000); the population of Sark largely remained where they were;&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt; but in [[Alderney#History|Alderney]], the entire population, save for six persons, left. In Alderney, the occupying Germans built [[Alderney concentration camps|four concentration camps]] in which over 700 people died (out of a total prisoner population of about 6,000). Due to the destruction of documents, it is impossible to state how many forced workers died in the other islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt; These were the only Nazi concentration camps on [[British Islands|British]] soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;okeefe&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Christine O'Keefe |url=http://www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html |title=Appendix F: Concentration Camps: Endlösung – The Final Solution |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aurigny&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Matisson Consultants |url=http://www.matisson-consultants.com/affaire-papon/aurigny.htm |title=Aurigny ; un camp de concentration nazi sur une île anglo-normande (English: Alderney, a Nazi concentration camp on an island Anglo-Norman) |accessdate=2009-06-06}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VEGA Royal Square Jersey.jpg|thumb|During the German occupation of [[Jersey]], a stonemason repairing the paving of the Royal Square incorporated a [[V sign#The V campaign and the victory/freedom sign|V for victory]] under the noses of the occupiers. This was later amended to refer to the Red Cross ship ''Vega''. The addition of the date 1945 and a more recent frame has transformed it into a monument]]
The [[Royal Navy]] [[blockade]]d these islands from time to time, particularly following the [[Invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944. There was considerable hunger and privation during the five years of German occupation, particularly in the final months when the population was close to starvation. Intense negotiations resulted in some humanitarian aid sent via the [[Red Cross]], leading to the arrival of the [[Red Cross]] supply ship ''Vega'' in December 1944.

The end of the occupation came only after [[VE-Day]] on 8 May 1945. Jersey and Guernsey were liberated on 9 May 1945. The German garrison in Alderney did not surrender until 16 May 1945 and it was one of the last of the [[Nazi German]] remnants to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;dday&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Legacy Publishers |title=Nazi Germany Surrenders: February 1945-May 1945 |url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/nazi-germany-surrenders12.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first evacuees returned on the first sailing from [[Great Britain]] on 23 June,&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt; but the people of Alderney were unable to start returning until December 1945.

====Post-1945====

Following the Liberation of 1945, reconstruction led to a transformation of the economies of the islands, attracting immigration and developing tourism. The legislatures were reformed and non-party governments embarked on social programmes, aided by the incomes from [[offshore finance]] which grew rapidly from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/finance-industry/ Thisisjersey.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands decided not to join the [[European Economic Community]] when the UK joined, and remain outside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.je/ChiefMinister/International+Relations/Profile+of+Jersey.htm Gov.je]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s declining profitability of agriculture and tourism have challenged the governments of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisguernsey.com/lifestyle/hanging-on-to-our-heritage/the-bailiwick-of-guernsey/ Thisisjersey.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Channel Islands fall into two separate [[federacy|self-governing]] bailiwicks. Both the Bailiwick of [[Guernsey]] and the Bailiwick of [[Jersey]] are [[British Empire|British]] [[Crown dependency|Crown Dependencies]], but neither is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. They have been part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] since the 10th century and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is often referred to by her traditional and conventional title of [[Duke of Normandy]]. However, pursuant to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)]] she is not the Duke in a constitutional capacity and instead governs in her right as Queen (the &quot;Crown in right of Jersey&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A bailiwick is a territory administered by a bailiff. The [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] in each bailiwick is the civil head, presiding officer of the States, and also head of the [[judiciary]].

The systems of government date from [[Normans|Norman]] times, which accounts for the names of the [[legislature]]s, the States, derived from the [[Norman language|Norman]] 'États' or '[[Estates of the realm|estates]]' (i.e. the Crown, the Church, and the people). The States have evolved over the centuries into democratic [[parliament]]s.

[[File:States Chamber public entrance Jersey.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the public gallery of the States Chamber in Jersey.]]
The Channel Islands are not represented in the [[UK Parliament]] but each island has its own primary legislature, known as the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[States of Jersey]], with Chief Pleas in Sark and the [[States of Alderney]]. Laws passed by the States are given [[Royal Assent]] by [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|the Queen in Council]], to whom the islands' governments are responsible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/crown/bg-info-crown-dependencies.pdf DCA.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands are not part of the [[European Union]], but are part of the Customs Territory of the [[European Community]], by virtue of Protocol Three to the [[Treaty on European Union]]. In September 2010 a Channel Islands Brussels Office was set up jointly by the two Bailiwicks to develop the Channel Islands' influence with the EU, to advise the Channel Islands' governments on European matters, and to promote economic links with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.gg/ccm/general/Guernsey-and-Jersey-begin-recruiting-for-senior-Brussels-positions.en States of Guernsey: August: Guernsey and Jersey begin recruiting for senior Brussels positions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Bailiwicks are members of the [[British-Irish Council]], and [[Jèrriais]] and [[Guernésiais]] are recognised [[regional language]]s of the Isles.

The legal courts are separate; separate courts of appeal have been in place since 1961. Among the legal heritage from Norman law is the [[Clameur de haro|Clameur de Haro]].

Islanders are full British citizens, and therefore European Citizens. Any British citizen who applies for a passport in Jersey or Guernsey receives a passport bearing the words &quot;[[British Islands]], Bailiwick of Jersey&quot; or &quot;British Islands, Bailiwick of Guernsey&quot;. Under the provisions of Protocol Three, Channel Islanders who do not have a close connection with the UK (no parent or grandparent from the UK, and have never been resident in Great Britain and Northern Ireland for any five-year period) do not automatically benefit from the EU provisions on free movement within the EU and consequently their passports receive an endorsement to that effect. This only affects a minority of islanders.

Under the UK [[Interpretation Act 1978]], the Channel Islands are deemed to be part of the British Islands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1838152 “British Islands” means the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. (1889)]&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with the [[British Isles]]. For the purposes of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]], &quot;United Kingdom&quot; (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, taken together, unless the context otherwise requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1981/cukpga_19810061_en_8#pt5-l1g57|title=British Nationality Act 1981|accessdate=2009-09-14|work=Legislation, UK, Acts|publisher= [[Office of Public Sector Information]]|quote=the Islands” means the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; [...] the United Kingdom” means Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Islands, taken together.}} [Schedule 1., s. 50 (1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Jersey}}
{{See also|Guernsey pound|Jersey pound}}

Tourism is the major industry in the smaller islands (with some agriculture). Jersey and Guernsey have, since the 1960s, relied on financial services. Guernsey's horticultural and greenhouse activities have been more significant than in Jersey, and Guernsey has maintained [[light industry]] as a higher proportion of its economy than Jersey. Jersey's economy since the 1980s has been substantially more reliant on finance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Both Bailiwicks issue their own banknotes and coins, which circulate freely in all the islands alongside UK coinage and Bank of England and Scottish banknotes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There are many exports, largely consisting of crafted goods and farmed produce.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Transport and communications ==
===Post===
{{main|Jersey Post|Guernsey Post}}
Since 1969, Jersey and Guernsey have operated postal administrations independently of the UK's [[Royal Mail]], with their own postage stamps, which can only be used for postage in their respective Bailiwicks. UK stamps are no longer valid, but mail to the islands, and to the [[Isle of Man]], is still charged at UK inland rates. However, it was not until the early 1990s that the islands joined the [[UK postcodes|UK's postcode]] system, Jersey postcodes using the initials JE and Guernsey using GY.

===Transport===
{{main|Transport in Guernsey|Transport in Jersey}}

====Road====
{{main|Roads in Jersey}}
Each of the three largest islands has a distinct vehicle registration scheme:
* Guernsey (GBG): simply a number, up to five digits;
* Jersey (GBJ): ''J'' followed by up to six digits (''JSY'' vanity plates are also issued);
* Alderney (GBA): ''AY'' followed by up to five digits (four digits are the most that have been used, as redundant numbers are re-issued).

In [[Sark]], where most motor traffic is prohibited, the few vehicles on the island{{ndash}} nearly all tractors{{ndash}} do not display plates. Bicycles display cardboard tax discs.

====Sea====
In the 1960s, names used for the cross-Channel ferries plying the mail route between the islands and [[Weymouth, Dorset]] were taken from the popular Latin names for the islands: &quot;Caesarea&quot; (Jersey), &quot;Sarnia&quot; (Guernsey) and &quot;Riduna&quot; (Alderney).

Today, the ferry route between the Channel Islands and the UK is operated by [[Condor Ferries]] from both St Helier, Jersey and St Peter Port, Guernsey using high speed catamarans fast craft to [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], and [[Poole]] in the UK. A regular passenger ferry service on the Commodore Clipper goes from both Channel Island ports to [[Portsmouth]] daily which carries both passengers and freight.

Ferry services to mainland Normandy are operated by Manche Îles Express, and a service between Jersey and [[Saint Malo]] is also operated by Compagnie Corsaire. Condor also operate a service to Saint Malo.

The Isle of Sark Shipping Company operates small ferries to Sark.

====Air====
There are three airports: [[Alderney Airport]], [[Guernsey Airport]] and [[Jersey Airport]].

[[Alderney]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] are connected by a service operated and competed on by [[Blue Islands]] and [[Aurigny]]. The latter use the [[Britten-Norman Trislander]] on the route while the former use [[Britten-Norman Islanders]] and [[BAe Jetstream 32]]s.

====Rail====
The [[Alderney Railway]] is the only operating railway in the Channel Islands.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Media===
The islands are connected to the radio and television system of the UK. They are part of [[BBC Channel Islands]], and have since 2000 had regular opt-outs from the main Spotlight programme: 15 minutes at 18.30 and a full late bulletin at 22.25. There are also two local BBC radio stations, [[BBC Radio Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]].

The islands have had their own [[ITV]] franchise, [[Channel Television]], since September 1962. The islands terminated their analogue terrestrial TV services in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/when_do_i_switch/channel_islands Digitaluk.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone===
{{main|Telecommunications in Jersey}}
Jersey always operated its own [[telephone]] services independently of the UK's national systems, but Guernsey did not establish its own telephone services until 1969. Both islands still form part of the [[UK telephone numbering plan]], but [[Ofcom]] in the UK does not have responsibility for telecommunications regulatory and licensing issues on the islands. (It is responsible for wireless telegraphy licensing throughout the islands, and by agreement, for broadcasting regulation in the two large islands only).

===Internet===
Alderney hosts the [[domain name registry]] for both Bailiwicks. The Channel Islands have their own country-code top-level-domains ([[ccTLD]]s) on the Internet, managed by [http://www.channelisles.net CHANNELISLES.NET]. The ccTLDs are [[.gg]] for the Bailiwick of Guernsey (including Alderney and Sark) and [[.je]] for the Bailiwick of Jersey. The country codes first appeared on the Internet in 1996 after [[Jon Postel]] agreed with [[Nigel Roberts]] of [[Island Networks]] to add four codes (GG,JE as well as IM and AC) to the IANA list of TLDs. The codes for the Channel Islands and for the Isle of Man were entered on to the official United Nations ISO-3166 list in 2006.

== Culture ==

[[File:Fête d'la Maïr Guernesy.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A sea festival&lt;!--regatta?--&gt; advertised using [[Guernésiais|Dgèrnésiais]].]]

Culturally, the [[Norman language]] predominated in the islands until the 19th century, when increasing influence from English-speaking settlers and easier transport links led to Anglicisation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Country'', Kelleher, Jersey 1994, ISBN 0-9518162-4-1&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main dialects/languages of Norman in the islands, [[Auregnais]] (Alderney, extinct in late 20th century), [[Guernésiais|Dgèrnésiais]] (Guernsey), [[Jèrriais]] (Jersey) and [[Sercquiais]] (Sark, an offshoot of Jèrriais).&lt;ref&gt;''La Grève de Lecq'', Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, 1988 ISBN 2905385138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]] spent many years in exile, first in Jersey and then in Guernsey, where he finished ''[[Les Misérables]]''. Guernsey is also the setting of Hugo's later novel, ''Les Travailleurs De La Mer'' (''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/trail-of-the-unexpected-victor-hugorsquos-guernsey-2016740.html &quot;Trail of the unexpected: Victor Hugo’s Guernsey&quot;], ''[[The Independent]]'', 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Guernsey-man&quot; also makes an appearance in chapter 91 of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Melville]], ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (St. Botoph Society edition, 1892) pp. 381-384.  [http://books.google.com/books?id=XV8XAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=guernsey#v=snippet&amp;q=guernsey&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual &quot;[[Muratti]]&quot;, the inter-island [[association football|football]] match, is considered the sporting event of the year—although, due to broadcast coverage, it no longer attracts the crowds of spectators, travelling between the islands, that occurred during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/05/08/passion-plays-a-part-%E2%80%93-right-across-the-board/ Thisisjersey.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cricket]] is a sport popular in the Channel Islands. The [[Jersey cricket team]] and the [[Guernsey cricket team]] are both Associate members of the [[International Cricket Council]]. Both teams have played each other in the [[Inter-insular match]], which has been played since 1957. In 2001 and 2002, the Channel Islands entered a team into the [[MCCA Knockout Trophy]], the one-day tournament of the [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/67/Minor_Counties_Trophy_Matches.html Minor Counties Trophy Matches played by Channel Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel Island sportsmen and women compete in the [[Commonwealth Games]] for their respective islands and the islands have also been enthusiastic supporters of the [[Island Games]]. Shooting is a popular sport, in which islanders have won Commonwealth medals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecgf.com/countries/tally_sports.asp Thecgf.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Guernsey's traditional colour for sporting and other purposes is [[green]] and Jersey's is [[red]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/colours/nonfifateams.html |title=Non-FIFA National Teams Colours |publisher=Rsssf.com |date=2006-11-28 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crapaud St Helier Jersey.jpg|thumb|This statue of a [[True toad|''crapaud'']] (toad) in St. Helier represents the traditional nickname for Jersey people.]]
The main islanders have traditional animal nicknames:&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire Jersiais-Français'', 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisguernsey.com/lifestyle/hanging-on-to-our-heritage/guernsey-donkeys/ Thisisjersey.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guernsey: ''les ânes'' (&quot;[[donkey]]s&quot; in French and Norman): the steepness of St. Peter Port streets required beasts of burden, but Guernsey people also claim it is a symbol of their strength of character{{ndash}} which Jersey people traditionally interpret as stubbornness.
* Jersey: ''les crapauds'' (&quot;[[toad]]s&quot; in French and Jèrriais): Jersey has toads and snakes that Guernsey lacks.
* Sark: ''les corbins'' (&quot;[[crow]]s&quot; in [[Sercquiais]], [[Dgèrnésiais]] and [[Jèrriais]], ''les corbeaux'' in French): crows could be seen from sea on the island's coast.
* Alderney: ''les lapins'' (&quot;[[rabbit]]s&quot; in French and [[Auregnais]]): the island is noted for its warrens.

[[Christianity]] was brought to the islands around the 6th century; according to tradition, Jersey was evangelised by Saint [[Helier]], Guernsey by Saint [[Samson of Dol]] and other smaller islands were occupied at various times by monastic communities representing strands of [[Celtic Christianity]]. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the islands turned [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] under the influence of an influx of French-language pamphlets published in [[Geneva]]. [[Anglicanism]] was imposed in the 17th century, but the Non-Conformist tendency re-emerged with a strong adoption of [[Methodism]]. The presence of long-term [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] communities from France and seasonal workers from Brittany and Normandy added to the mix of denominations among the population.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Other islands in the English Channel ==
There are other islands in other stretches of the English Channel that are not traditionally included within the grouping of Channel Islands. Among these are [[Ushant|Ouessant/Ushant]], [[Île-de-Bréhat|Bréhat]], [[Île de Batz]], [[Chausey]], [[Grande-Île, Normandy|Grande-Île]], [[Tatihou]] and [[Îles Saint-Marcouf]] (under French jurisdiction) and the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Isles of Scilly]] -- both integral parts of [[England]] and under British jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Comedy film''' is a genre of [[film]] in which the main emphasis is on [[humour]]. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (the [[black comedy]] being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies.  Comedy, unlike other [[film genre]]s, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former [[stand-up comic]] transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' and ''[[Man of the Year (2006 film)|Man of the Year]]'').

==Types==

A [[comedy of manners]] film satirises the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. The plot of the comedy is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]]. 

In a &quot;fish out of water&quot;-style comedy, the main character or character finds himself in an unusual environment, which drives most of the humor. Situations can be swapping gender roles, as in ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982); an age changing role, as in ''[[Big]]'' (1988); a freedom-loving individual fitting into a structured environment, as in ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984); a rural backwoodsman in the big city, as in ''[[&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee]]'', and so forth. The Coen Brothers are known for using this technique in all of their films, though not always to comedic effect. Some films including people fitting the &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; bill including ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' and ''[[A Serious Man]]''.

A [[Parody film|parody or spoof film]] is a comedy that satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Examples of this form include ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980), and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974).

The [[anarchic comedy film]] uses nonsensical, stream-of-consciousness humor which often lampoons a form of authority. Films of this nature stem from a theatrical history of anarchic comedy on the stage. Well-known films of this sub-genre include ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933) and ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978).

The [[black comedy]] film deals with normally [[taboo]] subjects, including, death, murder, sexual relations, suicide and war, in a satirical manner.  Examples include ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The Loved One]]'' (1965), ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983), ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' (1989), ''[[Heathers]]'' (1989), ''[[Your Friends &amp; Neighbors]]'' (1998), ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), and ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' (2008).

[[Gross-out film]]s are a relatively recent development, and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual or &quot;toilet&quot; humour. Examples include ''[[Porky's]]'' (1982), ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (1994), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999).

The [[romantic comedy]] sub-genre typically involves the development of a relationship between a man and a woman. The stereotyped plot line follows the &quot;boy-gets-girl&quot;, &quot;boy-loses-girl&quot;, &quot;boy gets girl back again&quot; sequence. Naturally there are innumerable variants to this plot, and much of the generally light-hearted comedy lies in the social interactions and sexual tensions between the pair. Examples of this style of film include ''[[It's a Wonderful World (1939 film)|It's a Wonderful World]]'' (1939), ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'' (1940), ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), and ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994).

It was not uncommon for the early romantic comedy film to also be a [[screwball comedy film]]. This form of comedy film was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films. Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty [[repartee]], some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and more recently ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972).

===Hybrid genres===
====Action comedy====
films blend comic antics and action where the film stars combine wit and one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as [[Eddie Murphy]] started taking more action oriented roles such as in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. These type of films are often [[buddy films]], with mismatched partners such as in ''[[Midnight Run]]'', ''[[Rush Hour (film)|Rush Hour]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]''. [[Slapstick]] [[martial arts films]] became a mainstay of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] through the work [[Jackie Chan]] among others.  It may also focus on [[superhero]]es such as [[The Incredibles]], [[Hancock (film)|Hancock]] or [[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]].

====Comedy horror====
Comedy horror is a type of horror film in which the usual dark themes are treated with a humorous approach. These films are either use goofy horror clichés such as in ''[[The Old Dark House]]'', ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[Haunted Mansion (film)|Haunted Mansion]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie]]'' where campy styles are favoured.  Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''. Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over the top violence and gore such as in ''[[Dead Alive]]'' (1992), ''[[Evil Dead]]'' (1981), and ''[[Club Dread]]'' - such films are sometimes known as ''splatstick'', a portmanteau of the words ''splatter'' and ''slapstick''.

====Fantasy comedy====
Fantasy comedy films are types of films that uses [[magic (fantasy)|magic]], [[supernatural]] and or mythological figures for comic purposes. Most fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning many of the fantasy conventions on their head such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool, the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' and ''[[Shrek]]''.

====Sci-fi comedy====
Sci-fi comedy films, like most hybrid genre of comedy use the elements of [[science fiction films]] to over the top extremes and exaggerated science fiction stereotypical characters. Popular examples of these types of films include ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Evolution (film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Innerspace]]'', ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', and ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]''.

====Military comedy====
Military comedy films, involve comic situations in a military setting. Examples of military comedy are ''[[The Secret War of Harry Frigg]]'', ''[[What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[Up the Academy]]'', ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', ''[[Private Benjamin]]'', ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'', ''[[The Private War of Major Benson]]'', and the boisterous ''[[What Price Glory? (1926 film)|Flagg and Quirt]]'' movies.

==History==
===1895&amp;ndash;1930===
Comic films began to appear in significant numbers during the era of silent films, roughly 1895 to 1930. The visual humor of many of these silent films relied on slapstick and [[burlesque]]. A very early comedy short was ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé|Watering the Gardener]]'' (1895) by the [[Lumière brothers]]. In American film, the most prominent comic actors of the silent era were [[Charlie Chaplin]] (although born in England, his success was principally in the U.S.), [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]]. In his native France and throughout the world, [[Max Linder]] was a major comic feature and might qualify as the first true film star.

A popular trend during the 1920s and afterward was comedy in the form of animated cartoons. Several popular characters of the period received the cartoon treatment. Among these were [[Felix the Cat]], [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], and [[Betty Boop]].

===1930&amp;ndash;1950s===
Toward the end of the 1920s, the introduction of sound into movies made possible dramatic new film styles and the use of verbal humor. During the 1930s, the silent film comedy was replaced by dialogue from film comedians such as the [[W. C. Fields]] and the [[Marx Brothers]]. [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], who had made a number of very popular short silent films, used the arrival of sound to deepen their well-formed screen characterizations and enhance their visual humour, and went on to great success in talking films. The comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] was one of the last silent film hold-outs, and his films during the 1930s were devoid of dialogue, although they did employ sound effects.

Screwball comedies, such as produced by [[Frank Capra]], exhibited a pleasing, idealized climate that portrayed reassuring social values and a certain optimism about everyday life. Movies still included slapstick humor and other physical comedy, but these were now frequently supplemental to the verbal interaction. Another common comic production from the 1930s was the short subject. [[Hal Roach]] Studio specialized in this form. While [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] was prolific, producing 190 [[Three Stooges]] releases, alone. These non-feature productions only went into decline in the 1950s when they were migrated to the television.

In the [[United Kingdom]], film adaptations of stage [[farce]]s were popular in the early 1930s, while the [[music hall]] tradition strongly influenced film comedy into the 1940s with [[Will Hay]] and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]] among the top comedy stars of the time. In England in the late 1940s, [[Ealing Studios]] achieved popular success as well as critical acclaim with a series of films known collectively as the &quot;Ealing comedies&quot;, from 1947 to 1957. They usually included a degree of social comment, and featured ensemble casts which often included [[Alec Guinness]] or [[Stanley Holloway]]. Among the most famous examples were ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955).

With the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], [[Hollywood]] became focused on themes related to the conflict. Comedies portrayed military themes such as service, civil defense, boot-camp and shore-leave. The war-time restrictions on travel made this a boom time for Hollywood, and nearly a quarter of the money spent on attending movies.

The post-war period was an age of reflection on the war, and the emergence of a competing medium, the television. In 1948, television began to acquire commercial momentum and by the following year there were nearly a hundred television transmitters in American cities.

By the 1950s, the television industry had become a serious competition for the movie industry. Despite the technological limitations of the TV medium at the time, more and more people chose to stay home to watch the television. The Hollywood studios at first viewed the television as a threat, and later as a commercial market. Several comic forms that had previously been a staple of movie theaters transitioned to the television. Both the short subject and the cartoon now appeared on the television rather than in the theater, and the &quot;B&quot; movie also found its outlet on the television.

As television became filled with family-oriented comedies, the 1950s saw a trend toward more adult social situations. Only the [[Walt Disney]] studios continued to steadily release family comedies. The release of comedy films also went into a decline during this decade. In 1947 almost one in five films had been comic in nature, but by 1954 this was down to ten percent.

The 1950s saw the decline of past comedy stars and a certain paucity of new talent in Hollywood. Among the few popular new stars during this period were [[Judy Holliday]] and the comedy team phenom of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]]. Lewis followed the legacy of such comedians as Keaton and Harold Lloyd, but his work was not well-received by critics in the United States (in contrast to [[France]] where he proved highly popular.)

The [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film industry]] produced a number of highly successful film series, however, including the [[Doctor in the House|Doctor series]], the [[St. Trinian's]] films and the increasingly bawdy ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' films. [[John and Roy Boulting]] also wrote and directed a series of successful [[satire]]s, including ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956) and ''[[I'm All Right, Jack]]'' (1959). As in the United States, in the next decade much of this talent would move into television.

A number of French comedians were also able to find an [[English language|English speaking]] audience in the 1950s, including [[Fernandel]] and [[Jacques Tati]].

===1960s&amp;ndash;1980s===
The next decade saw an increasing number of broad, star-packed comedies including ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), ''[[Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965). By the middle of the decade, some of the 1950s generation of American comedians, such as [[Jerry Lewis]], went into decline, while [[Peter Sellers]] found success with international audiences in his first American film ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]''. The bumbling [[Inspector Clouseau]] was a character Sellers would continue to return to over the next decade.

Toward the end of the 1950s, darker humor and more serious themes had begun to emerge, including satire and social commentary. ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) was a satirical comedy about [[Cold War]] paranoia, while ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967) featured sexual themes in a way that would have been impossible only a few years previously.

In 1970, the [[black comedy|black comedies]] ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch 22]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' reflected the anti-war sentiment then prevalent, as well as treating the sensitive topic of suicide. ''M*A*S*H'' would be toned down and brought to television in the following decade as a long-running series. 

Among the leading lights in comedy films of the next decade were [[Woody Allen]] and [[Mel Brooks]]. Both wrote, directed and appeared in their movies. Brooks' style was generally slapstick and zany in nature, often parodying film styles and [[genre]]s, including [[Universal Horror|Universal horror films]] (''[[Young Frankenstein]]''), [[western (genre)|westerns]] (''[[Blazing Saddles]]'') and [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] films (''[[High Anxiety]]''). Following his success on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and on film with ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'' [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]] Neil Simon would also be prominent in the 1970s, with films like ''[[The Sunshine Boys (film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' and ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]''. Other notable film comedians who appeared later in the decade were [[Richard Pryor]], [[Steve Martin]] and [[Burt Reynolds]].

Most [[British comedy]] films of the early 1970s were spin-offs of [[television series]], including ''[[Dad's Army]]'' and ''[[On the Buses]]''. The greatest successes, however, came with the films of the [[Monty Python]] team, including ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'' (1971), ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' in 1979.

In 1980, the gag-based comedy ''[[Airplane!]]'', a [[Parody|spoof]] of the previous decade's disaster film series was released and paved the way for more of the same including ''[[Top Secret!]]'' (1984) and the ''[[Naked Gun]]'' films. Popular comedy stars in the 1980s included [[Dudley Moore]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Many had come to prominence on the American TV series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', including [[Bill Murray]], [[Steve Martin]] and [[Chevy Chase]]. Eddie Murphy made a success of comedy-[[action film]]s including ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982) and the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' series (1984&amp;ndash;1993).

Also popular were the films of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] such as ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. He would later become best-known for the ''[[Home Alone]]'' series of the early 1990s. The latter film helped a revival in comedies aimed at a family audience, along with ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' and its sequels.

===1990s–2010s===
One of the major developments of the 1990s was the re-emergence of the [[romantic comedy film]], encouraged by the success of ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' in 1989. Other examples included ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' (1995) and ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' (1998) from the [[United States of America|United States]], and ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994), ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' (1998) and ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' (1999) from the [[United Kingdom]]. Spoofs remained popular as well, especially with the ''[[Scary Movie]]'' series and ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'' series.

Probably more representative of [[British humour]] were the working class comedies ''[[Brassed Off]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Full Monty]]'' (1997). Other [[British comedy|British comedies]] examined the role of the [[Asian people|Asian]] community in British life, including ''[[Bhaji on the Beach]]'' (1993), ''[[East Is East (film)|East Is East]]'' (1999), ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' (2002) and ''[[Anita and Me]]'' (2003).

Also there were &quot;stoner&quot; comedies, which usually involve two guys on an adventure with random things happening to them along the way. Big movies of this sub-genre would be ''[[Dude, Where's My Car]]'', ''[[Big Nothing]]'', ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''. These movies usually have drug-related jokes and crude content.

Another development was the increasing use of &quot;[[gross-out humor]]&quot; usually aimed at a younger audience, in films like ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' and its sequels, and ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]''. In mid 2000s, the trend of &quot;gross-out&quot; movies is continuing, with adult-oriented comedies picking up the box office. But serious black comedies (also known as dramatic comedies or [[dramedy|dramedies]]) were performing also well, such as ''[[The Weather Man]]'', ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' and ''[[Shopgirl]]''. In late 2006, ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'' blended vulgar humor with cultural satire.

A '''cult film''' (also known as a '''cult movie/picture''' or a '''cult classic''') is a [[film]] that has acquired a highly devoted but specific group of [[Fan (person)|fans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmovie.com/glossary/term/cult+film%2C+movie All Movie Guide glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, cult movies have failed to achieve fame outside the small fanbases; however, there have been exceptions that have managed to gain fame among mainstream audiences. Many cult movies have gone on to transcend their original cult status and have become recognized as classics; others are of the &quot;so bad it's good&quot; variety and are destined to remain in obscurity. Cult films often become the source of a thriving, obsessive, and elaborate [[subculture]] of [[fandom]], hence the analogy to [[cult]]s. However, not every film with a devoted fanbase is necessarily a cult film. Usually, cult films have limited but very special, noted appeal. Cult films are often known to be eccentric, often do not follow traditional standards of mainstream cinema and usually explore topics not considered in any way [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]]—yet there are examples that are relatively normal. Many are often considered controversial because they step outside standard narrative and technical conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Cult films at [http://www.filmsite.org/cultfilms.html Film site]; accessed October 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A cult film is a movie that attracts a devoted group of followers or obsessive fans, despite having failed commercially on its initial release. The term also describes films that have remained popular over a long period of time amongst a small group of followers. In many cases, cult films may have failed to achieve mainstream success on original release although this is definitely not always the case. Whilst they may only have a short cinema release cult films often enjoy ongoing popularity due to myriad [[VHS]], [[LaserDisc]] and [[DVD]] releases. In some cases, these films tend to enjoy long runs on [[home video|video]], thus being issued in video &quot;runs&quot; with more copies than other movies. The movie ''[[Office Space]]'' (1999), which lost money during its box office run, managed to turn significant profits when [[word-of-mouth]] made it a popular video rental and purchase. ''[[Harold and Maude]]'' (1971) was not successful financially at the time of its original release, but has since earned a [[cult following]] and has become successful following its video and DVD releases. This has also happened with ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), among others. Many cult films were [[independent film]]s and were not expected by their creators to have mainstream success. ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' (1962), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), ''[[Basket Case (film)|Basket Case]]'' (1982), ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981) and [[Evil Dead (series)|its sequels]], and ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' (2004) could all be considered cult films.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Sometimes the audience response to a cult film is somewhat different than what was intended by the film makers. Cult films usually offer something different or innovative in comparison to mainstream films, but cult films can also be popular across a wide audience.

A film can be both a major studio release and a cult film, particularly if despite its affiliation with a major studio, it failed to achieve broad success on either the theatrical or home video markets but was championed by a small number of dedicated film fanatics who seek out lesser-known offerings. It is also true that the content of certain films (such as dark subjects, alienation, [[Cinema of Transgression|transgressive]] content, or other [[controversial]] subject matter) can also decide whether or not a film is a &quot;cult film&quot;, regardless of the film's budget or studio affiliations. An example may be [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s big budgeted, highly sexualized ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), initially intended to be a drama film about the rise of a [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] stripper, that flopped both critically and commercially when released theatrically; afterward, it enjoyed success on the [[home video]] market, generating more than $100 million from video rentals.&lt;ref&gt;Wiser, Paige. &quot;The beauty of 'Showgirls'&quot;, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', July 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is a favorite of [[gay culture|gay audiences]] and audiences in general have considered it to be a [[comedy]] thanks to frequent [[midnight movie]] showings. According to activist writer [[Naomi Klein]], [[irony|ironic]] enjoyment of the film initially arose among those with the video before [[MGM]], the film's chief marketer, capitalized on the idea. MGM noticed the video was performing all right, since &quot;trendy twenty-somethings were throwing ''Showgirls'' irony parties, laughing sardonically at the implausibly poor screenplay and shrieking with horror at the aerobic sexual encounters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Klein]], ''[[No Logo]]'', Vintage Canada Edition, 2000, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1959 to 1970s===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Rocky Horror 2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Dr. Frank-N-Furter ([[Tim Curry]]) self proclaimed &quot;Sweet Transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania&quot; in ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975).]] --&gt;
''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959) and other films by [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] were considered cult classics,{{By whom|date=September 2010}} attracting devotees who reveled in his incompetence. Other low-budget science fiction and horror films of the 1950s (for example ''[[Robot Monster]]''), along with [[exploitation film]]s of the 1930s, which resurfaced in the [[home video]] market of the 1980s (including the infamous ''[[Reefer Madness (1936 film)|Reefer Madness]]''), were accorded that status.

The low budget horror film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) directed by [[George A. Romero]] earned moderate box office takings but was critically polarized at the time. However, the culture of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam-era]] United States had a tremendous impact on the film and the film was given a cult status after playing frequently at [[midnight movie]] circuits. It is so thoroughly laden with critiques of late-1960s American society that one historian described the film as &quot;[[subversive]] on many levels.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockoff&quot;&gt;Adam Rockoff, ''Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978–1986'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2002), p. 35, ISBN 0-7864-1227-5.&lt;/ref&gt; While not the first [[Zombies in literature and fiction#In film|zombie film]] made, ''Night of the Living Dead'' influenced countless films and is perhaps the defining influence on [[Zombies in popular culture|the modern pop-culture zombie archetype]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Zombie Movies&quot; in ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', ed. John Clute and John Grant (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 1048, ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt; The film is the first of six ''[[Living Dead|Dead]]'' films (completed or pending) directed by Romero.

[[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), was wildly controversial (being an exercise in &quot;poor taste&quot;) featuring [[incest]] and [[coprophagia]], became the best known of a group of campy midnight films focusing on sexual perversions and [[fetishism]].&lt;ref&gt;Waters (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed on weekends in Waters's hometown of Baltimore, with a mile-long extension cord as a power conduit, it was also crucial in inspiring the growth of the [[independent film]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finelinefeatures.com/pink/prodnote.htm Pink Flamingos Production Notes]. Retrieved 11/15/06.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the Elgin Theater started midnight screenings of both ''Pink Flamingos'' and a crime drama from Jamaica with a remarkable soundtrack. In its mainstream release, ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' (1972) had been a flop, panned by critics after its U.S. distributor, [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]], marketed it as a [[blaxploitation]] picture. Re-released as a midnight film, it screened around the country for six years, helping spur the popularity of [[reggae]] in the United States. While the midnight-movie potential of certain films was recognized only some time after they opened, a number during this period were distributed to take advantage of the market from the beginning—in 1973, for instance, ''Broken Goddess'', ''Dragula'', ''The White Whore and the Bit Player'', and ''Elevator Girls in Bondage'' (as well as ''Pink Flamingos'') had their New York premieres at midnight screenings.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, midnight opener ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'' evidenced how the phenomenon lent itself to flirtations with [[pornography]].

''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' satirizes conventions of [[science fiction]] and [[horror film|horror]] films, and includes elements of [[transvestism]], [[incest]] and [[homosexuality]] — all within the context of a [[musical film]]. The film received little critical attention or mainstream cinema exhibition when first released in 1975, but built up a base of fans who repeatedly showed up at midnight screenings at inexpensive neighborhood cinemas, dressed in costume and &quot;participating&quot; in the film by doing such things as throwing rice during its wedding scene.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/howapbegan.php History of the Rocky Horror Picture Show] and [http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/timeline.php Rocky Horror Timeline]. Retrieved 11/14/06.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the film intentionally ridiculed its own subject matter, thereby entering into the spirit of sarcastic fun often surrounding the attainment of cult status. Much of the attention has stemmed from the fanbase, rather than the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | author= Henkin, Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | pages = 36 | isbn=978-0801564369}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Network television]], [[cable television]] and [[pay-per-view]] stations have also changed the nature of cult films. David Lynch's experimental ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), an example of shoe-string surrealism was a flop both critically and commercially, yet was saved from obscurity thanks to home video in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Comedy films have also been cult classics. In 1979, [[Steven Spielberg]], after two blockbuster hits (''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''), decided to try the comedy genre with ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', set days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The film, spoofing popular film genres of the 1940s (and [[World War II]] in general), is considered by critics as Spielberg's first flop, although it made a small profit for [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Universal Studios]] compared to Spielberg's earlier (and later) blockbuster hits. Whatever the case, it gained a cult following after it aired in an extended version on the U.S. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, and years after on [[Laserdisc]] and [[DVD]].

Other cult films from this period are those of director and actor [[Tom Laughlin]], including the ''[[Billy Jack]]'' series.

=== 1980s to present ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nowirehangers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&quot;No wire hangers, EVER!&quot;: Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford in the autobiographical ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), based on the life of Crawford.]] --&gt;
The commercial viability of the sort of big-city arthouses that launched outsider pictures for the midnight movie circuit began to decline in the late 1970s as broad social and economic shifts weakened their countercultural base. Leading midnight movie venues were beginning to fold as early as 1977 — that year, New York's Bijou switched back permanently to the live entertainment for which it had been built, and the Elgin, after a brief run with gay porn, shut down completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinematreasures.org/theater/2932/ Bijou Theatre]; [http://cinematreasures.org/theater/6353/ Elgin Theatre]. Retrieved 11/15/06.&lt;/ref&gt; In succeeding years, the popularization of the [[VCR]] and the expansion of movie-viewing possibilities on cable television meant the death of many additional independent theaters, which as a result, developed a stream of newer cult films. Possibly the first of these was the biographical ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), which details the life of [[Joan Crawford]] and her alleged abusive relationship with her adopted daughter. The over-acting by [[Faye Dunaway]] as Crawford gave the film a campy tone, and critics were very negative towards the film. While Dunaway garnered some critical acclaim for her astonishing physical metamorphosis and her portrayal of Crawford (finishing a narrow second in the voting for the New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best Actress of the Year), she also received a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Award]] for [[1981 Golden Raspberry Awards|Worst Actress]] and caused considerable damage to her career. It did manage to develop a cult classic status, especially with gay audiences and became famous for Dunaway's emphasis on the line &quot;No wire hangers, ever!&quot;, when urging her daughter not to use them in her closet.

While ''Rocky Horror'' soldiered on, by then a phenomenon unto itself, and new films like ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' (1979), ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'' (1980), ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[Pink Floyd The Wall (film)|Pink Floyd The Wall]]'' (1982)&amp;mdash;all from mainstream distributors&amp;mdash;were picked up by the midnight movie circuit, the core of exhibitors that energized the movement was disappearing. [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) was financially unsuccessful upon its initial release. The film was, however, re-released in 1992 and achieved cult status. It has since become a leading example of the [[science fiction]] genre.

In 1984, ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'', starring [[Peter Weller]] as [[Buckaroo Banzai (character)|Buckaroo Banzai]], whose latest experiment opens the door to the 8th dimension and unwittingly starts an interstellar battle for the world. Directed by [[W.D. Richter]] the film has since received cult status. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Buckaroo Banzai'' as #43 in their Top 50 Cult Movies.&lt;ref name= &quot;cultmovies&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title = EW's Top Cult Movies | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher =  | date = May 23, 2003 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,452193_7,00.html | accessdate = 2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1984, [[Dino DeLaurentiis]] released ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', based on [[Frank Herbert]]'s best-selling sci-fi novel. Directed by [[David Lynch]], the film was a big-budget flop, partially because the movie had already been edited from an intended three-to-four hours to 137 minutes, leaving the story incomprehensible. Knowing that a great deal of footage had been deleted, [[Universal Studios]] took it upon themselves to release a longer version for syndicated television and thereby, return some of the cohesiveness to the story. Thus, ''Dune'' became a cult classic, albeit too late, as David Lynch had removed his name from the credits of the television cut. Both major versions have been successful thanks to a recent DVD release.

1985 saw the making of two [[Arnon Milchan]] films that were, like ''Dune'' before it, substantially altered by Universal Studios in an attempt to find a mainstream audience. [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), a [[dystopian]] science fiction film about a man's relationship with the woman of his dreams became a huge failure (largely because of the difficulties involved in marketing the film), yet was critically acclaimed and subsequently revitalized by video releases. Then, by the time ''[[Legend (film)|Legend]]'', directed by Ridley Scott, opened in European theatres, it had already been edited by 20 minutes by Universal. Having failed at the U.K. box office, it was further edited by five minutes for U.S. release a year later and [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s original orchestral score replaced by a rock score by [[Tangerine Dream]]. Interest in the missing footage and score helped to build the film's cult status, which paid off when in 2002, DVD audiences finally saw ''Legend'' in a version closer to director Scott's intent.

A year later, [[David Lynch]]'s highly influential [[neo-noir]] thriller ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), having initially failed at the box office (because of its limited release in theatres), was revitalized with video releases in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The film became hugely controversial and well-known because of its bizarre, often graphic depiction of small town America and male-female relationships featuring a psychotic [[Dennis Hopper]] and his drug-fueled sexual relationship with Dorothy Vallens, played by [[Isabella Rossellini]]. Lynch continued his career with various other cult films: ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990), ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) and the critically acclaimed ''[[Mulholland Dr. (film)|Mulholland Dr.]]'' (2001) as well as his short lived cult phenomenon television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (90-91), and its subsequent movie adaptation: ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992). Another cult item is the [[Jim Jarmusch]] film from 1989 ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'', which includes [[Joe Strummer]] and [[Tom Waits]].

[[Alan Parker]]'s hybrid [[Mystery film|mystery]]/[[horror film]], ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), starring [[Mickey Rourke]] and [[Robert De Niro]], fared poorly at the box office, only just breaking even.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092563/business Angel Heart (1987) - Box office / business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the film became a hit once released on VHS, and has become a cult classic since, known for its spooky tone, [[Michael Seresin]]'s cinematography, the sad and spooky score by [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]], and an unusual but effective blend of genres. Two of the movie's producers, [[Andrew G. Vajna]] and [[Mario Kassar]], also produced the cult film ''[[Jacob's Ladder (film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'' which had a similar narrative structure, as well as a [[twist]] ending.

[[Michael Lehmann]]'s satirical teenage comedy ''[[Heathers]]'' (1989), starring [[Winona Ryder]] and [[Christian Slater]], was intended to take on the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] teenage films (''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'') and give them a much darker, realistic and comedic approach. However, the film was a failure at the box office (mainly because of its limited release). Despite this, it was hugely popular on VHS in the early 1990s and launched cutting-edge dialogue spoken by its characters ('What's your damage?', 'I love my dead, gay son!') into mainstream popular culture. In 1993, the comedy horror ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', a sequel to the ''[[Evil Dead series]]'', was released. The movie had a considerably higher budget than the prior two ''Evil Dead'' films. The budget was estimated to be around $11 million; while ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' had a budget of $3.5 million and ''The Evil Dead'' a budget of $350,000. At the box office, ''Army of Darkness'' was not a big success as hoped, only grossing $11,501,093 domestically. After its video release, however, it has obtained an ever-growing cult following, along with the other two films in the trilogy.

One of the most successful of the 1990s generation of cult films was the Australian drag queen road saga ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). One of the theaters to show it regularly at midnight was New York's Waverly (also now closed), where ''Rocky Horror'' had played for a house record ninety-five weeks. Writer/director [[Todd Solondz]], a favorite cult director, had his first major success with the black comedy ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' (1995), a brutally-honest look at the persecution of a young junior high student by her classmates. His next film was the challenging, controversial dark comedy of sex and perversion in American suburbia—titled ''[[Happiness (1998 film)|Happiness]]'' (1998). ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998) was a flop on its initial release, yet became a cult classic and has been called &quot;the first cult film of the Internet era.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;russell&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Since the turn of the millennium, notable successes among cult and midnight movies have been ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001), the 2001 comedy ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', an absurdist parody of the pre-MTV summer camp genre, and the comic book adaptation ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]''.

In the 1990s, [[Adam Sandler]] films received many cult followers mainly ''[[Billy Madison]]'', ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'', ''[[The Waterboy]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'', and ''[[Big Daddy (film)|Big Daddy]]''. In 1999, Sandler founded [[Happy Madison]] productions and produced many films that all mainly received cult followers. 

Older films are also popular on the circuit, appreciated largely in an imposed [[camp (style)|camp]] fashion—a midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1938).&lt;ref&gt;See Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), pp. 261–262. For their consideration of ''Freaks'' as part of the early midnight movie phenomenon, see pp. 3, 95, 99, 295–297.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tod Browning]]'s 1932 horror classic ''[[Freaks]]'', the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which ''Reefer Madness'' was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the paradoxical element of [[nostalgia]]: the leading revivals currently on the circuit ironically include clearly non-cult films like [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] oeuvre&amp;mdash;''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' (1985), ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' (1986), and ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986), which were major studio productions and popular and financially successful during their original releases, and the teen adventure film ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;Beale (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult films within a particular culture==
Occasionally, a film can become the object of a cult following within a particular region or culture if it has some unusual significance to that region or culture. An example is the cult status of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy|comedic]] [[actor]] [[Norman Wisdom]]'s films in [[Albania]]. Wisdom's films, in which he usually played a family man worker who outsmarts his boss, were some of the few Western films considered acceptable by the country's [[communist]] rulers, thus Albanians grew familiar and attached to Wisdom. Curiously, he and his films are now acquiring nostalgic cult status in Britain. Another example is the place of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) in [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|American gay culture]], although a widely viewed and historically important film in greater American culture. Gay men sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;[[friend of Dorothy|friends of Dorothy]]&quot;. ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'' is another film adopted by American gay culture which used to regularly be shown during the 1980s and early 1990s for extended runs. ''[[Slaves of New York]]'', released in 1989, has also found a cult audience in the gay community.

In the world of [[anime]], the MTV spoof series ''[[Ultracity 6060]]'' created by ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' animator [[Mike deSeve]] has become a hard-to-acquire cult classic among American anime fans. DeSeve's gory send-up ''[[When Animated Animals Attack]]'' is also a cult hit among animation festival fans in North America, as are the works of [[Don Hertzfeldt]] (Billy's Balloon, [[Rejected]], The Meaning of Life) and [[Robert Smigel]].

The 1938 anti-[[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[propaganda]] film ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' has become a cult film within the stoner subculture due to its humorously sensationalized, outdated and inaccurate descriptions of the effects of marijuana. [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Legend Films]] released a [[colorized]] version of the film on [[DVD]] on April 20, 2004, a reference to its ironic appeal (see [[420 (cannabis culture)]]).{{Or|date=September 2010}} The [[World War II]]-era [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] film ''[[Hemp for Victory]],'' encouraging the growing of [[hemp]] for war uses, has achieved a similar cult status. Entry-level IT workers and white-collar American workers alike have given [[Mike Judge]]'s 1999 comedy film ''[[Office Space]]'' a cult following because of its heroic portrayal of ordinary office employees who become fed up with their jobs, make a stand, and try to overthrow the very corporation for which they work. [[Belgium|Belgian]] cult movie ''[[Man Bites Dog (film)|Man Bites Dog]]'' with [[Benoit Poelvoorde]] and the [[surrealist]] movie ''[[Camping Cosmos]]'' starring cult figures like [[Lolo Ferrari]], [[Noël Godin]] and [[Arno Hintjens]], are an element of the Belgian visual landscape with reminiscences to Belgian [[Surrealism]].

==International cult cinema==
Asian cinema, particularly Hong Kong martial arts films, such as [[wuxia]], and Japanese [[tokusatsu]], primarily from the [[kaiju|Daikaiju Eiga]], and [[anime]], also has a cult following in the Western hemisphere.  The [[Kaiju]] genre of films, most famously the [[Godzilla]] films, while enjoying much mainstream popularity in Japan, has a large cult following in the U.S.. ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' has gained cult status in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] due to the resonance the film has with the disaffected youth of that country. The action film ''[[Red Heat]]'' (1988) has found a cult audience amongst fluent Russian speakers because of the movie's weak portrayal of the Russian language and stereotypes.

==So-bad-they're-good cult films and camp classics==
{{See also|Mystery Science Theater 3000}}
Many films enjoy cult status because they are seen as ridiculously awful, for example ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1958) or ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'' (2003). The critic [[Michael Medved]] characterized examples of the &quot;so bad it's good&quot; class of low-budget cult film through books such as ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]''. These films include such financially fruitless and critically scorned films as ''[[The Lonely Lady]]'', ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'', ''[[Cool as Ice]]'', ''[[Boxing Helena]]'', ''[[Manos: The Hands of Fate]]'', ''[[Fatal Deviation]]'', ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2]]'', and ''[[Troll 2]]'', which have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs. Movies have even achieved cult status by successfully imitating the awfulnesses of so-bad-it's-good movies (''[[The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra]]'' and ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' being just two examples.)

In other cases, little-known or forgotten films from the past are revived as cult films, largely because they are considered goofy and senseless by modern standards, with laughable special effects and corny plotlines. These include ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'', ''[[Breakin']]'', ''[[The Beastmaster (film)|The Beastmaster]]'', ''[[Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]]'', ''[[The Creeping Terror]]'', ''[[Robot Monster]]'', ''[[The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies]]'', ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'', ''[[The Man Who Saves the World]]'' and the works of [[Edward D. Wood, Jr]]. ''The Beastmaster'' is an example of the strange vectors which can lead to cult filmdom, as its reputation stems as much from ubiquitous cable-TV overplay as anything in the film itself.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

These films should not be confused with comedic cult movies like ''[[The Toxic Avenger]]'', ''[[Bad Taste]]'', ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and the films of [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], which purposely utilize elements from films &quot;so bad they're good&quot; for comedic effect. This can be seen as related to the artistic style known as &quot;[[camp (style)|camp]]&quot;.

'''Constantinople''' ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντινούπολις}}, {{lang-la|Constantinopolis}}, Ottoman Turkish: قسطنطینیه, [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''[[İstanbul]]'') was the [[empire|imperial]] [[capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine/Eastern Roman Empire]], the [[Latin Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Throughout most of the [[Middle Ages]], Constantinople was Europe's largest&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, Norman John Greville. ''An Historical Geography of Europe, 1500-1840'', p. 124. CUP Archive, 1979. ISBN 0521223792.&lt;/ref&gt; and wealthiest city.

Since at least the tenth century, the city was commonly referred to as Istanbul which derives from the Greek Istimbolin, meaning &quot;in the city&quot; or &quot;to the city&quot;. After the Ottoman conquest of 1453, the official name of Constantinople was retained in official documents and coinage. It was not until the creation of the Republic of Turkey did the Turkish government formally object to the name, and asked that others use the more common name for the city.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Burham, ''The Dictionary of Misinformation'', Ballantine, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1023189.stm BBC - Timeline: Turkey].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian, (1993), ''Place Name changes 1900-1991'', Metuchen, N.J., &amp; London:The Scarecrow Press, Inc., ISBN 0-8108-2600-3 pp. 46, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; This took place through the Turkish Postal Service Law, as part of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk's]] national reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/istanbul.htm Lexicorient, Istanbul].&lt;/ref&gt; This name in turn derives from the Greek and Slavic colloquial name ''Stambol''; see [[Names of Istanbul]] for fuller discussion.

==History==
===Byzantium===
{{Main|Byzantium}}
Constantinople was founded by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine I]] on the site of an already-existing city, [[Byzantium]], settled in the early days of [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|Greek colonial expansion]], probably around 671-662 BC. The site lay astride the land route from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]] and the [[Turkish Straits|seaway]] from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]], and had in the [[Golden Horn]] an excellent and spacious harbour.

===306–337===
[[Image:Byzantinischer Mosaizist um 1000 002.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor [[Constantine I]] presents a representation of the city of Constantinople as tribute to an enthroned Mary and Christ Child in this church mosaic. [[Hagia Sophia|St Sophia]], c. 1000]]
[[Image:Constantinopolis coin.jpg|thumb|[[Coin]] struck by Constantine I to commemorate the founding of Constantinople]]
Constantine had altogether more colorful plans. Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in course of major governmental reforms as well as of [[Constantine I and Christianity|sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church]], he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the Imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, he identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the [[Danube]] or the [[Euphrates]] frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.

Constantinople was built over six years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (see, e.g., Michael Grant, ''The climax of Rome'' (London 1968), p. 133), or &quot;Constantine's City&quot;. According to the ''Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum'', vol. 164 (Stuttgart 2005), column 442, there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city &quot;New Rome&quot; (''Nova Roma''). It is possible that the emperor called the city &quot;Second Rome&quot; ({{lang-el|Δευτέρα Ῥώμη}}, ''Deutéra Rhōmē'') by official decree, as reported by the 5th-century church historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]]: See [[Names of Constantinople]].&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;A description can be found in the [[Notitia urbis Constantinopolitanae]].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, at first, Constantine's new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a [[proconsul]], rather than an [[urban prefect]]. It had no [[praetors]], [[tribunes]], or [[quaestors]]. Although it did have senators, they held the title ''clarus'', not ''[[clarissimus]]'', like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: Columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the Empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The Emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the Imperial estates in [[Diocese of Asia|Asiana]] and [[Diocese of Pontus|Pontica]], and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates II.13, cited by J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the [[Augustaion|Augustaeum]]. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] of the emperor with its imposing entrance, the [[Chalke]], and its ceremonial suite known as the [[Daphne Palace|Palace of Daphne]]. Nearby was the vast [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the [[Milion]], a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.

From the Augustaeum led a great street, the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]] (Greek: Μέση [Οδός] lit. &quot;Middle [Street]&quot;), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the [[Praetorium]] or law-court. Then it passed through the oval [[Forum of Constantine]] where there was a second Senate-house and a [[Column of Constantine|high column]] with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of [[Helios]], crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there the Mese passed on and through the Forum of Taurus and then the Forum of Bous, and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the [[Constantine's wall|Constantinian Wall]]. After the construction of the [[Theodosian Walls]] in the early 5th century, it would be extended to the new [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], reaching a total length of seven [[Roman mile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 75. ''et seqq''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Theodosius colum, Istanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Theodosius I]] was the last [[Roman emperor]] who ruled over an undivided empire (detail from the Obelisk at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]]]

The first known [[Urban prefect|Prefect]] of the City of Constantinople was [[Honoratus (Urban prefect)|Honoratus]], who took office on 11 December 359 and held it until 361. The emperor [[Valens]] built the Palace of [[Hebdomon]] on the shore of the [[Sea of Marmara|Propontis]] near the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and [[Basiliscus]] were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. [[Theodosius I]] founded the [[Studion|Church of John the Baptist]] to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the [[Topkapı Palace]] in Istanbul, Turkey), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of [[Aphrodite]] into a coach house for the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian Prefect]]; [[Arcadius]] built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.

The importance of Constantinople gradually increased. After the shock of the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, in which the emperor [[Valens]] with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the [[Visigoths]] within a few days' march, the city looked to its defenses, and [[Theodosius II]] built in 413–414 the 18-meter (60-foot)-tall [[Walls of Constantinople|triple-wall fortifications]], which were never to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a [[University of Constantinople|University]] near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.

[[Uldin]], a prince of the [[Huns]], appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city, and the fleet on the Danube improved.

In due course, the [[barbarian]]s overran the Western Roman Empire: Its emperors retreated to [[Ravenna]], and it diminished to nothing. Thereafter, Constantinople became in truth the largest city of the Roman Empire and of the world. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City, and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople.

The emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works. It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure the ship of the commander [[Belisarius]] anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the [[Herod's Temple|Temple treasure of Jerusalem]], looted by the Romans in [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|70 AD]] and taken to [[Carthage]] by the [[Vandals]] after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the [[Church of St. Polyeuctus]], before being returned to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] in either the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Church of the Resurrection]] or the New Church.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Barker, Times Literary Supplement 4 May 2007 p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.

Throughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the [[Christian orthodoxy|orthodox]] and the [[monophysites]] became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said&lt;ref&gt;Procopius' '' Secret History'': see P Neville-Ure, Justinian and his Age, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the [[Nika riots|&quot;Nika&quot; riots]] (from the battle-cry of &quot;Victory!&quot; of those involved).

Fires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine's basilica of St Sophia, the city's principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]] to replace it with a new and incomparable [[Hagia Sophia|St Sophia]]. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.&lt;ref&gt;St Sophia was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of the city, and is now a museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, &quot;O [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon]], I have outdone thee!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Source for quote: ''Scriptores originum Constantinopolitanarum'', ed T Preger I 105 (see [[A. A. Vasiliev]], ''History of the Byzantine Empire'', 1952, vol I p. 188).&lt;/ref&gt; St Sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build.&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;T. Madden, ''Crusades: The Illustrated History'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original Church of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a [[Church of the Holy Apostles|new church]] under the same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to remain the burial place of the emperors from Constantine himself until the 11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of [[Mehmet II|Mehmet II the Conqueror]]. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the city's built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within {{convert|100|ft|m}} of the sea front, in order to protect the view.&lt;ref&gt;Justinian, ''Novellae'' 63 and 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Justinian I's reign, the city's population reached about 500,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/handouts/Population.htm Early Medieval and Byzantine Civilization: Constantine to Crusades], Dr. Kenneth W. Harl.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the social fabric of Constantinople was also damaged by the onset of [[Plague of Justinian]] between 541–542 AD. It killed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe], [[BBC News]], November 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survival, 565–717 ===
In the early 7th century the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and later the [[Bulgars]] overwhelmed much of the [[Balkans]], threatening Constantinople from the west. Simultaneously, the [[Persia]]n [[Sassanid]]s overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into [[Anatolia]]. [[Heraclius]], son to the [[exarch]] of [[Africa]], set sail for the city and assumed the purple. He found the military situation so dire that he is said at first to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to [[Carthage]], but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. Constantinople lost its right to free grain in 618, when Heraclius realized that the city no longer could be supplied from Egyptian sources due to the Persian wars. The population of Constantinople dropped substantially in size as a result, from 500,000 inhabitants to just 40,000-70,000.&lt;ref&gt;The Inheritance of Rome, Chris Wickham, Penguin Books Ltd. 2009, ISBN 978-0-670-02098-0 (page 260)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Great City withstood a [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege]], [[Heraclius]] campaigned deep into Persian territory and briefly restored the ''status quo'' in 628 as the Persians surrendered all their conquests. However, the empire was left weakened in the face of subsequent attacks from the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|Arabs]] when the African and south-east Mediterranean provinces were lost for good. During these wars, a [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|first siege]] of Constantinople by the Muslims lasted from 674 to 678, and a [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second]] from 717 to 718. While the [[Theodosian Walls]] made the city impregnable from the land, a newly discovered incendiary substance known as &quot;[[Greek Fire]]&quot; allowed the [[Byzantine navy]] to destroy the Arab fleets and keep the city supplied. In the second siege, decisive help was rendered by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]]. The failure of this siege was a severe blow to the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], and stabilised the Byzantine-Arab equilibrium.

In the 730s [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodora, widow of the emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilus]] (d. 842), acted as regent during the minority of her son [[Michael III]], who was said to have been introduced to dissolute habits by her brother Bardas. When Michael assumed power in 856, he became known for excessive drunkenness, appeared in the hippodrome as a charioteer and burlesqued the religious processions of the clergy. He removed Theodora from the Great Palace to the Carian Palace and later to the [[Sancaktar Hayrettin Mosque|monastery of Gastria]], but, after the death of Bardas, she was released to live in the palace of St Mamas; she also had a rural residence at the Anthemian Palace, where Michael was assassinated in 867.&lt;ref&gt;George Finlay, History of the Byzantine Empire, Dent, London, 1906, pp. 156-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 860, an [[Rus'–Byzantine War (860)|attack]] was made on the city by a new principality set up a few years earlier at [[Kiev]] by [[Askold and Dir]], two [[Varangian]] chiefs: Two hundred small vessels passed through the Bosporus and plundered the monasteries and other properties on the suburban [[Prince's Islands]]. [[Niketas Oryphas|Oryphas]], the admiral of the Byzantine fleet, alerted the emperor Michael, who promptly put the invaders to flight; but the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught made a deep impression on the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, 1906 pp. 174-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 980, the emperor [[Basil II]] received an unusual gift from Prince [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]] of Kiev: 6,000 [[Varangian]] warriors, which Basil formed into a new bodyguard known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. They were known for their ferocity, honour, and loyalty. It is said that, in 1038, they were dispersed in winter quarters in the [[Thracesian Theme|Thracesian]] theme when one of their number attempted to violate a countrywoman, but in the struggle she seized his sword and killed him; instead of taking revenge, however, his comrades applauded her conduct, compensated her with all his possessions, and exposed his body without burial as if he had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, 1906, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the death of an Emperor, they became known also for plunder in the Imperial palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Enoksen, Lars Magnar. (1998). ''Runor : historia, tydning, tolkning''. Historiska Media, Falun. ISBN 91-88930-32-7 p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 11th Century the Varangian Guard became dominated by [[Anglo-Saxons]] who preferred this way of life to subjugation by the new Norman kings of England.&lt;ref&gt;J M Hussey, The Byzantine World, Hutchinson, London, 1967, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Book of the Eparch]]'', which dates to the 10th century, gives a detailed picture of the city's commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It is an impressive testament to the strength of tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, pp. 343-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th and 10th centuries, Constantinople had a population of between 500,000 and 800,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/turkey/istanbul/istanbul.html Silk Road Seattle - Constantinople], Daniel C. Waugh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iconoclast controversy ====
In the 8th and 9th centuries, the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclast]] movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The officer given the task was killed by the crowd, and in the end the image was removed rather than destroyed: It was to be restored by [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and removed again by [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]]: Finlay 1906, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine V]] convoked a [[Council of Hieria|church council in 754]], which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|church of the Holy Virgin]] at [[Blachernae]] as having been transformed into a &quot;fruit store and aviary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of his son [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] in 780, the empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] restored the veneration of images through the agency of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.

The iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress [[Theodora (9th century)|Theodora]], who restored the icons. These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the [[Catholicism|Western]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] Churches.

=== Prelude to the Comnenian period, 1025–1081 ===
In the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor [[Romanos IV|Romanus]] Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by [[Alp Arslan]], sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, [[Michael VII]] Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.

=== 1081–1185 ===

Under the Comnenian dynasty (1081–1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable military, financial and territorial recovery. In what is sometimes called the [[Comnenian Restoration]], with the establishment of a [[Komnenian army|new military system]], the Empire recovered nearly half of the lost Anatolian lands. In 1090–91, the nomadic [[Pechenegs]] reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the [[Kipchaks]] annihilated their army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050829210704/http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs The Pechenegs], Steven Lowe and Dmitriy V. Ryaboy.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[battle of Levounion]] in 1091 marked the beginning of a resurgence of Byzantine power and influence that would last for a hundred years. In response to a call for aid from [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I Comnenus]], the [[First Crusade]] assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for [[Jerusalem]] on its own account.&lt;ref&gt;There is an excellent source for these events: the writer and historian [[Anna Komnene|Anna Comnena]] in her work [[The Alexiad]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John II Komnenos|John II]] built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the restoration of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from approximately 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the [[Venice|Venetians]] and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of [[Outremer]] and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and [[Egypt]]. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of Manuel I's reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000-80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;popu&quot;&gt;J. Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jews&quot;&gt;J. Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In artistic terms, the 12th century was a very productive period. There was a revival in the [[mosaic]] art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (''Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization''):

: &quot;With its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the work-shops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals - lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins - confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.&quot;

: &quot;From the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at [[Torcello]] clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]], the [[Martorana]] at [[Palermo]], and the [[cathedral of Cefalù]], together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the [[italo-Normans|Norman]] Court of [[Sicily]] in the twelfth century. Hispano-[[Moorish]] art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. [[Romanesque art]] owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of [[Kiev]], [[doge of Venice|Venetian doges]], abbots of [[Monte Cassino]], merchants of [[Amalfi]], and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.&quot;

[[Image:Byzantium1204.png|thumb|The [[Latin Empire]], [[Empire of Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond]], and the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. The borders are very uncertain]]
In the course of a plot between [[Philip of Swabia]], [[Boniface of Montferrat]] and the [[Enrico Dandolo|Doge of Venice]], the [[Fourth Crusade]] was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexius son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor [[Alexius III]] had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied [[Galata]], broke the chain protecting the [[Golden Horn]] and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new [[Alexius IV]] found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the ''[[protovestiarius]]'' Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of [[Phidias]], which stood in the principal forum facing west.

In February, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as [[Alexius V]]. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in St Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the [[Milion|Golden Milestone]] before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.

The great historian of the Crusades, Sir Steven Runciman, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is “unparalleled in history”.

{{quote|“For nine centuries,” he goes on, “the great city had been the capital of Christian civilisation. It was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen. The Venetians, wherever they could, seized treasures and carried them off. But the Frenchmen and Flemings were filled with a lust for destruction: They rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses, snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry, pausing only to murder or to rape, or to break open the wine-cellars. Neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared. In St Sophia itself, drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the silver iconostasis to pieces, while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot. While they drank from the altar-vessels, a prostitute sang a ribald French song on the Patriarch’s throne. Nuns were ravished in their convents. Palaces and hovels alike were wrecked. Wounded women and children lay dying in the streets. For three days the ghastly scenes continued until the huge and beautiful city was a shambles. Even after order was restored, citizens were tortured to make them reveal treasures they had hidden.|&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''History of the Crusades'', Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1965, vol 3, pp. 111-128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the [[Latin Empire]]. The Byzantine nobility were scattered. Many went to [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], where Theodore Lascaris set up an imperial court, or to [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], where one of the Comneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of empire.&lt;ref&gt;Hussey 1967, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to recover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was [[Liberation of Constantinople|captured]] from its last Latin ruler, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]], by the forces of the [[Nicaean Empire|Nicaean emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]].

Although Constantinople was retaken by [[Michael VIII]], the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive. The palace of [[Blachernae]] in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the [[Bosporus]] going into decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;popu2&quot;&gt;T.

===Culture===
Constantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. In its heyday, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular, [[Hagia Sophia]], or the Church of Holy Wisdom: A Russian 14th-century traveler, Stephen of Novgorod, wrote, &quot;As for St Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.&quot;

It was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city's fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years.

===International Status===

The city provided a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century. The 18-meter-tall walls built by [[Theodosius II]] were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the [[Danube river]], who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia. From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the [[Anastasian Wall]], a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[peninsula]]. Many scholars{{Who|date=January 2010}} argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while [[Ancient Rome]] and the west collapsed. With the emergence of [[Christianity]] and the rise of [[Islam]], Constantinople became the gates of Christian Europe standing at the fore of Islamic expansion. As the Byzantine Empire was situated in-between the Islamic world and the Christian west, so did Constantinople act as Europe’s first line-of-defence against Arab advances in the 7th and 8th centuries. The city, and the empire, would ultimately fall to the [[Ottomans]] by 1453, but its enduring legacy had provided Europe centuries of resurgence following the collapse of Rome.

===Architecture===

[[Image:Ayasofya-Innenansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of the [[Hagia Sophia]] museum.]]

The Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, the basilicas of [[Ravenna]], and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th century Italian [[Italian coin florin|florin]], the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Diocletian]] becoming the [[bezant]] prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its [[Theodosian Walls|city walls]] were much imitated (for example, see [[Caernarfon Castle]]) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire.

===Religious===
Constantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]], vying for honour with the [[Pope]],&lt;ref&gt;The Fourth Canon of the [[First Council of Constantinople]]: [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-61.htm#P3914_689786 CCEL.org]&lt;/ref&gt; a situation that contributed to the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] that divided [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]] from [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to [[Islam]], as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the [[Islamic eschatology|End time in Islam]].

It is bordered to the north and west by the [[Celtic Sea]] &lt;ref&gt;International Hydrographic Organization&lt;/ref&gt;, to the south by the [[English Channel]], and to the east by the county of [[Devon]], over the [[River Tamar]]. Including the [[Isles of Scilly]], Cornwall has a population of {{English cerem counties|POP=Cornwall}}, and covers an area of {{convert|3563|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{English district population citation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{English district area citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative centre and only [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] is [[Truro]]. The geographical area of Cornwall also constitutes the [[Duchy of Cornwall]].

The area now known as Cornwall was first inhabited in the [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods. It continued to be occupied by [[Prehistoric Britain|Neolithic]] and then [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] peoples, and later (in the [[Iron Age]]) by [[Brythons]] with distinctive cultural relations to neighbouring [[Wales]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]]. There is little evidence that [[Roman Britain|Roman rule]] was effective west of [[Exeter]] and few Roman remains have been found. Cornwall was a division of the [[Dumnonii]] tribe—whose tribal centre was in the modern county of [[Devon]]—known as the [[Cornovii (Cornish)|Cornovii]], separated from [[Wales]] after the [[Battle of Deorham]], often coming into conflict with the expanding English kingdom of [[Wessex]] before [[King Athelstan]] in AD 936 set the boundary between [[English people|English]] and [[Cornish people]] at the Tamar.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, F. M. (1947) ''Anglo-Saxon England''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;. From the early middle ages, [[British language]] and culture was apparently shared by Brythons trading across both sides of the Channel, evidenced by the corresponding high medieval [[Breton]] kingdoms of [[Domnonee]] and [[Cornouaille]] and the [[Celtic Christianity]] common to both territories.

Historically [[tin]] mining was important in the Cornish economy, becoming significant during the Middle Ages and expanding greatly during the 19th century when rich copper mines were also in production. In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the tin and copper trades entered a period of decline. Subsequently china clay extraction became more important and metal mining had virtually ended by the 1990s. Traditionally fishing (particularly of [[pilchards]]), and agriculture (particularly of dairy products and vegetables), were the other important sectors of the economy. The railways led to the growth of tourism during the 20th century and it is now of greater importance economically than the other industries. Today, Cornwall's [[Economy of Cornwall|economy]] struggles after the decline of the [[Mining in Cornwall|mining]] and [[Fishing in Cornwall|fishing]] industries, and has become more dependent on [[tourism]]. The area is noted for its wild [[moorland]] landscapes, its extensive and varied coastline, its many place names derived from the [[Cornish language]], and its very mild climate.

Cornwall is recognised as one of the [[Celtic nations]], retaining a distinct [[Culture of Cornwall|cultural identity]] that reflects its [[History of Cornwall|heritage]]. Some people question the present [[constitutional status of Cornwall]], and a [[Cornish nationalism|nationalist movement]] seeks greater [[autonomy]] within the [[United Kingdom]] in the form of a devolved legislative [[Cornish Assembly|assembly]], and greater recognition of the [[Cornish people]] as a national minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1704112.stm |title=Blair gets Cornish assembly call |publisher=BBC |date=2001-12-11 |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Saxon England according to the Saxon Chronicle.jpg|upright|thumb|left|&quot;Cornweallas&quot; in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'']]
The name ''Cornwall'' comes from combining two different terms from separate languages. The [[Latin|Roman]] term for the [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]] which inhabited what is now Cornwall at the time of [[Roman times|Roman]] rule in Britain, ''[[Cornovii (Cornish)|Cornovii]]'', came from a [[Brython]]ic tribal name which gave modern [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''Kernow'', also known as ''Corneu'' to the Brythons.&lt;ref name=corneu&gt;{{Cite web

 | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be from either of two sources; the common [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] root ''cern'', or the Latin ''cornu'', both of which mean &quot;horn&quot; or &quot;[[peninsula]]&quot;, suggestive of the shape of Cornwall's landmass. There is a problem with this theory however. At least two other known Celtic tribes bore the name Cornovii, [[Cornovii (Caithness)|one tribe]] in [[Caithness]] which may also be considered a &quot;headland&quot; or &quot;horn-land&quot;, yet another, the principal tribe known to the Romans as [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] lived in the West Midlands and [[Powys]] areas, calling into question the derivation of the name from a peninsula (however, Celtic tribes were not necessarily permanently settled, and the Latin forms may be based on different British names).&lt;ref name=whitefiles&gt;{{Cite web

Nevertheless, the Cornovii were sufficiently established in the present day area recognised as Cornwall for their territory to be recorded as [[Cornubia]] by 700 AD, and remained as such into the [[England in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. The [[Ravenna Cosmography]], of around [[700]], makes reference to ''Purocoronavis'', (almost certainly a corruption of Durocornovium),  'a fort or walled settlement of the Cornovii', (unidentified, but possibly [[Tintagel]] or [[Carn Brea]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Payton 1&quot;&gt;

Some historians note that this was the word for [[Wales]], however it is understood that the term applied instead to all Brythonic peoples and lands, who were considered foreign by the Anglo-Saxons. As Cornwall was known as ''West Wales'' and present-day [[Wales]] as ''North Wales'' during those times, the &quot;Wales&quot; meaning is probable.

[[Image:Men-an-Tol.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mên-an-Tol]].]]

===Prehistory, Roman and post-Roman periods===
{{See also|Dumnonia|Kingdom of Cornwall}}
The present human history of Cornwall begins with the reoccupation of Britain after the last Ice Age. According to [[John T. Koch]] and others, Cornwall in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] that also included the other [[Celtic nations]], England, France, Spain and Portugal where [[Celtic languages]] developed with the Tartessian language, which he claims was the first written [[Celtic language]] so far discovered.&lt;ref name=Koch2009&gt;{{Cite book| last = Koch | first = John | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 (2009)| publisher = Palaeohispanica | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 339–351 | url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf | doi = | id = | issn = 1578-5386 | accessdate = 2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko|title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|page=384|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=A Race Apart: Insularity and Connectivity in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 75, 2009, pp. 55–64|year=2008 |publisher=The Prehistoric Society|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[British Iron Age]] Cornwall, like all of Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was inhabited by the [[Celts|Celtic]] people known as the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]. The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[British language (Celtic)|British language]] spoken at the time eventually developed into several distinct tongues, including [[Cornish language|Cornish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Payton 1&quot;/&gt; The first account of Cornwall comes from the Sicilian Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (c. 90 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 30 BC), supposedly quoting or paraphrasing the fourth-century BC geographer [[Pytheas]], who had sailed to Britain:

{{quotation|The inhabitants of that part of Britain called ''Belerion'' (or Land's End) from their intercourse with foreign merchants, are civilised in their manner of life. They prepare the tin, working very carefully the earth in which it is produced ... Here then the merchants buy the tin from the natives and carry it over to [[Gaul]], and after travelling overland for about thirty days, they finally bring their loads on horses to the mouth of the Rhône.|&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, F. E. (1959) ''A History of Cornwall'', London: Duckworth, ISBN 1-84232-123-4, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:England Celtic tribes - South.png|thumb|right|Celtic tribes of Southern Britain]]
The identity of these merchants is unknown. There has been a theory that they were [[Phoenicia]]ns, however there is no evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; (For further discussion of tin mining see the section on the economy below.)

There is a theory that [[silver]] was extracted from the copper ores of Cornwall in pre-Roman times, as silver is easily converted to its chloride (AgCl) by surface waters containing chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;Tylecote, R. F. (1962) Metallurgy in Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, Cornwall reverted to rule by independent Celtic chieftains.

===Conflict with Wessex===
The chronology of English dominance over Cornwall is unclear. In the 8th century Cornwall came into conflict with the expanding kingdom of [[Wessex]]. There are no recorded charters or legal agreements showing Cornwall as part of Wessex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://duchyofcornwall.eu/duchy01.php |title=Pre Norman Conquest Cornwall |publisher=Duchyofcornwall.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is little economic, military, social, cultural or archaeological evidence that Wessex established control over Cornwall, although some historians, notably Michael Swanton,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'', 2nd ed. London, Phoenix Press, 2000, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malcolm Todd]]&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Michael (1987) ''The South West to AD 1000''. London : Longman ISBN 0-582-49273-4&lt;/ref&gt; assert to the contrary.

The ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' report that in 722 AD the Britons of Cornwall won a battle at ''[[Battle of Hehil|Hehil]]''. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/annalescambriae.html ''Annales Cambriae''] However, it is not stated whether the Cornish fought the West Saxons or some other enemy. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states in 815 (adjusted date) ''&quot;&amp; þy geare gehergade Ecgbryht cyning on West Walas from easteweardum oþ westewearde.&quot;''...''&quot;and in this year king Ecgbryht raided in Cornwall from east to west.&quot;'' and thenceforth apparently held it as a ducatus or dukedom annexed to his regnum or kingdom of Wessex, but not wholly incorporated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.third-millennium-library.com/MedievalHistory/Book/CHAPTERS/XIV.html |title=The Foundation Of The Kingdom Of England |publisher=Third-millennium-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicles]]'' states that in 825 (adjusted date) a battle was fought involving the &quot;Welsh&quot;, presumably those of Cornwall, and the Defnas (men of Devon). It only states:- ''&quot;The Westwealas (Cornish) and the Defnas (men of Devon) fought at Gafulforda&quot;''.  However, there is no mention of who won or who lost, whether the men of Cornwall and Devon were fighting each other or on the same side, and no mention of Egbert. This is the only record of this battle. In the same year Ecgbert, as a later document phrases it, &quot;disposed of their territory as it seemed fit to him, giving a tenth part of it to God.&quot; In other words he incorporated Cornwall [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastically]] with the West Saxon [[diocese of Sherborne]], and endowed [[Ealhstan]], his fighting bishop, who took part in the campaign, with an extensive Cornish estate consisting of [[Callington, Cornwall|Callington]] and [[Lawhitton]], both in the [[River Tamar|Tamar]] valley, and Pawton near [[Padstow]].

In 838, the Cornish and their Danish allies were defeated by Egbert at Hengestesdune (Anglo-Saxon Chronicles): an unknown location (various places have been suggested over the years from Hengistbury Head in Dorset, [[Hingston Down, Devon]] to Hingston Down in Cornwall). In 875, the last recorded king of Cornwall, [[Donyarth|Dumgarth]], is said to have drowned in battle. Around the 880s, Anglo-Saxons from Wessex had established modest land holdings in the eastern part of Cornwall; notably [[Alfred the Great]] had acquired a few estates.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Simon; Lapidge, Michael (tr.) (1983), ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources'', London, Penguin Books, p. 175; cf. ''ibid'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Malmesbury]], writing around 1120, says that King [[Athelstan]] of England (924–939) fixed the boundary between English and Cornish people at the east bank of the River Tamar.

===Norman period===
[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|right|The ancient [[Hundreds of Cornwall]]]]
One interpretation of the Domesday Book is that by this time the native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, the largest of whom was [[Harold Godwinson]] himself. However, this is highly questionable: the [[Bodmin manumissions]] show that two leading Cornish figures nominally had Saxon names, but these were both glossed with native Cornish names. This suggests that a mixing of populations and [[Syncretism#Social and political roles|cultural syncretism]] occurred, as opposed to outright replacement of the original Cornish nobility.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

However, soon after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] most of the land was seized and transferred into the hands of a new Breton-Norman aristocracy, with the lion's share going to [[Robert, Count of Mortain]], half-brother of [[William I of England|King William]] and the largest landholder in England after the king.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Ann &amp; Martin, G. H. (2002) (tr.) ''Domesday Book: a complete translation'', London: Penguin, pp. 341-357&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately this aristocracy eventually became a Cornu-Norman ruling class,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} a phenomenon closely resembling the situation in the rest of England, and later in Ireland.

===Later medieval administration and society===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cornwall Crest.png|thumb|right|The Cornish coat of arms]] --&gt;
Subsequently, however, Norman absentee landlords became replaced by a new Cornu-Norman elite. These families eventually became the new ruling class of Cornwall (typically speaking Norman French, Cornish, Latin and eventually English), many becoming involved in the operation of the [[Stannary Parliament]] system, Earldom and eventually the Duchy.&lt;ref&gt;Payton (1998) ''Cornwall'', pp. 100-108&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cornish language]] continued to be spoken and it acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from [[Breton language|Breton]]. Cornwall showed a very different type of settlement pattern from that of Saxon Wessex and places continued, even after 1066, to be named in the [[Celts|Celtic]] Cornish tradition with Saxon architecture being uncommon. The earliest record for any Anglo-Saxon place names west of the Tamar is around 1040: they are particularly noticeable in the north-east of the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payton 1&quot;/&gt;

==Christianity in Cornwall==
{{Main|Christianity in Cornwall}}
{{See also|List of Cornish saints}}

Many place names in Cornwall are associated with Christian missionaries described as coming from Ireland and Wales in the fifth century AD and usually called saints (''See'' [[List of Cornish saints]]). The historicity of some of these missionaries is problematic&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Orme|Orme, Nicholas]] (2000) ''The Saints of Cornwall'', ''see also'' [http://www.lelant.info/uny.htm Article on &quot;Saint Uny&quot; at http://www.lelant.info/uny.htm]. The patron saint of [[Wendron]] Parish Church, &quot;Saint Wendrona&quot; is another example.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been pointed out by [[Gilbert Hunter Doble|Canon Doble]] that it was customary in the Middle Ages to ascribe such geographical origins to saints.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Hunter Doble|Doble, G. H.]] (1960) ''The Saints of Cornwall''. 5 vols. Truro: Dean and Chapter, 1960-70&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these saints are not included in the early lists of saints.&lt;ref&gt;See for example absences from Olsen and Padel's &quot;A tenth century list of Cornish parochial saints&quot; in ''Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies''; 12 (1986); and from ''[[Nova Legenda Angliae]]'' by [[John Capgrave]] (mid-15th cent.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St Piran]], after whom [[Perranporth]] is named, is generally regarded as the patron saint of Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =St. Piran - Sen piran| publisher = St-Piran.com| url = http://www.st-piran.com/st-piran.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However in early Norman times it is likely that [[St Michael the Archangel]] was recognised as the patron saint&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Charles (1935) &quot;Cornwall and her patron saint&quot;, In: his ''Essays in Cornish History''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; pp. 197-201&lt;/ref&gt; and the title has also been claimed for [[St Petroc]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===The Church in Cornwall in Celtic and Anglo-Saxon times===
[[File:St Petroc's Church, Bodmin - geograph.org.uk - 51028.jpg|The Church of St Petroc at Bodmin|thumb]]
[[File:Dupath well cornwall.jpg|thumb|One of Cornwall's many holy wells]]
The church in Cornwall until the time of Athelstan of Wessex observed more or less orthodox practices, being completely separate from the Anglo-Saxon church until then (and perhaps later). The See of Cornwall continued until much later: Bishop [[Conan of Cornwall|Conan]] apparently in place previously, but (re-?) consecrated in 931 AD by [[Athelstan]]. However, it is unclear whether he was the sole Bishop for Cornwall or the leading Bishop in the area. The situation in Cornwall may have been somewhat similar to Wales where each major religious house corresponded to a [[cantref]] (this has the same meaning as Cornish [[Constitutional status of Cornwall#Cornish &quot;shires&quot;|keverang]]) both being under the supervision of a Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, T. (1970) &quot;The Seven Bishop Houses of Dyfed,&quot; In: ''Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies'', vol. 24, (1970-1972), pp. 247-252.&lt;/ref&gt; However if this was so the status of keverangow before the time of King Athelstan is not recorded. However it can be inferred from the districts included at this period that the minimum number would be three: Triggshire; Wivelshire; and the remaining area. Penwith, Kerrier, Pydar and Powder meet at a central point ([[Scorrier]]) which some have believed indicates a fourfold division imposed by Athelstan on a sub-kingdom.

===The Middle Ages===
It is notable that in Cornwall that most of the parish churches in existence in Norman times were generally not in the larger settlements and that the medieval towns which developed thereafter usually had only a chapel of ease with the right of burial remaining at the ancient parish church.&lt;ref&gt;Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford&lt;/ref&gt; Over a hundred [[holy well]]s exist in Cornwall, each associated with a particular saint, though not always the same one as the dedication of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Jenner|Jenner, Henry]] (1925) &quot;The Holy Wells of Cornwall&quot;. In: ''Cornish Church Guide''. Truro: Blackford; pp. 249-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mabel Quiller-Couch|Quiller-Couch, M. &amp; L.]] (1894) ''Ancient and Holy Wells of Cornwall''. London: Chas. J. Clark&lt;/ref&gt;

Various kinds of religious houses existed in mediaeval Cornwall though none of them were nunneries; the benefices of the parishes were in many cases appropriated to religious houses within Cornwall or elsewhere in England or France.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Oliver (historian)|Oliver, George]] (1846) ''Monasticon Dioecesis Exoniensis: being a collection of records and instruments illustrating the ancient conventual, collegiate, and eleemosynary foundations, in the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, with historical notices, and a supplement, comprising a list of the dedications of churches in the Diocese, an amended edition of the taxation of Pope Nicholas, and an abstract of the Chantry Rolls'' [with supplement and index]. Exeter: P. A. Hannaford, 1846, 1854, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious history from the Reformation to the Victorian period===
In the sixteenth century there was some violent resistance to the replacement of Catholicism with Protestantism in the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The Prayer Book Rebellion 1549| publisher = TudorPlace.com.ar| url = http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/prayer_book_rebellion.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1548 the college at [[Glasney College|Glasney]], a centre of learning and study established by the Bishop of Exeter, had been closed and looted (many manuscripts and documents were destroyed) which aroused resentment among the Cornish. They, among other things, objected to the English language [[Book of Common Prayer]], protesting that the English language was still unknown to many at the time. The Prayer Book Rebellion was a cultural and social disaster for Cornwall; the reprisals taken by the forces of the Crown have been estimated to account for 10-11% of the civilian population of Cornwall. Culturally speaking, it saw the beginning of the slow decline of the [[Cornish language]].

From that time Christianity in Cornwall was in the main within the Church of England and subject to the national events which affected it in the next century and a half. Roman Catholicism never became extinct, though openly practised by very few; there were some converts to Puritanism, Anabaptism and Quakerism in certain areas though they suffered intermittent persecution which more or less came to an end in the reign of William and Mary. During the 18th century Cornish Anglicanism was very much in the same state as Anglicanism in most of England. Wesleyan Methodist missions began during [[John Wesley]]'s lifetime and had great success over a long period during which Methodism itself divided into a number of sects and established a definite separation from the Church of England.

From the early nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century [[Methodism]] was the leading form of Christianity in Cornwall but it is now in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Methodism| publisher = Cornish-Mining.org.uk| url = http://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/story/religion.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Thomas (1967) ''A History of Cornish Methodism''. Truro: Bradford Barton&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of England was in the majority from the reign of Queen Elizabeth until the Methodist revival of the 19th century: before the Wesleyan missions dissenters were very few in Cornwall. The county remained within the [[Diocese of Exeter]] until 1876 when the Anglican [[Diocese of Truro]] was created&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Truro Cathedral website - History page| publisher = TruroCathedral.org.uk| url = http://www.trurocathedral.org.uk/cathedral-story/story1.html| accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, H. Miles (1976) ''A Century for Cornwall''. Truro: Blackford&lt;/ref&gt; (the first Bishop was appointed in 1877). Roman Catholicism was virtually extinct in Cornwall after the 17th century except for a few families such as the Arundells of [[Lanherne]]. From the mid-19th century the church reestablished episcopal sees in England, one of these being at [[Diocese of Plymouth|Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plymouth-diocese.org.uk/|title= Diocese of Plymouth|accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then immigration to Cornwall has brought more Roman Catholics into the population.

==Physical geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cornwall|Geology of Cornwall}}
[[Image:Cw2.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of Cornwall]]

Cornwall forms the tip of the south-west peninsula of the island of Great Britain, and is therefore exposed to the full force of the [[prevailing winds]] that blow in from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The coastline is composed mainly of [[resistance (geology)|resistant]] rocks that give rise in many places to impressive cliffs. Cornwall has a border with only one other county, [[Devon]].

===Coastal areas===
The north and south coasts have different characteristics. The north coast on the [[Celtic Sea]], part of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], is more exposed and therefore has a wilder nature. The prosaically named ''High Cliff'', between [[Boscastle]] and [[St Gennys]], is the highest sheer-drop cliff in Cornwall at {{convert|223|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/main/sections/index.cfm?fsa=dspSectionDetail&amp;w_id=147 |title=The Official Guide to the South West Coast Path |publisher=Southwestcoastpath.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also many extensive stretches of fine golden sand which form the beaches that are so important to the tourist industry, such as those at [[Bude]], [[Polzeath]], [[Watergate Bay]], [[Perranporth]], [[Porthtowan]], [[Fistral Beach]], [[Newquay]], [[St Agnes, Cornwall|St Agnes]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], and on the south coast [[Gyllyngvase]] beach in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. There are two river estuaries on the north coast: [[Hayle Estuary]] and the estuary of the [[River Camel]], which provides [[Padstow]] and [[Rock, Cornwall|Rock]] with a safe harbour.

[[Image:St-Michael Mount.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Michael's Mount]] in Marazion]]
The south coast, dubbed the &quot;Cornish Riviera&quot;, is more sheltered and there are several broad estuaries offering safe anchorages, such as at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Fowey]]. Beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle, interspersed with rocky sections of [[wave-cut platform]]. Also on the south coast, the picturesque fishing village of [[Polperro]], at the mouth of the Pol River, and the fishing port of [[Looe]] on the [[River Looe]] are both popular with tourists.

===Inland areas===
The interior of the county consists of a roughly east-west spine of infertile and exposed upland, with a series of [[granite]] intrusions, such as [[Bodmin Moor]], which contains the highest land within Cornwall. From east to west, and with approximately descending altitude, these are Bodmin Moor, the area north of [[St Austell]], the area south of [[Camborne]], and the [[Penwith]] or [[Land's End]] peninsula. These intrusions are the central part of the granite outcrops that form the exposed parts of the [[Cornubian batholith]] of south-west Britain, which also includes [[Dartmoor]] to the east in [[Devon]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]] to the west, the latter now being partially submerged.

[[Image:Porthcurno beach.jpg|thumb|left|Cornwall is known for its beaches and rugged coastline.]]
The intrusion of the granite into the surrounding [[sedimentary]] rocks gave rise to extensive [[metamorphism]] and mineralisation, and this led to Cornwall being one of the most important mining areas in Europe until the early 20th century. It is thought [[tin]] was mined here as early as the [[Bronze Age]], and [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]] and [[silver]] have all been [[Mining in Cornwall|mined in Cornwall]]. Alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of [[Kaolinite|China Clay]], especially in the area to the north of [[St Austell]], and the extraction of this remains an important industry.

The uplands are surrounded by more fertile, mainly [[pasture|pastoral]] farmland. Near the south coast, deep wooded valleys provide sheltered conditions for flora that like shade and a moist, mild climate. These areas lie mainly on [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]] and [[slate]]. The north east of Cornwall lies on [[Carboniferous]] rocks known as the [[Culm Measures]]. In places these have been subjected to severe folding, as can be seen on the north coast near [[Crackington Haven]] and in several other locations.

===The Lizard Peninsula===
{{Main|Lizard complex}}
The [[Geology of Lizard, Cornwall|geology of the Lizard peninsula]] is unusual, in that it is mainland Britain's only example of an [[ophiolite]], a section of oceanic crust now found on land.&lt;ref&gt;Britain's only other example on an ophiolite, the Shetland ophiolite, is older, and linked to the Grampian [[Orogeny]]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red [[Precambrian]] [[serpentinite]], which forms spectacular cliffs, notably at [[Kynance Cove]], and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops. This [[ultramafic rock]] also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula. This is home to rare plants, such as the [[Cornish Heath]], which has been adopted as the [[county flower]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall County Council, &quot;[http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5430 The County Flower].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecology===
{{See also|Flora and fauna of Cornwall}}

Cornwall has varied habitats including terrestrial and marine ecosystems. One of the [[lower plant]] forms in decline locally is the [[Reindeer lichen]], which species has been made a priority for protection under the national UK [[Biodiversity Action Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;Price, J.

Botanists divide Cornwall and Scilly into two vice-counties: West (1) and East (2). The standard flora is by [[F. H. Davey]] ''Flora of Cornwall'' (1909). Davey was assisted by [[A. O. Hume]] and he thanks Hume, his companion on excursions in Cornwall and Devon, and for help in the compilation of that Flora, publication of which was financed by him.

===Climate===
{{Main|Geography of Cornwall#Climate}}
Cornwall has a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Cfb) and has the mildest and sunniest climate in the [[United Kingdom]], as a result of its southerly latitude and the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref&gt;Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif Annual average temperature for the United Kingdom].&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature in Cornwall ranges from 11.6&amp;nbsp;°C (53&amp;nbsp;°F) on the [[Isles of Scilly]] to 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F) in the central uplands. Winters are amongst the warmest in the country due to the southerly latitude and moderating effects of the warm ocean currents, and frost and snow are very rare at the coast and are also rare in the central upland areas as well. Summers are however not as warm as other areas in southern England. Due to its proximity to the sea, Cornwall's weather can be relatively changeable.

Cornwall is one of the sunniest areas in the UK, with over 1541 hours of sunshine per year, with the highest average of 7.6 hours of sunshine per day in July.&lt;ref&gt;Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif Annual average sunshine for the United Kingdom].&lt;/ref&gt; The moist, mild air coming from the south west brings higher amounts of rainfall than eastern Great Britain, at 1051 to 1290&amp;nbsp;mm (41.4 to 50.8&amp;nbsp;in) per year, however not as much as more northern areas of the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif Annual average rainfall for the United Kingdom].&lt;/ref&gt; The Isles of Scilly, for example, where there are on average less than 2 days of air frost per year, are in the [[USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 10, which is the only area in the UK that is in this zone and where there is on average less than 1 day of air temperature exceeding 30&amp;nbsp;°C per year, are in the AHS Heat Zone 1. Extreme temperatures in Cornwall are particularly rare, however extreme weather in the form of storms and floods is common.

[[Image:New County Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Cornwall Council]]'s headquarters in [[Truro]]]]
[[File:CornwallConstituencies2010.gif|thumb|From the 2010 general election, Cornwall has had six parliamentary constituencies]]
With the exception of the [[Isles of Scilly]], Cornwall is now governed by a [[unitary authority]] known as [[Cornwall Council]] which is based in [[Truro]].  Cornwall's Courts of Justice are also located in Truro.

The Isles of Scilly form part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Cornwall and have, at times, been served by the same county administration.  However, since 1890 they have been administered by their own [[unitary authority]], now known as the Council of the Isles of Scilly.  They are still grouped with Cornwall for other administrative purposes, such as the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] and [[Devon and Cornwall Constabulary|Devon and Cornwall Police]].&lt;ref name=iosuatt&gt;{{Cite web| title = Isles of Scilly Cornwall through time | url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10076742&amp;c_id=10171878 | publisher = visionofbritain.org.uk | accessdate = January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iosrdtt&gt;{{Cite web| title = Isles of Scilly RD Cornwall through time | url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10026210&amp;c_id=10001043 | publisher = visionofbritain.org.uk | accessdate = January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Prior to reorganisation on 1 April 2009, council functions throughout the rest of Cornwall were organised on a two-tier basis, with a county council and district councils for the six districts  of [[Caradon]], [[Carrick, Cornwall|Carrick]], [[Kerrier]], [[North Cornwall]], [[Penwith]], and [[Restormel]]. While projected to streamline services, cut red tape and save around £17 million a year, the reorganisation was met with wide opposition, with a poll in 2008 giving a result of 89% disapproval from Cornish residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=37570 |title=One Cornwall - A unified council for Cornwall |publisher=Cornwall County Council |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onecornwall.cornwall.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=44400 ]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| publisher = BBC| title = Cornwall super-council go-ahead| date = 2007-07-25| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6914947.stm| accessdate = 2007-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first elections for the new unitary authority were held on 4 June 2009.  The new council has 123 seats; the largest party is the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] with 50, followed by the [[Liberal Democrats]] with 38, [[Independent (politics)|Independent]]s with 32 and [[Mebyon Kernow]] with 3 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the creation of the new unitary council, the former county council had 82 seats, the majority of which were held by the Liberal Democrats, elected at the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2005|2005 county council elections]].  The six former districts in Cornwall had a total of 249 council seats, and the numerically largest groups represented on them were Liberal Democrats, Conservatives, and Independents.

;Parliamentary constituencies
Following a review by the [[Boundary Commission for England]] taking effect at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Cornwall is divided into six [[county constituencies]] to elect MPs to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

Before the 2010 boundary changes there were five constituencies in Cornwall, all of which were won by [[Liberal Democrats]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. However, at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] Liberal Democrat candidates won three constituencies and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidates won three constituencies (''see also [[2010 United Kingdom general election result in Cornwall]]'').

Until 1832, Cornwall had 44 MPs-–more than any other county-–reflecting the importance of tin to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba31/ba31regs.html |title=British Archaeology, no 30, December 1997: Letters |publisher=Britarch.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the increase came between 1529 and 1584 after which there was no change until 1832.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. L. Rowse|Rowse, A. L.]] (1941) ''Tudor Cornwall''. London: Cape; pp. 91-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief registered parties contesting elections in Cornwall are Conservatives, [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], Liberal Democrats, [[Mebyon Kernow]], [[Liberal Party (modern)|Liberal Party]] and the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP).

In July 2007, Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] appointed [[Mark Prisk]] to the newly-created post of [[Shadow Minister for Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAarTqZsaU |title=Mark Prisk appointed [[Shadow Minister for Cornwall]] |publisher=Cameron, David |format=flash video |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-rule movement===
There is a growing call within Cornwall for [[Cornish self-government movement|greater self-rule]]. [[Cornwall Council]]'s Feb 2003 MORI poll showed 55% in favour of an elected, fully-devolved regional assembly for Cornwall and 13% against.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} (Previous result: 46% in favour in 2002). The Cornish Constitutional Convention&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  advocates the creation of a [[Cornish Assembly]], along the lines of those for [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], and in 2001 presented a petition to the then Prime minister, [[Tony Blair]], calling for the change. It is claimed that many of the residents are calling for a high degree of autonomy within England, or a split from England, creating a fifth [[home nation]] of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Cite web|author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/about.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly - Senedh Kernow |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |date=2005-04-03 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or a separate Cornish Development Agency, a result of discontent with the [[South West of England Regional Development Agency|South West Regional Development Agency]].

===Cornish political parties===
Cornish nationalists have organised into two political parties: [[Mebyon Kernow]], formed in 1951, and the [[Cornish Nationalist Party]]. In addition to the political parties, there are various interest groups such as the Cornish [[Stannary Parliament]] and the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]]. In November 2000, the Cornish Constitutional Convention was formed to campaign for a Cornish Assembly. It is a cross-party organisation including representatives from the private, public, and voluntary sectors, of all political parties and none. Between 5 March 2000 and December 2001, the campaign collected the signatures of 41,650 Cornish residents endorsing the declaration for a devolved regional Cornish Assembly, along with 8,896 signatories from outside Cornwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The campaign also has the support of  the three Cornish Lib Dem MPs and Mebyon Kernow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lib Dem 1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cornish MPs determined to win more power for Cornwall - Dan Rogerson MP

===The question of Cornwall's constitutional status===
{{Main|Constitutional status of Cornwall}}

The question of Cornwall's constitutional status as a ''de facto'' [[county of England]], as established by the [[Local Government Act 1888]], a [[Duchy]], i.e. the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] established in 1337 by [[Edward III of England]] for his son, Edward, [[Prince of Wales]], or another constitutional entity of the [[United Kingdom]] is a complex one. In recent years there has been cross-party recognition of the issue at least as far as the calls for a [[Cornish Assembly]] are concerned. In addition there are also groups and individuals, including the [[Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament]], the [[Cornish Constitutional Convention]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ccc&quot;/&gt; and [[John Angarrack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.duchyofcornwall.eu/ |title=The Duchy of Cornwall Human Rights Association |publisher=Duchyofcornwall.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reject the present constitutional status of Cornwall, denying the legality of Cornwall's current administration as a county of England, and Cornwall's relationship to the Duchy of Cornwall.

====Contemporary political parties====
In 2007 [[David Cameron]], leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], in a departure from the Conservative Party's traditionally [[British Unionism|unionist]] stance, appointed Cornishman [[Mark Prisk]], MP for Hertford, Hertfordshire, England, as &quot;[[Shadow Minister for Cornwall]]&quot;. This appointment was called &quot;the fictional minister for Cornwall&quot;, by a Liberal Democrat MP, as there was no government minister to shadow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/03/conservative-party-local-mps&lt;/ref&gt; The post was not continued following the 2010 election, and no longer exists. The [[Liberal Democrats]] recognise Cornwall's claims for greater autonomy, as do the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]].

:&quot;The new single council is also the opportunity to gain more control over local issues from regional and national Government bureaucrats – the first step on our way to a Cornish Assembly.&quot; - The Liberal Democrat Manifesto for 2009 &lt;ref&gt;http://devon-cornwall-libdems.org.uk/resources/sites/84.234.17.197-44731d1eeb1e05.55457880/Cornwall+Lib+Dems+2009+Manifesto.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
An additional political issue is the recognition of the [[Cornish people]] as a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clip.local.gov.uk/lgv/core/page.do?pageId=40416 |title=Minutes for the Census Sub-Group Meeting held on 23 November 2006 |publisher=Central &amp; Local Information Partnership |date=2007-02-09 |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlements and communication==
{{See also|Transport in Cornwall|Media in Cornwall}}
[[Image:Truro stmarysst.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Truro]], Cornwall's administrative centre]]

Cornwall's only city, and the home of the [[Cornwall Council|council headquarters]], is [[Truro]]. Nearby [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] is notable as a port, while the ports at [[Penzance]], the most westerly town in England, [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] and [[Padstow]] have declined. [[Newquay]] on the north coast is famous for its beaches and is a popular surfing destination, as is [[Bude]] further north. [[St Austell]] is Cornwall's largest town and is larger than the capital [[Truro]], and a centre of the [[kaolin|china clay]] industry. [[Redruth]] and [[Camborne]] together form the largest urban area in Cornwall, and both towns were significant as centres of the global tin mining industry.

Cornwall borders the county of [[Devon]] at the River Tamar. Major road links between Cornwall and the rest of [[Great Britain]] are the [[A38 road|A38]] which crosses the Tamar at [[Plymouth]] via the [[Tamar Bridge]] and the town of [[Saltash]], the [[A39 road]] (Atlantic Highway) from [[Barnstaple]], passing through [[North Cornwall]] to end eventually in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], and the [[A30 road|A30]] which crosses the border south of [[Launceston, England|Launceston]]. A [[Torpoint Ferry|car ferry]] also links [[Plymouth]] with the town of [[Torpoint]] on the opposite side of the [[Hamoaze]]. A rail bridge, the [[Royal Albert Bridge]], built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1859) provides the only other major transport link. The major city of Plymouth being the nearest large urban centre to east Cornwall makes it an important location for such services as hospitals, department stores, road and rail transport, and cultural venues.

[[Newquay Cornwall International Airport|Newquay Airport]] provides an airlink to the rest of the UK, Ireland and Europe.

[[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]], across the Bristol Channel, are connected to Cornwall by ferry, usually to [[Padstow]]. [[Swansea]] in particular has several boat companies who can arrange boat trips to north Cornwall, which allow the traveller to pass by the north Cornish coastline, including [[Tintagel Castle]] and [[Padstow]] harbour. Very occasionally, the [[PS Waverley|Waverley]] and [[MV Balmoral|Balmoral]] paddle steamers cruise from [[Swansea]] or [[Bristol]] to [[Padstow]].

The [[Isles of Scilly]] are served by ferry (from [[Penzance]]), helicopter ([[Penzance Heliport]]) and fixed wing aeroplane ([[Land's End Airport]], near St Just) and from [[Newquay Airport]]. Further flights to [[St. Mary's Airport (Isles of Scilly)|St. Mary's]], [[Isles of Scilly]], are available from [[Exeter International Airport]] in [[Devon]].

==Flag==
{{Main|Saint Piran's Flag}}
[[Image:Pamiatka z Kornwalii.jpg|thumb|right|Souvenir flags outside a Cornish café]]
Saint Piran's Flag is regarded by many as the national flag of Cornwall,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rendle&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Phil%20Rendle.pdf|title=Cornwall - The Mysteries of St Piran|last=Rendle|first=Phil|work=Proceedings of the XIX International Congress of Vexxilology|format=PDF|publisher=The Flag Institute|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fotw&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb-corn.html| title=Cross of Saint Piran|publisher=Flags of the World (FOTW)|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an emblem of the Cornish people; and by others as the county flag. The banner of [[Saint Piran]] is a white cross on a black background. Saint Piran is supposed to have adopted these two colours from seeing the white tin in the black coals and ashes during his supposed discovery of tin. [[Davies Gilbert]] in 1826 described it as anciently the flag of St Piran and the banner of Cornwall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Payton|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Payton|title=Cornwall: A History|publisher=Cornwall Editions Limited|location=[[Fowey]]|year=2004|edition=2nd revised|page=262|chapter=Re-inventing Kernow|isbn=1904880053}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another history of 1880 said that: &quot;The white cross of St. Piran was the ancient banner of the Cornish people.&quot; The Cornish flag is an exact reverse of the former [[Brittany|Breton]] national flag (black cross) and is known by the same name &quot;Kroaz Du&quot;.

There are also claims that the patron saint of Cornwall is [[Saint Michael]] or [[Saint Petroc]], but Saint Piran is by far the most popular of the three and his emblem is internationally&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-corn.html |title=Cornwall (United Kingdom) |publisher=Crwflags.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flags.net/UNKG12.htm#UNKG7400 |title=British Flags (United Kingdom) from The World Flag Database |publisher=Flags.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognised as the flag of Cornwall. [[St Piran's Day]] (5 March) is celebrated by the [[Cornish diaspora]] around the world.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Cornwall}}
[[Image:FalmouthDocks.jpg|thumb|right|Falmouth Docks is the major port of Cornwall, and one of the largest [[natural harbour]]s in the world]]
[[Image:Eden project1.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Eden Project]], Cornwall's largest tourist attraction in terms of visitor numbers]]
Cornwall is one of the poorest areas in the United Kingdom. The GVA per head was 65% of the UK average for 2004.&lt;ref&gt;ONS December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The GDP per head for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly was 79.2% of the EU-27 average for 2004, the UK per head average was 123.0%.&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|mining of tin]] (and later also of copper) was important in the Cornish economy. The first reference to this appears to be by Pytheas: see above. [[Julius Caesar]] was the last classical writer to mention the [[tin]] trade, which appears to have declined during the Roman occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The tin trade revived in the Middle Ages, and the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] is attributed to tin miners.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the tin trade again fell into decline.

Today, the Cornish economy depends heavily on its tourist industry, which makes up around a quarter of the economy. The official measures of deprivation and poverty at district and 'sub-ward' level show that there is great variation in poverty and prosperity in Cornwall with some areas among the poorest in England and others among the top half in prosperity. For example, the ranking of 32,482 sub-wards in England in the index of multiple deprivation (2006) ranged from 819th (part of Penzance East) to 30,899th (part of Saltash Burraton in Caradon), where the lower number represents the greater deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwallstatistics.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=35740 ''Poverty and deprivation in Cornwall'' (June 2006)] and {{PDFlink|[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/Regional%20poverty_files/cornw/02SPA.pdf ''Poverty and neighbourhood renewal in west Cornwall'' (January 2002)]|756&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cornwall is one of four UK areas that qualify for poverty-related grants from the EU: it was granted [[Objective 1]] status by the [[European Commission]], followed by a further round of funding known as 'Convergence Funding'.

===Tourism===
Cornwall's unique culture, spectacular landscape and mild climate make it a popular tourist destination, despite being somewhat distant from the United Kingdom's main centres of population. Surrounded on three sides by the [[English Channel]] and [[Celtic Sea]], Cornwall has many miles of beaches and cliffs. Other tourist attractions include moorland, country gardens, historic and prehistoric sites and wooded valleys. Five million tourists visit Cornwall each year, mostly drawn from within the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Visit Cornwall, 2007. {{PDFlink| The total number of visitors to the county includes those on business and visiting relatives. ''[http://www.visitcornwall.com/xsdbimgs/Tourism%20in%20Cornwall%202007.pdf Tourism in Cornwall]''|216&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to Cornwall are served by [[airports]] at [[Newquay]] and [[Plymouth]], whilst private jets, charters and helicopters are also served by [[Perranporth]] airfield; nightsleeper and daily rail services run between Cornwall, London and other regions of the UK.

[[Newquay]] and [[Porthtowan]] are popular destinations for surfers. In recent years, the [[Eden Project]] near [[St Austell]] has been a major financial success, drawing one in eight of Cornwall's visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Executive, 2004. ''[http://www.scottishexecutive.gov.uk/library5/education/lrcas-14.asp A literature review of the evidence base for culture, the arts and sport policy]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other industries===
[[Image:Tin-mining-cornwall-c1890.jpg|thumb|right| Redruth Mine in 1890]]
Other industries are '''[[Fishing in Cornwall|fishing]]''', although this has been significantly re-structured by EU fishing policies (the Southwest Handline Fishermen's Association has started to revive the fishing industry),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linecaught.org.uk/links.htm |title=Line-caught wild bass from Cornwall - South West Handline Fishermen's Association |publisher=Linecaught.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''agriculture''', which has also declined significantly. '''Mining''' of tin and copper was also an industry, but today the derelict mine workings survive only as a [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;ref&gt;. [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1215 UNESCO Page on the Cornwall &amp; West Devon application]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Camborne School of Mines]], which was relocated to [[Tremough|Penryn]] in 2004, is still a world centre of excellence in the field of mining and applied geology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uec.ac.uk/csm/ |title=The University of Exeter - Cornwall Campus - Camborne School of Mines |publisher=Uec.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the grant of World Heritage status has attracted funding for conservation and heritage tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Cornish-mining.org.uk |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China clay]] extraction has also been an important industry in the St Austell area, but this sector has been in decline, and this, coupled with increased mechanisation, has led to a decrease in employment in this sector.

In recent years Cornwall's '''creative industries''' have undergone significant growth, thanks in part to [[Objective One]] funding{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, as it is the only British county poor enough to receive such money. There is now a significant creative industry in Cornwall, encompassing areas like graphic design, product design, web design, packaging design, environmental design, architecture, photography, art and crafts. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Cornwall's population was 513,527 at the last count, and [[population density]] 144 people per square kilometre, ranking it 40th and 41st respectively compared with the other 47 counties of England. Cornwall is 99.0% [[White British]] and has a relatively high level of population growth. At 11.2% in the 1980s and 5.3% in the 1990s, it has the fifth highest population growth of the English counties.&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics, 2001. [http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Facts/fact2.htm Population Change in England by County 1981-2000].&lt;/ref&gt; The natural change has been a small population decline, and the population increase is due to inward migration into Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics, 2001. [http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Facts/fact74.htm Births, Deaths and Natural Change in Cornwall 1974&amp;nbsp;– 2001].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1991 census, the population was 469,800.

Cornwall has a relatively high retired population, with 22.9% of pensionable age, compared with 20.3% for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics, 1996. [http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Transport/Ltp/Tables/Table004.htm % of Population of Pension Age (1996)].&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to a combination of Cornwall's rural and coastal geography increasing its popularity as a retirement location, and outward migration of younger residents to more economically diverse areas. Inward migration of pensioners from southern England to Cornwall, and outward migration of young Cornish people, are persistent concerns.

===Question of Cornish national identity===
Cornwall is the homeland of the Cornish people and diaspora, and is recognised by many people, organisations and media (including politicians, [[Mebyon Kernow]], the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]], the [[Celtic Congress|International Celtic Congress]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'', and [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ)]]) alongside Brittany, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales as one of the six [[Celtic nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Teverson&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

Cornwall Council consider Cornwall's unique cultural heritage and distinctiveness to be one of the area's major assets. They see Cornwall's language; landscape; Celtic identity; political history; patterns of settlement; maritime tradition; industrial heritage; and non-conformist tradition, to be among the features comprising its &quot;distinctive&quot; culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cornwall Council – part three |url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=14923 |accessdate=10&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;2011 |publisher=[[Cornwall Council]] |date=18&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2010 |work=[[Cornwall Council]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is uncertain how many of the people living in Cornwall consider themselves to be Cornish; results from different surveys (including the national census) have varied. In the 2001 census, 7 percent of people in Cornwall identified themselves as Cornish, rather than British or English. However, activists have argued that this underestimated the true number as there was no explicit &quot;Cornish&quot; option included in the official census form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-cornish-they-revolted-in-1497-now-theyre-at-it-again-1782535.html|title=The Cornish: they revolted in 1497, now they're at it again|last=Dugan|first=Emily|date=2009-09-06|publisher=Independent (The)|accessdate=14 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent surveys have suggested that as many as 44 percent identify as Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3527673.stm|title=Welsh are more patriotic|date=2004-03-03|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in Cornwall say that this issue would be resolved if a Cornish option became available on the census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/recommended-questions---national-identity.pdf|title=Information paper: Recommended questions for the 2009 Census Rehearsal and 2011 Census: National Identity|format=PDF|publisher=Office for National Statistics|page=32|month=December | year=2008|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question and content recommendations for the 2011 Census provide an explanation of the process of selecting an ethnic identity which is relevant to the understanding of the often quoted figure of 37,000 who claim Cornish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/ethnic-group-prioritisation-tool.pdf|title=2011 Census; 2011 census questionnaire content; question and content recommendations for 2011; ethnic group prioritisation tool|pages=20–22|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education system===
Cornwall has a comprehensive education system, with 31 state and 8 independent secondary schools. There are three FE colleges--[[Penwith College]] (a former sixth form college), [[Cornwall College]] (occupying the former home of the Camborne School of Mines) and [[Truro College]]. The Isles of Scilly only has one school while the former Restormel district has the highest school population, and school year sizes are around 200, with none above 270.

Higher education is provided by [[University College Falmouth]], the [[University of Exeter]] (including [[Camborne School of Mines]]), the [[Combined Universities in Cornwall]], and by Truro College, Penwith College and Cornwall College.

==Languages and dialects==
[[English language|English]] is the main language used in Cornwall, although the revived [[Cornish language]] may be seen on road signs and is spoken fluently by a small minority of people.

===Cornish language===

[[File:Penzansagasdynerghcrop.jpeg|right|thumb|A [[welcome sign]] to [[Penzance]], in the English and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] languages]]
{{Main|Cornish language}}
The Cornish language is closely related to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Breton language|Breton]], and less so to [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]. The language continued to function as a community language in parts of Cornwall until the late 18th century, and there has been a revival of the language since [[Henry Jenner]]'s ''&quot;Handbook of the Cornish Language&quot;'' was published in 1904. A study in 2000 suggested that there were  around 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gosw.gov.uk/gosw/docs/254795/mode_of_use.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Cornish however had no legal status in the UK until 2002. Nevertheless, the language is taught in about twelve primary schools, and occasionally used in religious and civic ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Cornish in United Kingdom  | publisher = European Commission | url = http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/euromosaic/uk1_en.html  | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Cornish was officially recognised as a UK minority language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2410383.stm |title=November 2002 - Cornish gains official recognition |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-11-06 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 it received limited Government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/4092664.stm |title=June 2005 - Cash boost for Cornish language |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Standard Written Form]] was agreed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kernowek.net/Specification_Final_Version.pdf |title=An Outline of the Standard Written Form of Cornish |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Cornish mining words are still in use in English language mining terminology, such as [[costean]], [[gunnies]], [[vug]],&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms'' by American Geological Institute and U S Bureau of Mines (pages 128, 249, and 613)&lt;/ref&gt; kibbal, [[gossan]], [[keeve|kieve]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

[[File:Sphere With Inner Form.jpg|thumb|Artwork in the [[Barbara Hepworth]] Museum in St Ives]]
Since the 19th century, Cornwall, with its unspoilt maritime scenery and strong light, has sustained a vibrant visual art scene of international renown. Artistic activity within Cornwall was initially centred on the art-colony of [[Newlyn]], most active at the turn of the 20th century. This [[Newlyn School]] is associated with the names: [[Stanhope Forbes]], Elizabeth Forbes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Elizabeth Adela Forbes | publisher=PenleeHouse.org.uk | url=http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/artists/elizabeth-forbes.htm | accessdate=2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Garstin]] and [[Lamorna Birch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Samuel John Lamorna Birch | publisher= HayleGallery.co.uk | url=http://www.haylegallery.co.uk/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=59 | accessdate=2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist writers such as [[D.

===Music and festivals===
{{Main|Music of Cornwall}}
Cornwall has a rich and vibrant [[folk music]] tradition which has survived into the present and is well-known for its unusual folk survivals such as [[Mummers Play]]s, the [[Furry Dance]] in [[Helston]] played by the famous [[Helston Town Band]], and [[Obby Oss]] in [[Padstow]].

As in other former mining districts of Britain, male voice choirs and [[Brass band (British style)|Brass Band]]s, e.g. ''Brass on the Grass'' concerts during the summer at [[Constantine, Kerrier|Constantine]], are still very popular in Cornwall: Cornwall also has around 40 brass bands, including the six-times National Champions of Great Britain, Camborne Youth Band, and the bands of Lanner and St Dennis.

Cornish players are regular participants in inter-Celtic festivals, and Cornwall itself has several lively inter-Celtic festivals such as [[Perranporth]]'s Lowender Peran folk festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.an-daras.com |title=An-Daras.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more modern note, contemporary musician [[Aphex Twin|Richard D. James]] (also known as Aphex Twin) grew up in Cornwall, as did [[Luke Vibert]] and [[Alex Parks]] winner of [[Fame Academy]] 2003. [[Roger Taylor (Queen)|Roger Taylor]], the drummer from the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] was also raised in the county, and currently lives not far from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. The American singer/songwriter [[Tori Amos]] now resides predominantly in North Cornwall not far from Bude with her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/The-whole-Tori/2005/05/05/1115092621001.html |title=The whole Tori - Music - Entertainment |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2005-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-25 | location=Melbourne | first=Guy | last=Blackman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
====Fiction====
[[Arthur Quiller-Couch|Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch]] author of many novels and works of literary criticism lived in Fowey: his novels are mainly set in Cornwall. [[Daphne du Maurier]] lived at [[Menabilly]] near Fowey and many of her novels had Cornish settings, including ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'', ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]'', ''[[Frenchman's Creek (novel)|Frenchman's Creek]]'', ''[[My Cousin Rachel]]'', and ''[[The House on the Strand]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Daphne du Maurier  | publisher = DuMaurier.org| url = http://www.DuMaurier.org/  | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also noted for writing ''Vanishing Cornwall''. Cornwall provided the inspiration for &quot;[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]&quot;, one of her terrifying series of short stories, made famous as a film by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The Birds | publisher = MovieDiva.com| url = http://www.moviediva.com/MD_root/reviewpages/MDBirds.htm  | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:RemainsofTintagel.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of [[Tintagel Castle]], legendary birthplace of mythical [[King Arthur]]]]

Medieval Cornwall is the setting of the trilogy by [[Monica Furlong]], ''Wise Child'', ''Juniper'', and ''Colman'', as well as part of Charles Kingsley's ''[[Hereward the Wake]]''.

[[Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Adventure of the Devil's Foot]]'' featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]] is set in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The Adventure of the Devil's Foot | publisher = WorldwideSchool.org| url = http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/detective/TheAdventureoftheDevilsFoot/Chap1.html | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Graham]]'s series ''[[Poldark]]'', [[Kate Tremayne]]'s [[Adam Loveday]] series, [[Susan Cooper]]'s novels ''[[Over Sea, Under Stone]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Over Sea, Under Stone | publisher = Powell's Books| url = http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780689840357 | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Greenwitch'', and [[Mary Wesley]]'s ''[[The Camomile Lawn]]'' are all set in Cornwall. Writing under the [[pseudonym]] of Alexander Kent, [[Douglas Reeman]] sets parts of his [[Richard Bolitho]] and Adam Bolitho series in the Cornwall of the late 18th and the early 19th centuries, particularly in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]].

[[Hammond Innes]]'s novel, ''The Killer Mine'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The Killer Mine | publisher = BoekBesprekingen.nl| url = http://www.boekbesprekingen.nl/cgi-bin/boek.cgi?boek=588391  | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles de Lint]]'s novel ''The Little Country'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The Little Country | publisher = Amazon.com| url = http://www.amazon.com/Little-Country-Charles-Lint/dp/0312876491  | accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chapters 24 and 25 of [[J.

H. Lawrence]] spent a short time living in Cornwall. [[Rosamunde Pilcher]] grew up in Cornwall, and several of her books take place there.

====Poetry====
[[Image:ForTheFallenPlaqueCornwall.jpg|thumb|'For The Fallen' plaque with [[The Rumps]] promontory beyond]]
The late [[Poet Laureate]] [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]] was famously fond of Cornwall and it featured prominently in his poetry. He is buried in the churchyard at [[St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =St Enodoc Church| publisher = RockInfo.co.uk| url = http://www.rockinfo.co.uk/daymer/stenochc.html| accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Charles Causley]], the poet, was born in Launceston and is perhaps the best known of Cornish poets. [[Jack Clemo]] and the scholar [[A. L. Rowse]] were also notable Cornishmen known for their poetry; The Rev. R. S. Hawker of Morwenstow wrote some poetry which was very popular in the Victorian period. The Scottish poet [[W. S. Graham]] lived in West Cornwall from 1944 until his death in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =William Sydney Graham | publisher = CPRW.com| url = http://www.cprw.com/Drexel/graham.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Laurence Binyon]] wrote &quot;For the Fallen&quot; (first published in 1914) while sitting on the cliffs between [[Pentire Point]] and The Rumps and a stone plaque was erected in 2001 to commemorate the fact. The plaque bears the inscription &quot;FOR THE FALLEN / Composed on these cliffs, 1914&quot;. The plaque also bears below this the fourth stanza (sometimes referred to as [[Ode of Remembrance|&quot;The Ode&quot;]]) of the poem:
:''They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old''
:''Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn''&lt;!-- &quot;Condemn&quot; is in fact the correct word. See the talk page for more. --&gt;
:''At the going down of the sun and in the morning''
:''We will remember them''

====Other literary works====
Cornwall produced a substantial number of [[passion play]]s such as the [[Ordinalia]] during the Middle Ages. Many are still extant, and provide valuable information about the Cornish language. See also [[Cornish literature]]

Prolific writer [[Colin Wilson]], best known for his debut work ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'' (1956) and for ''[[The Mind Parasites]]'' (1967), lives in [[Gorran Haven]], a little village on the southern Cornish coast, not far from [[Mevagissey]] and [[St Austell]]. [[A. L. Rowse]], the historian and poet, was born near St Austell. The writer [[D. M. Thomas]] was born in Redruth but lived and worked in Australia and the United States before returning to his native Cornwall. He has written novels, poetry, and other works, including translations from Russian.

[[Thomas Hardy]]'s drama ''The Queen of Cornwall'' (1923) is a version of the Tristan story; the second act of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' takes place in Cornwall, as do [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s operettas ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[Ruddigore]]''. A level of ''[[Tomb Raider: Legend]]'', a game dealing with Arthurian Legend, takes place in Cornwall at a tacky museum above King Arthur's tomb.

The fairy tale [[Jack the Giant Killer]] takes place in Cornwall.

===Sports and games===
{{Main|Sport in Cornwall}}
[[Image:Gerry and Ashley Cawley.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Cornish wrestling]]]]
With its comparatively small, and largely rural population, major contribution by the Cornish to national [[sport in the United Kingdom]] has been limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clegg10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clegg|2005|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no teams affiliated to the [[Cornwall County Football Association]] that play in [[the Football League]] of [[England and Wales]], and the [[Cornwall County Cricket Club]] plays as one of the [[minor counties of English cricket]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clegg10&quot;/&gt; Viewed as an &quot;important identifier of ethnic affiliation&quot;, [[rugby union]] has become a sport strongly tied to notions of Cornishness,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harv221&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harvey|2002|p=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and since the 20th century, [[rugby union in Cornwall]] has emerged as one of,the most popular spectator and team sports in Cornwall (perhaps the most popular), with professional Cornish rugby footballers being described as a &quot;formidable force&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Clegg10&quot;/&gt; &quot;naturally independent, both in thought and deed, yet paradoxically staunch English patriots whose top players have represented England with pride and passion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CornishRug&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/3247717/Cornish-rugby-union-celebrate-125-years-of-pride-and-passion---but-are-they-the-lost-tribe-Rugby.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|title=Cornish rugby union celebrate 125 years of pride and passion--but are they the lost tribe?|first=Brendan|last=Gallagher|date=23&amp;nbsp;October 2008|accessdate=2009-09-07 | location=London|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, sports journalist [[Alan Gibson]] made a direct connection between love of rugby in Cornwall and the ancient parish games of hurling and wrestling that existed for centuries before rugby officially began.&lt;ref name=&quot;CornishRug&quot;/&gt; Among Cornwall's native sports are a distinctive form of Celtic wrestling related to [[Brittany|Breton]] wrestling, and [[Hurling the Silver Ball|Cornish hurling]], a kind of mediaeval [[football]] played with a silver ball (distinct from [[Hurling|Irish Hurling]]). [[Cornish Wrestling]] is Cornwall's oldest sport and as Cornwall's native tradition it has travelled the world to places like [[Victoria, Australia]] and [[Grass Valley, California]] following the miners and [[gold rushes]]. Cornish hurling now takes place at [[St. Columb Major]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], and less frequently at [[Bodmin]].&lt;ref&gt;The Bodmin hurl is held whenever the ceremony of [[beating the bounds]] takes place: each occasion must be five years or more after the last one.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surfing and other water sports====

[[Image:GwithianSurfing.jpg|thumb|right|Cornwall's north coast is known as a centre for [[surfing]]]]
Due to its long coastline, various maritime sports are popular in Cornwall, notably [[sailing]] and [[surfing]]. International events in both are held in Cornwall. Cornwall hosted the Inter-Celtic [[Watersports]] Festival in 2006. Surfing in particular is very popular, as locations such as [[Bude]] and [[Newquay]] offer some of the best surf in the UK. [[Cornish pilot gig|Pilot gig]] rowing has been popular for many years and the World championships takes place annually on the [[Isles of Scilly]]. On September 2, 2007, 300 surfers arrived at [[Polzeath]] beach, Cornwall to set a new world record for the highest number of surfers riding the same wave (as part of the Global Surf Challenge and part of a project called Earthwave to raise awareness about [[global warming]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6974667.stm |title=BBC NEWS, Surfers aim to break world record |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indoor games====
[[Euchre]] (also known as [[Five hundred]]) is a popular [[card game]] in Cornwall, it is normally a game for four players consisting of two teams. Its origins are unclear but some claim it is a Cornish game. There are several leagues in Cornwall at present. Whist and pub quizzes are also popular.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cornish cuisine}}
[[Image:Cornish pasty - cut.jpeg|thumb|right|A [[Pasty|Cornish Pasty]]]]
Cornwall has a strong culinary heritage. Surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds, Cornwall naturally has fresh seafood readily available; [[Newlyn]] is the largest fishing port in the UK by value of fish landed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.objectiveone.com/client/media/media-611.htm |title=Objective One media release |publisher=Objectiveone.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television chef [[Rick Stein]] has long operated a fish restaurant in [[Padstow]] for this reason, and [[Jamie Oliver]] recently chose to open his second restaurant, [[Fifteen (restaurant)|Fifteen]], in [[Watergate Bay]] near [[Newquay]]. [[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]] host and founder of Smiths of Smithfield, [[John Torode]], in 2007 purchased Seiners in [[Perranporth]]. One famous local fish dish is [[Stargazy pie]], a fish-based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust, as though &quot;star-gazing&quot;. The pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for [[Tom Bawcock's Eve]], but is not generally eaten at any other time.

Cornwall is perhaps best known though for its [[pasty|pasties]], a savoury dish made with [[pastry]]. Today's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak, onion, potato and [[Rutabaga|swede]] with salt and white pepper, but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings. &quot;Turmut, 'tates and mate&quot; (i.e. Turnip, potatoes and meat) describes a filling once very common. For instance, the licky pasty contained mostly leeks, and the herb pasty contained watercress, parsley, and shallots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alanrichards.org/cornish3.htm |title=Cornish recipe site |publisher=Alanrichards.org |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasties are often locally referred to as ''oggies''. Historically, pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam, apple and blackberry, plums or cherries.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{Cite book| last=Martin | first=Edith | title=Cornish Recipes, Ancient &amp; Modern. 22nd edition, 1965|year=1929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The wet climate and relatively poor soil of Cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops. However, it is ideal for growing the rich grass required for dairying, leading to the production of Cornwall's other famous export, [[clotted cream]]. This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish [[fudge]] and Cornish [[ice cream]]. Cornish clotted cream is protected under [[British Protected designation of origin|EU law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/qual/en/uk_en.htm |title=Official list of British protected foods |publisher=Europa.eu.int |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be made anywhere else. Its principal manufacturer is Rodda's, based at [[Scorrier]].

Local cakes and desserts include [[Saffron bun|Saffron cake]], [[Heavy cake|Cornish heavy (''hevva'') cake]], [[Cornish fairings]] biscuits, figgy 'obbin, scones (often served with jam and clotted cream) and whortleberry pie.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith.

M. Dent&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many types of [[beer]]s brewed in Cornwall&amp;nbsp;– those produced by [[Sharp's Brewery]], [[Skinner's Brewery]] and [[St Austell Brewery]] are the best-known – including [[stout]]s, [[ale]]s and other beer types. There is some small scale production of [[wine]], [[mead]] and [[cider]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Monarchism |expanded=Varieties}}{{Forms of government}}
'''Constitutional monarchy''' (or '''limited monarchy''') is a form of [[government]] in which a [[monarch]] acts as [[head of state]] within the parameters of a [[constitution]], whether it be a written, [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]] or blended constitution. This form of government differs from [[absolute monarchy]] in which an absolute monarch serves as the sole source of political power in the state and is not legally bound by any constitution.

Most constitutional monarchies employ a [[parliamentary system]] in which the monarch may have strictly ceremonial duties or may have reserve powers, depending on the constitution. Under most modern constitutional monarchies there is also a [[prime minister]] who is the head of government and exercises effective political power.

In the past, constitutional monarchy has co-existed with [[Fascism|fascist]] and quasi-fascist regimes{{ndash}}such as [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Francoist Spain]]{{ndash}}and with [[military dictatorship]]s.  However on other occasions constitutional monarchs have played a crucial role in thwarting ''coups d'état'' and the overthrow of democratic institutions by fascist or communist movements. Examples include the attempted [[23-F]] coup in Spain in 1981, and the 1981 and 1985 coup attempts in Thailand. In both cases action taken by the king proved decisive.

Contemporary constitutional monarchies include [[Australia]], [[The Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belgium]], [[Belize]], [[Bhutan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Cambodia]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lesotho]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malaysia]], [[Monaco]], [[Morocco]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Thailand]], [[Tuvalu]],  and the [[United Kingdom]].

There also exist today several [[federal constitutional monarchies]]. In these countries, each subdivision has a distinct government and head of government, but all subdivisions share a monarch who is head of state of the federation as a united whole. The latest country that was completely transformed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional democratic monarchy is [[Bhutan]].

==Constitutional and absolute monarchy==
===Constitutional monarchy in the European tradition===
In Britain, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], although limits on the power of the monarch ('A Limited Monarchy') are much older than that (see [[Magna Carta]]).  Today the monarchy in Britain is politically neutral and by convention the role is largely ceremonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/HowtheMonarchyworks/Whatisconstitutionalmonarchy.aspx| accessdate=11 March 2010| title=What is constitutional monarchy?| publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; No person may accept significant public office without swearing an [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath of allegiance to the Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-116.pdf RESEARCH PAPER 01/116]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional monarchy occurred in continental Europe after the [[French revolution]]. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] is considered the first monarch proclaiming ''himself'' as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. G.W.F. [[Hegel]], in his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1820), gave it a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the Protestant Christian view of natural law. Hegel's forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan. His forecast of the form of government suitable to the modern world may be seen as prophetic: the largely ceremonial offices of president in some modern parliamentary democracies in Europe and e.g. Israel can be perceived as elected or appointed versions of Hegel's constitutional monarch; the Russian and French presidents, with their stronger powers, may also be regarded in Hegelian terms as wielding powers suitable to the embodiment of the national will.

===Modern constitutional monarchy===
As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was quite a powerful figure, head of the [[executive branch]] even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the US Constitution may have conceived of the president as being an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was understood in their time, following [[Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] account of the separation of powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Baron de Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws''.  Legal Classics Library, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present concept of constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where it was the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the [[prime minister]], who had become those who exercised power, with the monarchs voluntarily ceding it and contenting themselves with the titular position.  In many cases even the monarchs themselves, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of &quot;servants of the people&quot; to reflect the new, egalitarian view. In the course of [[France]]'s [[July Monarchy]], [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis-Philippe I]] was styled &quot;King of the French&quot; rather than &quot;King of France&quot;.

Following the [[Unification of Germany]], [[Otto von Bismarck]] rejected the British model. In the kind of constitutional monarchy established under the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] which Bismarck inspired, the [[Kaiser]] retained considerable actual executive power, and the [[Reichskanzler|Prime Minister]] needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However, this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germany's defeat in the [[First World War]]. Later on, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] could also be considered as a &quot;constitutional monarchy&quot; of a kind, in the sense that there was a [[King of Italy|king]] as the titular head of state while actual power was held by [[Benito Mussolini]] under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.

In present terms, the difference between a [[parliamentary democracy]] that is a constitutional monarchy and one that is a [[republic]] is considered more one of detail than of substance. In both cases, the titular head of state - monarch or president - serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the actual governing is carried out by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]. In some cases, constitutional monarchies have been dubbed &quot;[[crowned republic]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Boyce| first=Peter| title=The Queen's Other Realms| publisher=Federation Press| date=2008| location=Annandale| page=1| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=kY-Tk0-quyoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn=9781862877009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today constitutional monarchies are mostly associated with [[Western European]] countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Sweden]]. However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia: Japan and Thailand. In such cases it is the [[prime minister]] who holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the King or Queen (or other monarch, such as a Grand Duke, in the case of Luxembourg, or Prince in the case of Monaco and Liechtenstein) retains only residual (but not always minor) powers.  The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In the Netherlands, Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a [[coalition government]] following a parliamentary election, while in [[Norway]] the King chairs special meetings of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].

In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] to act on the advice of the Cabinet.  Only a few monarchies (most notably [[Japan]] and [[Sweden]]) have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.

The most significant family of constitutional monarchies in the world today are the sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s under [[Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/QueenandCommonwealth/WhatisaCommonwealthRealm.aspx|title=Website of the British Monarchy: What is a Commonwealth realm?|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant &quot;reserve&quot; or &quot;prerogative&quot; powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor General exercising his power was during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], when the Australian Prime Minister of the time, [[Gough Whitlam]], was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's budget by refusing to pass the associated appropriation bills. On 11 November 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he went to seek the Governor-General's approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition [[Malcolm Fraser]] in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a [[double dissolution]] election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlam's supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-General's reserve powers was appropriate, and whether [[Republicanism in Australia|Australia should become a republic]]. Among supporters of constitutional monarchy however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by their respective constitutions, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.

In Thailand's constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The current King, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], is the longest reigning current monarch in the world and in all of Thailand's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;longestthai&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1996 |url=http://www.worldhop.com/Journals/J5/ROYAL.HTM |title=A Royal Occasion speeches |publisher=Worldhop.com Journal |accessdate=2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhumibol has reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He has played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents. (See Bhumibol's role in [[Bhumibol_Adulyadej#Role_in_Thai_politics|Thai Politics]].) While the monarch retains some powers from the constitution, most particular is [[Lèse majesté]] which protects the image and ability of the monarch to play a role in politics and carries modest criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people are reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence comes from that and the fact that the royal family is often involved in socio-economic improvement efforts.

In both the United Kingdom and elsewhere, a common debate centres around when it is appropriate for a monarch to use his or her political powers. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favour of a [[partisan (political)|partisan]] goal, while some [[political scientist]]s champion the idea of an &quot;interventionist monarch&quot; as a check against possible illegal action by politicians.

The title of Belgian kings is not ''King of Belgium'', but instead ''King of the Belgians''. Another unique feature of the Belgian system is that the new monarch does not automatically assume the throne at the death or abdication of his predecessor; he only becomes monarch upon taking a constitutional oath.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former monarchies==
* The [[History of China#Imperial era|Chinese Empire]] - last Imperial Chinese rule was by the [[Qing Dynasty]] 清朝 1644–1912 - During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with Chinese culture. However, its military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international pressure, massive rebellions and defeats in wars, the Qing Dynasty declined after the mid-19th century. The Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the Xinhai Revolution, when the Empress Dowager Longyu abdicated on behalf of the last emperor, Puyi, on February 12, 1912.
* The [[Korean Empire]] (Korean: 대한제국, Hanja: 大韓帝國) from 1897 to 1910 - was an empire of [[Korea]] that succeeded the [[Joseon Dynasty]] that ruled the nation over the past 500 years. On August 22, 1910, the Korean Empire was annexed by [[Japan]] with the [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty]], beginning a 35-year period of [[Korea under Japanese rule]]. Prior to the Korean Empire, several dynastic rulers of Goguryeo, Silla, Baekje, Balhae and Goryeo claimed the right to imperial status and used imperial titles at one time or another.
* [[British America]] was ruled by the monarchy of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] from 1607 until the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, when the secession of the thirteen original British colonies on the continent was accepted.  The other British North American colonies retained the [[British Crown]] as their head of state, and subsequently achieved self-rule as [[Canada]].
* The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], formed after the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 and lasting until the final partition of the state in 1795, operated much like many modern European constitutional monarchies (into which it was officially changed by the establishment of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], which historian [[Norman Davies]] calls &quot;the first constitution of its kind in Europe&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA699 |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=Europe: A History |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=699 |isbn=0198201710}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The legislators of the unified state truly did not see it as a monarchy at all, but as ''a republic under the presidency of the King''. Poland-Lithuania also followed the principle of &quot;Rex regnat et non gubernat&quot;, had a bicameral parliament, and a collection of entrenched legal documents amounting to a constitution along the lines of the modern [[United Kingdom]]. The King was elected, and had the duty of maintaining the people's rights.
* The [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]] was a brief period in the [[history of Corsica]] (1794–1796) when the island broke with [[Revolutionary France]] and sought military protection from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Corsica became an independent kingdom under [[George III]] of England, but with its own elected parliament and a written constitution guaranteeing local autonomy and democratic rights.
* [[France]], several times during the 19th century. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon Bonaparte]] proclaimed himself Emperor of the French in what was ostensibly a constitutional monarchy, though modern historians often class his reign as a military dictatorship. The [[Bourbon Restoration]] (under [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]), the [[July Monarchy]] (under [[Louis-Philippe]]), and the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] (under [[Napoleon III]]) were also constitutional monarchies, although the power of the monarch varied considerably between them.
* The [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1918, (as well as earlier confederations, and the monarchies it consisted of) was also a constitutional monarchy—see [[Constitution of the German Empire]].
* Prior to the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, [[Iran]] was a constitutional monarchy under [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]], which had been originally established during the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] in 1906.
* [[Portugal]] until 1910 when [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]] was overthrown by a military coup.
* [[Kingdom of Serbia]], until 1918, when it merged with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs into the unitary Yugoslav Kingdom, that was led by the Serbian dynasty of [[Karadjordjevic]]
* [[Mexico]] was twice an [[Mexican Empire|Empire]]. First from July 21, 1822, to March 19, 1823, with [[Agustín de Iturbide]] serving as emperor. Then, with the help of the Austrian and Spanish crowns, [[Napoleon III of France]] installed [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] as Emperor of Mexico. This attempt to create a European-style monarchy lasted three years, from 1864 to 1867.
* [[Brazil]] from 1815 (United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves) until 1822, with the proclamation of independence and rise of the [[Empire of Brazil]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. The empire ended in 1889, when [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was deposed by a military coup.
* [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] was a constitutional monarchy from the unification of the smaller independent chiefdoms of O{{okina}}ahu, Maui, Moloka{{okina}}i, Lāna{{okina}}i, and the Hawai{{okina}}i (or the &quot;Big Island&quot;) in 1810 until the overthrow of [[Liliuokalani of Hawaii|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] in 1893 by conspirators from United States.
* The [[Grand Principality of Finland]] was a constitutional monarchy though its ruler, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], was simultaneously an [[Autocracy|autocrat]] and [[Absolute monarchy|absolute ruler]] in [[Russia]].
* The [[Kingdom of Laos]] was a constitutional monarchy until 1975, when [[Savang Vatthana|Sisavang Vatthana]] was forced to abdicate by the communist, the [[Pathet Lao]].
* The [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  In 1848–1849 and 1867–1918 as part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In the interwar period (1920–1944) [[Hungary]] remained a constitutional monarchy without a reigning monarch.
* [[Montenegro]] until 1918 when it merged with [[Serbia]] and other areas to form [[Yugoslavia]].
* [[Yugoslavia]] until 1945 when [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was deposed by the communist government.
* [[Kingdom of Romania]] until 1947 when [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] was forced to abdicate at gunpoint by the communists.
* [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] until 1946 when [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Tsar Simeon]] was deposed by the communist assembly.
* [[Greece]] until 1967 when [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] was deposed by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|military government]]. The decision was formalised by a [[Greek plebiscite, 1974|plebiscite]] in 05/04/1974.
* [[Italy]] until June 2, 1946, when a referendum proclaimed the end of the Kingdom and the begin of the Republic.
* Many [[Commonwealth republic]]s were constitutional monarchies for some period after their independence.
*[[Nepal]] until May 28, 2008, when [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]] was deposed, and the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal was declared.
*[[Iceland]] The Act of Union, a 1 December 1918 agreement with Denmark, established Iceland as a sovereign kingdom united with Denmark under a common king. Iceland abolished the monarchy and became a republic on 17 June 1944 after the Icelandic constitutional referendum, 24 May 1944.

==Other situations==
* [[Andorra]] and [[San Marino]] are the only countries where the head of state is vested jointly in two individuals: co-princes (Bishop of Urgell, President of France) and the [[Captains Regent]], respectively.
* [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]] and [[Liechtenstein]] are the only countries with a reigning [[Prince]].
* [[Japan]] is the only country with a reigning [[Emperor]].
* [[Luxembourg]] is the only country with a reigning [[Grand Duke]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clarke's Three Laws''' are three [[adage|&quot;laws&quot;]] of prediction formulated by the British writer and scientist [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. They are:

# {{Anchor|Clarke's first law}}When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right.  When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
# {{Anchor|Clarke's second law}}The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
# {{Anchor|Clarke's third law}}Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

== Origins ==

The first of the three laws, previously termed Clarke's Law, was proposed by Arthur C. Clarke in the essay &quot;Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination&quot;, in ''[[Profiles of the Future]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'&quot; in the collection ''[[Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible]]'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay; its status as Clarke's Second Law was conferred on it by others.

In a 1973 revision of his compendium of essays, ''Profiles of the Future'', Clarke acknowledged the Second Law and proposed the Third in order to round out the number, adding &quot;As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there&quot;. Of the three, the Third Law is the best known and most widely cited.  It may be an echo of a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: &quot;Witchcraft to the ignorant, .... Simple science to the learned&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Sorcerer of Rhiannon&quot;, ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in [[Wild Talents]] by author [[Charles Fort]] where he makes the statement: &quot;...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic.&quot;

Clarke's Third Law codifies perhaps the most significant of Clarke's unique contributions to [[speculative fiction]]. A model to other writers of [[hard science fiction]], Clarke postulates advanced technologies without resorting to flawed engineering concepts (as [[Jules Verne]] sometimes did) or explanations grounded in incorrect science or engineering (a hallmark of &quot;bad&quot; science fiction)&lt;sup&gt;Not NPOV, [[needs citation]]&lt;/sup&gt;, or taking cues from trends in research and engineering (which dates some of [[Larry Niven]]'s novels). Accordingly, the powers of any future [[superintelligence]] or hyperintelligence which Clarke often described would seem astonishing.

In novels such as ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' and the story &quot;[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]&quot; (upon which ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was based) Clarke  presents   ultra-advanced technologies developed by [[hyperintelligence]]s limited only by fundamental science. In ''[[Against the Fall of Night]]'' the human race has mysteriously regressed after a full billion years of civilization. Humanity is faced with the remnants of its past glories: for example, a network of roads and sidewalks that flow like rivers. Although physically possible, it is inexplicable from their perspective.

== References in other works ==

Clarke's laws, especially the third, have been mentioned or alluded to numerous times in literature.  Sometimes they  provide corollaries to one or more of the laws.  Often, these are parodies solely for humor value, but sometimes they offer interesting applications or perspectives.

* [[Isaac Asimov]] wrote a corollary to Clarke's First Law, stating: &quot;When, however, the lay public rallies round an idea that is denounced by distinguished but elderly scientists and supports that idea with great fervor and emotion -- the distinguished but elderly scientists are then, after all, probably right&quot;.
* [[Larry Niven]], in discussing [[fantasy]], wrote that [[Niven's laws#Others|&quot;any sufficiently rigorously defined magic is indistinguishable from technology&quot;]]. This is the converse to Clarke's Third Law, sometimes known as &quot;Niven's Law&quot; although it is not to be confused with the list of &quot;[[Niven's laws]]&quot;. [[Mercedes Lackey]] has been quoted with the same corollary.
* [[Terry Pratchett]] refers to Niven's inversion of the third law in his ''[[Discworld]]'' books by having wizard [[Ponder Stibbons]] state that &quot;Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology&quot;. Pratchett also alludes to the second law in another ''Discworld'' work, ''[[The Last Hero]]'': [[Technology of the Discworld#Leonard of Quirm|Leonard of Quirm]] is working on the Discworld's first (non-magical) flying machine, and states that he has no use for artisans who have &quot;learned the limits of the possible&quot;.
* In the first non-Asimov ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' novel, ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'', the emperor declares, &quot;If technology is distinguishable from magic, it is insufficiently advanced&quot;. This is a paraphrase of Gehm's Corollary to Clarke's Third Law, &quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced&quot;.
* In the [[Doctor Who]] episode &quot;[[Battlefield (Doctor Who)|Battlefield]]&quot; the Doctor also mentions the third law. 
* In the [[Torchwood]] book ''Trace Memory'', Jack mentions Clarke's Third Law many times, until Tosh looks it up on the internet.
* The [[Jargon file]] mentions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netsoc.tcd.ie/~inky/jargon/html/M/magic.html Jargon file entry defining &quot;magic&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; a corollary (often attributed to [[Gregory Benford]]) to Clarke's Third law: &quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced.&quot;
* In the Simpsons episode &quot;[[Future-Drama]]&quot;, Marge claims that the technology is so advanced that the &quot;[[technomancy|scientists invented magic]]&quot;.
* In the movie ''[[Superman Returns]]'', [[Lex Luthor]] says that &quot;To the primitive mind, any sufficiently advanced technology would be indistinguishable from magic&quot;.
* In the movie ''[[The Box (2009 film)|The Box]]'', Clarke's laws are mentioned throughout.
* In the comic book [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the movie [[Thor (film)|of the same name]], the Norse gods are depicted as super-advanced aliens with technological powers indistinguishable from magic. In the movie, Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgård's characters have a small conversation concerning Clarke's third law.
* In the comic book ''[[Mass Effect: Evolution]]'', Eva tells Jack Harper to remember Clarke's third Law. Jack states the law: &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is always going to look like magic&quot;. But than he adds that some of the things they are going after might actually be magic.
* In the Jasper Fforde book ''[[One of Our Thursdays Is Missing]]'' (2011) he writes about Clarke's Second Law of Egodynamics: &quot;For every expert there is an equal and opposite expert.&quot; Chapter 17 The Council of Genres.
* In the Fringe episode &quot;Johari Window&quot;, Walter reveals to Astrid the apparent transformation of a mutated moth into a beautiful butterfly and quotes &quot;a friend of [his]&quot; and repeats the Third Law.

'''Caspar David Friedrich''' (September 5, 1774 – May 7, 1840) was a 19th-century [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-65&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|1980|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his mid-period [[allegorical]] landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-[[Classicism|classical]] work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs &quot;the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Murray|2004| p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich was born in the [[Swedish Pomerania]]n town of [[Greifswald]], where he began his studies in art as a youth. He studied in [[Copenhagen]] until 1798, before settling in [[Dresden]]. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of [[spirituality]]. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, [[J.M.W. Turner]] (1775–1851) and [[John Constable]] (1776–1837) sought to depict nature as a &quot;divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;v04-7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich’s work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor [[Pierre Jean David|David d'Angers]] (1788–1856) spoke of him as a man who had discovered &quot;the tragedy of landscape&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;During an 1834 visit to Dresden; quoted in {{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity, and in the words of the art historian Philip Miller, &quot;half mad&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anxiety&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Miller|first=Philip B.|date=Spring 1974|title=Anxiety and Abstraction: Kleist and Brentano on Caspar David Friedrich|journal=[[The Art Journal|Art Journal]]|volume=33|issue=3|pages=205–210|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/775783|doi=10.2307/775783}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich’s contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his paintings and sculptures in Berlin. By the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the [[Expressionist]]s, and in the 1930s and early 1940s [[Surrealist]]s and [[Existentialist]]s frequently drew ideas from his work. The rise of [[Nazism]] in the early 1930s again saw a resurgence in Friedrich's popularity, but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were, by association with the Nazi movement,  misinterpreted as having a [[nationalist]]ic aspect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahn&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Forster-Hahn|first=Françoise|date=March 1976|title=Recent Scholarship on Caspar David Friedrich|journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=58|issue=1|pages=113–116|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3049469|doi=10.2307/3049469}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1970s that Friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of the German Romantic movement and a painter of international importance.

==Life==
===Early years and family===

Caspar David Friedrich was born on September 5, 1774, in [[Greifswald]], [[Swedish Pomerania]], on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Pomerania had been divided between Sweden and [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] since 1648, and at the time of Caspar David's birth, it was still part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Napoleon]] occupied the territory in 1806, and in 1815 all of Pomerania passed to  [[Prussia]]n sovereignty. {{Harvnb|Johnston|Leppien|Monrad|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sixth of ten children, he was brought up in  the strict [[Lutheran]] creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich, a  [[History of candle making|candle-maker]] and soap boiler.&lt;ref name=&quot;v04-7&quot;/&gt; Records of the family's financial circumstances are contradictory; while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored, others record that they were raised in relative poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolf, 17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caspar David was familiar with death from an early age. His mother, Sophie Dorothea Bechly, died in 1781 when he was just seven.&lt;ref&gt;The family was subsequently raised by their housekeeper and nurse, &quot;Mutter Heide&quot;, who had a warm relationship with all of the Friedrich children.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, his sister Elisabeth died,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a second sister, Maria, succumbed to [[typhus fever|typhus]] in 1791.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolf, 17&quot;/&gt; Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood was the 1787 death of his brother Johann Christoffer: at the age of thirteen, Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake and drown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David, who was also in danger on the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1990|p=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Caspardavidfriedrich self1.jpg|upright|thumb|The chalk drawing ''Self-portrait'', 1800, which portrays the artist at 26 was completed while he was studying at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen. [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Royal Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kent | first = Neil | title = Soul of the North: a Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700-1940 | publisher = Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-86189-067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Friedrich began his formal study of art in 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the [[University of Greifswald]]. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS12&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|Leppien|Monrad|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian [[Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten]], who taught that nature was a revelation of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS12&quot; /&gt; Quistorp introduced Friedrich to the work of the German 17th-century artist [[Adam Elsheimer]], whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period he also studied literature and [[aesthetics]] with Swedish professor [[Thomas Thorild]]. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Copenhagen]], where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Royal Picture Gallery’s]] collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as [[Christian August Lorentzen]] and the landscape painter [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]]. These artists were inspired by the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning [[Neoclassicism#In architecture and in the decorative and visual arts|neo-classical]] ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of [[Edda]], the poems of [[Ossian]] and [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich settled permanently in Dresden in 1798. During this early period, he experimented in [[printmaking]] with [[etching]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designs for [[woodcut]]s which his furniture-maker brother cut. By 1804 he had produced 18 etchings and four woodcuts; they were apparently made in small numbers and only distributed to friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffiths|Carey|1994|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these forays into other media, he gravitated toward working primarily with [[India ink|ink]], [[watercolour]] and [[sepia (color)|sepia]]s. With the exception of a few early pieces, such as ''[[commons:Image:LandscapewithTempleinRuin1797.jpg|Landscape with Temple in Ruins]]'' (1797), he did not work extensively with [[oil painting|oils]] until his reputation was more established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landscapes were his preferred subject, inspired by frequent trips, beginning in 1801, to the [[Baltic coast]], [[Bohemia]], the [[Riesen Mountains|Riesen]] and the [[Harz Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;j45&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|Leppien|Monrad|1999|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly based on the landscapes of northern Germany, his paintings depict woods, hills, harbors, morning mists and other light effects based on a close observation of nature. These works were modeled on sketches and studies of scenic spots, such as the cliffs on [[Rügen]], the surroundings of Dresden and the river [[Elbe]]. He executed his studies almost exclusively in pencil, even providing topographical information, yet the subtle atmospheric effects characteristic of Friedrich's mid-period paintings were rendered from memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|Leppien|Monrad|1999|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects took their strength from the depiction of light, and of the illumination of sun and moon on clouds and water: optical phenomena peculiar to the Baltic coast that had never before been painted with such an emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|Leppien|Monrad|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Dresden===
Friedrich established his reputation as an artist when he won a prize in 1805 at the [[Weimar]] competition organised by the writer, poet, and dramatist [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. At the time, the Weimar competition tended to draw mediocre and now long-forgotten artists presenting derivative mixtures of neo-classical and pseudo-Greek styles. The poor quality of the entries began to prove damaging to Goethe's reputation, so when Friedrich entered two sepia drawings—''Procession at Dawn'' and ''Fisher-Folk by the Sea''—the poet responded enthusiastically and wrote, &quot;We must praise the artist's resourcefulness in this picture fairly. The drawing is well done, the procession is ingenious and appropriate... his treatment combines a great deal of firmness, diligence and neatness... the ingenious watercolour... is also worthy of praise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich's first major work, the piece breaks with the traditions of representing the crucifixion in altarpieces by depicting the scene as a landscape.]]

Friedrich completed the first of his major paintings in 1807, at the age of 34. ''The Cross in the Mountains'', today known as the ''Tetschen Altar'' ([[Galerie Neue Meister]], Dresden), is an [[altarpiece]] panel commissioned by the Countess of Thun for her family's chapel in [[Děčín|Tetschen]], [[Bohemia]].  It was to be one of the few commissions the artist received.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS5556&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The altar panel depicts the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified Christ]] in profile at the top of a mountain, alone and surrounded by nature. The cross reaches the highest point in the pictorial plane but is presented from an oblique and a distant viewpoint, unusual for a crucifixion scene in [[Western art]].  Nature dominates the scene and for the first time in [[Christian art]], an altarpiece showcases a landscape. According to the art historian Linda Siegel, the design of the altarpiece is the &quot;logical climax of many earlier drawings of his which depicted a cross in nature's world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS5556&quot; /&gt;

The work was first exhibited on Christmas Day, 1808.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS5556&quot; /&gt; Although it was generally coldly received, it was nevertheless Friedrich's first painting to receive wide publicity. The artist’s friends publicly defended the work, while art critic [[Basilius von Ramdohr]] published a lengthy article rejecting Friedrich's use of landscape in such a context; he wrote that it would be &quot;a veritable presumption, if landscape painting were to sneak into the church and creep onto the altar&quot;.  Ramdohr fundamentally challenged the concept that pure landscape painting could convey explicit meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|1980|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friedrich responded with a programme describing his intentions. In his 1809 commentary on the painting, he compared the rays of the evening sun to the light of the [[God the Father|Holy Father]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|Leppien|Monrad|1999|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinking of the sun suggests that the era when God revealed himself directly to man has passed.  This statement marked the only time Friedrich recorded a detailed interpretation of his own work.

Friedrich was elected a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] in 1810 following the purchase of two of his paintings by the Prussian [[Crown Prince]].&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-101&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|1980|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in 1816, he sought to distance himself from Prussian authority, and that June applied for Saxon citizenship. The move was unexpected by his friends, as the Saxon government of the time was pro-French, while Friedrich's paintings to date were seen as generally patriotic and distinctly anti-French. Nevertheless, with the aid of his Dresden-based friend Graf Vitzthum von Eckstädt, Friedrich attained not only citizenship, but in 1818, a place in the Saxon Academy as a member with a yearly dividend of 150 [[thalers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|pp=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he hoped to receive a full Professorship, it was never awarded him as, according to the German Library of Information, &quot;it was felt that his painting was too personal, his point of view too individual to serve as a fruitful example to students.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GLI38&quot;&gt;German Library of Information. ''Caspar David Friedrich: His Life and Work''. New York: German Library of Information, 1940. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Politics too may have played a role in the stalling of his career: Friedrich’s decidedly Germanic choice of subject and costuming frequently clashed with the prevailing pro-French attitudes of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
[[Image:Caspar David Friedrich 023.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Chalk Cliffs on Rügen]]'', (1818). 90.5 × 71 cm. Museum Oskar Reinhart am Stadtgarten, [[Winterthur]], Switzerland. Friedrich married Christiane Caroline Bommer in 1818, and on their honeymoon  they visited relatives in [[Neubrandenburg]] and [[Greifswald]]. This painting celebrates the couple's union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On January 21, 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a [[dye]]r from Dresden.&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-101&quot;/&gt; The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  [[Physiologist]] and painter [[Carl Gustav Carus]] notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including ''[[Chalk Cliffs on Rügen]]''&amp;mdash;painted after his honeymoon&amp;mdash;display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Börsch-Supan|1974|pp=41–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that &quot;the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Siegel 1978 p=114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, the artist found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, Grand Duke [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nikolai Pavlovich]], at the behest of his wife [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], visited Friedrich's studio and returned to [[Saint Petersburg]] with a number of his paintings. The exchange marked the beginning of a patronage that continued for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Updike|Updike, John]]. &quot;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=3340 Innerlichkeit and Eigentümlichkeit]&quot;. ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Volume 38, Number 5, March 7, 1991. Retrieved on October 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long thereafter, the poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], tutor to [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich’s career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings &quot;please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-66&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|1980|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich was acquainted with [[Philipp Otto Runge]] (1777–1810), another leading German painter of the Romantic period.  He was also a friend of [[Georg Friedrich Kersting]] (1785–1847), who painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter [[Johann Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857). Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only &quot;curiosities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmied|1995|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrich's psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrich's landscapes, commenting that &quot;artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrich's art only a kind of [[Mysticism|mystic]], because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic... They did not see Friedrich's faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-66&quot;/&gt;

During this period Friedrich frequently sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for [[mausoleums]], reflecting his obsession with death and the afterlife; he even created designs for some of the [[funerary art]] in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of these works were lost in the fire that destroyed [[Munich]]'s [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glass Palace]] (1931) and later in the 1945 [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].

===Later life and death===
Friedrich's reputation steadily declined over the final fifteen years of his life. As the ideals of early Romanticism passed from fashion, he came to be viewed as an eccentric and melancholy character, out of touch with the times. Gradually his patrons fell away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Va263&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1820, he was living as a recluse and was described by friends as the &quot;most solitary of the solitary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GLI38&quot; /&gt; Towards the end of his life he lived in relative poverty and was increasingly dependent on the charity of friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;j45&quot;/&gt; He became isolated and spent long periods of the day and night walking alone through woods and fields, often beginning his strolls before sunrise.
[[Image:Georg Friedrich Kersting 002.jpg|thumb|left|[[Georg Friedrich Kersting]], ''[[Caspar David Friedrich in his Studio]]'' (1819). 51 × 40 cm. [[Alte Nationalgalerie]], Berlin. Kersting portrays an aged Friedrich holding a [[maulstick]] at his canvas.]]

In June 1835, Friedrich suffered his first [[stroke]], which left him with minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability to paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmied|1995|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result he was unable to work in oil; instead he was limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions. Although his vision remained strong, he had lost the full strength of his hand. Yet he was able to produce a final 'black painting', ''Seashore by Moonlight'' (1835–36), described by Vaughan as the &quot;darkest of all his shorelines, in which richness of tonality compensates for the lack of his former finesse&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;V302&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|pp=300–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols of death appeared in his other work from this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Va263&quot; /&gt;  Soon after his stroke, the [[House of Romanov|Russian royal family]] purchased a number of his earlier works, and the proceeds allowed him to travel to [[Teplice|Teplitz]]&amp;mdash;in today's Czech Republic&amp;mdash;to recover.&lt;ref name=&quot;V302&quot; /&gt;

During the mid-1830s, Friedrich began a series of portraits and he returned to observing himself in nature. As the art historian William Vaughan has observed, however, &quot;He can see himself as a man greatly changed. He is no longer the upright, supportive figure that appeared in ''Two Men Contemplating the Moon'' in 1819. He is old and stiff... he moves with a stoop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1838, he was capable only of working in a small format. He and his family were living in poverty and grew increasingly dependent for support on the charity of friends.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaud, 128. Originally from Vaughan (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

When Friedrich died in May 1840, his passing was little noticed within the artistic community.&lt;ref name=&quot;GLI38&quot;/&gt; By then, his reputation and fame were waning. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-65&quot;/&gt; By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found. After his death, [[Carl Gustav Carus]] wrote a series of articles which paid tribute to Friedrich's transformation of the conventions of landscape painting.  However, Carus' articles placed Friedrich firmly in his time, and did not place the artist within a continuing tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of his paintings had been reproduced as a print, and that was produced in very few copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffiths|Carey|1994|pp=27, 207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although the French sculptor [[Pierre Jean David|David D'Angers]], who visited Friedrich in 1834, was moved by the devotional issues explored in the artist's canvasses. He exclaimed to Carus in 1834, &quot;Friedrich! ... The only landscape painter so far to succeed in stirring up all the forces of my soul, the painter who has created a new genre: the tragedy of the landscape.&quot; In: Grewe, Cordula. &quot;Heaven on Earth: Cordula Grewe on Caspar David Friedrich&quot;.

&quot;What the newer landscape artists see in a circle of a hundred degrees in Nature they press together unmercifully into an angle of vision of only forty-five degrees. And furthermore, what is in Nature separated by large spaces, is compressed into a cramped space and overfills and oversatiates the eye, creating an unfavorable and disquieting effect on the viewer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mitchell&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Mitchell|first=Timothy|date=September 1984|title=Caspar David Friedrich's ''Der Watzmann'': German Romantic Landscape Painting and Historical Geology|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=66|issue=3|pages=452–464|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3050447|doi=10.2307/3050447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visualisation and portrayal of landscape in an entirely new manner was Friedrich's key innovation. He sought not just to explore the blissful enjoyment of a beautiful view, as in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]], a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature. Friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a self-contained emotive subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitchell&quot;/&gt; Friedrich's paintings commonly employed the ''Rückenfigur''—a person seen from behind, contemplating the view. The viewer is encouraged to place himself in the position of the ''Rückenfigur'', by which means he experiences the sublime potential of nature,  understanding that the scene is as perceived and idealised by a human.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Prettejohn|Prettejohn, Elizabeth]] (2005). ''Beauty &amp; Art, 1750–2000''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 54–56.

He often used the landscape to express religious themes. During his time, most of the best-known paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Academic American Encyclopedia | publisher = Grolier | location = Danbury | year = 1989|page=332 | isbn = 0-7172-2024-9  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich said, &quot;The artist should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, then he should also refrain from painting that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures will be like those folding screens behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Börsch-Supan|1974|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness to the presence of God are frequent elements in Friedrich's landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shore—a [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]-like motif—and in the poplar tree, it is referenced more directly in paintings like ''[[The Abbey in the Oakwood]]'' (1808–10), in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins.

He was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes in which the land is rendered as stark and dead. Friedrich's winter scenes are solemn and still—according to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which &quot;no man has yet set his foot. The theme of nearly all the older winter pictures had been less winter itself than life in winter. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was thought impossible to leave out such motifs as the crowd of skaters, the wanderer... It was Friedrich who first felt the wholly detached and distinctive features of a natural life. Instead of many tones, he sought the one; and so, in his landscape, he subordinated the composite chord into one single basic note&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB&quot; /&gt;

With dawn and dusk constituting prominent themes of his landscapes, Friedrich's own later years were characterized by a growing pessimism. His work becomes darker, revealing a fearsome monumentality. ''The Wreck of the Hope''&amp;mdash;also known as ''The Polar Sea'' or ''[[The Sea of Ice]]'' (1823–24)&amp;mdash;perhaps best summarizes Friedrich's ideas and aims at this point, though in such a radical way that the painting was not well received. Completed in 1824, it depicted a grim subject, a shipwreck in the Arctic Ocean; &quot;the image he produced, with its grinding slabs of [[travertine]]-colored [[floe]] ice chewing up a wooden ship, goes beyond documentary into allegory: the frail bark of human aspiration crushed by the world's immense and glacial indifference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Awestruck Witness&quot;.

Friedrich's written commentary on aesthetics was limited to a collection of [[aphorism]]s set down in 1830, in which he explained the need for the artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His best-known remark advises the artist to &quot;close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|1980|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its &quot;totality&quot;, as found in the work of contemporary painters like [[Adrian Ludwig Richter]] (1803–84) and [[Joseph Anton Koch]] (1768–1839).

===Loneliness and death===
[[File:Landscape with Owl, Grave, and Coffin.jpg|thumb|''Landscape with Owl, Grave, and Coffin'' (1836–37). Pencil and sepia drawing.]]

Both Friedrich's life and art are marked with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. This becomes more apparent in his later works, from a time when friends, members of his family and fellow pioneers of early romanticism began to either become distant from him or die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historians and some of his contemporaries attribute the melancholy in his art to the losses suffered during his youth to the bleak outlook of his adulthood,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Börsch-Supan|1974|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Friedrich's pale and withdrawn appearance helped reinforce the popular notion of the &quot;taciturn man from the North&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;v80-64&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|1980|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His letters, however, contain humour and self-irony, while the natural philosopher [[Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert]] wrote that Friedrich &quot;was indeed a strange mixture of temperament, his moods ranging from the gravest seriousness to the gayest humour ... But anyone who knew only this side of Friedrich's personality, namely his deep melancholic seriousness, only knew half the man. I have met few people who have such a gift for telling jokes and such a sense of fun as he did, providing that he was in the company of people he liked.&quot; Quoted in {{Harvnb|Börsch-Supan|1974|pp=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich suffered depressive episodes in 1799, 1803–1805, c.1813, in 1816 and between 1824 and 1826. There are noticeable thematic shifts in the works he produced during these episodes, which see the emergence of such motifs and death symbols as vultures, owls, graveyards and ruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogousslavsky&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlenburg|Carsten|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1826 these motifs became a permanent feature of his output, while his use of color became more dark and muted. Carus wrote in 1929 that Friedrich &quot;is surrounded by a thick, gloomy cloud of spiritual uncertainty&quot;, while in 2004 the psychiatrist Carsten Spitzer wrote that he believed during his life, Friedrich suffered prolonged inertia, a suicide attempt and what the artist himself described as a &quot;dreadful weariness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lüddemann, Stefan. &quot;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=495 Glimpses of Mystery In a Sea of Fog.

===Germanic folklore===
Reflecting  Friedrich's patriotism and resentment during the 1813 French occupation of the dominion of [[Pomerania]], motifs from [[German folklore]] became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate  Germanic culture, customs and [[Continental Germanic mythology|mythology]]. He was impressed by the anti-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] poetry of [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] and [[Theodor Körner (author)|Theodor Körner]], and the patriotic literature of [[Adam Müller]] and [[Heinrich von Kleist]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleist was the first member of the Romantic movement to discuss Friedrich in print. See: Siegel, Linda.&lt;/ref&gt; Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama ''Die Hermannsschlacht'', Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape&amp;mdash;a first in the history of art.

In ''[[commons:Image:Caspar David Friedrich 021.jpg|Old Heroes' Graves]]'' (1812), a dilapidated monument inscribed &quot;[[Arminius]]&quot; invokes the Germanic chieftain, a symbol of nationalism, while the four tombs of fallen heroes are slightly ajar, freeing their spirits for eternity. Two French soldiers appear as small figures before a cave, lower and deep in a grotto surrounded by rock, as if farther from heaven.&lt;ref name=&quot;siegel&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Siegel|first=Linda|date=Spring 1974|title=Synaesthesia and the Paintings of Caspar David Friedrich|journal=The Art Journal|volume=33|issue=3|pages= 196–204|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/775782}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second political painting, ''[[commons:Image:Caspar David Friedrich 068.jpg|Fir Forest with the French Dragoon and the Raven]]'' (c. 1813), depicts a lost French soldier dwarfed by a dense forest, while on a tree stump a raven is perched—a prophet of doom, symbolizing the anticipated defeat of France.&lt;ref&gt;The scene is an allusion to Act V, scene 3 of [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]]'s ''Die Hermannsschlacht''. {{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|pp=87–88}}.

==Legacy==
===Influence===

Alongside other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position [[landscape painting]] as a major genre within Western art. Of his contemporaries, Friedrich's style most influenced the painting of [[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857). Among later generations, [[Arnold Böcklin]] (1827–1901) was strongly influenced by his work, and the substantial presence of Friedrich's works in Russian collections influenced many Russian painters, in particular [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] (c. 1842–1910) and [[Ivan Shishkin]] (1832–98).  Friedrich's spirituality anticipated American painters such as [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] (1847–1917), [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] (1847–1919), the painters of the [[Hudson River School]] and the [[Luminism (American art style)|New England Luminists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Epstein|first=Suzanne Latt|title=The Relationship of the American Luminists to Caspar David Friedrich|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|year=1964|oclc=23758262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Lonely Ones.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edvard Munch]], ''The Lonely Ones'', (1899). Woodcut. [[Munch Museum]], Oslo]]

At the turn of the 20th century Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art historian [[Andreas Aubert (art historian)|Andreas Aubert]] (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship,&lt;ref name=&quot;j45&quot;/&gt; and by the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print ''The Lonely Ones'' echoes Friedrich's ''Rückenfigur (back figure)'', although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich's landscapes exercised a strong influence on the work of German artist [[Max Ernst]] (1891–1976), and as a result other [[Surrealist]]s came to view Friedrich as a precursor to their movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;j45&quot;/&gt; In 1934, the Belgian  painter [[René Magritte]] (1898–1967) paid tribute in his work ''The Human Condition'', which directly echoes motifs from Friedrich's art in its questioning of perception and the role of the viewer.&lt;ref name=&quot;v04-320&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, the Surrealist journal ''[[Minotaure]]'' featured Friedrich in a 1939 article by critic Marie Landsberger, thereby exposing his work to a far wider circle of artists. The influence of ''The Wreck of Hope'' (or ''The Sea of Ice'') is evident in the 1940–41 painting ''Totes Meer'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] (1889–1946), a fervent admirer of Ernst.&lt;ref name=&quot;causey&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Causey | first = Andrew | title = Paul Nash | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1980 |page=315| isbn = 0-19-817348-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich's work has been cited as an inspiration by other major 20th-century artists, including [[Mark Rothko]] (1903–70),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gotthard Graubner]] (b. 1930), [[Gerhard Richter]] (b. 1932), [[HA Schult]] (b. 1939) and [[Anselm Kiefer]] (b. 1945),&lt;ref&gt;Alteveer, Ian. &quot;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kief/hd_kief.htm Anselm Kiefer (Born 1945)]&quot; In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

Altveer mentions a specific photograph by Kiefer inspired by ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been singled out by writer [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906–89), who, standing before ''Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon'', said &quot;This was the source of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', you know.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Cristin. &quot;[http://www.helnwein-museum.com/article3453.html Old Romantics Tug at the Heart]&quot;.

In his 1961 article &quot;The Abstract Sublime&quot;, originally published in [[ARTnews]], the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]] with the [[Abstract Expressionist]] paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting ''[[The Monk by the Sea]]'', Turner's ''The Evening Star''&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction of Turner's ''The Evening Star'' here [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng1991]&quot;.

Reproduction of the Rothko can be found here [http://www.angel-art-house.com/oil_paintings_artists/r/RothkoMark/Light_Earth_and_Blue_1954.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, &quot;Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenblum&quot;&gt;Rosenblum, Robert. &quot;The Abstract Sublime&quot;. Reprinted in: Geldzahler, Henry. ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970''. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Exhibition catalog, 1969. Library of Congress card catalog number 71-87179. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum goes on to say, &quot;Like the mystic trinity of sky, water and earth that, in the Friedrich and Turner appears to emanate from one source, the floating horizontal tiers of veiled light in the Rothko seem to conceal a total, remote presence that we can only intuit and never fully grasp. These infinite glowing voids carry us beyond reason to the Sublime; we can only submit to them in an act of faith and let ourselves be absorbed into their radiant depths.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical opinion===
Until 1890, and especially after his friends had died, Friedrich's work lay in near-oblivion for decades. Yet, by 1890, the symbolism in his work began to ring true with the artistic mood of the day, especially in central Europe. However, despite a renewed interest and an acknowledgment of his originality, his lack of regard for &quot;painterly effect&quot; and thinly rendered surfaces jarred with the theories of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClarkeII&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Vaughan|first=William|date=September 1991|title=Reviewed work(s): ''Caspar David Friedrich in seiner Zeit: Zeichnungen des Romantik und des Biedermeier'' by Hans Dickel; ''The Romantic Vision of Caspar David Friedrich + Painting and Drawings from the USSR'' by Sabine Rewald; ''Caspar David Friedrich and the Subject of Landscape'' by Joseph Leo Koerner|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=133|issue=1062|pages=626–628|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/884854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, Friedrich's work was used in the promotion of [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|pp=219–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attempted to fit the Romantic artist within the nationalistic ''[[Blood and soil|Blut und Boden]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahn&quot; /&gt; It took decades for Friedrich's reputation to recover from this association with Nazism. His reliance on symbolism and the fact that his work fell outside the narrow definitions of [[modernism]] contributed to his fall from favour. In 1949, art historian [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote that Friedrich &quot;worked in the frigid technique of his time, which could hardly inspire a school of modern painting&quot;, and suggested that the artist was trying to express in painting what is best left to poetry.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClarkeII&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Clark | first = Kenneth | title = Landscape into Art | publisher = Gibb Press | location =  |page=72| year = 2007| isbn = 1-4067-2824-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's dismissal of Friedrich reflected the damage the artist's reputation sustained during the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClarkeII&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Shishkin na severe dikom1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ivan Shishkin]], ''In the Wild North'' (1891). 161 x 118 cm. Kiev Museum of Russian Art]]

Friedrich's reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of Hollywood directors, such as [[Walt Disney]], built on the work of such German cinema masters as [[Fritz Lang]] and [[F. W. Murnau]], within the horror and fantasy genres.&lt;ref name=&quot;V325&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|pp=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context.&lt;ref name=&quot;V325&quot; /&gt; By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.

Today, his international reputation is well established. He is a national icon in his native Germany, and highly regarded by art historians and art connoisseurs across the Western World. He is generally viewed as a figure of great psychological complexity, and according to Vaughan, &quot;a believer who struggled with doubt, a celebrator of beauty haunted by darkness. In the end, he transcends interpretation, reaching across cultures through the compelling appeal of his imagery. He has truly emerged as a butterfly—hopefully one that will never again disappear from our sight&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|2004|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{main|List of works by Caspar David Friedrich}}

Friedrich was a prolific artist who produced more than 500 attributed works.&lt;ref name=&quot;S3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1978|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as &quot;[[The Stages of Life]]&quot;, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted during one of the revivals of interest in Friedrich.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.designboom.com/history/friedrich.html Caspar David Friedrich inventing romanticism]&quot;. designboom.com. Retrieved on October 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.&lt;ref name=&quot;S3&quot; /&gt;

'''Courtney Michelle Love'''&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Although some sources give Love's natal name as &quot;Love Michelle Harrison,&quot; her listing on the ''[[California Birth Index]]'' from the Center for Health Statistics gives a natal name of &quot;Courtney Michelle Harrison.&quot; Between adoptions from several step-fathers, she has also gone by the names &quot;Courtney Michelle Rodriguez&quot; and &quot;Courtney Michelle Menely.&quot; The name change to &quot;Courtney Michelle Love&quot; happened in early 1990s, in the beginning of her music career and after the end of her first marriage (of which the legal records still feature the name &quot;Courtney Michelle Menely&quot;). According to the same statistics list above, the natal status of Courtney's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, already include &quot;Love&quot; as the mother's maiden surname.&lt;/ref&gt; (born '''Courtney Michelle Harrison''', July 9, 1964) is an [[People of the United States|American]] [[vocalist]], [[lyricist]], [[musician]] and actress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20041022-9999-lz1c22love.html|title=Courtney Love is back from the brink and hoping music will be her saving grace|last=Peterson|first=Karla|date=22 October 2004 |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps best known as frontwoman and [[rhythm guitarist]] for [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]]. She also received massive media attention over her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]], before and after his suicide in 1994.

Love had an unstable childhood and adolescence, and sought to be a musician from an early age, making her big break when she founded Hole in 1989 with [[Eric Erlandson]] after unsuccessful attempts at forming bands in her early adulthood. Hole released several successful albums in the 1990s, debuting with ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991), an underground [[noise rock]] hit which was especially popular  the United Kingdom. The band followed with two massively acclaimed albums, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994) and ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998). Love also starred in several films throughout the '90s, most notably ''[[The People Vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), for which she earned a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.

Hole officially disbanded in 2002, and Love became a media spectacle in the latter part of the decade due to a series of legal troubles and battles with [[drug addiction]], largely amidst the release of her first solo album. In 2007, Love cleaned up her image and announced her sobriety after a lengthy court-ordered rehab, and began working on a fifth album. In 2009, Love reformed Hole with new members, and released the group's fourth album, ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' (2010), which received generally positive reviews.

Love has also attracted significant media attention over the years for her wild stage performances and subversive [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;slut&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bad subjects: political education for everyday life|author=Nicolini, Kim|pages=100–107|chapter=Staging the Slut: Hyper-Sexuality in Performance|year=1998|publisher=New York University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2618266&amp;page=1|work=NBC News|title=Courtney Love's Trip Back From the Bottom|date=31 October 2006|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a controversial figure, Love has, in recent years, been taken note of for her contributions to rock music, particularly as a female performer,&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;peoplevscourtney&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is often considered a [[gay icon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CLADV&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' once called Love &quot;the most controversial woman in rock history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,1969245,00.html |title=Love me do Rock &amp;#124; Guardian Unlimited Music |publisher=Music.guardian.co.uk |date= 11 December 2006|accessdate=2009-05-16 | location=London | first=Laura | last=Barton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Courtney Michelle Harrison was born in [[San Francisco]], California, the daughter of [[Linda Carroll]], a therapist, and Hank Harrison, a publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/58/Courtney-Love.html |title=Courtney Love Biography (1964-) |publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aida Edemariam |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/jun/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview7 |title=A qualified optimist |publisher=Guardian |date= 21 June 2006|accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/cobain.html |title=Ancestry of Frances Bean Cobain |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Love, her mother named her after the alcoholic, fledgling debutante protagonist of a 1956 &quot;dime-store novel&quot; called ''Chocolates for Breakfast'' by [[Pamela Moore (author)|Pamela Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|network=Vh1|airdate=21 June 2010|title=Behind the Music: Bonus Clip - &quot;Courtney Love Discusses the Origin of Her Name&quot;|series=Behind the Music|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/529956/courtney-love-discusses-the-origin-of-her-name.jhtml#id=1641949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love would discover, in later years, that her biological grandmother was novelist [[Paula Fox]] and her great-grandmother was [[Cuba]]n-born screenwriter [[Elsie Fox]]; Fox had given Linda Carroll up for adoption when she was an infant.&lt;ref name=&quot;poetry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/article.html?id=177975|title=Desire to Burn|author=Appelo, Tim|work=Poetry Foundation|date=10 April 2006|accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love's family were part of the burgeoning [[hippie]] scene of the 1960s. Linda Carroll was raised in a wealthy [[Catholicism|Catholic]] family, and ventured into the subcultures of San Francisco where she met Hank Harrison, and the two soon married.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; Harrison was an &quot;amateur [[LSD|acid]] maker&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; according to Love, and was briefly a road manager for [[The Grateful Dead]]. At five years old, Love was featured on the back of the Grateful Dead's third album, ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' (1969), sitting under a tree among the band members and various roadies and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|author=McLeod, Kembrew|date=29 January 2002}} [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200753/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll and Harrison's marriage wouldn't last long, and they filed for a divorce by the time Love was five. During a child custody case following her parents' divorce, Love's mother and one of her friends presented letters implying her father had given [[LSD]] to the three-year-old child.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|network=Vh1|airdate=21 June 2010|title=Courtney Love|series=Behind the Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sldsoi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy |first=Dana |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289728,00.html |title=Courtney Love: The Real Story Book Review &amp;#124; Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Ew.com |date=10 October 1997 |accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love's father denies this allegation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article729937.ece |title=Courtney Love's intimate journals spark legal feud with father—Times Online |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= 12 February 2006|accessdate=2009-05-16 | location=London | first=John | last=Harlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' article in 1995 Love admitted, &quot;I don't know if it actually happened&quot; but insisted it was alleged in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-05-11/entertainment/17805047_1_hank-harrison-frances-bean-cobain-star-daughter/3|title=Courtney and Dad -- No Love Lost / He downplays estrangement, she won't see him}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists Max Wallace and Ian Halperin later claimed to have searched through &quot;hundreds of pages of transcripts from the divorce proceedings&quot; and concluded that there was no such reference.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Max and Halperin, Ian.

Love was [[bullied]] at school and called &quot;pee girl&quot; because her clothes were not often washed,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289728,00.html|title=Book Review: Courtney Love: The Real Story|author=Kennedy, Dana|date=10 October 1997|accessdate=2011-04-22|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was sent to various therapists and counselors by her mother after expressing deep-seated anger issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CourtneyLoveyoung.png|thumb|right|160px|Childhood photograph of Love, early 1970s.]]In 1972, Love's mother relocated to New Zealand with Love's half sisters, but left Love behind in the United States under the care of a family friend. Love soon after moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] to live with her ex-stepfather, and,  at age 12, Love applied to join the [[Mickey Mouse Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matheson, Whitney|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/popcandy/2006/11/books_i_read_on.html|title=Pop Candy: Books I Read On Vacation|work=USA Today|date=27 November 2006}}; As revealed in her scrapbook, ''Dirty Blonde'', Love was a teenage fan of the Bay City Rollers: &quot;...from the collages of her favorite rockers (in her case, the Bay City Rollers), to scrawled lists of artists and things she yearned to learn more about to pages of poems and daydreams...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but was reportedly rejected after reading a [[Sylvia Plath]] poem for her audition.&lt;ref&gt;Rockland, Kate. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/fashion/05nite.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/L/Love,%20Courtney &quot;Don't Call It a Comeback (Yet)&quot;], New York Times, 5th November 2006: &quot;The book offers several gems; one is a 1976 rejection letter from the Mickey Mouse Club. 'I read Sylvia Plath's poem &quot;Daddy,&quot;' Love says, 'grinning widely.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===1977-1980: Teenage years===
At age 14, Love was arrested for [[criminal mischief]] and [[theft]] after shoplifting a t-shirt and was sent to [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]]. She was then briefly shipped to New Zealand to her mother, but, because they fought, was returned to the United States, where she was admitted to [[Hillcrest Youth Correctional Facility]]. According to documents by the facility committee from 1979, Love was very &quot;outspoken&quot; and caused problems within the program because of her &quot;boisterous, negative, and hurtful behavior&quot; toward her teachers and her peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilldoc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=29-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also noted that Love's &quot;academic ability is seen to be far beyond the typical student at Hillcrest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilldoc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other documents from the Oregon's [[Children's Services Division]] noted that it was &quot;apparent that Courtney has been in search of the family life she has always been deprived of for so many years&quot;, and has &quot;rejected substitutes as unworthy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilldoc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to a data sheet which logged Love's juvenile placements, she was shuffled between over 20 different facilities and foster homes between 1978 and 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilldoc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16, Love escaped the Oregon juvenile system and gained legal emancipation from her family. She subsequently traveled to [[England]], [[Ireland]], and [[Japan]], living on a [[trust (law)|trust fund]] established for her by her mother's adoptive parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;courting&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Iley, Chrissy|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article604615.ece|title=Courting disaster|work=The Times|date=22 October 2006|accessdate=2011-01-23|location=London}} &quot;'I talked one of my mother's gurus, of which she had many, into letting me live with him.

Love returned to Portland at age 17, still pursuing music, and became part of the city's punk rock scene. According to Love, she briefly worked as a [[DJ]] at Portland's [[community radio]] station, [[KBOO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usUklPoqF6U|work=MTV|title=Courtney Love: Super Rock Interview|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote an article under the name &quot;Courtney Michelle&quot; in punk zine ''[[Maximumrocknroll|MRR]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Spin|date=July 1998|pages=94|title=This Was Hardcore|author=Weisbard, Eric|quote=Courtney Love filed a Portland scene report in Issue 4 as &quot;Courtney Michelle&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I wrote three or four of these missives from Portland, all about [[Poison Idea]] and Rancid Vat.

Love's interest in punk rock flourished, and she immersed herself with alternative and countercultural groups of people&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Brite, Poppy Z.|title=Courtney Love: The Real Story|year=1997|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;— &quot;I was quite the terror in Portland,&quot; Love said in retrospect.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; Love befriended fellow punk kids and strippers, and often hung out at local [[gay bars]] with [[drag queens]]: &quot;I didn't ever really talk until I started hanging out in '80 or '81 with drag queens at the Metropolis in Portland (now the live music club [[Dante's]]). I was very, very quiet. So much so that at one point when I was very young I was diagnosed as a probable [[autistic]]. And then I started hanging around with bitchy drag queens and with [my friends] Ursula and Robin, and they basically raised me. I found my inner bitch and I ran with her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Marks, Craig|date=February 1995|work=Spin|accessdate=2010-12-02|title=&quot;Courtney Love— Confessions of a Diva}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though still a [[minor (law)|minor]], Love returned to work as an [[exotic dancer]] in various venues in Portland, lying to club owners in order to get jobs. Love worked at several clubs, including the [[Star Theater (Portland, Oregon)|Star Theater]] and the infamous Mary's Dine &amp; Dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marysclub.com/history.php|work=Mary's Club|title=History|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her income from stripping, she was able to rent an apartment in [[Northwest Portland]] with two of her friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot; /&gt; Between 1980 and 1982, she frequently traveled up and down the West Coast in search of local music scenes, and while doing so, adopted the name &quot;Courtney Love.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;

==Music career==
===1982-1988: Early musical endeavors===
Love began her music career with a brief stint as lead singer of [[Faith No More]]. According to Love, she showed up to a concert in San Francisco in 1982 wearing a wedding gown, and basically &quot;demanded&quot; to be in their band,&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; wanting to replace their lead singer. She was 18 years old. Her work in the band was brief, though she later maintained a friendship with band member [[Roddy Bottum]].

At age 20, in 1984, Love met [[Kat Bjelland]] in Portland at the [[Satyricon nightclub]], and the two began a friendship that was marked by drug experimentation. Both were extremely interested in music, however, and they decided to form a band together, called [[Sugar Babydoll]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Kat Bjelland. Edited by Liz Evans. ''Women, Sex and Rock'N'Roll: In Their Own Words''. Rivers Orum Press/Pandora List, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair recruited bassist [[Jennifer Finch]] in Los Angeles, whom Love had also become friends with. The group wouldn't last long, however, and they ended up parting ways in 1985 after fighting and troubles involving individual drug dependency.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;

Love and Bjelland, still friends, moved to San Francisco the following year and formed a band called [[Pagan Babies (band)|The Pagan Babies]], with Deidre Schletter and [[Janis Tanaka]], but the band would dismember after recording one [[demo (music)|demo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katbjelland.com/paganbabies/indexpaganbabies.html |title=Pagan Babies |publisher=Katbjelland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070905191236/http://www.katbjelland.com/paganbabies/indexpaganbabies.html |archivedate = 5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Love played bass in Kat Bjelland's band [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes In Toyland]] in Minneapolis for a short time but was kicked out of this group as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/babes-toyland-biography |title=Babes in Toyland Biography |publisher=Arts.enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love briefly attended several colleges between 1985 and 1987 during her many relocations, spending little more than six months to a year at each— she took classes at [[Portland State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portlandstate.blogspot.com/2008/01/notable-alumni.html|work=Portland State University Blog|date=2008-01-28|title=Portland State University: Notable Alumni|accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[San Francisco State University]] and the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], studying [[English language|English]] and [[Buddhism]], but never invested enough time to graduate.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepoweroflove&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303306,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=The Power of Love|author=Kennedy, Dana|date=12 August 1994|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsuccessful in her musical endeavors thus far, Love, an inexperienced actress, submitted an audition tape to director [[Alex Cox]], which earned her a bit part in the [[Sid Vicious]] biopic ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986). Impressed by Love, Cox offered her $40,000 for a leading role in his following film ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987), which she filmed in Spain in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot; /&gt; Love was ultimately dissatisfied with the experience and the &quot;low level of celebrity&quot; that it brought her, and returned to stripping, where she was recognized and photographed by customers at a bar in [[McMinnville, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/hole/49737|title=Courtney Love blasts UK music scene and slags off 'America's Sweetheart' during Oxford Union speech|date=13 February 2010|accessdate=2011-02-24|work=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love then retreated to [[Alaska]] for several months where she continued to strip to support herself,&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|work=The E! True Hollywood Story|title=Courtney Love}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the while writing song lyrics and aspiring to form a band. Love would say in retrospect, &quot;I was 24, and I was looming on 25, and if I hadn't made it for real by 25, that was it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;

===1989-1993: Hole and ''Pretty on the Inside''===
{{Main|Hole (band)}}

[[Image:Hole 1991 ad.png|thumb|left|220px|[[Flyer (pamphlet)|Flyer]] made by Courtney Love promoting a Hole show in 1991, Los Angeles.]]
In 1989, Love moved to Los Angeles—dissatisfied with acting, she taught herself to play [[guitar]] and set out to form her own band. She placed an ad in ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'', reading: &quot;I want to start a band. My influences are [[Big Black]], [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wkkc54&quot;&gt;Who Killed Kurt Cobain?: The Mysterious Death of an Icon (pp. 54)&lt;/ref&gt; to which [[Eric Erlandson]], along with over a dozen other musicians, replied. Love ultimately chose Erlandson. After a cycle of several bass players and drummers, Love and Erlandson recruited bassist Jill Emery and drummer Caroline Rue into the band, which they named [[Hole (band)|Hole]]. The band's name allegedly came from a quote from [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' which read &quot;there's a hole that pierces my soul&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Later... With Jools Holland'' Interview— Courtney Love, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and a conversation Love had with her mother about her upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes

Amidst the formation of Hole, Love met and married &quot;Falling&quot; James Moreland, vocalist of [[The Leaving Trains]]. Moreland was a [[transvestite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/features/courtneylove.htm|work=NY Rock|title=Courtney Love: The Life of Love|author=Apter, Jeff|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Love later referred to their marriage as &quot;a joke&quot;; an annulment was filed within the first few months of the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recordssitereviews.com/divorcerecords/courtney-love-james-moreldivorce.html|work=Public Records Site|title=The Courtney Love and James Moreland Divorce|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amg&gt;Bush, John. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4738/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Leaving Trains] at [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Hole played their first gig in November 1989 after three months of rehearsal, and made [[single (music)|singles]] on the [[Long Beach, California]], independent label [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]]. Their first single, titled &quot;[[Retard Girl]],&quot; was issued in spring 1990, and had been produced by Love's then ex-husband Moreland. One year later, the band debuted their second single, &quot;[[Dicknail]]&quot; through [[Sub Pop Records]]. The group began to gain a following in Los Angeles and while the band's local fanbase was growing, Love began to practice [[Nichiren Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the sounds and style of [[no wave]] rock bands, Love sought out [[Sonic Youth]] bassist [[Kim Gordon]] to produce the band's first studio album, a proposal to which Gordon accepted. Hole's debut album ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991) was released in September 1991 on [[Caroline Records]], produced by Gordon and [[Gumball (band)|Gumball]]'s Don Fleming. It sold well for an independent release and received specifically favorable reviews in the British alternative music press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/hi/barbiesdead/holeisaband.html |title=Hole is a Band; Courtney Love Is a Soap Opera |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; charting at 59 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in October 1991. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' referred to it as &quot;the most compelling album to have been released in 1991&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;real&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Courtney Love: The Real Story|last=Brite|first=Poppie Z|year=1998|page=117|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0684848007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'' also labeled it one of the 20 best albums of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|work=SPIN|date=December 1991|title=20 Best Albums of the Year|pages=122|author=Spencer, Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love went on tour with Hole to promote the record in the United States following a lengthy tour of Europe and the UK, where Love was touted as a &quot;darling&quot; of their alternative rock scene. Several years after the album's release, Love made comments that though the album was &quot;the truth&quot;, it was also an act of proving herself to her &quot;[[independent music|indie]] peers&quot; who had &quot;made fun of her&quot; for liking [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Smiths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jt&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=Thurnher, Jeffery|work=SPIN|date=May 1994|title=Love Conquers All}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also referred to the creation of the album as a sort of self-[[exorcism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;badgirl&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114001/ Not Bad for a Girl]|people=Love, Courtney; Emery, Jill; Rue, Caroline|publisher=Apramian, Lisa Rose|date=1995|medium=VHS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Love had befriended many figures in the alternative rock scene, including [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]] and [[Billy Corgan]] of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] (whom she briefly dated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/features/courtneylove.htm |title=Courtney Love: The Life of Love (NY Rock Book Review) |publisher=Nyrock.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1989, Love had her first encounter with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] in Portland at the [[Satyricon nightclub]], where she had often hung out in her teenage years. Cobain and his band, Nirvana, who were still relatively underground at the time, were playing at the club that night. Cobain passed by a booth where Love was seated with a friend, and she blurted to him, &quot;You look like [[Dave Pirner]]&quot; (lead singer of [[Soul Asylum]]). The two purportedly playfully wrestled on the floor in front of a [[jukebox]] that night, but Love left the club before Cobain did.&lt;ref name=&quot;how they met&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=How they met: fateful encounters of famous lovebirds, rivals, partners in crime|author=Green, Joey|pages=69–70|publisher=Black Dog Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, through mutual friends and other chance encounters, Love and Cobain began dating in 1991, and were married in 1992. They gave birth to their only daughter, [[Frances Bean Cobain]], in August 1992.

===1994-1995: Commercial breakthrough===

The marriage between Love and Cobain lasted up until 1994; Cobain was experiencing immense success with his band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and Love was in the studio recording Hole's second album, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994). In April 1994, [[Death of Kurt Cobain|Cobain was found dead]] in the couple's Seattle home of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Both Love and Cobain had been staying in separate rehabilitation centers in California at the time due to [[heroin]] abuse; Cobain checked himself out of the center during treatment and vanished, returning to Seattle without telling anyone. His body was found in their home on April 8, 1994, four days before the release of Hole's ''Live Through This''. A memorial was held for Cobain two days later at the [[Seattle Center]], with a pre-recorded message of Love reading Cobain's suicide note, while crying and chastising him. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived at the park and distributed some of Cobain's clothing to those who still remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Come As You Are|author=Azerrad, Michael|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedy in Love's personal life occurred during Hole's biggest achievement thus far— ''Live Through This'', recorded in the fall of 1993 in Atlanta, would garner much attention, not only because of it being the group's first commercial album, but also because of its release date, just days after Cobain committed suicide. The album featured a new lineup, with [[Kristen Pfaff]] on bass and Patty Schemel on drums; Jill Emery and Caroline Rue had both left the band in 1992. Less than two months after the release of ''Live Through This'', on June 16, Kristen Pfaff died of an apparent heroin overdose.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; Love soon after recruited 22-year-old bassist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] for the band's upcoming tour. Throughout the months preceding the tour, Love was rarely seen in public, and had [[Namgyal]] Buddhist [[monks]] move into her home to help her deal with the recent tragedies.&lt;Ref name=&quot;thepoweroflove&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The live performances for Hole's 1994 and 1995 tours became notorious due to Love's emotional state at the time; they were described as &quot;part therapy and part eulogy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; with Love often altering hurtful song lyrics toward herself, dedicating songs to Cobain and Pfaff, provoking fans, throwing guitars into the audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2010/09/09/20100909mtv-vmas-memorable-moments.html?page=4|title=10 most memorable moments of the MTV Video Music Awards - Living through this (1995)|last1=Masley |first1=Ed |last2= |first2= |date=9 September 2010 |work=[[The Arizona Republic|azcentral.com]] |publisher= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and breaking into screaming fits onstage. Disgruntled Nirvana fans—many of whom had been adherents to [[conspiracy theories]] alleging that Love had murdered Cobain— threw [[shotgun shells]] at her onstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatweek.com/music/musicianinterviews/4499-cypress-hill-the-beatweek-cover-story-interview/|work=Beat Week|title=Cypress Hill: Interview|accessdate=2011-02-28|date=20 April 2010|author=Anderson, Lance|quote= “Those were really great shows. It was opening us up to a whole different deal…it provided the background for some funny-ass stories at times too. Getting to play with Hole at that time. She’s always been a controversial figure obviously…she’s definitely Punk Rock…there were times she was getting carried off the stage on that tour. Fighting with fans. People were throwing shot gun shells at her feet. It was a spectacle.” Despite Courtney Love’s outrageous behavior and her smack talk about Cypress Hill early on the tour, B-Real respects Courtney Love as an artist, “Nobody could take that away from her.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatic nature of the tour came to public light on the [[Fourth of July]], 1995— while playing at the [[Lollapalooza]] Music Festival, Love punched [[Bikini Kill]] singer [[Kathleen Hanna]] in the face, after pelting her with candy and throwing a lit cigarette at her.&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot; /&gt; Hanna had allegedly made a joke about Love's daughter [[drug injection|shooting up]] in a closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=36053&amp;category=34029|work=Portland Mercury|date=9 January 2006|title=Raising America's Sweetheart: An Interview with Courtney Love's Mother|author=Bowie, Chas|accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, Hanna pressed charges, and Love pled guilty and underwent anger management classes.

In spite of the recent tragedies in Love's life and the highly emotional tour, ''Live Through This'' was an immense commercial and critical success. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and the ''[[Village Voice]]'' declared it &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and by November the record was certified [[gold record|gold]]. By April 1995, it went [[platinum record|platinum]]. ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave it a positive review, noting the lyrical content of the songs and Love's dealings with it: &quot;Life in the media spotlight, motherhood, being called Nirvana's [[Yoko Ono]], the idea that love and sex strip women of their dignity-these and other thoughts are on her mind, and her frazzled, occasionally venomous observations make for what amounts to a shrink session with a beat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301841,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=15 April 1994|author=Browne, David|title=Live Through This|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist Geoffrey Himes noted the album's reactiveness toward &quot;the impossible situation that confronts women when they are asked to be both wild sources of pleasure and unblemished mother figures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tower.com/live-through-this-hole-cd/wapi/105768439|work=Tower Records|title=Live Through This|author=Himes, Geoffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's subject matter ranged from themes of pregnancy, rape, and relationships to conformity, child abuse, and suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1158652/a/Live+Through+This.htm|work=CD Universe|title=Live Through This|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Live Through This'' went on to be declared one of the best albums of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in their ''[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]'' issue in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6862/35223/47810|work=Rolling Stone|title=Live Through This (#466): Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of all Time|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996-1999: Hiatus and ''Celebrity Skin''===
Following the success of ''Live Through This'', Hole went on a hiatus beginning in 1996 while Love acted in several films. In 1997, the band released a compilation album, ''[[My Body, The Hand Grenade]]'' through [[City Slang]] records, which featured material from the band's earliest recordings in 1989 up until 1995— the album featured several singles and live tracks, and was described as an anthology of the band's progression from punk rock to more mainstream alternative rock tastes.

While ''My Body, The Hand Grenade'' was hitting store shelves, Hole was in the studio recording ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'', which featured a more [[pop rock]] style than the band's previous albums. Released in September 1998, ''Celebrity Skin'' was noted for its commercial style, and received positive critical reaction. ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album four out of five stars, saying, &quot;the album teems with sonic knockouts that make you see all sorts of stars. It's accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time. Here is a basic guitar record that's anything but basic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Posted: Sep 1, 1998) |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/hole/albums/album/227169/rid/5942887/?rnd=1144451215796&amp;has-player=true&amp;version=6.0.8.1024 |title=James Hunter reviews Celebrity Skin |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date=1 September 1998|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Celebrity Skin'' went on to go multi-platinum, and topped &quot;Best of Year&quot; lists at ''Spin'', the ''Village Voice'', and other periodicals. Erlandson was still the lead guitarist, and now there were Melissa Auf der Maur's backup vocals and bass, but drummer [[Patty Schemel]] was replaced by a session drummer during the recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityhollywoodnews.com/erlandson-also-declared-that-patty/ |title=Erlandson also declared that Patty |publisher=Celebrity Hollywood News |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album is noted for being the only Hole album to garner a #1 hit single on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, with its title track, &quot;[[Celebrity Skin (song)|Celebrity Skin]]&quot;.

During the release and promotion of ''Celebrity Skin'', Love and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] designed a low-price [[Squier]] brand guitar, called [[Squier Venus|Vista Venus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drownsoda.free.fr/vistavenus.htm |title=Fender Squier Vista Venus |publisher=Drown Soda |date= |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as Cobain did in 1994, doing the design of his [[Fender Jag-Stang]]). The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], and [[Rickenbacker]]'s solidbodies and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: &quot;I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty (...) And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one pickup switch. Because I think that cultural revolutions are in the hands of guitar players&quot;.

Hole toured [[Australia]] in 1999 to support the album, then the U.S. on a tour with [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. The two bands mocked each other on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080210045720/http://www.chartattack.com/road/reviews/1999/19990302-hole.html  | archivedate=2008-02-10 | title=Live Reviews: Hole / Marilyn Manson | publisher=''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]'' | accessdate=2008-11-15 | date=2 March 1998| first=Sarah | last=G | url=http://www.chartattack.com/road/reviews/1999/19990302-hole.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hole dropped off the tour, citing the obligation to pay 50% of Manson's staging costs as a reason. The singers of both bands told MTV there was no animosity and they were happy to end the tour.

===2000-2007: Solo work and interruptions===
[[File:Courtney Love on stage crop.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Love performing in London, England on her 43rd birthday (2007).]]With Hole in disarray, Love began a &quot;punk rock femme [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]]&quot; called Bastard during autumn 2001, enlisting Schemel, [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] co-frontwoman [[Louise Post]], and bassist Gina Crosley, whom Post recommended. Though a demo was completed, the project never reached fruition: conflicts between Love and Crosley, then between Love and replacement bassist Corey Parks from [[Nashville Pussy]], led to the group's demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weston |first=Colin |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1018 |title=Sort The 'Bastard' Out |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=4 May 2001|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juicemagazine.com/COREYPARKS.html |title=Corey Parks |publisher=Juicemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 24, 2002, Hole officially announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with [[Universal Music Group]].

A whirlwind of legal troubles surrounded Love beginning in 2003, when public attention fell on her for various arrests and drug charges, most notably after the release of her solo album, ''America's Sweetheart''.&lt;ref&gt;Donegan, Lawrence. ''Sunday Magazine'': [http://web.archive.org/web/20080123215247/http://www.moonwashedrose.com/media/sundaymag03.html LIVE THROUGH THIS.] December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479849/10212003/love_courtney.jhtml |title=Courtney Love Fighting For Custody Of Daughter Frances Bean |publisher=Mtv.com |date=21 October 2003|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495857/20050113/story.jhtml |title=Courtney Love Regains Custody Of Frances Bean Cobain |publisher=Mtv.com |date=13 January 2005|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love had begun composing the album with [[Linda Perry]] in 2002.

''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', released on [[Virgin Records]] in February 2004, was embraced by critics with mixed reviews. ''Spin'' called it a &quot;jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994’s ''Live Through This''&quot; and awarded it eight out of ten stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinmagazine.com/reviews/courtney-love-americas-sweetheart-virgin|title=Spin|title=Courtney Love, America's Sweetheart Review|author=Aaron, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Rolling Stone'' suggested that, &quot;for people who enjoy watching celebrities fall apart, ''America's Sweetheart'' should be more fun than an [[The Osbournes|Osbournes]] marathon.&quot; 

The album sold a disappointing 86,000 copies in its first three months, with the singles ''[[Mono (Courtney Love song)|Mono]]'' and &quot;Hold on to Me&quot;, both of which earned competent spots on album charts. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times; in 2010, while speaking at the [[Oxford Union]], Love called it &quot;a crap record&quot;, and reasoned that her drug issues at the time were to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/hole/49737|work=NME|title=Courtney Love blasts UK music scene and slags off 'America's Sweetheart' during Oxford Union speech|date=13 February 2010|accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was clear during promotion of the album that Courtney was not as sober as she had claimed; she performed on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on March 17, 2004, followed by a chaotic interview which included Love standing on Letterman's desk and flashing her breasts. The same evening following the Letterman appearance, Love was arrested for possession of a controlled substance after a live performance in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;letterman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485823/20040318/love_courtney.jhtml |title=Courtney Love Arrested After Allegedly Striking Fan With Mic Stand |publisher=Mtv.com |date=18 March 2004|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In public appearances, Love protested her arrest, denying charges and describing the drugs found on her as &quot;one expired [[Percocet]] and one [[Ambien]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/4553516|title=Courtney Love Arrested in New York|work=MSNBC|date=25 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police, however, alleged possession of oxycodone and [[hydrocodone]] without prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3523406.stm |title=Rock star Love arrested after gig |publisher=BBC News |date=18 March 2004|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, after several violations of rehab sentences, Love was sentenced to six months in lock down rehab, which ended in February 2006. She made a public statement after her release, saying: &quot;I would just like to thank the court for allowing me these 90 days... [It] helped me deal with a very gnarly drug problem, which is behind me... I've just been playing guitar and taking care of my daughter.

In June 2005, Love started recording what was going to be her second solo album, ''Nobody's Daughter'',&lt;ref name=&quot;nobodysdaughter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/04/18/courtney-love-is-nobodys-daughter |title=Courtney Love Is 'Nobody's Daughter' |publisher=Spinner.com |date=18 April 2007|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborating with [[Linda Perry]] and Billy Corgan in the writing and recording of the album. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song entitled &quot;Loser Dust&quot;, during her time in rehab.&lt;ref name=&quot;readytorock&quot;/&gt; 

Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled ''The Return of Courtney Love'', detailing the making of ''Nobody's Daughter'', aired on the British television network in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of &quot;Never Go Hungry Again&quot;, recorded during an interview for ''[[The Times]]'' in November, was also released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anjana Ahuja |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,27052,00.html |title=TheTimes.co.uk: Podcasts |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incomplete audio clips of the song &quot;[[Samantha (Hole song)|Samantha]]&quot;, originating from an interview with [[NPR]], were also distributed on the internet in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulaby |first=Neda |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10189167 |title=Rebuilding Courtney Love, One Song at a Time |publisher=Npr.org |date=15 May 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008-present: Hole and ''Nobody's Daughter''===
[[Image:CourtneyLove Ottowa.png|thumb|left|180px|Love performing at Ottawa Bluesfest, 2010.]]
On June 17, 2009, ''[[NME]]'' reported that Hole would be reuniting. Former Hole guitarist [[Eric Erlandson]] stated in ''Spin'' magazine that contractually no reunion can take place without his involvement; therefore ''Nobody's Daughter'' would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a &quot;Hole&quot; record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a Twitter post, claiming that &quot;he's out of his MIND, Hole is MY band, MY name, and MY Trademark&quot;. Shortly after this quarrel, Love began posting new Hole logos, stage ideas, and guitar pick ideas on her Facebook page, implying, though not confirming, that Hole had reformed.

''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' was released worldwide as a Hole album in April 2010. Hole now consists of Courtney Love (guitar, vocals), [[Micko Larkin]] (guitar), Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). Some songs from the sessions with Linda Perry and [[Billy Corgan]] are on the album, including &quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot;, &quot;Letter to God&quot;, &quot;Samantha&quot;, and &quot;Never Go Hungry&quot;, although they have been re-produced with Micko Larkin.

The first single from ''Nobody's Daughter'' was &quot;[[Skinny Little Bitch]]&quot;, which was the most added song on alternative rock radio in early March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtney-love.org/skinny-little-bitch-most-added-song-on-alternative-radio|title=Skinny Little Bitch, most added song on alternative radio|date=15 March 2010|accessdate=2010-11-04|last=|first=Mel|work=courtney-love.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hole performed on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on April 27, 2010, and Courtney Love was interviewed. Hole also performed on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on April 29, 2010, on the outdoor stage.

The album received mixed reviews, though the majority of them leant toward positive. ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Love &quot;worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, ''America's Sweetheart''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/nobodys-daughter-20100426|author=Sheffield, Robert|title=Nobody's Daughter by Hole|work=Rolling Stone|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Slant Magazine'' also gave the album three out of five stars, saying &quot;It's [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;For Once in Your Life.&quot; The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date. Co-penned by Linda Perry, the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/hole-nobodys-daughter/2083|work=Slant|date=21 April 2010|author=Cinquemani, Sal|title=Hole: Nobody's Daughter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk-rock sound with much more acoustic work than previous Hole albums. Love toured Europe, Japan, and the United States promoting the album in the spring and summer of 2010, ending the tour at Seattle's [[Bumbershoot]] festival in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bumbershoot.org/fresh/2010/06/music-lineup-2/|title=Bumbershoot 2010 Music Lineup|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
Love actually entered the entertainment industry through cinema in Alex Cox's 1986 [[biopic]] ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', playing a small role as [[Nancy Spungen]]'s friend, Gretchen. Cox, impressed by Love's personality and energy, gave her a major role in his subsequent spaghetti western, ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). [[Image:LarryFlyntCourtneyLove.png|thumb|right|250px|Love as Althea Flynt in ''[[The People Vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which garnered her critical acclaim as an actress and a Golden Globe nomination.]]

Nearly a decade later, in 1996, Love returned to acting in between her success and work with Hole. She had small parts in ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' and ''[[Feeling Minnesota]]'', but her greatest film achievement thus far came in the role of [[Larry Flynt]]'s wife, Althea, in [[Miloš Forman]]'s 1996 film ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'', opposite [[Woody Harrelson]] as Flynt. The role marked her first major acting part. Forman chose Love, unaware of her history as a musician, because she was &quot;an extremely talented actress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ic&quot; /&gt; Initially, [[Columbia Pictures]] had been hesitant to hire Love for the role, because she wasn't a &quot;big enough name&quot;, and they were also worried about her &quot;troubled&quot; past.&lt;ref name=&quot;ic&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/MIFO01.HTM|work=Industry Cental|title=Milos Forman (The People vs Larry Flynt)|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Forman fought the company and Love was given the role; however, Columbia Pictures refused to insure her during the making of the film. Ultimately, Forman, co-star Woody Harrelson, Oliver Stone, Michael Hausman, and Love herself pooled their money together in order to pay for her insurance, which demanded weekly urine tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;ic&quot; /&gt;

Love passed every urine test while making the film, and the work paid off— she received unanimous critical acclaim upon the film's release, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actress in a Drama and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called her work in the film &quot;quite a performance; Love proves she is not a rock star pretending to act, but a true actress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961227/REVIEWS/612270303/1023|date=27 December 1996|accessdate=13 October 2010|author=Ebert, Roger|work=Chicago Sun Times|title=People vs. Larry Flynt: Review by Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time she began a relationship with [[Edward Norton]], which after four years would become her longest.

The late 1990s— after Hole released ''Celebrity Skin''— saw Love in the party film ''[[200 Cigarettes]]'' (1998), and starring opposite [[Jim Carrey]] in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999). In 2001, Love returned to acting and took a leading role in ''[[Julie Johnson]]'' (2001) as [[Lili Taylor]]'s lesbian lover, for which she won an Outstanding Actress award at L.A.'s [[Outfest]]. She followed with another leading part in the thriller film ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), alongside [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Charlize Theron]].

==Personal life==
Love is a member of [[Soka Gakkai]], a branch of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], having started exploring the religion in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jolie&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;actually&quot; /&gt; Love stated that in 1990, she would chant ''[[Daimoku|Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō]]'' daily,&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; and in retrospect, has credited her spiritual awakening as a being responsible for her success with Hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;jolie&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/nov/18/popandrock1|work=The Guardian|title=Enduring Love: Jolie Lash meets Courtney Love|date=18 November 2005|accessdate=2011-01-05|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her mother's biological mother, Love is a distant relative of actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/society-social/families-children-marriage/5858691-1.html|work=All Business|title=Controversial Grunge Queen and Actress Courtney Love Rocks Oxygen's 'Conversations From the Edge...|date=13 February 2002|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;&lt;big&gt;Relationships&lt;/big&gt;
Love's most prolific relationship was with fellow rock musician Kurt Cobain, whom she initially met in Portland, Oregon in 1989. They later became reacquainted through [[Jennifer Finch]], one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates, who was dating Nirvana drummer [[Dave Grohl]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;how they met&quot; /&gt; Love told Grohl she had a crush on Cobain, and later sent him a heart-shaped box with a letter and porcelain doll head inside of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;how they met&quot;/&gt; Love and Cobain officially began dating in 1991, and were married on [[Waikiki Beach]] in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, on February 24, 1992. Love wore a satin and lace dress once owned by actress [[Frances Farmer]], and Cobain wore green pajamas. Six months later, on August 18, the couple's only child, a daughter named [[Frances Bean Cobain]], was born. In 1994, Cobain committed suicide. In speaking of her marriage with Kurt Cobain, she has been adamant about the fact that she loved him,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I loved my husband very, and I did everything I could to protect him...&quot; VH1 Behind the Music: Courtney Love, quotation&lt;/ref&gt; but in more recent years has been less inclined to discuss it. In a 2010 interview with ''[[NME]]'', Love said she was &quot;sick of talking about it&quot;. &quot;I am not his spokesperson on Earth,&quot; she told the magazine. &quot;I don't know what he'd be like now; he could be into society girls, he could be into fat girls, he could be [[homosexual]]. We don't know, he died at 27.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=NME|title=Courtney Love is Dead|date=April 2010|author=Miller, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 1996, Love dated actor [[Edward Norton]] when the two met on the set of ''The People vs. Larry Flynt''. Her relationship with Edward was described as her &quot;most stable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; The two were together for several years and were at one point engaged,&lt;ref name=&quot;actually&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article630036.ece |title=Love, actually|accessdate=2007-12-16 |last=Moran |first=Caitlin |date=9 November 2006 |work=Times Online | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but separated in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;ed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/03/14/2010-03-14_courtney_love_says_edward_norton_is_mediator_between_her_and_daughter_frances_be.html|work=NY Daily News|date=2010-03-14|title=Courtney Love Says Edward Norton is Mediator Between her and Daughter Frances Bean|author=Rush &amp; Molloy|accessdate=2011-01-19|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love was also romantically linked to [[Trent Reznor]] in 1995 and once left a suicide note in her room in the [[Sunset Marquis Hotel]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] after a fight with Reznor.&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Communications2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Los Angeles Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=010EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=2011-02-20|date=January 2005|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=117|id={{ISSN|15229149}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her book ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'', she left a suicide-note-like apology letter addressed to deceased husband [[Kurt Cobain]] and daughter [[Frances Bean Cobain|Frances Bean]], saying that ''I love you.

;&lt;big&gt;Substance abuse battles&lt;/big&gt;
[[Image:Russell Brand and Courtney Love.jpg|thumb|right|Love speaking with [[Russell Brand]] in Los Angeles, 2008.]]

Love's struggle with drug abuse has also been subject of many media outlets, first beginning in a ''Vanity Fair'' article by Lynn Hirschberg in 1992, which alluded that Love was addicted to [[heroin]] during her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Courtney. MTV Interview, 1994: &quot;If you read Vanity Fair, you probably think I swig Jack Daniel's first thing in the morning, after I smoke my crack and don't see my daughter for ten days.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Though Love has admitted she used heroin before she knew she was pregnant, she asserts that she stopped &quot;damn fast&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; &quot;My daughter knows I did drugs in my first trimester of pregnancy. She weighed 7lb 6oz when she was born and she was healthy.

In May 2011, Love made public statements that she was &quot;tired&quot; of her reputation as a drug addict: &quot;I've been maligned as this drug freak for years, and I'm getting tired of it. That's not the way I live anymore. I try to work a good program. I don't do [[heroin|smack]].

Love has also been a lifelong [[cigarette smoking|smoker]]. In a 2010 interview, she commented, saying: &quot;Someone compared me to [[Bette Davis]] in that I make smoking cool for kids. And I think it was a tragic and truthful statement. And it made me feel, as you can imagine, just horrible. Then they challenged me to quit smoking — because if I can quit smoking, anyone can quit smoking. So while I ''am'' smoking a cigarette right now, I have written 'The Last Pack' with a [[Sharpie]] on every pack since then.

Love has advocated for several [[liberalism|liberal]] causes, including stricter [[gun control]] laws and reform of the &quot;corrupt&quot; record industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;gun&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/872624/20000515/index.jhtml|work=VH1|title=Courtney Love Among 'Million Moms' Calling for Tighter Gun Control|date=15 May 2000|accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;math&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/feature/2000/06/14/love/print.html|work=Salon|title=Courtney Love does the math (unedited speech transcript)|date=14 May 2000|accessdate=1 August 2010|author=Love, Courtney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love has also been an advocate for [[gay rights]]; during a 1997 award speech at VH1's Fashion Awards, Love said &quot;I think that great personal style is being true to yourself and speaking your mind, which, since I'm up here, I'm going to do... I feel that keeping gay people in the closet with our actions and attitudes is cruel and tacky, and most of all, it's boring. I think we need to respect each other and ourselves, and who we are, and what we are, and not be afraid to be what we are, whether we're gay, or straight, or... insane.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=1997 VH1 Fashion Awards|network=VH1|airdate=28 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love voted against California's [[Proposition 8]] during the 2008 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grrlplanet.com/courtney-love-gay-marriage-butt-plug/|work=Grrl Planet|title=Courtney Love supports you, in a kind of scary way|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love is also self-identified [[feminist]],&lt;ref name=&quot;peoplevscourtney&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2006/11/06/courtney_scrapbook/print.html|work=Salon|title=The people vs. Courtney Love|author=Levy, Lisa|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism|author=Heywood, Leslie; Drake, Jennifer|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn= 0-8166-3005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theme that has not only come across in her music, but in her own persona. Love was written about in the journal ''[[Bad Subjects]]'' for her [[subversive]] [[feminism]] and &quot;slut/diva&quot; image, and her &quot;self-conscious parody of female sex roles&quot;, which is often misinterpreted because the public &quot;only sees the 'slut' without the critique of the system that creates categories like 'slut.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slut&quot; /&gt;

In more recent years, Love has been known for her frequent usage of [[social networking]] sites such as [[Twitter]]. In January 2011, it was announced that Love was being sued for [[defamation]] of fashion designer Dawn Simorangkir, whom Love referred to as a &quot;drug-pushing prostitute&quot; in a Twitter posting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8241912/Courtney-Love-Twitter-trial-are-tweets-facts-or-opinions.html|title=Courtney Love Twitter trial: are tweets facts or opinions?|work=The Telegraph|date=5 January 2011|author=Beckford, Martin|accessdate=2011-02-08|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, which is reportedly the first of its kind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/73360,people,entertainment,courtney-love-sued-over-twitter-prostitute-rant|work=The First Post|date=2011-01-06|title=Courtney Love sued over Twitter ‘prostitute’ rant|author=Taylor, Sophie|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set for a court hearing in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/fashion/2011/01/06/2011-01-06_courtney_love_sued_for_defamation_over_twitter_designer_sez_loves_crazy_tweets_r.html|work=New York Daily News|title=Courtney Love Twitter defamation trial starts in Feb|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=2011-01-29|first=Lindsay|last=Goldwert}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Love's attorneys settled the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Montreal Gazette|date=8 March 2011|accessdate=2011-03-09|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Love+lacks+character+Twitter/4399809/story.html|title=Courtney Love lacks character on Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and musical style==
Love has often cited [[New Wave music|new wave]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] groups/musicians as being great influences on her; such musical acts as [[Echo and the Bunnymen]], [[The Smiths]], and [[Joy Division]] have been mentioned by Love, including songs by several of them being covered by Hole in live performances and, in some cases, studio recordings as album [[B-sides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egigs.co.uk/index.php?a=13490|work=EGigs|title=Hole/Little Fish — Brixton Academy|author=Jones, Craig|date=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Doll Parts'' single. ©1995 DGC/Geffen Records. &quot;Do It Clean&quot; lyrics by Echo and the Bunnymen&lt;/ref&gt; In the early '90s, Hole as a group was greatly influenced by [[no wave]] music— in the initial advertisement placed by Love which resulted in Hole's formation, she cited [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Big Black]] as her three major musical influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;wkkc54&quot; /&gt;

In a 1995 interview with [[Kurt Loder]], Love divulged that in the late 1980s, guitarist [[Joe Strummer]] of [[The Clash]] told her that she was &quot;the worst guitar player he'd ever heard&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;loder&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|work=MTV|title=The Hole Story|author=Loder, Kurt; Love, Courtney|date=1 September 1994|airdate=14 February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she insisted she had improved by the early 1990s: &quot;I'm fine... I have my style... and, you know what's funny, is most of the songs [from ''Pretty on the Inside''] are complete [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] rip-offs.&quot; During the same interview, Love said she was greatly influenced by guitarists [[Will Sergeant]] of Echo and the Bunnymen and [[Johnny Marr]] of the Smiths.&lt;ref name=&quot;loder&quot; /&gt;

Although emphasis on new wave and punk rock influence has been noted by Love as well as critics, her favorite artists vary across genres and time periods. In her teenage years, Love was cited listening to jazz and lounge singers such as [[Billie Holliday]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], as well as punk rock acts such as [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[The Dead Kennedys]].&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot; /&gt; Over the course of Hole's career, the band has done various live and studio covers from a wide array of artists, such as: [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Wipers]], [[The Germs]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Donovan]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Neil Young]], [[Leadbelly]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Carole King]].

Although Hole's sound changed over the course of the band's career, the pretty/ugly dynamic has often been noted as a consistent theme in Love's music, most prominently in Hole's first two studio albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;oct91&quot;&gt;{{cite article|work=Spin|date=October 1991|title=Hole Lotta Love|pages=32|author=Von Furth, Daisy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the extremes between beauty and ugliness, Love's musical style has also been remarked for its layering of harsh and abrasive riffs which often bury more sophisticated musical arrangements.&lt;ref name=&quot;oct91&quot; /&gt; Upon the release of ''Pretty on the Inside'', the album was lauded for its &quot;fascination with the repulsive aspects of L.A.— superficiality, sexism, violence, and drugs.&quot; In Love's later musical career, however, on both ''Celebrity Skin'' and her solo ''America's Sweetheart'', Los Angeles and the state of [[California]] was cast in a different light; such songs as &quot;Malibu&quot;, &quot;Sunset Marquis&quot;, and &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; all highlight aspects of the glamourous nature of L.A. and its relationship with Love's own life. ''Celebrity Skin'' has been referred to as Love's &quot;personal love letter to Los Angeles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;

In terms of musical equipment, Love has used several different guitars during her career. In 1989 and the early 1990s, Love was seen several times with a [[Rickenbacker]] onstage, and, more often, a [[Fender Jazzmaster]], which she played in the music video for &quot;[[Miss World (song)|Miss World]]&quot;; Love's Jazzmaster is now on display at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;jazzmaster&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/rustysheriff/4373963261/|work=Flickr|title=Courtney Love (Hole) Jazzmaster Fender Guitar - Hard Rock Cafe NYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later '90s, Love played several [[Fender Stratocaster]]s, as well as her own line of [[Squier Venus]] guitars. Most recently, in 2010, Love played a [[Rickenbacker 360]] while touring.

==Legacy==
Once labelled by ''Rolling Stone'' as ''&quot;the most controversial woman in the history of rock&quot;'',&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt; Love has been influential in the music world, particularly in the area of [[alternative rock]] and female-driven musical acts. 

Most notable has been her vision of female potential in rock music&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblog&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/04/live-review-hole-at-the-henry-fonda-theater.html|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Live Review: Hole at the Music Box|date=23 April 2010|author=Brown, August|accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—an industry and art form that has been notorious for its male dominance. Of the slew of female-driven rock and punk bands that emerged in the 1990s—from alternative punk bands such as [[L7 (band)|L7]] to &quot;[[riot grrrl]]&quot; musical acts like [[Bikini Kill]]—Hole was also perhaps the most successful of its time, garnering a widespread fanbase, critical accolades, and notable album sales.

Likewise, Love has been cited as a [[gay icon]] by several [[LGBT]] publications, such as ''[[The Advocate]]'', probably due to her perseverance and endurance through adverse situations in her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLADV&quot;&gt;{{cite article|work=The Advocate|date=17 August 1997|title=Evens that shaped the under-30 mind|author=Romseburg, Don; Finlay, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love's devoted gay fanbase was later written about in a [http://www.nypress.com/article-21137-unconditional-love.html New York Press article] when Hole released their fourth album in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;UL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/article-21137-unconditional-love.html|work=New York Press|title=Unconditional Love|author=Russell, John|date=21 April 2010|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, John Russel writes: {{c quote|Of course, it’s never been easy to be a Courtney Love fan. Even when she was at the top of her game there was always some kind of controversy, some reason to write her off as either a sell-out or a nut job, or both. And people don’t exactly take you seriously when you say that you love Courtney Love. Rock snobs—straight guys in particular—tend to turn their noses up at you... [gay men] adopted Courtney as their patron saint while others knelt at the altar of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. And while riot grrrl culture may have long ago disowned her, Love’s queer fanbase doggedly sticks by her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UL&quot; /&gt;}}

In more recent years, Love's presence in music has been noted: in 2004, ''Spin'' magazine ranked Love #18 in their list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Rock Frontmen Of All Time&quot;, calling her &quot;a great band leader because onstage or off, she always makes sure we're paying attention&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|work=Spin|date=2004|title=The 50 Greatest Rock Frontmen Of All Time|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Love ranked at #14 in ''Q Magazine'''s list of &quot;100 Women Who Rock the World&quot;. [[The Biography Channel]] called Love &quot;outspoken, brash, and sometimes out of control&quot;, and &quot;one of alternative rock's most fascinating figures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Courtney-Love-9542145|work=A&amp;E Networks|title=Courtney Love Biography: Biography.com|accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannibalism''' (from Caníbales, the Spanish name for the [[Carib people]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cannibalism?r=66 |title=Cannibalism Definition |publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a West Indies tribe formerly well known for their practice of cannibalism),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92701/cannibalism Cannibalism (human behaviour)]&quot;, Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh of other human beings. It is also called [[anthropophagy]].  A person who practices cannibalism is called a '''cannibal'''.

While the expression &quot;cannibalism&quot; has origins in the act of humans eating other humans, it has extended into [[zoology]] to mean [[cannibalism (zoology)|the act of any animal consuming members of its own type or kind]], including the [[sexual cannibalism|consumption of mates]].

A related word, &quot;cannibalize&quot; (from which &quot;[[cannibalization]]&quot; is derived), has several meanings which are [[metaphor]]ically derived from cannibalism and originally referred to the reuse of military parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cannibalize Cannibalize in On-line Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[manufacturing]], it can refer to reuse of salvageable parts.

Cannibalism has been occasionally practiced as a last resort by people suffering from [[famine]]. Occasionally it has occurred in modern times. A famous example is the crash of [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]], after which some survivors ate the bodies of dead passengers. Also, some mentally ill individuals obsess about eating others and actually do so, such as [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and [[Albert Fish]]. There is a resistance to formally labelling cannibalism as a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;strightdope&quot;&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2515/eat-or-be-eaten Eat or be eaten: Is cannibalism a pathology as listed in the DSM-IV?] [[The Straight Dope]] by Cecil Adams. Retrieved 16 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of cannibalism has been featured in religion, mythology, fairy stories and in works of art; for example, cannibalism has been depicted in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' by the French lithographer [[Théodore Géricault]] in 1819. It has been satirized in popular culture, as in Monty Python's  [[Lifeboat sketch]].

==Reasons for cannibalism==
The reasons for cannibalism include the following:
*As sanctioned by a [[cultural norm]]
*By necessity in extreme situations of [[famine]]
*[[Self-cannibalism]] is a form of major self-injury usually as a result of major mental illness.
*Caused by [[insanity]] or [[Social deviance|social deviancy]] (Cannibalism is not mentioned in the formal index of insanity, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The medical literature on the topic is likewise sparse.&lt;ref name=&quot;strightdope&quot;/&gt;)
There are fundamentally two kinds of cannibalistic social behavior: [[endocannibalism]] (eating humans from the same community) and [[exocannibalism]] (eating humans from other communities).

A separate ethical distinction can be made to delineate between the practice of [[Murder|killing]] a human for food (homicidal cannibalism) versus eating the flesh of a person who was already dead ([[Necrophagy#As a human behaviour|necro-cannibalism]]).

==Overview==
The [[social stigma]] against cannibalism has been used as an aspect of propaganda against an enemy by accusing them of acts of cannibalism to separate them from their [[human nature|humanity]].
The [[Carib people|Carib]] tribe in the [[Lesser Antilles]], from whom the word cannibalism derives, for example, acquired a long-standing reputation as cannibals following the recording of their legends  in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief history&quot;/&gt; Some controversy exists over the accuracy of these legends and the prevalence of actual cannibalism in the culture.

During their period of expansion in the 15th through 17th centuries, Europeans equated cannibalism with evil and savagery. In the 16th century, [[Pope Innocent IV]] declared cannibalism a sin deserving to be punished by Christians through force of arms and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain decreed that Spanish colonists could only legally enslave natives who were cannibals, giving the colonists an economic interest in making such allegations. This was used as a justification for employing violent means to subjugate native people. This theme dates back to Columbus' accounts of a supposedly ferocious group of cannibals who lived in the Caribbean islands and parts of South America called the Caniba, which gave us the word cannibal.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief history&quot;&gt;[http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_cannibalism_pt2.htm Brief history of cannibal controversies]; David F. Salisbury, August 15, 2001, ''[http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/ Exploration]'', Vanderbuilt University.&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known case of mortuary cannibalism is that of the [[Fore (people)|Fore]] tribe in [[New Guinea]] which resulted in the spread of the [[prion]] disease [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lindenbaum S |title=Review.

However, some scholars argue that although post-mortem dismemberment was the practice during funeral rites, cannibalism was not. [[Marvin Harris]] theorizes that it happened during a famine period coincident with the arrival of Europeans and was rationalized as a religious rite.

In pre-modern medicine, an explanation for cannibalism stated that it came about within a black acrimonious [[four humours|humour]], which, being lodged in the linings of the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], produced the voracity for human flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0147&amp;q1=anthropophagy |publisher=&quot;1728 Cyclopaedia&quot;|title=Anthropophagy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannibalism has been occasionally practiced as a last resort by people suffering from [[famine]].
* In colonial [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], colonists resorted to cannibalism during a period known as the [[Starving Time]], from 1609–1610. After food supplies were diminished, some colonists began to dig up corpses for food. During this time period, one man was persuaded to confess to having killed, salted, and eaten his pregnant wife before he was burned alive as punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Winter07/jamestown.cfm |title=The official site of Colonial Williamsburg&amp;nbsp;— Things which seame incredible: Cannibalism in Early Jamestown |publisher=History.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The accounts of the sinking of the ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727 reported cannibalism amongst the survivors during their two weeks on a small boat in the mid-atlantic.

Pearce was captured near Hobart and confessed that he and the other escapees had successively killed and cannibalised members of their group over a period of weeks, he being the last survivor.
* In the US, the group of settlers known as the [[Donner Party]] resorted to cannibalism while snowbound in the mountains for the winter of 1846–47.

* [[Lowell Thomas]] records the cannibalization of some of the surviving crew members of the ship [[Dumaru]] after it exploded and sank during the First World War in his book, ''The Wreck of the Dumaru'' (1930). Another case of shipwrecked survivors forced to engage in cannibalism was that of the [[Medusa (ship)|''Medusa'']], a French vessel which in 1816 ran aground on the [[Arguin Bank|''Banc d'Arguin'']] (''English: The Bank of Arguin'') off the coast of Africa, about sixty miles distant from shore.
* In 1972, the survivors of [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]], consisting of the rugby team from [[Stella Maris College (Montevideo)|Stella Maris College]] in [[Montevideo]] and some of their family members, resorted to cannibalism while trapped at the crash site. They had been stranded since 13 October 1972 and rescue operations at the crash site did not begin until 22 December 1972. The story of the survivors was chronicled in [[Piers Paul Read]]'s 1974 book, ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]'', in a 1993 film adaptation of the book, called simply [[Alive (1993 film)|''Alive'']], and in a 2008 documentary:  [[Stranded: I Have Come from a Plane That Crashed in the Mountains|''Stranded: I’ve Come From a Plane That Crashed on the Mountains'']].
* Jared Diamond has suggested in his ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|Collapse]]'' that cannibalism took place on [[Easter Island]] after the construction of the [[Moai]] contributed to [[Natural environment|environment]]al degradation when extreme [[deforestation]] destabilized an already precarious [[ecosystem]].

Cannibalism
features in many mythologies, and is most often attributed to evil
characters or as extreme retribution for some wrong. Examples include
the [[witch]] in ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' and [[Baba Yaga]] of [[Slavic folklore]].

A number of stories in [[Greek mythology]] involve cannibalism, in particular cannibalism of close family members, for example the stories of [[Thyestes]], [[Tereus]] and especially [[Cronus]], who was [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] in the Roman pantheon. The story of [[Tantalus]] also parallels this. These mythologies inspired Shakespeare's cannibalism scene in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.

[[Hindu]] mythology describes evil demons called &quot;[[asura]]&quot; or &quot;[[rakshasa]]&quot; that dwell in the forests and practice extreme violence including devouring their own kind, and possess many evil supernatural powers. These are however the Hindu equivalent of &quot;demons&quot; and do not relate to actual tribes of forest-dwelling people. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The ''[[Wendigo]]'' (also ''Windigo'', ''Weendigo'', ''Windago'', ''Windiga'', ''Witiko'', ''Wihtikow'', and numerous other variants) is a mythical creature appearing in the [[Native American mythology|mythology]] of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people. It is a malevolent cannibalistic spirit into which humans could transform, or which could [[spiritual possession|possess]] humans.

Unsubstantiated reports of cannibalism disproportionately relate cases of cannibalism among cultures that are already otherwise despised, feared, or are little known. In antiquity, Greek reports of cannibalism, (often called ''anthropophagy'' in this context) were related to distant non-Hellenic [[barbarians]], or else relegated in [[Greek mythology]] to the 'primitive' [[chthonic]] world that preceded the coming of the Olympian gods: see the explicit rejection of human sacrifice in the cannibal feast prepared for the Olympians by [[Tantalus]] of his son [[Pelops]]. All South Sea Islanders were cannibals so far as their enemies were concerned. When the [[whaleship Essex]] was rammed and sunk by a whale in 1820, the captain opted to sail 3000 miles upwind to [[Chile]] rather than 1400 miles downwind to the [[Marquesas]] because he had heard the Marquesans were cannibals. Ironically many of the survivors of the shipwreck resorted to cannibalism in order to survive.

However, [[Herman Melville]] happily lived with the Marquesan Typees (Taipi), rumored to have been the most vicious of the island group's cannibal tribes, but also may have witnessed evidence of cannibalism. In his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Typee]]'', he reports seeing [[shrunken heads]] and having strong evidence that the tribal leaders ceremonially consumed the bodies of killed warriors of the neighboring tribe after a skirmish.

[[William Arens]], author of ''The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy'',&lt;ref&gt;(New York : Oxford University Press, 1979; ISBN 0-19-502793-0)&lt;/ref&gt; questions the credibility of reports of cannibalism and argues that the description by one group of people of another people as cannibals is a consistent and demonstrable ideological and rhetorical device to establish perceived [[Cultural imperialism|cultural superiority]]. Arens bases his thesis on a detailed analysis of numerous &quot;classic&quot; cases of cultural cannibalism cited by explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists. His findings were that many were steeped in racism, unsubstantiated, or based on second-hand or hearsay evidence. In combing the literature he could not find a single credible eye-witness account. And, as he points out, the hallmark of ethnography is the observation of a practice prior to description. In the end he concluded that cannibalism was not the widespread prehistoric practice it was claimed to be; that anthropologists were too quick to pin the cannibal label on a group based not on responsible research but on our own [[culturally determined]] pre-conceived notions, often motivated by a need to exoticize. He wrote:
{{quote|
Anthropologists have made no serious attempt to disabuse the public of the widespread notion of the ubiquity of anthropophagists.&amp;nbsp;... in the deft hands and fertile imaginations of anthropologists, former or contemporary anthropophagists have multiplied with the advance of civilization and fieldwork in formerly unstudied culture areas. ...The existence of man-eating peoples just beyond the pale of civilization is a common ethnographic suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Arens' findings are controversial, and have been cited as an example of [[postcolonial]] [[historical revisionism|revisionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Taylor, ''The Buried Soul: How Humans Invented Death'', Pages 58–60, Fourth Estate 2002&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is often mischaracterized as &quot;cannibals do not and never did exist&quot;,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} when in the end the book is actually a call for a more responsible and reflective approach to anthropological research. At any rate, the book ushered in an era of rigorous combing of the cannibalism literature. By Arens' later admission, some cannibalism claims came up short, others were reinforced.

Conversely, [[Michel de Montaigne]]'s essay &quot;Of cannibals&quot; introduced a new multicultural note in European civilization. Montaigne wrote that &quot;one calls 'barbarism' whatever he is not accustomed to.&quot; By using a title like that and describing a fair indigean society, Montaigne may have wished to provoke a surprise in the reader of his ''Essays''.

===Pre-history===
Some anthropologists, such as [[Tim White (anthropologist)|Tim White]], suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period. This theory is based on the large amount of &quot;butchered human&quot; bones found in [[Neanderthal]] and other Lower/Middle Paleolithic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-TVHr_XtDJcC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=paleolithic+cannibalism|title= Once were Cannibals |work=Evolution: A Scientific American Reader|author=Tim D white |accessdate=2008-02-14 |isbn=9780226742694 |date=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannibalism in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061205-cannibals.html|title=Neandertals Turned to Cannibalism, Bone Cave Suggests |work=National Geographic News |author=James Owen |accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gough's Cave]], [[England]], remains of human bones and skulls, around 15,000 years old, suggest that cannibalism took place amongst the people living in or visiting the cave,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKie|first=Robin|title=Bones from a Cheddar Gorge cave show that cannibalism helped Britain's earliest settlers survive the ice age|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jun/20/ice-age-cannibals-britain-earliest-settlers|accessdate=20 June 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2010-06-20|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they may have used human skulls as [[Skull cup|drinking vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bello, Silvia M.

According to one historical account, aboriginal tribes of Australia were most certainly cannibals, never failing to eat persons killed in a fight and always eating men noted for their fighting ability who died natural deaths. &quot;... out of pity and consideration for the body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seqhistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99%3Apart1chpt3&amp;catid=42%3Atom-petrie&amp;Itemid=67&amp;limitstart=2|title=Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland |author=Petrie, C.C. |accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Cannibalism is mentioned many times in early history and literature.  It is reported in the [[Bible]] during the siege of [[Samaria]] (2 Kings 6:25–30).  Two women made a pact to eat their children; after the first mother cooked her child the second mother ate it but refused to reciprocate by cooking her own child.  A similar story is reported by [[Flavius Josephus]] during the siege of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 AD, and the population of Numantia during the Roman [[Siege of Numantia]] in the 2nd century BC was reduced to cannibalism and suicide.

As in modern times, though, reports of cannibalism were often told as apocryphal second and third-hand stories, with widely varying levels of accuracy.  [[St. Jerome]], in his letter ''[[Against Jovinianus]]'', discusses how people come to their present condition as a result of their heritage, and then lists several examples of peoples and their customs.  In the list, he mentions that he has heard that [[Attacotti|Atticoti]] eat human flesh and that [[Massagetae]] and ''Derbices'' (a people on the borders of India) kill and eat old people.(The [[Tibareni]] crucify those whom they have loved before when they have grown old).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Researchers have found physical evidence of cannibalism in ancient times.  In 2001, archaeologists at the University of Bristol found evidence of [[Iron Age]] cannibalism in Gloucestershire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2001/cannibal.htm Cannibalistic Celts discovered in South Gloucestershire] March 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Cannibalism was practiced as recently as 2000 years ago in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/090320-druids-sacrifice-cannibalism_2.html Druids Committed Human Sacrifice, Cannibalism?]&quot;. National Geographic.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, Emil Carthaus and Dr. Bruno Bernhard have observed 1,891 signs of cannibalism in the [[caves]] at the [[Hönne]] (1000 - 700 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.stefan-enste.de/Kannibalen.htm&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DEmil%2BCarthaus%2Band%2BDr.%2BBruno%2BBernhard%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Dactive%26sa%3DG&amp;usg=ALkJrhhVezKvVpi4Z3xeq5QQBMs-rX4L_Q &quot;Cannibalism in Westphalia?&quot;] Stefan Enste.

===Middle Ages===
[[Image:Blake Hell 33 Ugolino.jpg|alt=Painting of a bearded man and four children huddled on a stone floor with two large angels overhead.| thumb|Ugolino and his sons in their cell, as painted by [[William Blake]] circa 1826. [[Ugolino della Gherardesca]] was an Italian [[nobility|nobleman]] that, together with his sons Gaddo and Uguccione and his grand-sons Nino and Anselmuccio were detained in the [[Torre dei Gualandi|Muda]], in March 1289. The keys were thrown into the [[Arno]] river and the prisoners left to starve. According to [[Dante]], the prisoners were slowly starved to death and before dying Ugolino's children begged him to eat their bodies.]]
During the Muslim-Qurayš wars in the early 7th century, cases of cannibalism have been reported. Following at the [[Battle of Uhud]] in 625, it is said that after killing [[Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Hamzah ibn Abdu l-Muṭṭalib]], his liver was consumed by [[Hind bint Utbah|Hind bint ‘Utbah]] (the wife of Abû Sufyan ibn Harb one of the commanders of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Qurayš]] army)&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq (1955){{clarify|date=November 2010}} 380—388, cited in Peters (1994){{clarify|date=November 2010}} p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; who later converted to Islam and became the mother of [[Muawiyah I]] founder of the Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]].

Reports of cannibalism were also recorded during the [[First Crusade]], as  Crusaders  fed on the bodies of their dead opponents following the [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan]]. [[Amin Maalouf]] also discusses further cannibalism incidents on the march to [[Jerusalem]], and to the efforts made to delete mention of these from western history. The inhabitants of Hungary (which the Crusader marched through to reach the Holy Land ) were also reported to be cannibals, as the Hungarians had only converted from paganism to Christianity in the 10th century.
In fact, the French word for Hungarian, '''hongre'', may be the source of the English word ''ogre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Maalouf, Amin |title=The Crusades Through Arab Eyes |publisher= [[Schocken Books]] |location=New York |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=0-8052-0898-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Europe's [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] there were many reports of cannibalism among the starving populations.  In North Africa, as in Europe, there are references to cannibalism as a last resort in times of [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/196038 Cannibalism in Early Modern North Africa], British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim explorer [[Ibn Batutta]] reported that one African king advised him that nearby people were cannibals (though this may have been a prank played on Ibn Batutta by the king in order to fluster his guest). However Batutta reported that Arabs and Christians were safe , as their flesh was &quot;unripe&quot; and would cause the eater to fall ill.

For a brief time in Europe, an unusual form of cannibalism occurred when thousands of [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies as a commodity|Egyptian mummies]] preserved in [[bitumen]] were ground up and sold as medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice developed into a wide-scale business which flourished until the late 16th century. This &quot;fad&quot; ended because the mummies were revealed actually to be recently killed slaves. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties against bleeding, and were sold as [[pharmaceutical]]s in powdered form (see [[Mellified Man|human mummy confection]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Daly flesh&quot;&gt;Quotes from [[John Sanderson (merchant)|John Sanderson]]'s ''Travels'' (1586) in ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0029-5132(199423)28%3A1%3C24%3ATOOODV%3E2.0.CO%3B2-8 That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy]'', [[Nicholas Daly]], NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Autumn, 1994), pp. 24–51. doi:10.2307/1345912{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]] during the [[Tang Dynasty]], cannibalism was supposedly resorted to by rebel forces early in the period (who were said to raid neighboring areas for victims to eat), as well as both soldiers and civilians besieged during the rebellion of [[An Lushan Rebellion|An Lushan]]. Eating an enemy's heart and liver was also claimed to be a feature of both official punishments and private vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benn |first=Charles |title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517665-0 |pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to cannibalizing the enemy has also been seen in poetry written in the [[Song Dynasty]], though the cannibalizing is perhaps poetic symbolism, expressing hatred towards the enemy (see ''[[Man Jiang Hong]]'').

While there is universal agreement that some [[Mesoamerican]] people practiced [[human sacrifice]], there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether [[cannibalism in pre-Columbian America]] was widespread. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of ''[[Cannibals and Kings]]'', has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the [[Aztec]] diet was lacking in [[protein]]s. While most pre-Columbian historians believe that there was ritual cannibalism related to human sacrifices, they do not support Harris's thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DE1F3DF935A35752C0A961948260 To Aztecs, Cannibalism Was a Status Symbol], New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/montellano.htm |title=Aztec Cannibalism: An Ecological Necessity? |publisher=Latinamericanstudies.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R.

===Early modern era===
European explorers and colonizers brought home many stories of cannibalism practiced by the native peoples they encountered.  The friar [[Diego de Landa]] reported about [[Yucatán]] instances,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=De Landa|first=Diego|title=Yucatán before and after the Conquest|year=1978|publisher=Dover|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been similar reports by Purchas from Popayán, [[Colombia]], and from the [[Marquesas Islands]] of [[Polynesia]], where human flesh was called ''long pig''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Louis Stevenson in the South Seas|year=1987|publisher=Luzac Paragon House|pages=45–50|editor=Alanna King}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hans Egede]], the [[Inuit]]s, when they killed a witch, ate a portion of her heart.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Cannibalism Cannibalism]&quot;. The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recorded about the natives of the captaincy of [[Sergipe]] in [[Brazil]], &quot;They eat human flesh when they can get it, and if a woman miscarries devour the abortive immediately. If she goes her time out, she herself cuts the [[umbilical cord|navel-string]] with a [[seashell|shell]], which she boils along with the [[placenta|secondine]], and eats them both.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;E. Bowen, 1747: 532&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1913 ''Handbook of Indians of Canada'', (reprinting 1907 material from the Bureau of American Ethnology) claims that North American natives practicing cannibalism included &quot;...the [[Innu|Montagnais]], and some of the tribes of [[Maine]]; the [[Algonquin people|Algonkin]], [[Armouchiquois]], [[Iroquois]], and [[Micmac]]; farther west the [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Cree]], [[Fox (tribe)|Foxes]], [[Chippewa]], [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]], [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Illinois (tribe)|Illinois]], [[Sioux]], and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]]; in the South the people who built the mounds in [[Florida]], and the [[Tonkawa]], [[Attacapa]], [[Karankawa]], [[Caddo]], and [[Comanche]] (?); in the Northwest and West, portions of the continent, the [[Thlingchadinneh]] and other [[Athapascan]] tribes, the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Heiltsuk people|Heiltsuk]], [[Kwakiutl]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]], [[Siksika]], some of the [[California]]n tribes, and the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]. There is also a tradition of the practice among the [[Hopi]], and mentions of the custom among other tribes of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]. The [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], and the [[Attacapa]], [[Tonkawa]], and other [[Texas]] tribes were known to their neighbours as 'man-eaters.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/cannibalism.htm cannibalism], James WHITE, ed., Handbook of Indians of Canada, Published as an Appendix to the Tenth Report of the Geographic Board of Canada, Ottawa, 1913, 632p., pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of cannibalism described included both resorting to human flesh during famines and ritual cannibalism, the latter usually consisting of eating a small portion of an enemy warrior. See also [[Captives in American Indian Wars]].


As with most lurid tales of native cannibalism, these stories are treated with a great deal of scrutiny, as accusations of cannibalism were often used as justifications for the subjugation or destruction of &quot;savages&quot;. However, there were several well-documented cultures that engaged in regular eating of the dead, such as New Zealand's [[Māori people|Māori]].  In one infamous 1809 incident, 66 passengers and crew of the ship the Boyd were killed and eaten by Māori on the Whangaroa peninsula, Northland. (''See also: [[Boyd massacre]]'')  Cannibalism was already a regular practice in Māori wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=252&amp;objectid=10462390 'Battle rage' fed Maori cannibalism], 8 September 2007 - Maori news&amp;nbsp;— NZ Herald&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, on 11 July 1821 warriors from the Ngapuhi tribe killed 2,000 enemies and remained on the battlefield &quot;eating the vanquished until they were driven off by the smell of decaying bodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HongiHika/HongiHika/en HONGI HIKA (c. 1780–1828) Ngapuhi war chief], the Encyclopedia of New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; Māori warriors fighting the New Zealand government in [[Titokowaru's War]] in New Zealand's North Island in 1868–69 revived ancient rites of cannibalism as part of the radical Hauhau movement of the [[Pai Marire]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c20.html James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume II, 1922.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other islands in the Pacific were home to cultures that allowed cannibalism to some degree.  The dense population of [[Marquesas Islands]], [[Polynesia]], was concentrated in the narrow valleys, and consisted of warring tribes, who sometimes practiced cannibalism on their enemies. In parts of [[Melanesia]], cannibalism was still practiced in the early 20th century, for a variety of reasons&amp;nbsp;— including retaliation, to insult an enemy people, or to absorb the dead person's qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/oceania/whonsbon-aston1961.html &quot;Melanesia Historical and Geographical: the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides&quot;], ''Southern Cross'' n°1, London: 1950&lt;/ref&gt; One tribal chief, Ratu [[Udre Udre]] in Rakiraki, [[Fiji]], is said to have consumed 872 people and to have made a pile of stones to record his achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040929012220/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gwr5/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54265 Most Prolific Cannibal] ''Guiness Book of World Records'' Internet Archive Wayback Machine 2004-09-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday. &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=SYW6EzB9rYkC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Divine hunger: cannibalism as a cultural system]''&quot;. p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; The ferocity of the cannibal lifestyle deterred European sailors from going near Fijian waters, giving Fiji the name ''Cannibal Isles''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;It was considered a great triumph among the Marquesans to eat the body of a dead man. They treated their captives with great cruelty. They broke their legs to prevent them from attempting to escape before being eaten, but kept them alive so that they could brood over their impending fate. ... With this tribe, as with many others, the bodies of women were in great demand. ... &quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This period of time was also rife with instances of explorers and seafarers resorting to cannibalism for survival.  The survivors of the sinking of the French ship ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Méduse]]'' in 1816 resorted to cannibalism after four days adrift on a raft and their plight was made famous by [[Théodore Géricault]]'s painting [[Raft of the Medusa]].  After the sinking of the [[Essex (whaleship)|''Essex'']] of [[Nantucket]] by a whale, on November 20, 1820, (an important source event for [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'') the survivors, in three small boats, resorted, by common consent, to cannibalism in order for some to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A671492 |title=The Wreck of the Whaleship Essex |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir [[John Franklin]]'s lost polar expedition is another example of cannibalism out of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keenleyside |first=Anne |title=The final days of the Franklin expedition: new skeletal evidence Arctic 50(1) 36-36 1997 |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic50-1-36.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On land, the [[Donner Party]] found itself stranded by snow in [[Donner Pass|a high mountain pass]] in California without adequate supplies during the [[Mexican-American War]], leading to several instances of cannibalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, Kristin 1996&quot;&gt;Johnson, Kristin (ed.)(1996). Unfortunate Emigrants: Narratives of the Donner Party, Utah State University Press. ISBN 0874212049&lt;/ref&gt; Another notorious cannibal was [[mountain man]] [[Boone Helm]], who was known as &quot;The Kentucky Cannibal,&quot; for eating several of his fellow travelers from 1850 until his eventual hanging in 1864. 

The case of ''[[R v. Dudley and Stephens]]'' (1884) 14 QBD 273 (QB) is an English case which dealt with four crew members of an English yacht, the ''Mignonette'', who were cast away in a storm some {{convert|1600|mi|km}} from the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. After several days one of the crew, a seventeen year old cabin boy, fell unconscious due to a combination of the famine and drinking seawater. The others (one possibly objecting) decided then to kill him and eat him. They were picked up four days later. Two of the three survivors were found guilty of murder. A significant outcome of this case was that [[necessity]] was determined to be no defence against a charge of murder.

American consul [[James W. Davidson]] described in his 1903 book, ''The Island of Formosa'' how the Chinese in Taiwan ate and traded in the flesh of [[Taiwanese aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Davidson | first = James Wheeler | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Island of Formosa, Past and Present | publisher = Macmillan &amp; Co. | year = 1903 | location = | page = 255 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Casement]] writing to a consular colleague in Lisbon on 3 August 1903 from Lake Mantumba in the Congo Free State said: &quot;The people round here are all cannibals. You never saw such a weird looking lot in your life. There are also dwarfs (called Batwas) in the forest who are even worse cannibals than the taller human environment. They eat man flesh raw! It's a fact.&quot;  Casement then added how assailants would &quot;bring down a dwarf on the way home, for the marital cooking pot...The Dwarfs, as I say, dispense with cooking pots and eat and drink their human prey fresh cut on the battlefield while the blood is still warm and running. These are not fairy tales my dear Cowper but actual gruesome reality in the heart of this poor, benighted savage land.&quot; (National Library of Ireland, MS 36,201/3)

===Modern era===
==== World War II ====

Many instances of cannibalism by necessity were recorded during World War II.  For example, during the 872-day [[Siege of Leningrad]], reports of cannibalism began to appear in the winter of 1941–1942, after all birds, rats and pets were eaten by survivors.  Leningrad police even formed a special division to combat cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://it.stlawu.edu/~rkreuzer/pcavallerano/leningradweb.htm |title=900-Day Siege of Leningrad |publisher=It.stlawu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?id=7014&amp;action=tdihArticleCategory |title=This Day in History 1941: Siege of Leningrad begins |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Soviet victory at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] it was found that some German soldiers in the besieged city, cut off from supplies, resorted to cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Later, in February 1943, roughly 100,000 German soldiers were taken [[prisoner of war]] (POW). Almost all of them were sent to POW camps in [[Siberia]] or [[Central Asia]] where, due to being chronically underfed by their Soviet captors, many resorted to cannibalism. Fewer than 5,000 of the prisoners taken at Stalingrad survived captivity. The majority, however, died early in their imprisonment due to exposure or sickness brought on by conditions in the surrounded army before the surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege.'' Penguin Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian War Crimes Section of the [[Tokyo tribunal]], led by prosecutor [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] (the future Judge-in-Chief), collected numerous written reports and testimonies that documented  Japanese soldiers' acts of cannibalism among their own troops, on enemy dead, and on Allied prisoners of war in many parts of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;In September 1942, Japanese daily rations on New Guinea consisted of 800 grams of rice and tinned meat. However, by December, this had fallen to 50 grams.

''Hidden horrors: Japanese War Crimes in World War II'', Westview Press, 1996, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, flesh was cut from living people. An Indian POW, [[Lance Naik]] Hatam Ali (later a citizen of Pakistan), testified that in New Guinea: &quot;the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles [80&amp;nbsp;km] away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill Books, 2002, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-documented case occurred in [[Chichijima]] in February 1945, when Japanese soldiers killed and consumed five American airmen. This case was investigated in 1947 in a war crimes trial, and of 30 Japanese soldiers prosecuted, five (Maj. Matoba, Gen. Tachibana, Adm. Mori, Capt. Yoshii, and Dr. Teraki) were found guilty and hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| format = PDF | url = http://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/welch_naval_MCs.pdf | title = Without a Hangman, Without a Rope: Navy War Crimes Trials After World War II | chapter = Cannibalism | last = Welch | first = JM | journal = International Journal of Naval History | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | month = April | year = 2002 | accessdate = 2007-12-03 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''[[Flyboys: A True Story of Courage]]'', [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] details several instances of cannibalism of World War II Allied prisoners by their Japanese captors.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{Cite book

==== Papua New Guinea====

The [[Korowai]] tribe of south-eastern [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] could be one of the last surviving tribes in the world engaging in cannibalism, although there have been media reports of soldiers/rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Liberia eating body parts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childexploitation.org/soldiers.html Child Soldiers, children soldiers, boy soldiers, girl soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt; to intimidate child soldiers or captives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2006/02/14/BrownstoneMagazine/Forgotten.War-2397297.shtml Forgotten War], Brownstone magazine{{dead link|date=December 2010|url=http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2006/02/14/BrownstoneMagazine/Forgotten.War-2397297.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Marvin Harris]] has analysed cannibalism and other [[taboo food and drink|food taboos]].
He argued that it was common when humans lived in small bands, but disappeared in the transition to states, the [[Aztecs]] being an exception.

==Other cases==
Further instances include cannibalism as ritual practice, and in times of drought, famine and other destitutions, as well as those being criminal acts and war crimes against victims throughout the 20th century.

In [[West Africa]], the [[Leopard Society]] was a secret society active into the mid-1900s and one that practiced cannibalism. Centred in [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], the ''[[Leopard men]]'' would dress in [[leopard]] skins, waylaying travelers with sharp claw-like weapons in the form of leopards' claws and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unexplainedstuff.com/Secret-Societies/The-Leopard-Men.html |title=The Leopard Men |publisher=Unexplainedstuff.com |date=1948-01-10 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims' flesh would be cut from their bodies and distributed to members of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/RitualKillings1900_1950b.htm|title=The Leopard Society&amp;nbsp;— Africa in the mid 1900s|accessdate=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aghori]]s of northern [[India]] are a splinter sect of [[Hinduism]] who practice cannibalism in which they consume the flesh of the dead floated in the [[Ganges]] in pursuit of [[immortality]] and supernatural powers. Members of the Aghori drink from [[human skull]]s and practice cannibalism in the belief that eating human flesh confers spiritual and physical benefits, such as prevention of aging.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9842124/from/RL.4/ Indian doc focuses on Hindu cannibal sect], [[MSNBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aghori&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/encounter/stories/2006/1782966.htm Aghoris], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/K/kumbhmela/plgrm_agoris.html The Aghoris], [[Channel 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, multiple acts of cannibalism were reported from [[Ukraine]] and Russia's Volga, South Siberian and Kuban regions during the great famine, the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3229000.stm|title=Ukraine marks great famine anniversary|date=2003-11-22|accessdate=2007-07-27 | work=BBC News | first=Yaroslav | last=Lukov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1931, ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[William Buehler Seabrook]], allegedly in the interests of &quot;research&quot;, obtained from a hospital intern at the [[Sorbonne]] a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, &quot;It was like good, fully-developed [[veal]], not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William Bueller Seabrook.

Drawing on personal experiences as an intellectual in the [[gulag]], the [[USSR|Soviet]] writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] knew cases of cannibalism. In his book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' Solzhenitsyn described cases of cannibalism in 20th-century [[USSR]]. Of the [[Russian famine of 1921|famine in Povolzhie]] (1921–1922) he wrote: &quot;That horrible famine was up to cannibalism, up to consuming children by their own parents&amp;nbsp;— the famine, which Russia had never known even in [[Time of Troubles]] [in 1601–1603]...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;A. Solzhenitsyn, ''The Gulag Archipelago'' Part I, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

He said of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941–1944): &quot;Those who consumed human flesh, or dealt with the human liver trading from dissecting rooms... were accounted as the political criminals...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;A. Solzhenitsyn, ''The Gulag Archipelago'', Part I, comments to Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; And of the building of Northern Railway Prisoners Camp (&quot;SevZhelDorLag&quot;) Solzhenitsyn reports, &quot;An ordinary hard working political prisoner almost could not survive at that penal camp. In the camp SevZhelDorLag (chief: colonel Klyuchkin) in 1946–47 there were many cases of cannibalism: they cut human bodies, cooked and ate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A.Solzhenitsyn ''The Gulag Archipelago'', Part III, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet journalist [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] was a former long-term political prisoner who spent time in the Soviet prisons, [[Gulag]] camps and settlements from 1938 to 1955. She described in her [[memoir]], ''Harsh Route'' (or ''Steep Route'') of the case, which she was directly involved in the late 1940s, after she had been moved to the prisoners' hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Yevgenia Ginzburg, ''Harsh Route'', Part 2, Chapter 23 &quot;The Paradise On A Microscope View&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...The chief warder shows me the black smoked pot, filled with some food: 'I need your medical expertise regarding this meat.' I look into the pot, and hardly hold vomiting. The fibres of that meat are very small, and don't resemble me anything I have seen before. The skin on some pieces bristles with black hair (...) A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp (...) And suddenly he surprisingly disappeared. The wardens looked around the hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned to the fireplace, Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy (...) The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed that it was an escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ... Just yesterday, one body part was found under two crossed logs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] crashed into the [[Andes]] on October 13, 1972, the survivors resorted to eating the deceased during their 72 days in the mountains. Their story was later recounted in the books ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]'' and ''[[Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home|Miracle in the Andes]]'' as well as the film ''[[Alive (1993 film)|Alive]]'', by [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], and the documentaries ''[[Alive: 20 Years Later]]'' (1993) and ''[[Stranded: I've Come from a Plane that Crashed in the Mountains]]'' (2008).

Cannibalism was reported by the journalist [[Neil Davis (cameraman)|Neil Davis]] during the South East Asian wars of the 1960s and 1970s. Davis reported that [[Cambodia]]n troops ritually ate portions of the slain enemy, typically the [[liver]]. However he, and many refugees, also report that cannibalism was practiced non-ritually when there was no food to be found. This usually occurred when towns and villages were under [[Khmer Rouge]] control, and food was strictly rationed, leading to widespread starvation. Any civilian caught participating in cannibalism would have been immediately executed.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Bowden. ''One Crowded Hour''. ISBN 0-00-217496-0&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported by defectors and refugees that, at the height of the [[North Korean]] famine in 1996, cannibalism was sometimes practiced in [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A41966-2003Oct3?language=printer|title=

===African reports===
In the 1980s, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], the international medical charity, supplied photographic and other documentary evidence of ritualized cannibal feasts among the participants in [[Liberia]]'s internecine strife to representatives of [[Amnesty International]] who were on a fact-finding mission to the neighboring state of [[Guinea]]. However, Amnesty International declined to publicize this material; the Secretary-General of the organization, [[Pierre Sane]], said at the time in an internal communication that &quot;what they do with the bodies after human rights violations are committed is not part of our mandate or concern&quot;. The existence of cannibalism on a wide scale in Liberia was subsequently verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gillison |first = Gillian |title = From Cannibalism to Genocide: The Work of Denial |journal = The Journal of Interdisciplinary History |volume = 37 |issue = 3 |pages = 395–414 |publisher = MIT Press Journals |date = 2006-11-13 |doi = 10.1162/jinh.2007.37.3.395 |accessdate = 2007-12-26 |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannibalism has been reported in several recent African conflicts, including the [[Second Congo War]], and the civil wars in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. A [[U.N.]] human rights expert reported in July 2007 that sexual atrocities against Congolese women go &quot;far beyond rape&quot; and include [[sexual slavery]], forced [[incest]], and cannibalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;farbeyond&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073001849.html Congo's Sexual Violence Goes 'Far Beyond Rape'], July 31, 2007.

Another serial killer, [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] of the United States, experimented with cannibalism before his arrest and imprisonment in 1991. The traces of human flesh and bones found on pots and pans inside his home are more likely from his practice of taking souvenirs from his victims.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The [[murder of Tim McLean]] occurred on the evening of July 30, 2008. McLean, a 22-year-old Canadian man, was stabbed, beheaded and cannibalized while riding a Greyhound Canada bus. According to witnesses, McLean was sleeping with his headphones on when the man sitting next to him, Vince Weiguang Li, suddenly produced a large knife and began stabbing McLean in the neck and chest. The attacker then decapitated McLean, severed other body parts, and consumed some of McLean's flesh.

A '''chemical element''' is a pure [[chemical substance]] consisting of one type of [[atom]] distinguished by its [[atomic number]], which is the number of [[proton]]s in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=C01022|title=chemical element}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of elements are [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[copper]], [[carbon]], and [[nitrogen]]. Although all known chemical [[matter]] is composed of these elements, chemical matter itself constitutes only about 15% of the total matter in the [[universe]]. The remainder is [[dark matter]], which is not believed to consist of chemical elements as we know them since it does not contain protons, [[neutron]]s or [[electron]]s. As of May 2011, 118 elements have been identified, the latest being [[ununoctium]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=Oganessian2002&gt;{{cite journal|first=YT|last=Oganessian|title=Heaviest nuclei from 48Ca-induced reactions|journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics|volume=34|issue=4|year=2007|pages=R165–R242|doi=10.1088/0954-3899/34/4/R01|url=http://www.icpress.co.uk/etextbook/p573/p573_chap01.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; New elements of higher atomic number are discovered from time to time, as the [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] products of man-made [[nuclear reaction]]s, though [[ununennium]] (atomic number 119) has yet to be synthesized. Of the 118 known elements, only the first 94 are believed to occur naturally on [[Earth]].

Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 40 are all considered to be [[stable isotope]]s. Elements with atomic numbers 41 through 82 are [[Metastability|apparently stable]] (except [[technetium]] and [[promethium]]) but theoretically unstable, or [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. The half lives of elements 41 through 82 are so long however that their radioactive decay has yet to be detected by experiment. These &quot;[[List_of_nuclides#Nuclides_with_no_experimentally_observed_decays|theoretical radionuclides]]&quot; have half lives at least 100 million times longer than the estimated [[age of the universe]]. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are [[Radionuclide|unstable]] to the point that their radioactive decay can be detected. Some of these elements, notably [[thorium]] (atomic number 90) and [[uranium]] (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that produced the [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy elements]] before the formation of our [[Solar System|solar system]]. For example, at over 1.9{{e|19}} years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, [[bismuth-209]] (atomic number 83) has the longest known [[alpha decay]] half life of any naturally occurring element.&lt;ref name=Dume2003&gt;{{cite news|title=Bismuth breaks half-life record for alpha decay|last=Dumé|first=Belle|date=2003-04-23|work=Physicsworld.com|publisher=Institute of Physics|location=Bristol, England|url=http://physicsweb.org/articles/news/7/4/16|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marcillac2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcillac|first=Pierre de|coauthors=Noël Coron, Gérard Dambier, Jacques Leblanc, and Jean-Pierre Moalic|year=2003|title=Experimental detection of alpha-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth|journal=Nature|volume=422|pages=876–8|doi=10.1038/nature01541|pmid=12712201|issue=6934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very heaviest elements (those beyond [[plutonium]], atomic number 94) undergo radioactive decay with [[Half-life|half lives]] so short that they have only been observed as the result of [[Scientific method|experimental observation]].

Apart from the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] in the universe, which are thought to have been mostly produced in the [[Big Bang]], the chemical elements are thought to have been produced by one of two later processes—either [[cosmic ray spallation]] (important for [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]]), or stellar [[nucleosynthesis]] (which produces all elements heavier than boron). [[Oxygen]] is the [[abundances of the elements (data page)|most abundant]] element in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], making up almost half of its mass.&lt;ref name=LosAlamos&gt;{{cite web|title=Periodic Table of Elements: Oxygen|author=Los Alamos National Laboratory|authorlink=Los Alamos National Laboratory|publisher=Los Alamos National Security, LLC|location=Los Alamos, New Mexico|year=2011|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively small amounts of elements continue to be produced on Earth as products of natural [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] processes. This includes production by [[cosmic ray]]s or other nuclear reactions (see [[cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic]] and [[nucleogenic]] nuclides), or as [[decay product]]s of long-lived [[primordial nuclide]]s.&lt;ref name=Earnshaw1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Earnshaw|first=A|last2=Greenwood|first2=N|year=1997|title=Chemistry of the Elements|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two distinct elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by [[chemical bond]]s, the result is termed a [[chemical compound|compound]]. Chemical compounds may be composed of elements combined in exact whole number ratios of atoms (a familiar example of such a compound is [[water]]). However, chemical bonding of many types of elements may result in the formation of [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] [[solid]]s and [[metal]]lic [[alloy]]s, for which exact [[chemical formula]]s do not exist. Most of the solid substance of the Earth is of this latter type: the atoms that are present in the substance of the Earth's crust, [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[inner core]] are combined into chemical compounds of many compositions, but these do not have precise [[empirical formula]]s.

==History==
[[Image:Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table.png|300px|thumb|[[Mendeleev]]'s 1869 [[periodic table]]]]

[[Ancient philosophy]] posited a set of [[classical element]]s to explain patterns in [[nature]]. ''Elements'' originally referred to ''[[Earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[Air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'' rather than the chemical elements of modern science.

The term 'elements' (''stoicheia'') was first used by the Greek philosopher [[Plato]] in about 360 BCE, in his dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by [[Empedocles]] were composed of small [[regular polyhedron|polyhedral]] ''[[Theory of Forms|forms]]'': [[tetrahedron]] (fire), [[octahedron]] (air), [[icosahedron]] (water), and [[cube]] (earth).&lt;ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]], c. 350 BCE, also used the term ''stoicheia'' and added a fifth element called ''[[Aether (classical element)|aether]],'' which formed the heavens. Aristotle defined an element as:

{{quote|'''Element''' – one of those bodies into which other bodies can decompose, and that itself is not capable of being divided into other.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1661, [[Robert Boyle]] showed that there were more than just four [[classical element]]s as the ancients had assumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyle&quot; /&gt; The first modern list of chemical elements was given in [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s 1789 ''Elements of Chemistry'', which contained thirty-three elements, including [[light]] and caloric.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1818, [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] had determined atomic weights for forty-five of the forty-nine accepted elements. [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] had sixty-six elements in his [[periodic table]] of 1869.

From Boyle until the early 20th century, an element was defined as a pure [[chemical substance|substance]] that cannot be decomposed into any simpler substance.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyle&quot;&gt;

In 1913, [[Henry Moseley]] discovered that the physical basis of the atomic number of the atom was its nuclear charge, which eventually led to the current definition. The current definition also avoids some ambiguities due to [[isotopes]] and [[allotropes]].

By 1919, there were seventy-two known elements.&lt;ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:080998 Universe Content 240.jpg|thumb|right|375px|Estimated distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. Only the fraction of the mass and energy in the universe labeled &quot;atoms&quot; is composed of chemical elements.]]

Only about 4 % of the total mass of the universe is represented by chemical elements, and is thus made up of atoms. This fraction is about 15% of the total matter, with the remainder of the matter (85%) being [[dark matter]]. Dark matter has a nature which is unknown, but it is not composed of atoms of chemical elements, because it contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons. (The remaining non-matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of the even more mysterious [[dark energy]]).

The lightest of the chemical elements are hydrogen and [[helium]], both created by [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] during the [[Timeline of the Big Bang|first 20 minutes of the universe]]&lt;ref&gt;See the timeline on p.10 of {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[ratio]] of around 3:1 by mass (approximately 12:1 by number of atoms). Almost all other elements found in nature, including some further hydrogen and helium created since then, were made by various natural or (at times) artificial methods of [[nucleosynthesis]]. On Earth, small amounts of new atoms are naturally produced in [[nucleogenic]] reactions, or in [[cosmogenic]] processes, such as [[cosmic ray spallation]]. New atoms are also naturally produced on Earth as [[radiogenic]] [[daughter isotope]]s of ongoing [[radioactive decay]] processes such as [[alpha decay]], [[beta decay]], [[spontaneous fission]], [[cluster decay]], and other rarer modes of decay.

As of 2010, there are 118 known elements (in this context, &quot;known&quot; means observed well enough, even from just a few decay products, to have been differentiated from any other element).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 118 elements, 94 occur naturally on Earth{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. Six of these occur in extreme trace quantities: [[technetium]], atomic number 43; [[promethium]], number 61; [[astatine]], number 85; [[francium]], number 87; [[neptunium]], number 93; and [[plutonium]], number 94. These 94 elements, and also possibly element 98 [[californium]], have been detected in the universe at large, in the spectra of stars and also supernovae, where short-lived radioactive elements are newly being made. The first 94 elements have been detected directly on Earth as naturally-occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and thorium. Some californium may be present on Earth, but at present, natural californium is only known from supernovae spectra and even there its presense is uncertain (see [[californium]] for detail).

The remaining 24 heavier elements, not found today either on Earth or in astronomical spectra, have been derived artificially. All of the heavy elements that are derived solely through artificial means are radioactive, with very short half-lives; if any atoms of these elements were present at the formation of Earth, they are extremely likely to have already decayed, and if present in novae, have been in quantities too small to have been noted. [[Technetium]] was the first purportedly non-naturally occurring element to be synthesized, in 1937, although trace amounts of technetium have since been found in nature (and also the element may have been discovered naturally in 1925). This pattern of artificial production and later natural discovery has been repeated with several other radioactive, naturally-occurring rare elements.

Lists of the elements are available [[List of elements by name|by name]], [[List of elements by symbol|by symbol]], [[List of elements by number|by atomic number]], [[List of elements by density|by density]], [[List of elements by melting point|by melting point]], and [[List of elements by boiling point|by boiling point]] as well as [[Ionization energies of the elements]]. The nuclides of stable and radioactive elements are also available as a [[list of nuclides]], sorted by length of half life for those that are unstable. One of the most convenient, and certainly the most traditional presentation of the elements, is in form of [[periodic table]], which groups elements with similar chemical properties (and usually also similar electronic structures) together.

===Atomic number===
The [[atomic number]] of an element, ''Z'', is equal to the number of protons that defines the element. For example, all carbon atoms contain 6 protons in their [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]; so the atomic number &quot;Z&quot; of carbon is 6. Carbon atoms may have different numbers of neutrons; atoms of the same element having different numbers of neutrons are known as [[isotope]]s of the element.

The number of protons in the atomic nucleus also determines its [[electric charge]], which in turn determines the number of [[electron]]s of the atom in its [[ionization|non-ionized]] state. The electrons are placed into [[atomic orbital]]s which determine the atom's various [[chemical property|chemical properties]]. The number of neutrons in a nucleus usually has very little effect on an elements' chemical properties (except in the case of [[hydrogen]] and [[deuterium]]). Thus, all carbon isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because they all have six protons and six electrons, even though carbon atoms may differ in number of neutrons. It is for this reason that atomic number rather than [[mass number]] (or [[atomic weight]]) is considered the identifying characteristic of a chemical element.

===Atomic mass===
The [[mass number]] of an element, ''A'', is the number of [[nucleons]] (protons and neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Different isotopes of a given element are distinguished by their mass numbers, which are conventionally written as a super-index on the left hand side of the atomic symbol (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U).

The [[relative atomic mass]] of an element is the average of the atomic masses of all the chemical element's isotopes as found in a particular environment, weighted by isotopic abundance, relative to the [[atomic mass unit]] (u). This number may be a fraction that is not close to a whole number, due to the averaging process. On the other hand, the atomic mass of a pure isotope is quite close to its mass number. Whereas the mass number is a natural (or whole) number, the atomic mass of a single isotope is a real number that is close to a natural number. In general, it differs slightly from the mass number as the mass of the protons and neutrons is not exactly 1 u, the electrons also contribute slightly to the atomic mass, and because of the [[nuclear binding energy]]. For example, the mass of &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F is 18.9984032 u. The only exception to the atomic mass of an isotope not being a natural number is &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, which has a mass of exactly 12, because u is ''defined'' as 1/12 of the mass of a free carbon-12 atom.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotope|Stable isotope|List of nuclides}}
[[Isotope]]s are atoms of the same element (that is, with the same number of protons in their atomic nucleus), but having ''different'' numbers of [[neutron]]s. Most (66 of 94) naturally occurring elements have more than one stable isotope. Thus, for example, there are three main isotopes of carbon. All carbon atoms have 6 protons in the nucleus, but they can have either 6, 7, or 8 neutrons. Since the mass numbers of these are 12, 13 and 14 respectively, the three isotopes of carbon are known as carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14, often abbreviated to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Carbon in everyday life and in [[chemistry]] is a mixture of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms.

Except in the case of the isotopes of hydrogen (which differ greatly from each other in relative mass—enough to cause chemical effects), the isotopes of the various elements are typically chemically nearly indistinguishable from each other. For example, the three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon have essentially the same chemical properties, but different nuclear properties. In this example, carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable atoms, but [[carbon-14]] is unstable; it is [[radioactive]], undergoing [[beta decay]] into [[nitrogen-14]]. 

As illustrated by carbon, all of the elements have some [[isotopes]] that are [[radioactive]] ([[radioisotopes]]), which decay into other elements upon radiating an alpha or beta particle. Certain elements ''only'' have radioactive isotopes: specifically the elements without any stable isotopes are technetium (atomic number 43), promethium (atomic number 61), and all observed elements with [[atomic numbers]] greater than 82. 

Of the 80 elements with at least one stable isotope, 26 have only one stable isotope, and the mean number of stable isotopes for the 80 stable elements is 3.1 stable isotopes per element. The largest number of stable isotopes that occur for an element is 10 (for tin, element 50).

===Allotropes===
{{Main|Allotropy}}
Atoms of pure elements may bond to each other chemically in more than one way, allowing the pure element to exist in multiple structures (spacial arrangements of atoms), known as [[allotropes]], which differ in their properties. For example, carbon can be found as [[diamond]], which has a tetrahedral structure around each carbon atom; [[graphite]], which has layers of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure stacked on top of each other; [[graphene]], which is a single layer of graphite that is incredibly strong; [[fullerene]]s, which have nearly spherical shapes; and [[carbon nanotube]]s, which are tubes with a hexagonal structure (even these may differ from each other in electrical properties). The ability for an element to exist in one of many structural forms is known as 'allotropy'.

===Standard state===
The [[standard state]], or reference state, of an element is defined as its thermodynamically most stable state at 1 bar at a given temperature (typically at 298.15 K). In [[thermochemistry]], an element is defined to have an [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]] of zero in its standard state. For example, the reference state for carbon is graphite, because it is more stable than the other allotropes.

The naming of elements precedes the atomic theory of matter, although at the time it was not known which chemicals were elements and which compounds. When these facts were learned, the existing names for anciently-known elements (''e.g.,'' gold, mercury, iron) were kept in most countries. National differences emerged over the names of elements either for convenience, linguistic niceties, or nationalism. For a few illustrative examples: German speakers use &quot;Wasserstoff&quot; (water substance) for &quot;hydrogen&quot;, &quot;Sauerstoff&quot; (acid substance) for &quot;oxygen&quot; and &quot;Stickstoff&quot; (smothering substance) for &quot;nitrogen&quot;, while [[English language|English]] and some [[romance language]]s use &quot;sodium&quot; for &quot;natrium&quot; and &quot;potassium&quot; for &quot;kalium&quot;, and the French, Italians, Greeks, Portuguese and Poles prefer &quot;azote/azot/azoto&quot; (from roots meaning &quot;no life&quot;) for &quot;nitrogen&quot;.

For purposes of international trade, the [[Table of chemical elements|official names]] of the chemical elements both ancient and recent are decided by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], which has decided on a sort of international English language. That organization has recently prescribed that &quot;[[aluminium]]&quot; and &quot;caesium&quot; take the place of the U.S. spellings &quot;aluminum&quot; and &quot;cesium&quot;, while the U.S. &quot;sulfur&quot; takes the place of the British &quot;sulphur&quot;. Chemicals that are practical to sell in bulk in many countries, however, still have national names. Also, those countries that do not use the [[Latin alphabet]] to write their national language, cannot be expected to use the IUPAC name for elements. 

In languages such as German, where all nouns of all types are capitalized, chemical element names are capitalized. However, chemical elements are not proper nouns in English, according to IUPAC. Thus, in English, the full name of an element is not capitalized, even if it is derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the elements [[californium]] or [[einsteinium]]. Thus, these elements are only capitalized in English when as words they would be capitalized by some other [[capitalization|rule]], such as to begin a sentence, or as a heading or title. There is a tendency of some English sources to capitalize rare elements, such as uranium, but this is incorrect. Isotopes of chemical elements are also uncapitalized if written out: [[carbon-12]] or [[uranium-235]]. 

'''Symbols''' of chemical elements, however, are capitalized: thus the symbols for the elements just discussed are Cf and Es; C-12 and U-235. IUPAC prefers that isotope symbols be written in superscript notation, however: &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.

In the second half of the twentieth century physics laboratories became able to produce nuclei of chemical elements that have a half life too short for them to remain in any appreciable amounts. These are also named by IUPAC, which generally adopts the name chosen by the discoverer. This can lead to the controversial question of which research group actually discovered an element, a question that delayed naming of elements with atomic number of 104 and higher for a considerable time. (See [[element naming controversy]]).

Precursors of such controversies involved the nationalistic namings of elements in the late nineteenth century. For example, ''[[lutetium]]'' was named in reference to Paris, France. The Germans were reluctant to relinquish naming rights to the French, often calling it ''cassiopeium''. Similarly, the British discoverer of ''[[niobium]]'' originally named it ''columbium,'' in reference to the [[New World]]. It was used extensively as such by American publications prior to international standardization.

==Chemical symbols==
{{for|the listing of current and not used [[Chemical symbol]]s, and other symbols that look like chemical symbols|List of elements by symbol}}

===Specific chemical elements===
Before chemistry became a [[science]], [[alchemy|alchemists]] had designed arcane symbols for both metals and common compounds. These were however used as abbreviations in diagrams or procedures; there was no concept of atoms combining to form molecules. With his advances in the atomic theory of matter, [[John Dalton]] devised his own simpler symbols, based on circles, which were to be used to depict molecules.

The current system of chemical notation was invented by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]]. In this typographical system chemical symbols are not used as mere abbreviations - though each consists of letters of the [[Latin alphabet]] - they are symbols intended to be used by peoples of all languages and alphabets. The first of these symbols were intended to be fully universal; since Latin was the common language of science at that time, they were abbreviations based on the [[Latin]] names of metals - Cu comes from Cuprum, Fe comes from Ferrum, Ag from Argentum. The symbols were not followed by a period (full stop) as abbreviations were. Later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols, based on the name of the element, but not necessarily in English. For example, [[sodium]] has the chemical symbol 'Na' after the Latin ''natrium''. The same applies to &quot;W&quot; (wolfram) for [[tungsten]], &quot;Fe&quot; (ferrum) for [[Iron]], &quot;Hg&quot; (hydrargyrum) for [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], &quot;Sn&quot; (stannum) for [[Tin (element)|tin]], &quot;K&quot; (kalium) for [[potassium]], &quot;Au&quot; (aurum) for [[gold]], &quot;Ag&quot; (argentum) for [[silver]], &quot;Pb&quot; (plumbum) for [[lead]], and &quot;Sb&quot; (stibium) for [[antimony]].

Chemical symbols are understood internationally when element names might need to be translated. There are sometimes differences; for example, the Germans have used &quot;J&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot; for iodine, so the character would not be confused with a [[roman numeral]].

The first letter of a chemical symbol is always capitalized, as in the preceding examples, and the subsequent letters, if any, are always lower case (small letters).

===General chemical symbols===
There are also symbols for series of chemical elements, for comparative formulas. These are one capital letter in length, and the letters are reserved so they are not permitted to be given for the names of specific elements. For example, an &quot;X&quot; is used to indicate a variable group amongst a class of compounds (though usually a [[halogen]]), while &quot;R&quot; is used for a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], meaning a compound structure such as a hydrocarbon chain. The letter &quot;Q&quot; is reserved for &quot;heat&quot; in a chemical reaction. &quot;Y&quot; is also often used as a general chemical symbol, although it is also the symbol of [[yttrium]]. &quot;Z&quot; is also frequently used as a general variable group. &quot;L&quot; is used to represent a general [[ligand]] in inorganic and organometallic chemistry. &quot;M&quot; is also often used in place of a general metal.

===Isotope symbols===
The three main isotopes of the element hydrogen are often written as H for protium, D for [[deuterium]] and T for [[tritium]]. This is in order to make it easier to use them in chemical equations, as it replaces the need to write out the mass number for each atom. E.g. the formula for [[heavy water]] may be written D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O instead of ²H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

==The periodic table==
{{Main|Periodic table}}
The periodic table of the chemical elements is a tabular method of displaying the chemical elements. Although precursors to this table exist, its invention is generally credited to [[Russia]]n chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] in 1869. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring (&quot;periodic&quot;) trends in the properties of the elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.

The periodic table is now ubiquitous within the academic discipline of chemistry, providing an extremely useful framework to classify, systematize and compare all the many different forms of chemical behavior. The table has also found wide application in physics, biology, engineering, and industry. The current standard table contains 118 confirmed elements as of April 10, 2010.

==Abundance==
{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}
During the early phases of the [[Big Bang]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] of hydrogen nuclei resulted in the production of hydrogen and helium isotopes, as well as very minuscule amounts (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;) of lithium and beryllium. There is evidence that some boron was produced in the Big Bang, since it has been observed in some very young stars, even though carbon has not.&lt;ref&gt;

 |work=[[New York Times]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is agreement that no heavier elements than boron were produced in the Big Bang. As a result, the primordial abundance of atoms consisted of roughly 75% &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, 25% &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, and 0.01% [[deuterium]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. As physical laws and processes appear common throughout the [[visible universe]], however, it is expected that these galaxies will likewise have evolved similar abundances of elements.

The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier.]]

[[File:10 French centimes 1963 (2).jpg|thumb|right|10 French centimes (1963)]]
'''Centime''' (from Latin ''centesimus'') is [[French language|French]] for &quot;[[Cent (currency)|cent]]&quot;, and is used in English as the name of the fraction [[currency]] in several [[Francophone]] [[country|countries]] (including [[Switzerland]], [[Algeria]], [[Belgium]], [[Morocco]] and [[France]]).

In France the usage of ''centime'' goes back to the introduction of the [[decimal currency|decimal monetary system]] under [[Napoleon]]. This system aimed at replacing non-decimal fractions of older coins. A five-centime coin was known as a ''sou'', i.e. a [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] or [[shilling]].

Conversely in [[Quebec]], one hundredth of a [[Canadian dollar]] is called a ''[[Penny (Canadian coin)|sou]]'' (penny).

==Subdivision of euro: cent or centime?==
In the European community ''cent'' is the official name for one hundredth of a [[euro]]. However, in French-speaking countries the word ''centime '' is the preferred term. Indeed, the [[Superior Council of the French language]] of Belgium recommended in 2001 the use of ''centime'', since ''cent'' is also the French word for &quot;hundred&quot;. An analogous decision was published in the ''[[Journal officiel]]'' in France (December 2, 1997).

In Morocco, [[dirham]]s are divided into 100 ''centime''s and one may find prices in the country quoted in ''centime''s rather than in dirhams. Sometimes ''centime''s are known as francs or in [[Spanish Morocco|former Spanish areas]], [[pesetas]].

==Usage==
A centime is one-hundredth of the following basic monetary units:

===Current===
* [[Algerian dinar]]
* [[Burundian franc]]
* [[CFP franc]]
* [[CFA franc]]
* [[Comorian franc]]
* [[Congolese franc]]

Generally speaking, a '''calendar year''' begins on the [[New Year|New Year's Day]] of the given calendar system and ends on the day before the following New Year's Day. By convention, a calendar year consists of a [[natural number]] of [[day]]s. To reconcile the calendar year with an astronomical cycle (which could not possibly be reckoned in a whole number of days), certain years contain [[Intercalation|extra days]]. Through further insertion of non-day units of time, the calendar year can be further synchronized; however, these extra units of time are not considered part of the calendar.

The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31 with a length of 365 days in an ordinary year and 366 days in a [[leap year]] giving an average length of 365.2425 days. This is very close to the average length of 76 [[Islamic calendar]] years (based on the average time between successive [[vernal equinox]]es, currently 365.2424 days and increasing marginally). Other formula-based calendars can have lengths which are further out of step with the solar cycle, for example, the [[Julian calendar]] has&lt;!--It is still important in Orthodox Christianity--&gt; an average length of 365.25 days, and the [[Hebrew calendar]] has an average length of 365.2468 days.

The astronomer's [[mean tropical year]] which is averaged over equinoxes and solstices is currently 365.24219 days, slightly shorter than the average length of the year in most calendars, but the astronomer's value changes over time, so [[William Herschel]]'s suggested correction to the Gregorian calendar may become unnecessary by the year 4000.

== Quarters ==
{{anchor|Subdivisions}}
The calendar year can be divided into 4 quarters, often abbreviated Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4:
*First quarter: from the beginning of January to the end of March
*Second quarter: from the beginning of April to the end of June
*Third quarter: from the beginning of July to the end of September
*Fourth quarter: from the beginning of October to the end of December

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CFA Franc map.svg|thumb|Usage of: &lt;br /&gt;{{Color box|#008800}} West African CFA franc &lt;br /&gt;{{Color box|#ff0000}} Central African CFA franc]] 
The '''CFA franc''' (in [[French language|French]]: ''franc CFA'' {{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃ seɛfɑ|}}, or colloquially ''franc'') is the name of two  [[currency|currencies]] used in Africa which are guaranteed by the French treasury. The two CFA franc currencies are the '''[[West African CFA franc]]''' and the '''[[Central African CFA franc]]'''. Although theoretically separate, the two CFA franc currencies are effectively interchangeable. 

Both CFA Francs currently have a [[fixed exchange rate]] to the [[euro]]: 100 CFA francs = 1 former [[French franc|French (nouveau) franc]] = 0.00152449 euro; or 1 euro = 655.957 CFA francs.

Although Central African CFA francs and West African CFA francs have always been at parity and have therefore always had the same monetary value against other currencies, they are in principle separate currencies. They could theoretically have different values from any moment if one of the two CFA monetary authorities, or France, decided it. Therefore West African CFA coins and banknotes are ''theoretically'' not accepted in countries using Central African CFA francs, and vice versa. However in practice the permanent parity of the two CFA franc currencies is widely assumed.

CFA Francs are used in fourteen countries: twelve formerly [[France|French]]-ruled [[African]] countries, as well as in [[Guinea-Bissau]] (a former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony) and in [[Equatorial Guinea]] (a former [[Spain|Spanish]] colony). The [[ISO 4217|ISO currency code]]s are '''XAF''' for the [[Central African CFA franc]] and '''XOF''' for the [[West African CFA franc]].

==Name==
Between 1945 and 1958, CFA stood for ''{{lang|fr|Colonies françaises d'Afrique}}'' (&quot;French colonies of Africa&quot;); then for ''{{lang|fr|Communauté française d'Afrique}}'' (&quot;French community of Africa&quot;) between 1958 (establishment of the [[French Fifth Republic]]) and the independence of these African countries at the beginning of the 1960s. Since independence, CFA is taken to mean ''{{lang|fr|Communauté Financière Africaine}}'' (African Financial Community),&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica Online, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/128988/Communaute-Financiere-Africaine-franc Communauté Financière Africaine franc]; accessed 2008.12.05.&lt;/ref&gt; but in actual use, the term can have two meanings (see [[#Institutions|Institutions]] below).

==History==
===Creation===
The CFA franc was created on 26 December 1945, along with the [[CFP franc]]. The reason for their creation was the weakness of the [[French franc]] immediately after [[World War II]].  When France ratified the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods Agreement]] in December 1945, the [[French franc]] was [[devaluation|devalued]] in order to set a [[fixed exchange rate]] with the [[US dollar]].  New currencies were created in the [[French colonies]] to spare them the strong devaluation.  [[René Pleven]], the [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|French minister of finance]], was quoted as saying:

:&quot;In a show of her generosity and selflessness, [[metropolitan France]], wishing not to impose on her far-away daughters the consequences of her own poverty, is setting different exchange rates for their currency.&quot;

===Exchange rate===
The CFA franc was created with a fixed exchange rate versus the [[French franc]]. This exchange rate was changed only twice: in 1948 and in 1994.

Exchange rate: 
* 26 December 1945 to 16 October 1948 &amp;ndash; 1 CFA franc = 1.70 FRF (FRF = French franc). This 0.70 FRF [[premium]] is the consequence of the creation of the CFA franc, which spared the French African colonies the devaluation of December 1945 (before December 1945, 1 local franc in these colonies was worth 1 French franc).
* 17 October 1948 to 31 December 1959 &amp;ndash; 1 CFA franc = 2.00 FRF (the CFA franc had followed the French franc's devaluation versus the US dollar in January 1948, but on 18 October 1948, the French franc devalued again and this time the CFA franc was revalued against the French franc to offset almost all of this new devaluation of the French franc; after October 1948, the CFA was never revalued again versus the French franc and followed all the successive devaluations of the French franc)
* 1 January 1960 to 11 January 1994 &amp;ndash; 1 CFA franc = 0.02 FRF (1 January 1960: the French franc redenominated , with 100 &quot;old&quot; francs becoming 1 &quot;new&quot; franc)
* 12 January 1994 to 31 December 1998 &amp;ndash; 1 CFA franc = 0.01 FRF (sharp devaluation of the CFA franc to help African exports)
* 1 January 1999 onward &amp;ndash; 100 CFA franc = 0.152449 euro or 1 euro = 655.957 CFA franc. (1 January 1999: [[euro]] replaced FRF at the rate of 6.55957 FRF for 1 euro)

The 1960 and 1999 events were merely changes in the currency in use in France: the [[relative value]] of the CFA franc versus the French franc / euro changed only in 1948 and 1994.

The value of the CFA franc has been widely criticized as being too high, which many economists believe favors the urban elite of the African countries, which can buy manufactured goods cheaply at the expense of farmers who cannot easily export agricultural products. The devaluation of 1994 was an attempt to reduce these imbalances.

===Changes in countries using the franc===
Over time, the number of countries and territories using the CFA franc has changed as some countries began introducing their own separate currencies. A couple nations in West Africa have also chosen to adopt the CFA franc since its introduction, despite the fact that they were never French colonies.

* 1949: [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) leaves and begins issuing [[Djiboutian franc]]s
* 1960: [[Guinea]] leaves and begins issuing [[Guinean franc]]s
* 1962: [[Mali]] leaves and begins issuing [[Malian franc]]s
* 1967: [[Réunion]] leaves for French franc
* 1973: [[Madagascar]] leaves (in 1972, according to another source) and begins issuing [[Malagasy franc|its own francs]], which ran concurrently with the [[Malagasy ariary]] (1 ariary = 5 CFA francs)
* 1973: [[Mauritania]] leaves, replacing the franc with the [[Mauritanian ouguiya]] (1 ouguiya = 5 CFA francs)
* 1974: [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] leaves for French franc
* 1984: [[Mali]] rejoins (1 CFA franc = 2 [[Malian franc]]s)
* 1985: [[Equatorial Guinea]] joins (1 &quot;franco&quot; = 4 [[ekwele|bipkwele]])
* 1997: [[Guinea-Bissau]] joins (1 &quot;franco&quot; = 65 [[Guinea Bissau peso|pesos]])

''Note : Réunion and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon currently use euro as part of French Republic.''

===European Monetary Union===
In 1998, in anticipation of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[Council of the European Union]] addressed the monetary agreements France has with the CFA Zone and [[Comoros]] and ruled that: 
* The agreements are unlikely to have any material effect on the [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[exchange rate regime|exchange rate policy]] of the [[Euro zone]]
* In their present forms and states of implementation, the agreements are unlikely to present any obstacle to a smooth functioning of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|economic and monetary union]]
* Nothing in the agreements can be construed as implying an obligation for the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) or any national [[central bank]] to support the convertibility of the CFA and [[Comorian franc]]s
* Modifications to the existing agreements will not lead to any obligations for the European Central or any national central bank
* The French Treasury will guarantee the free convertibility at a fixed parity between the [[euro]] and the CFA and Comorian francs
* The competent French authorities shall keep the [[European Commission]], the European Central Bank and the Economic and Financial Committee informed about the implementation of the agreements and inform the Committee prior to changes of the parity between the euro and the CFA and Comorian francs
* Any change to the nature or scope of the agreements would require Council approval on the basis of a Commission recommendation and ECB consultation

==Institutions==
Strictly speaking, there actually exist two different currencies called CFA franc: the West African CFA franc ([[ISO 4217]] currency code XOF), and the Central Africa CFA franc ([[ISO 4217]] currency code XAF). They are distinguished in French by the meaning of the abbreviation CFA. These two CFA francs have the same exchange rate with the euro (1 euro = 655.957 XOF = 655.957 XAF), and they are both guaranteed by the French treasury ([[Trésor public]]), but the West African CFA franc cannot be used in Central African countries, and the Central Africa CFA franc cannot be used in West African countries.

===West African===
{{Main|West African CFA franc}}

The West African CFA franc (XOF) is just known in [[French language|French]] as the ''Franc CFA'', where CFA stands for ''Communauté financière d'Afrique'' (&quot;Financial Community of Africa&quot;). It is issued by the BCEAO (''[[Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest]]'', i.e. &quot;Central Bank of the West African States&quot;), located in [[Dakar]], [[Sénégal]], for the 8 countries of the UEMOA (''Union Économique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine'', i.e. &quot;[[West African Economic and Monetary Union]]&quot;):

===Central African===
{{Main|Central African CFA franc}}
 
The Central Africa CFA franc (XAF) is just known in [[French language|French]] as the ''Franc CFA'', where CFA stands for ''Coopération financière en Afrique centrale'' (&quot;Financial Cooperation in Central Africa&quot;). It is issued by the BEAC (''[[Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale]]'', i.e. &quot;Bank of the Central African States&quot;), located in [[Yaoundé]], [[Cameroon]], for the 6 countries of the CEMAC (''Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale'', i.e. &quot;[[Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa]]&quot;):
*{{flag|Cameroon}}
*{{flag|Central African Republic}}
*{{flag|Chad}}
*{{flag|Republic of the Congo}}
*{{flag|Equatorial Guinea}}
*{{flag|Gabon}}

In 1975, Central African CFA banknotes were issued with an [[obverse]] unique to each participating country, and common reverse, in a fashion similar to euro coins.

[[Equatorial Guinea]], the only former Spanish colony in the zone, adopted the CFA in 1984.

'''Consciousness''' is a term that has been used to refer to a variety of aspects of the relationship between the [[mind]] and the world with which it interacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;van_Gulick2004&quot;&gt;van Gulick, 2004 [van Gulick, R. (2004). Consciousness. In ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.'' (version Aug 16, 2004) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined, at one time or another, as: subjective experience; [[awareness]]; the ability to experience [[feeling]]s; wakefulness; having a sense of [[self]]hood; or as the executive control system of the mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farthing1992Psychology&quot;&gt;Farthing, 1992 [Farthing, G. W. (1992). ''The Psychology of Consciousness.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficulty of definition, many philosophers believe that there is a basic underlying intuition about consciousness that is shared by nearly all people.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, 2005, In Honderich, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Max Velmans]] and Susan Schneider wrote in ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'':

{{quote|&quot;Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider and Velmans, 2007, pp.1-6 In Velmans &amp; Schneider, 2007 [Velmans, M., &amp; Schneider, S. (Eds.) (2007). ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell.]; For a similar comment see also Güzeldere, 1995 In Block, Flanagan &amp; Güzeldere, 1997, pp.1-67 [Block, N., Flanagan, O., &amp; Güzeldere, G. (1997). ''The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical debates'' Cambridge, MA: MIT.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[philosophy]], consciousness is often said to imply four characteristics: subjectivity, change, continuity, and selectivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farthing1992Psychology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1910 In Block, Flanagan &amp; Güzeldere [Block, N., Flanagan, O., &amp; Güzeldere, G. (1997). ''The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical debates'' Cambridge, MA: MIT.]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Franz Brentano]] has also suggested [[intentionality]] or aboutness (that consciousness is about something); however, there is no consensus on whether intentionality is a requirement for consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Searle, 2005 In Honderich, 2005, s.v. consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues of practical concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether consciousness can ever be explained mechanistically; whether non-human consciousness exists and if so how it can be recognized; at what point in [[fetal development]] consciousness begins; and whether it may ever be possible for [[computer]]s to achieve a conscious state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Butler (schoolmaster)|Samuel Butler]] first raised the possibility of [[manufactured|mechanical]] consciousness in an article signed with the [[Pen name|''nom de plume]] Cellarius and headed &quot;Darwin among the Machines&quot;, which appeared in the [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]], newspaper ''[[The Press]]'' on June 13, 1863: retrieved from PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION, [[Project Gutenberg]] eBook [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1906 '''Erewhon'''], by Samuel Butler.

At one time consciousness was viewed with skepticism by many scientists and considered within the domain of philosophers and theologians, but in recent years it has been an increasingly significant topic of scientific research.  In [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], the focus of most research is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness—that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness.  The majority of experimental studies use human subjects and assess consciousness by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., &quot;tell me if you notice anything when I do this&quot;).  Issues of interest include phenomena such as [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal perception]], [[blindsight]], [[anosognosia|denial of impairment]], and [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] produced by psychoactive drugs or spiritual or meditative techniques.

In [[medicine]], consciousness is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and responsiveness, and can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, then delirium, then loss of any meaningful communication, and ending with loss of movement in response to painful [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].&lt;ref&gt;Güzeldere, 1995 In Block, Flanagan &amp; Güzeldere, 1997, pp.1-67 [Block, N., Flanagan, O., &amp; Güzeldere, G. (1997). ''The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical debates'' Cambridge, MA: MIT.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Late recovery from the minimally conscious state: ethical and policy implications.

==Etymology and early history==
The origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', published in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Chapter XXVII)|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=University of Adelaide|location=Australia|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/locke/john/l81u/B2.27.html|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locke explicitly defined consciousness as “the perception of what passes in a man’s own mind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133274/consciousness|title=Science &amp; Technology: consciousness|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His essay had much influence on the 18th century view of consciousness, and his definition appeared in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s celebrated [[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]] ([[1755]]).

The earliest English language uses of &quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; date back, however, to the 1500s.  The English word &quot;conscious&quot; originally derived from the Latin ''conscius'' (''con-'' &quot;together&quot; + ''scire'' &quot;to know&quot;), but the Latin word did not have the same meaning as our word — it meant ''knowing with'', in other words ''having joint or common knowledge with another''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Classic Latin Dictionary'', Follett Publishing Company, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase ''conscius sibi'', which translates literally as &quot;knowing with oneself&quot;, or in other words ''sharing knowledge with oneself about something''.  Taken literally this is nonsense, but it had the figurative meaning of ''knowing that one knows'', as the modern English word &quot;conscious&quot; does.  In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word retained the Latin meaning.  For example [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'' wrote: &quot;Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another.&quot;  The Latin ''conscius sibi'' was rendered in English as &quot;conscious to oneself&quot; or &quot;conscious unto oneself&quot;.  For example, [[Archbishop Ussher]] wrote in 1613 of &quot;being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The whole works, Volume 2 |author=[[James Ussher]], [[Charles Richard Elrington]] |page=417 |year=1613 |publisher=Hodges and Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related word was ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'', which primarily means [[morality|moral]] [[conscience]]. In the literal sense, &quot;conscientia&quot; means knowledge-with, that is, shared knowledge. The word first appears in Latin juridical texts by writers such as [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 7|last1=Hastings|first1=James|last2=Selbie|first=John A.|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=0766136779|year=2003|page=41}} note: &quot;In the sense of 'consciousness,' consientia is rare, but it is exceedingly common in most writers after Cicero with the meaning 'conscience'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''conscientia'' is the knowledge that a witness has of the deed of someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melenaar|first=G.|title=Mnemosyne, Fourth Series|volume=22|pages=170–180|publisher=Brill}} note: reference only that Cicero had been using the word.[http://www.jstor.org/pss/4429733]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use &quot;conscientia&quot; in a way that does not fit this traditional meaning.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Descartes used &quot;conscientia&quot; the way modern speakers would use &quot;conscience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hennig|first=Boris|title=Cartesian Conscientia|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy|year=2007|volume=15|issue=3|pages=455–484}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Search after Truth'' he says &quot;conscience or internal testimony&quot; (''conscientia vel interno testimonio'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=205–206|title=Consciousness: from perception to reflection in the history of philosophy|isbn=978-1-4020-6081-6|publisher=Springer|first=Sara|last=Heinämaa|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, in Britain, the neo-Platonist theologian [[Ralph Cudworth]] used something resembling the modern meaning of consciousness in his &quot;[[True Intellectual System of the Universe]]&quot; ([[1678]]), although he never explicitly defined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=79|title=The Uses of antiquity: the scientific revolution and the classical tradition|last=Gaukroger|first=Stephen|isbn=0-7923-1130-2|year=1991|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical approaches==
The [[philosophy of mind]] has given rise to many stances regarding consciousness.  They differ in the answers they give to a set of fundamental questions, including:
#Is consciousness a valid concept or a conceptual error?
#Is it a single unified entity or a collection of distinct entities?
#How does it relate to language?
#Can it be explained in terms of the laws of physics?
#Why are we convinced that other people (or even we ourselves) possess consciousness?
#Why do we believe that some animals possess consciousness, and is there any way to test this belief?
#What is the nature of experience, and particularly what is the nature of sensory qualities such as the color red?

The question about the relationship between consciousness and the physical realm is perhaps the most contentious of all:  several schools of thought are defined mainly in terms of the answers they give to it.

===Is it a valid concept?===
A majority of philosophers have felt that the word consciousness names a genuine entity, but some who belong to the [[physicalist]] and [[behaviorist]] schools have not been convinced; many scientists have also been dubious.  The most compelling argument in favor is that the vast majority of mankind has an overwhelming intuition that there truly is such a thing.  The argument against is that this intuition, however compelling it may be, is false.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}  [[Gilbert Ryle]], for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that divides into mind and body, mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of 'consciousness,' we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Another problem that concerns many philosophers and scientists is the difficulty of producing a definition that does not rely on circularity or fuzziness.   The neuroscientist [[Antonio Damasio]], for example, calls consciousness &quot;the feeling of what happens&quot;, and defines it as &quot;an organism's awareness of its own self and its surroundings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio. A. 1999. ''The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness.'' New York: Harcourt Brace. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  These formulations seem intuitively reasonable, but they are difficult to apply to specific situations.

===Is it a single thing?===
Many philosophers have argued that ''consciousness'' is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.  Others, though, have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it is an [[umbrella term]] meaning different things to different people.

[[Ned Block]] proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called ''phenomenal'' (P-consciousness) and ''access'' (A-consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;Block, N. (2004). ''The Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science.''&lt;/ref&gt;  P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience:  it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called ''[[qualia]]''.  A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we [[perception|perceive]], information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we [[introspection|introspect]], information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we [[memory|remember]], information about the past is access conscious, and so on.  Although some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]], have disputed the validity of this distinction,&lt;ref name=&quot;D375&quot;&gt;Dennett, D. (2004).  ''Consciousness Explained'', p. 375. Harmondsworth: The Penguin Press, Middlesex, England.  ISBN 0971399037-6.&lt;/ref&gt; others have broadly accepted it.  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging:  he calls this the ''[[hard problem of consciousness]]''.  Dennett denies that the concept of qualia is coherent, that P-consciousness is intrinsically different from A-consciousness, and that there is anything especially hard about the &quot;hard problem&quot;.

===How does it relate to the physical world?===
{{main|Mind–body problem}}
The first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was Descartes, and the answer he proposed is known as [[Cartesian dualism]].  Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called ''res cogitans'' (the realm of thought), in contrast to the domain of material things which he called ''res extensa'' (the realm of extension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Man: selected readings|last=Dy, Jr.|first=Manuel B.|publisher=Goodwill Trading Co.Inc.|year=2001isbn=971-12-0245-X|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford_pineal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland|publisher=Stanford University|date=November 5, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pineal-gland/|accessdate=Aug.22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem very cogently, few later philosophers have been happy with his solution, and in particular his emphasis on the pineal gland has generally been ridiculed.  Alternative solutions, however, have been extremely diverse.  They can be divided broadly into two categories:  [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] solutions that maintain Descartes's rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and [[monism|monist]] solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects.  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants.  The two main types of dualism are [[substance dualism]] (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics) and [[property dualism]] (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind).  The three main types of monism are [[physicalism]] (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), [[idealism]] (which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion), and [[neutral monism]] (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them).  There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these camps.

Some theorists hold that phenomenal consciousness in particular creates an [[explanatory gap]]. [[Colin McGinn]] takes the [[New Mysterianism]] position that it can't be solved, and David Chalmers [[David Chalmers#Work|criticizes purely physical accounts]] of mental experiences based on the idea that [[philosophical zombie]]s are logically possible and supports [[property dualism]].

===How does it relate to language?===
In humans, the clearest visible indication of consciousness is the ability to use language.  Medical assessments of consciousness rely heavily on an ability to respond to questions and commands, and in scientific studies of consciousness, the usual criterion for awareness is verbal report (that is, subjects are deemed to be aware if they say that they are).  Thus there is a strong connection between consciousness and language.  Philosophers differ, however, on whether language is essential to consciousness or merely the most powerful tool for gaining access to it.

Descartes believed that language is essential:  he argued that non-human animals lack consciousness because they lack language.  Others have reached the same conclusion, though sometimes for different reasons.  [[Julian Jaynes]] argued in ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]'' that for consciousness to arise, language needs to have reached a fairly high level of complexity.  [[Merlin Donald]] also argued for a critical dependence of consciousness on the ability to use symbols in a sophisticated way.&lt;ref&gt;A Mind So Rare p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

Those are, however, minority views.  If language is essential, then speechless humans (infants, [[feral child]]ren, [[aphasia|aphasics]], ''etc.'') could not be said to be conscious, a conclusion that the majority of philosophers have resisted.  The implication that humans are the only animals capable of consciousness is also widely resisted, and often viewed as offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koch&quot;&gt;[[Christof Koch]], ''The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach.'' Englewood, Colorado: Roberts and Company Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Why do people believe that other people are conscious?===
Many philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively.  But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do the vast majority of people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knobe J |year=2008 |title=Can a Robot, an Insect or God Be Aware? |journal=Scientific American: Mind |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-a-robot-an-insect-or}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the [[problem of other minds]].  It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness.

The most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior:  we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences of the sort that we do.  There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation.  For one thing, it seems to violate the [[Occam's razor|principle of parsimony]], by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe.  Some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] in an essay titled ''The Unimaginable Preposterousness of Zombies'', argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying.  More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior.  A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because they tell us about their experiences.

==Scientific approaches==
For many decades, consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists, because of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendriks-Jansen|first=Horst|title=Catching ourselves in the act: situated activity, interactive emergence, evolution, and human thought|year=1996|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|page=114|isbn=0-262-08246-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Even so, some research on topics associated with consciousness was conducted under the banner of [[attention]].  Starting in the 1980s, an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called ''Consciousness Studies'', giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in journals such as [[Consciousness and Cognition]], and methodological work published in journals such as the [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]], along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the [[Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness]].

Broadly speaking, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts.  The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired in a variety of ways.  In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.

===Cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience===
Modern scientific investigations into consciousness are based on [[psychological statistics|psychological]] [[statistical study|statistical studies]] and [[case studies]] of consciousness states and the deficits caused by surgery, trauma or illness that disrupt the normal functioning of human [[sense]]s and [[cognition]]. Another approach is experimental work on unconscious perception, e.g., the investigation of [[priming]] effects using [[subliminal stimuli]]. These discoveries suggest that the [[mind]] is a complex structure derived from various localized functions that are [[binding problem|bound]] together with a unitary awareness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Several studies point to common mechanisms in different clinical conditions that lead to loss of consciousness. [[Persistent vegetative state]] (PVS) is a condition in which an individual loses the higher cerebral powers of the brain, but maintains sleep-wake cycles with full or partial autonomic functions. Studies comparing PVS with healthy, awake subjects consistently demonstrate an impaired connectivity between the deeper (brainstem and thalamic) and the upper (cortical) areas of the brain. In addition, it is agreed that the general brain activity in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] is lower in the PVS state. Some [[electroneurobiology|electroneurobiological]] interpretations of consciousness characterize this loss of consciousness as a loss of the ability to resolve time (similar to playing an old phonographic record at very slow or very rapid speed), along a continuum that starts with inattention, continues on sleep, and arrives to coma and [[death]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;Bl5&quot;&gt;Mariela Szirko: &quot;Effects of relativistic motions in the brain and their physiological relevance&quot;, Chapter 10 (pp. 313-358) in: Helmut Wautischer, editor, ''Ontology of Consciousness: Percipient Action'', A Bradford Book:
The MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1st edition, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is likely that different components of consciousness can be teased apart with [[anesthetics]], sedatives and [[hypnotics]].  These drugs appear to act differently on several brain areas to disrupt, to varying degrees, different components of consciousness.  The ability to recall information, for example, may be disrupted by anesthetics acting on the [[Hippocampus|hippocampal cortex]].  Neurons in this region are particularly sensitive to anesthetics at the time loss of recall occurs.  Direct anesthetic actions on hippocampal neurons have been shown to underlie EEG effects that occur in humans and animals during loss of recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1097/00000542-199606000-00018 | last1=McIver | first1=M.B. | last2=Mandema | first2=J.W. | last3=Stanski | first3=D.R. | last4=Bland | first4=B.H. | year=1996 | title=Thiopental uncouples hippocampal and cortical synchronized electroencephalographic activity | journal=Anesthesiology | volume=84 | pages=1411–1424 | pmid=8669683 | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain chemistry affects human consciousness. [[Sedative|Sleeping drugs]] such as [[midazolam]] (Dormicum) can bring the brain from the awake condition (conscious) to the sleep (unconscious) condition. Wake-up drugs such as [[flumazenil]] reverse this process. Many other drugs (such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[nicotine]], [[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], [[LSD]], [[MDMA]], [[caffeine]]), have a consciousness-changing effect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Neurophysiological studies in awake, behaving monkeys point to advanced cortical areas in prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes as carriers of neuronal correlates of consciousness. [[Christof Koch]] and [[Francis Crick]] argue that [[neural correlates of consciousness|neuronal mechanisms of consciousness]] are intricately related to prefrontal cortex &amp;mdash; cortical areas involved in higher cognitive function, affect, behavioral control, and planning. [[Rodolfo Llinas]] proposes that consciousness results from [[recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance]] where the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus) thalamocortical systems (context) interact in the [[gamma wave|gamma]] band frequency via time coincidence. According to this view the &quot;I&quot; represents a global predictive function required for intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;Llinas R.. (2001) &quot;I of the Vortex. From Neurons to Self&quot; MIT Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Llinas R.,Ribary, U. Contreras, D. and Pedroarena, C. (1998) &quot;The neuronal basis for consciousness&quot; Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London, B. 353:1841-1849&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental work of Steven Wise, [[Mikhail Lebedev]] and their colleagues supports this view. They demonstrated that activity of prefrontal cortex neurons reflects illusory perceptions of movements of visual stimuli. Nikos Logothetis and colleagues made similar observations on visually responsive neurons in the temporal lobe. These neurons reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry). The studies of [[blindsight]] &amp;mdash; vision without awareness after lesions to parts of the visual system such as the primary visual cortex &amp;mdash; performed by Lawrence Weiskrantz and David P. Carey provided important insights on how conscious perception arises in the brain. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The [[Neuroscience of free will]] also seems to provide relevant insights to the understanding of consciousness.

===Measurement===
Experimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties, e.g., when establishing whether an observer is unaware of a critical stimulus. Several techniques exist for dissociating the conscious visibility of stimuli from indirect effects they might have on behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, T., &amp; Vorberg, D.: ''Criteria for unconscious cognition: Three types of dissociation.'' In: ''Perception &amp; Psychophysics'', Nr. 68, 2006, p. 489-504.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the experimental technique of [[Response Priming]] allows researchers to find conditions where the conscious visibility of a critical stimulus and the ability of that stimulus to affect a motor response develop in opposite directions, e.g., when motor effects of a stimulus become larger under conditions where its visibility is decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;Vorberg, D., Mattler, U., Heinecke, A., Schmidt, T., &amp; Schwarzbach, J.: ''Different time courses for visual perception and action priming.'' In: ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'', Nr. 100, 2003, p. 6275-6280.&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, several neurological and brain imaging techniques, such as [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]], have proven useful for physical measures of brain activity associated with consciousness.  This is particularly true for [[EEG measures during anesthesia]], which can provide an indication of anesthetic depth.

====Operational tests====
It has been argued that due to the nature of the problem of consciousness, empirical tests are intrinsically impossible.  However, several tests have been developed that attempt an [[operational definition]] of consciousness and try to determine whether computers and non-human animals can demonstrate through behavior, by passing these tests, that they are conscious.

Though sometimes thought of as a test for consciousness, the [[Turing test]] (named after computer scientist [[Alan Turing]], who proposed it) was originally presented as an operational replacement for the question &quot;Can machines think?&quot;, which Turing regarded as too ambiguous to be meaningful.  This test is commonly cited in discussion of [[artificial intelligence]]. The test is based on an &quot;Imitation Game&quot; in which a human experimenter converses, via computer keyboards, with two competitors, one human, the other a computer.  Because all of the conversation is by keyboard, no cues such as voice, prosody, or appearance will be available to indicate which is human and which is the computer.  If the human judge is unable to determine which of the conversants is the computer, the computer is said to have &quot;passed&quot; the test.  The Turing test has generated a great deal of philosophical debate. For example, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious,&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.C. and Hofstadter, D. (1985). The Mind's I: Fantasies and reflections on self and soul (ISBN 978-0-553-34584-1)&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David Chalmers]], argues that a [[philosophical zombie]] could pass the test, yet fail to be conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D. (1997) ''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory.'' Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-511789 Please check ISBN|0195117891&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Mirror test]], devised by [[Gordon Gallup]] in the 1970s, one is interested in whether animals are able to recognize themselves in a mirror. The classic example of the test involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves. Humans (older than 18 months) and other [[Hominidae|great apes]], [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[pigeon]]s, [[elephants]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10402-elephants-see-themselves-in-the-mirror.html Elephants see themselves in the mirror - life - 30 October 2006 - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magpie]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/rubin/rbin2_00/natur/artikel1/index.html &quot;Was Elstern wahrnehmen&quot;] german article&lt;/ref&gt; have all been observed to pass this test. The test is usually carried out with an identical 'spot' being placed elsewhere on the head with a non-visible material as a control, to assure the subject is not responding to the touch stimuli of the spot's presence.

===Biological function and evolution===
Regarding the primary function of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing that would otherwise be independent (see review in Baars, 2002). This has been called the ''integration consensus''. However, it remained unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect (cf., Morsella, 2005).

Even among writers who consider consciousness to be a definite thing, there is widespread dispute about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it.&lt;ref name = &quot;ingvww&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Budiansky S |title=If a Lion Could Talk: Animal Intelligence and the Evolution of Consciousness |year=1998 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |isbn=9780684837109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties.  Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of  [[evolutionary biology]] as an [[adaptation]] in the sense of a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] that increases [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Nichols S, Grantham T |title=Adaptive Complexity and Phenomenal Consciousness |year=2000 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=648–670}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his paper &quot;Evolution of consciousness,&quot; John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian [[cerebral cortex]] gave rise to consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eccles JC |title=Evolution of consciousness |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=89 |issue=16 |pages=7320–4 |year=1992 |month=August |pmid=1502142 |pmc=49701 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernard Baars proposed that once in place, this recursive circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Baars BJ |title=A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Flanagan OJ, Polger TW |year=1995 |title=Zombies and the function of consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=313–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible, they argue, for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism to achieve the same survival advantages as a non-conscious organism.  If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function ''F'' being performed by conscious organism ''O'' and non-conscious organism ''O*'', it is unclear what advantage consciousness would provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Harnad S |year=2002 |chapter=Turing Indistinguishability and the Blind Watchmaker |editor=Fetzer JH |title=Consciousness Evolving |publisher=John Benjamins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
Since the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that even consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms. The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]], in his book [[Man a Machine]] (''L'homme machine'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor=Ann Thomson |author=Julien Offray de La Mettrie |title=Machine man and other writings |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521478496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as [[Gerald Edelman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bright air, brilliant fire: on the matter of the mind |author=Edelman GM |publisher=Basic Books |year=1993 |isbn=9780465007646}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[António Damásio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Damasio A |year=1999 |title=The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Press |isbn=978-0-15-601075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett D |year=1991 |title=Consciousness Explained |location=Boston |publisher=Little &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-316-18066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; seek to explain access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain. Many other neuroscientists, such as [[Christof Koch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Koch C |year=2004 |title=The Quest for Consciousness |location=Englewood, CO |publisher=Roberts &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-9747077-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists working in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]] have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can [[Artificial consciousness|simulate or embody consciousness]].

Some theorists—most of whom are physicists—have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] provides [[quantum mind|the missing ingredients]]. Several theorists have therefore proposed [[quantum mind]] (QM) theories of consciousness; the most notable theories falling into this category include the [[Holonomic brain theory]] of [[Karl H. Pribram]] and [[David Bohm]], and the [[Orch-OR|Orch-OR theory]] formulated by [[Stuart Hameroff]] and [[Roger Penrose]]. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment, and many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J. (1997) The Mystery of Consciousness, London, Granta Books, p84&lt;/ref&gt;

===States of Consciousness===

The three most widely accepted states of consciousness are sleeping, dreaming and waking. In addition to the obvious subjective differences each state has a corresponding pattern of physiological functioning in terms of EEG, biochemical markers, and (in dreaming) rapid eye movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Guyton A.C., Hall J. E. |year=2000 |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology, Tenth Edition |publisher=Saunders |pages=689–691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Moorcraft, W.H. |year=2005 |title=Understanding Sleep and Dreaming |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various techniques of meditation. Recent research with brain waves during meditation has shown a distinct difference between those of just relaxation and the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com­ /releases/2010/03/100319210631.htm|work=Brain waves and meditation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is contested, however, whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Murphy M., Donovan S., Taylor E |year=1997 |title=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research With a Comprehensive Bibliography, 1931-1996 |publisher=Institute of Noetic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander C.N., Langer E. (1990) ''Higher Stages of Human Development: Perspectives on Adult Growth,'' Oxford University Press pp286-341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merkwelt===

The [[merkwelt]] ([[German language|German]]; {{lang-en|&quot;way of viewing the world&quot;, &quot;peculiar individual consciousness&quot;}}) is a [[concept]] in [[robotics]], [[psychology]] and [[biology]] that describes a creature or android's capacity to view things, manipulate [[information]] and synthesize to make meaning out of the [[universe]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  In biology, a [[shark]]'s merkwelt for instance is dominated by [[olfaction|smell]] due to its enlarged [[olfaction|olfactory lobes]] whilst a bat's is dominated by its [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], especially at ultrasonic frequencies.  This term was particularly developed by the German biologist [[Jakob von Uexküll]] who framed it as part of his theory of [[umwelt]]. This basically stated that any living 'observer' of the broader environment or [[umwelt]] through their particular werkwelt or 'mechanical viewing' (that is to say, the organs through which they view the world- their eyes, ears, mouth etc. in humans and electrical sensors in sharks for instance) could have a merkwelt or 'perceptual universe'.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''Mondes animaux et monde humain ''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical aspects==
In medicine, consciousness is measured by [[neuropsychological assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Giacino JT, Smart CM|date=December 2007|doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e3282f189ef|issue=6|journal=Curr Opin Neurol|pages=614–619|pmid=17992078|title=Recent advances in behavioral assessment of individuals with disorders of consciousness|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is of concern to patients, physicians, and ethicists as well as biological scientists and biomedical engineers. [[Patient]]s may suffer from [[disorders of consciousness]] and seek medical treatment.  [[Physician]]s may perform medical interventions of consciousness such as instructing the patient to [[sleep]], administering [[general anesthesia]], or inducing [[induced coma|medical coma]]. [[Bioethicists]] and [[neuroethicists]] may be concerned with the ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as [[Karen Ann Quinlan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kinney HC, Korein J, Panigrahy A, Dikkes P, Goode R|date=26 May 1994|issue=21|journal=N Engl J Med|pages=1469–1475|pmid=8164698|title=Neuropathological findings in the brain of Karen Ann Quinlan -- the role of the thalamus in the persistent vegetative state|volume=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terri Schiavo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Goodnough A|date=16 Jun 2005|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A24|title=Schiavo autopsy says brain, withered, was untreatable|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/16/national/16schiavo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[biological scientist]]s study patients with these disorders while [[biomedical engineer]]s develop [[neuroprosthetics]] for them.

===Assessment===
There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient, a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise.

The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli.  If so, the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands.  If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.  A patient who can answer all of these questions correctly is said to be &quot;oriented times three&quot; (sometimes denoted &quot;Ox3&quot; on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.   A patient who can additionally describe the current situation may be referred to as &quot;oriented times four&quot;.

The more complex procedure is known as a [[neurological examination]], and is usually carried out by a [[neurology|neurologist]] in a hospital setting.  A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely defined series of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language.  The outcome may be summarized using the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], which yields a number in the range 3—15, with a score of 3 indicating [[brain death]] (the lowest level of consciousness), and 15 indicating full consciousness.  The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the ''best motor response'' (ranging from &quot;no motor response&quot; to &quot;obeys commands&quot;), the ''best eye response'' (ranging from &quot;no eye opening&quot; to &quot;eyes opening spontaneously&quot;) and the ''best verbal response'' (ranging from &quot;no verbal response&quot; to &quot;fully oriented&quot;).  There is also a simpler [[Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale|pediatric]] version of the scale, for children too young to be able to use language.

===Disorders of consciousness===
Medical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered [[disorders of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronic&quot;/&gt; This category generally includes [[minimally conscious state]] and [[persistent vegetative state]], but sometimes also includes the less severe [[locked-in syndrome]] and more severe [[coma|chronic coma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronic&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}

==Spiritual approaches==
===''Vedanta''===
According to ''[[Vedanta]],'' awareness is not a product of physical processes and can be considered under four aspects. The first is waking consciousness (''jagaritasthana''), the identification with “I” or “me” in relationship with phenomenal experiences with external objects. The second aspect is dream consciousness (''svapna-sthana''), which embodies the same subject/object duality as the waking state. The third aspect of consciousness is deep sleep (''susupti''), which is non-dual as a result of holding in abeyance all feelings, thoughts, and sensations. The final aspect is the consciousness that underlies and transcends the first three aspects (''[[turiya]]'') also referred to as a trans-cognitive state (''anubhava'') or a state of self-realization or freedom from body-mind identification ([[moksha]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yegan Pillay, Katherine K. Ziff and Christine Suniti Bhat, ''Vedānta Personality Development: A Model to Enhance the Cultural Competence of Psychotherapists'', International Journal of Hindu Studies, Volume 12, Number 1 / April, 2008, OUP&lt;/ref&gt; The state of turiya has been correlated with physiological and bio chemical changes in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, M. (1997)'' The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research With a Comprehensive Bibliography, 1931-1996'' ( 2nd edition)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaudiya Vaisnavism|Gaudiya Vedanta]] recognizes a fifth aspect of consciousness in which God becomes subordinate to ''[[bhakti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]], ''[http://www.swami.org/pages/sanga/1999/1999_14.php Entering the Fifth Dimension]'', ''Sanga'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vijñāna===
In Buddhism, consciousness ([[viññāṇa]]) is included in the five classically defined experiential &quot;[[skandha|aggregates]]&quot;.  The aggregates are seen as [[anatta|empty of self-nature]]; that is, they arise dependent on causes and conditions.  The cause for consciousness arising (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is the arising of another  aggregate (physical or mental); and, consciousness arising in turn gives rise to one or more of the mental (''nāma'') aggregates.  The causation chain identified in the aggregate (''khandha'') model overlaps the conditioning chain in Dependent Origination (''[[Pratitya-samutpada|paticcasamuppāda]]'') model.&lt;ref&gt;This overlap is particularly pronounced in the ''Mahanidana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15) where consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is a condition of name-and-body (''nāmarūpa'') and ''vice-versa'' (see, e.g., Thanissaro, 1997a).&lt;/ref&gt; Consciousness is the third link, between [[Saṅkhāra|mind body mental formations]] and [[Namarupa|name &amp; form]] in the traditional [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes]] (''nidāna'') of [[Pratitya-samutpada|Dependent Origination]].&lt;ref&gt;Not all canonical texts identify twelve causes in Dependent Origination's causal chain.  For instance, the ''Mahanidana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997a)] identifies only nine causes (omitting the six sense bases, formations and ignorance) and the initial text of the ''Nalakalapiyo Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.67) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html (Thanissaro, 2000)] twice identifies ten causes (omitting formations and ignorance) although its final enumeration includes the twelve traditional factors.&lt;/ref&gt;  The six classes of consciousness are: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, intellect-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, similar to the sensory-specific description of consciousness found in discussing &quot;the All&quot; (above), the &quot;Analysis of Dependent Origination Discourse&quot; (''Paticcasamuppada-vibhanga Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.2) describes ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' (&quot;consciousness&quot;) in the following manner:
:&quot;And what is ''consciousness''? These six are classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, intellect-consciousness. This is called consciousness.&quot; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997b)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following aspects are traditionally highlighted within Dependent Origination:
:* consciousness is conditioned by mental fabrications (''{{IAST|[[sankhara|saṅkhāra]]}}'');
:* consciousness and the mind-body (''[[namarupa|nāmarūpa]]'') are interdependent; and,
:* consciousness acts as a &quot;life force&quot; by which there is a continuity across rebirths.

[[File:Euromoenterogsedler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coins]] and [[banknotes]] – the two most common forms of currency.]]
{{Numismatics}}
In [[economics]], '''currency''' refers to physical objects generally accepted as a [[medium of exchange]]. These are usually the [[coins]] and [[banknotes]] of a particular government, which comprise the physical aspects of a nation's [[money supply]]. The other part of a nation's money supply consists of [[bank deposits]] (sometimes called [[deposit money]]), ownership of which can be transferred by means of [[cheque]]s, [[debit card]]s, or other forms of money transfer. Deposit money and currency are [[money]] in the sense that both are acceptable as a means of payment.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bernstein |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter L. Bernstein |title=A Primer on Money, Banking and Gold |trans_title= |edition=3rd |year=2008 |origyear=1965 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ  |isbn=978-0-470-28758-3 |oclc=233484849 |chapter=Chapters 4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money in the form of currency has predominated throughout most of history. Usually ([[gold]] or [[silver]]) coins of intrinsic value ([[commodity money]]) have been the norm. However, nearly all contemporary money systems are based on [[fiat money]] – modern currency has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins issued by the [[central bank]]) to be [[legal tender]], making it unlawful to not accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Deardorff, Prof. Alan V. |year = 2008 |title = Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics |url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/f.html |publisher = Department of Economics, University of Michigan |accessdate = 2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black, Henry Campbell (1910). &quot;A Law Dictionary Containing Definitions Of The Terms And Phrases Of American And English Jurisprudence, Ancient And Modern&quot;, page 494. West Publishing Co. [[Black’s Law Dictionary]] defines the word &quot;fiat&quot; to mean &quot;a short order or warrant of a Judge or magistrate directing some act to be done; an authority issuing from some competent source for the doing of some legal act&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Shekel]] --&gt;

=== Early currency ===
Currency evolved from two basic innovations, both of which had occurred by 2000 BC. Originally money was a form of receipt, representing grain stored in temple granaries in [[Sumer]] in ancient [[Mesopotamia]], then [[Ancient Egypt]].

This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the [[Fertile Crescent]] for over 1500 years. However, the collapse of the Near Eastern trading system pointed to a flaw: in an era where there was no place that was safe to store value, the value of a circulating medium could only be as sound as the forces that defended that store. Trade could only reach as far as the credibility of that military. By the late [[Bronze Age]], however, a series of international treaties had established safe passage for merchants around the Eastern Mediterranean, spreading from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] and [[Mycenae]] in the northwest to [[Elam]] and [[Bahrain]] in the southeast. Although it is not known what functioned as a currency to facilitate these exchanges, it is thought that ox-hide shaped ingots of copper, produced in [[Cyprus]] may have functioned as a currency.
It is thought that the increase in piracy and raiding associated with the [[Bronze Age collapse]], possibly produced by the [[Peoples of the Sea]], brought this trading system to an end. It was only with the recovery of Phoenician trade in the ninth and tenth centuries BC that saw a return to prosperity, and the appearance of real coinage, possibly first in Anatolia with [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]] and subsequently with the Greeks and Persians.
In Africa many forms of value store have been used including beads, ingots, [[ivory]], various forms of weapons, livestock, the [[manilla currency]], ochre and other earth oxides, and so on. The manilla rings of [[West Africa]] were one of the currencies used from the 15th century onwards to buy and sell slaves. [[African currency]] is still notable for its variety, and in many places various forms of [[barter]] still apply.

=== Coinage ===
{{main|Coin}}
These factors led to the shift of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new [[unit of account]], which helped lead to [[banking]]. [[Archimedes' principle]] provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their [[Fineness|fine]] weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see [[Numismatics]]).

In most major economies using coinage, copper, silver and gold formed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the military and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of account for taxes, dues, contracts and fealty, while copper coins represented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient [[Indian coinage|India]] since the time of the [[Mahajanapadas]]. In Europe, this system worked through the [[medieval]] period because there was virtually no new gold, silver or copper introduced through mining or conquest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.

=== Paper money ===
{{main|Banknote}}
In [[History of China|premodern]] [[China]], the need for credit and for circulating a medium that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of [[copper]] coins led to the introduction of [[banknote|paper money]], commonly known today as [[banknote]]s. This economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) into the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for [[receipt]]s of deposit issued as [[promissory notes]] from shops of [[wholesaler]]s, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the [[Song Dynasty]] government began circulating these notes amongst the traders in their [[monopoly|monopolized]] salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; it was not until the mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of [[woodblock printing]] and then [[Bi Sheng]]'s [[movable type]] [[printing]] by the 11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern China.

At around the same time in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], a vigorous [[monetary economy]] was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the [[dinar]]). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of [[Credit (finance)|credit]],&lt;ref name=Banaji&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banaji  |first=Jairus |year=2007 |title=Islam, the Mediterranean and the Rise of Capitalism |journal=Historical Materialism |volume=15 |series= |issue=1 |pages=47–74 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |issn=1465-4466 |doi=10.1163/156920607X171591 |bibcode= |oclc=440360743 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/14246569/Banaji-Jairus-Islam-The-Mediterranean-and-the-Rise-of-Capitalism |accessdate=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cheque]]s, [[promissory note]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Medieval Trade in the Mediterranean World: Illustrative Documents&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lopez |first1=Robert Sabatino |authorlink1=Roberto Sabatino Lopez |last2=Raymond |first2=Irving Woodworth |last3=Constable |first3=Olivia Remie |title=Medieval trade in the Mediterranean world: Illustrative documents |series=Records of Western civilization.; Records of civilization, sources and studies, no. 52 |year=2001  |origyear=1955 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |url=http://cup.columbia.edu/bookpreview/978-0-231-12356-3/ |isbn=0231123574 |oclc=466877309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[savings account]]s, [[transactional account]]s, [[loan]]ing, [[trusts]], [[exchange rate]]s, the transfer of credit and [[debt]],&lt;ref name=Labib&gt;{{cite journal |last=Labib |first=Subhi Y. |year=1969 |month=March |title=Capitalism in Medieval Islam |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–86 |publisher=Economic History Association |location=Wilmington, DE |issn=0022-0507 |oclc=478662641 |id={{JSTOR|2115499}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[banking institution]]s for loans and [[deposit account|deposit]]s.&lt;ref name=Labib /&gt;

In Europe, paper money was first introduced in [[Sweden]] in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made.

The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the risks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier, since the specie (gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of [[stock]] in [[joint stock company|joint stock companies]], and the redemption of those [[shares]] in paper.

However, these advantages held within them disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by [[David Hume]] in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a [[standing army]]. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established [[mint (coin)|mints]] to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.

At this time both silver and gold were considered [[legal tender]], and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the [[Gresham's law|instability in the ratio]] between the two grew over the course of the 19th century, with the increase both in supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called [[bimetallism]] and the attempt to create a [[Bimetallism|bimetallic]] standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of [[inflation]]ists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States [[United States Note|Greenback]], to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.

By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private [[bank]]s and governments across the world followed [[Gresham's Law]]: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the [[gold standard]] was the United States in 1971.

No country anywhere in the world today has an enforceable [[gold standard]] or [[silver standard]] currency system.

=== Banknote era===
{{Main|Banknote|Fiat currency}}
A [[banknote]] (more commonly known as a bill in the United States and Canada) is a type of currency, and commonly used as legal tender in many jurisdictions. With [[coin]]s, banknotes make up the [[cash]] form of all [[money]]. Mostly paper, Australia's [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] developed the world's first [[Polymer banknote|polymer currency]] in the 1980s that went into circulation on the nation's bicentenary in 1988. Now used in some 22 countries (over 40 if counting commemorative issues), [[Polymer banknote|polymer currency]] dramatically improves the life span of banknotes and prevents counterfeiting.

== Modern currencies ==
{{main|Tables of historical exchange rates to the USD}}
[[File:2002 currency exchange AIGA euro money.png|thumb|Currencies exchange logo]]
To find out which currency is used in a particular country, check [[list of circulating currencies]].

Currently, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] has introduced a three-letter system of codes ([[ISO 4217]]) to define currency (as opposed to simple names or [[currency sign]]s), in order to remove the confusion that there are dozens of currencies called the [[dollar]] and many called the [[franc]]. Even the [[List of countries using pound currency|pound]] is used in nearly a dozen different countries, all, of course, with wildly differing values. In general, the three-letter code uses the [[ISO 3166-1]] country code for the first two letters and the first letter of the name of the currency (D for dollar, for instance) as the third letter. United States currency, for instance is globally referred to as [[USD]].

The [[International Monetary Fund]] uses a variant system when referring to national currencies.

==Control and production==
In most cases, each private [[central bank]] has [[monopoly]] control over the supply and production of its own currency. To facilitate [[international trade|trade]] between these currency zones, there are different [[exchange rate]]s, which are the prices at which currencies (and the goods and services of individual currency zones) can be exchanged against each other. Currencies can be classified as either [[floating currency|floating currencies]] or [[fixed currency|fixed currencies]] based on their [[exchange rate regime]]. 

In cases where a country does have control of its own currency, that control is exercised either by a [[central bank]] or by a [[Finance minister|Ministry of Finance]]. In either case, the institution that has control of monetary policy is referred to as the monetary authority. Monetary authorities have varying degrees of autonomy from the governments that create them. In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Reserve System]] operates without direct oversight by the legislative or executive branches. A monetary authority is created and supported by its sponsoring government, so independence can be reduced by the legislative or executive authority that creates it. (Revocation of authority is unlikely in [[Western world|Western countries]], where there has been a trend towards central bank independence.)

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:WorldCurrency.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Currencies around the world.]] --&gt;
Several countries can use the same name for their own distinct currencies (for example,, ''dollar'' in [[Canadian dollar|Canada]] and the [[United States dollar|United States]]). By contrast, several countries can also use the same currency (for example,, the [[euro]]), or one country can declare the currency of another country to be [[legal tender]]. For example, [[Panama]] and [[El Salvador]] have declared U.S. currency to be legal tender, and from 1791–1857, [[Spanish silver coins]] were legal tender in the United States. At various times countries have either re-stamped foreign coins, or used [[currency board]] issuing one note of currency for each note of a foreign government held, as [[Ecuador]] currently does.

Each currency typically has a main currency unit (the [[U.S. dollar]], for example, or the [[euro]]) and a fractional currency, often valued at {{Frac|1|100}} of the main currency: 100 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s = 1 [[dollar]], 100 [[centime]]s = 1 [[franc]], 100 [[British One Penny coin|pence]] = 1 [[Pound sterling|pound]], although units of {{Frac|1|10}} or {{Frac|1|1000}} are also common. Some currencies do not have any smaller units at all, such as the [[Icelandic króna]].

[[Mauritania]] and [[Madagascar]] are the only remaining countries that do not use the decimal system; instead, the Mauritanian [[Mauritanian ouguiya|ouguiya]] is divided into 5 [[khoums]], while the [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] [[Malagasy ariary|ariary]] is divided into 5 [[iraimbilanja]]. In these countries, words like ''dollar'' or ''pound'' &quot;were simply names for given weights of gold.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Collapse of the Dollar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turk |first1=James |last2=Rubino |first2=John |title=The collapse of the dollar and how to profit from it: Make a fortune by investing in gold and other hard assets.|edition=Paperback |year=2007 |origyear=2004 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=9780385512244 |oclc=192055959 |pages=43 of 252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[inflation]] khoums and iraimbilanja have in practice fallen into disuse. (See [[non-decimal currencies]] for other historic currencies with non-decimal divisions).

== Currency Convertibility ==
Convertibility of a currency determines the ability of an individual, corporate or government to convert its local currency to another currency or vice versa with or without central bank/government intervention. Based on the above restrictions or free and readily conversion features currencies are classified as:

* Fully Convertible - When there are no restrictions or limitations on the amount of currency that can be traded on the international market, and the government does not artificially impose a fixed value or minimum value on the currency in international trade. The US dollar is an example of a fully convertible currency and for this reason, US dollars are one of the major currencies traded in the FOREX market.
* Partially Convertible - Central Banks control over international investments flowing in and out of the country, while most domestic trade transactions are handled without any special requirements, there are significant restrictions on international investing and special approval is often required in order to convert into other currencies. Indian Rupee is an example for partially convertible currency.
* Nonconvertible - Neither participate in the international FOREX market nor allow conversion of these currencies by individuals or companies. As a result, these currencies are known as blocked currencies. e.g.: North Korean Won and the Cuban national Peso

== Local currencies ==
{{Main|Local currency}}
In economics, a local currency is a currency not backed by a national government, and intended to trade only in a small area. Advocates such as [[Jane Jacobs]] argue that this enables an economically depressed region to pull itself up, by giving the people living there a medium of exchange that they can use to exchange services and locally produced goods (In a broader sense, this is the original purpose of all money.) Opponents of this concept argue that local currency creates a barrier which can interfere with economies of scale and comparative advantage, and that in some cases they can serve as a means of [[tax evasion]].

Local currencies can also come into being when there is economic turmoil involving the national currency. An example of this is the Argentinian economic crisis of 2002 in which IOUs issued by local governments quickly took on some of the characteristics of local currencies.

A '''central bank''', '''reserve bank''', or '''monetary authority''' is a public institution that usually issues the currency, regulates the [[money supply]], and controls the interest rates in a country. Central banks often also oversee the [[commercial bank|commercial banking system]] of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on printing the national currency, which usually serves as the nation's [[legal tender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The primary function of a central bank is to provide the nation's money supply, but more active duties include controlling [[interest rates]], and acting as a [[lender of last resort]] to the [[bank|banking sector]] during times of financial crisis. It may also have supervisory powers, to ensure that banks and other financial institutions do not behave recklessly or fraudulently.

Central banks in most developed nations are independent in that they operate under rules designed to render them free from political interference. Examples include the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bank of England]], and the [[Federal Reserve System]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://federalreserveeducation.org/about-the-fed/structure-and-functions/ |title=The Structure of the Federal Reserve System |date= |author= |publisher=federalreserveeducation.org |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:London.bankofengland.arp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bank of England]], established in 1694.]]
In Europe prior to the 17th century most money was [[commodity money]], typically [[gold]] or silver. However, promises to pay were widely circulated and accepted as value at least five hundred years earlier in both Europe and Asia. The [[Song Dynasty]] was the first to issue generally circulating paper currency, while the [[Yuan Dynasty]] was the first to use notes as the predominant circulating medium. In 1455, in an effort to control [[inflation]], the succeeding [[Ming Dynasty]] ended the use of paper money and closed much of Chinese trade. The medieval European [[Knights Templar]] ran an early prototype of a central banking system, as their promises to pay were widely respected, and many regard their activities as having laid the basis for the modern banking system.

As the first public bank to &quot;offer accounts not directly convertible to coin&quot;, the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] established in 1609 is considered to be a precursor to a central bank.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Stephen; Roberds, William (2006), [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=934871 &quot;An Economic Explanation of the Early Bank of Amsterdam, Debasement, Bills of Exchange, and the Emergence of the First Central Bank&quot;], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta]], Working Paper 2006–13&lt;/ref&gt; The central bank of Sweden (&quot;[[Sveriges Riksbank]]&quot; or simply &quot;Riksbanken&quot;) was founded in Stockholm in 1664, making it the oldest central bank still operating today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=9159 History of Sveriges Riksbank]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1694 by the [[Bank of England]], created by Scottish businessman [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] in the [[City of London]] at the request of the [[Kingdom of England|English]] government to help pay for a war.

Although central banks today are generally associated with [[fiat money]], the 19th and early 20th centuries central banks in most of Europe and [[Bank of Japan|Japan]] developed under the international [[gold standard]], elsewhere [[free banking]] or [[currency board]]s were more usual at this time. Problems with collapses of banks during downturns, however, was leading to wider support for central banks in those nations which did not as yet possess them, most notably in [[Australia]].

With the collapse of the gold standard after [[World War I]], central banks became much more widespread. The [[US Federal Reserve]] was created by the [[U.S. Congress]] through the passing of the [[Glass-Owen Bill]], signed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on December 23, 1913, whilst Australia established its first central bank in 1920, [[Colombia]] in 1923, [[Mexico]] and [[Chile]] in 1925 and [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] in the aftermath of the [[Great Depression]] in 1934. By 1935, the only significant independent nation that did not possess a central bank was [[Brazil]], which subsequently developed a precursor thereto in 1945 and the present central bank twenty years later. Having gained independence, African and Asian countries also established central banks or monetary unions.

The [[People's Bank of China]] evolved its role as a central bank starting in about 1979 with the introduction of market reforms, which accelerated in 1989 when the country adopted a generally capitalist approach to its export economy. Evolving further partly in response to the [[European Central Bank]], the People's Bank of China has by 2000 become a modern central bank. The most recent bank model, was introduced together with the [[euro]], involves coordination of the European national banks, which continue to manage their respective economies separately in all respects other than currency exchange and base interest rates.

==Activities and responsibilities==
[[File:Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building.jpg|thumb|[[United States]] [[Federal Reserve]]]]
Functions of a central bank may include:

* implementing monetary policy
* determining Interest rates
* controlling the nation's entire money supply
* the Government's banker and the bankers' bank (&quot;lender of last resort&quot;)
* managing the country's [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]] and the Government's stock register
* regulating and supervising the banking industry
* setting the official interest rate – used to manage both [[inflation]] and the country's [[exchange rate]] – and ensuring that this rate takes effect via a variety of policy mechanisms

===Monetary policy===
Central banks implement a country's chosen [[monetary policy]]. At the most basic level, this involves establishing what form of currency the country may have, whether a [[fiat currency]], [[gold standard|gold-backed currency]] (disallowed for countries with membership of the [[IMF]]), [[currency board]] or a [[currency union]]. When a country has its own national currency, this involves the issue of some form of standardized currency, which is essentially a form of [[promissory note]]: a promise to exchange the note for &quot;money&quot; under certain circumstances. Historically, this was often a promise to exchange the money for precious metals in some fixed amount. Now, when many currencies are [[fiat money]], the &quot;promise to pay&quot; consists of nothing more than a promise to pay the same sum in the same currency.

A central bank may use another country's currency either directly (in a currency union), or indirectly (a currency board). In the latter case, exemplified by [[Bulgaria]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Estonia]], the local currency is backed at a fixed rate by the central bank's holdings of a foreign currency.

In countries with fiat money, expression &quot;monetary policy&quot; may refer more narrowly to the interest-rate targets and other active measures undertaken by the monetary authority.

==Goals of monetary policy==
[[Image:Eurotower in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|The [[European Central Bank|ECB]] [[building]] in [[Frankfurt]]]]
; Price Stability: Unanticipated inflation leads to lender losses. Nominal contracts attempt to account for inflation. Effort successful if monetary policy able to maintain steady rate of inflation.

;High Employment: The movement of workers between jobs is referred to as frictional unemployment. All unemployment beyond frictional unemployment is classified as unintended unemployment. Reduction in this area is the target of macroeconomic policy.

;Economic Growth: Economic growth is enhanced by investment in technological advances in production. Encouragement of savings supplies funds that can be drawn upon for investment.

;Interest Rate Stability: Volatile interest and exchange rates generate costs to lenders and borrowers. Unexpected changes that cause damage, making policy formulation difficult.

;Financial Market Stability:

;Foreign Exchange Market Stability:

;Conflicts Among Goals: Goals frequently cannot be separated from each other and often conflict. Costs must therefore be carefully weighed before policy implementation.

===Currency issuance===
In similarity with commercial banks, central banks hold assets (foreign exchange, gold, and other financial assets) and incur liabilities (currency outstanding).

Central banks earn money generally by issuing currency notes and selling them to the public in exchange for interest-bearing assets such as government bonds. Income from the interest paid by the government on those bonds is referred to as [[seigniorage]]. The European Central Bank remits its interest income to the central banks of the member countries of the European Union.

When a central bank wishes to purchase more bonds than their respective national governments make available, they purchase assets denominated in foreign currencies.

===Naming of central banks===
There is no standard terminology for the name of a central bank, but many countries use the &quot;Bank of Country&quot; form (for example,, [[Bank of England]], [[Bank of Canada]], [[Bank of Russia]]). Some are styled &quot;national&quot; banks, such as the [[National Bank of Ukraine]]; but the term &quot;[[national bank]]&quot; is more often used by privately-owned commercial banks, especially in the [[United States]]. In other cases, central banks may incorporate the word &quot;Central&quot; (for example, [[European Central Bank]], [[Central Bank of Ireland]]). The word &quot;Reserve&quot; is also often included, such as the [[Reserve Bank of India]], [[Reserve Bank of Australia]], [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]], the [[South African Reserve Bank]], and U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]]. Many countries have state-owned banks or other quasi-government entities that have entirely separate functions, such as financing imports and exports.

In some countries, particularly in some Communist countries, the term national bank may be used to indicate both the monetary authority and the leading banking entity, such as the [[USSR]]'s [[Gosbank]] (state bank). In other countries, the term national bank may be used to indicate that the central bank's goals are broader than monetary stability, such as full employment, industrial development, or other goals.

===Interest rate interventions===
Typically a central bank controls certain types of short-term [[interest rate]]s. These influence the [[stock market|stock-]] and [[bond market]]s as well as [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] and other interest rates. The [[European Central Bank]] for example announces its interest rate at the meeting of its Governing Council; in the case of the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[Board of Governors]].

Both the Federal Reserve and the ECB are composed of one or more central bodies that are responsible for the main decisions about interest rates and the size and type of open market operations, and several branches to execute its policies. In the case of the Federal Reserve, they are the local Federal Reserve Banks; for the ECB they are the national central banks.

===Limits of enforcement power===
Contrary to popular perception, central banks are not all-powerful and have limited powers to put their policies into effect. Most importantly, although the perception by the public may be that the &quot;central bank&quot; controls some or all interest rates and currency rates, economic theory (and substantial empirical evidence) shows that it is impossible to do both at once in an open economy. [[Robert Mundell]]'s &quot;[[impossible trinity]]&quot; is the most famous formulation of these limited powers, and postulates that it is impossible to target monetary policy (broadly, interest rates), the exchange rate (through a fixed rate) and maintain free capital movement. Since most Western economies are now considered &quot;open&quot; with free capital movement, this essentially means that central banks may target interest rates or exchange rates with credibility, but not both at once.

Even when targeting interest rates, most central banks have limited ability to influence the rates actually paid by private individuals and companies. In the most famous case of policy failure, [[George Soros]] arbitraged the [[pound sterling]]'s relationship to the [[European Currency Unit|ECU]] and (after making $2 billion himself and forcing the UK to spend over $8bn defending the pound) forced it to abandon its policy. Since then he has been a harsh critic of clumsy bank policies and argued that no one should be able to do what he did.

The most complex relationships are those between the [[Renminbi|yuan]] and the [[US dollar]], and between the [[euro]] and its neighbours. The situation in [[Cuba]] is so exceptional as to require the [[Cuban peso]] to be dealt with simply as an exception, since the United States forbids direct trade with Cuba. US dollars were ubiquitous in Cuba's economy after its legalization in 1991, but were officially removed from circulation in 2004 and replaced by the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]].

==Policy instruments==
[[File:BoJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bank of Japan]]]]
The main monetary policy instruments available to central banks are [[open market operation]], bank [[reserve requirement]], [[Monetary policy#Interest rates|interest rate policy]], re-lending and re-discount (including using the [[term repurchase]] market), and [[credit policy]] (often coordinated with [[trade policy]]). While [[capital adequacy]] is important, it is defined and regulated by the [[Bank for International Settlements]], and central banks in practice generally do not apply stricter rules.

To enable open market operations, a central bank must hold [[foreign exchange reserves]] (usually in the form of [[government bond]]s) and [[official gold reserves]]. It will often have some influence over any official or mandated [[exchange rate]]s: Some exchange rates are managed, some are market based (free float) and many are somewhere in between (&quot;managed float&quot; or &quot;dirty float&quot;).

===Interest rates===
By far the most visible and obvious power of many modern central banks is to influence market interest rates; contrary to popular belief, they rarely &quot;set&quot; rates to a fixed number. Although the mechanism differs from country to country, most use a similar mechanism based on a central bank's ability to create as much [[fiat money]] as required.

The mechanism to move the market towards a 'target rate' (whichever specific rate is used) is generally to lend money or borrow money in theoretically unlimited quantities, until the targeted market rate is sufficiently close to the target. Central banks may do so by lending money to and borrowing money from (taking deposits from) a limited number of qualified banks, or by purchasing and selling bonds. As an example of how this functions, the [[Bank of Canada]] sets a target [[overnight rate]], and a band of plus or minus 0.25%. Qualified banks borrow from each other within this band, but never above or below, because the central bank will always lend to them at the top of the band, and take deposits at the bottom of the band; in principle, the capacity to borrow and lend at the extremes of the band are unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/backgrounders/bg-p9.html Bank of Canada backgrounder: Target for the Overnight Rate]&lt;/ref&gt; Other central banks use similar mechanisms.

It is also notable that the target rates are generally short-term rates. The actual rate that borrowers and lenders receive on the market will depend on (perceived) credit risk, maturity and other factors. For example, a central bank might set a target rate for overnight lending of 4.5%, but rates for (equivalent risk) five-year bonds might be 5%, 4.75%, or, in cases of [[inverted yield curve]]s, even below the short-term rate. Many central banks have one primary &quot;headline&quot; rate that is quoted as the &quot;central bank rate.&quot; In practice, they will have other tools and rates that are used, but only one that is rigorously targeted and enforced.

&quot;The rate at which the central bank lends money can indeed be chosen at will by the central bank; this is the rate that makes the financial headlines.&quot; – Henry C.K. Liu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/GI29Dj01.html Asia Times article explaining modern central bank function in detail]&lt;/ref&gt; Liu explains further that &quot;the U.S. central-bank lending rate is known as the [[Federal funds rate|Fed funds rate]]. The Fed sets a target for the Fed funds rate, which its [[Federal Open Market Committee|Open Market Committee]] tries to match by lending or borrowing in the [[money market]] ... a fiat money system set by command of the central bank. The Fed is the head of the central-bank because the U.S. dollar is the key reserve currency for international trade. The global money market is a USA dollar market. All other currencies markets revolve around the U.S. dollar market.&quot; Accordingly the U.S. situation is not typical of central banks in general.

A typical central bank has several interest rates or monetary policy tools it can set to influence markets.

* [[discount window|Marginal lending rate]] (currently 1.75% in the Eurozone) – a fixed rate for institutions to borrow money from the central bank. (In the USA this is called the [[discount rate]]).
* [[Main refinancing rate]] (1.00% in the Eurozone) – the publicly visible interest rate the central bank announces. It is also known as ''[[minimum bid rate]]'' and serves as a bidding floor for refinancing loans. (In the USA this is called the [[federal funds rate]]).
* [[Deposit rate]] (0.25% in the Eurozone) – the rate parties receive for deposits at the central bank.

These rates directly affect the rates in the money market, the market for short term loans.

===Open market operations===
Through [[open market operation]]s, a central bank influences the money supply in an economy directly. Each time it buys [[security (finance)|securities]], exchanging money for the security, it raises the money supply. Conversely, selling of securities lowers the money supply. Buying of securities thus amounts to printing new money while lowering supply of the specific security.

The main open market operations are:

* Temporary lending of money for [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] securities (&quot;Reverse Operations&quot; or &quot;[[repurchase agreement|repurchase operations]]&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;repo&quot; market). These operations are carried out on a regular basis, where fixed [[maturity (finance)|maturity]] loans (of 1 week and 1 month for the ECB) are auctioned off.
* Buying or selling securities (&quot;[[direct operations]]&quot;) on ad-hoc basis.
* [[Foreign exchange market|Foreign exchange]] operations such as [[forex swap]]s.

All of these interventions can also influence the [[foreign exchange market]] and thus the exchange rate. For example the [[People's Bank of China]] and the [[Bank of Japan]] have on occasion bought several hundred billions of [[Treasury security|U.S. Treasuries]], presumably in order to stop the decline of the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] versus the [[renminbi]] and the [[yen]].

===Capital requirements===
All banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their assets as capital, a rate which may be established by the central bank or the banking supervisor. For international banks, including the 55 member central banks of the [[Bank for International Settlements]], the threshold is 8% (see the [[Basel Capital Accords]]) of risk-adjusted assets, whereby certain assets (such as government bonds) are considered to have lower risk and are either partially or fully excluded from total assets for the purposes of calculating [[capital adequacy]]. Partly due to concerns about [[asset inflation]] and [[repurchase agreements]], capital requirements may be considered more effective than deposit/reserve requirements in preventing indefinite lending: when at the threshold, a bank cannot extend another loan without acquiring further capital on its balance sheet.

===Reserve requirements===
In practice, many banks are required to hold a percentage of their deposits as [[Bank reserves|reserves]]. Such legal [[reserve requirement]]s were introduced in the 19th century to reduce the risk of banks overextending themselves and suffering from [[bank run]]s, as this could lead to knock-on effects on other banks. ''See also [[money multiplier]].'' As the early 20th century [[gold standard]] and late 20th century [[dollar hegemony]] evolved, and as banks proliferated and engaged in more complex transactions and were able to profit from dealings globally on a moment's notice, these practices became mandatory, if only to ensure that there was some limit on the ballooning of money supply. Such limits have become harder to enforce. The [[People's Bank of China]] retains (and uses) more powers over reserves because the [[Renminbi|yuan]] that it manages is a non-[[convertible currency]].

Even if reserves were not a legal requirement, prudence would ensure that banks would hold a certain percentage of their assets in the form of cash reserves. It is common to think of commercial banks as passive receivers of deposits from their customers and, for many purposes, this is still an accurate view.

This passive view of bank activity is misleading when it comes to considering what determines the nation's money supply and credit. Loan activity by banks plays a fundamental role in determining the money supply. The central-bank money after aggregate settlement – '''final money''' – can take only one of two forms:
*physical cash, which is rarely used in wholesale financial markets,
*central-bank money.
The currency component of the money supply is far smaller than the deposit component. Currency and bank reserves together make up the monetary base, called [[Money supply|M1 and M2]].

===Exchange requirements===
To influence the money supply, some central banks may require that some or all foreign exchange receipts (generally from exports) be exchanged for the local currency. The rate that is used to purchase local currency may be market-based or arbitrarily set by the bank. This tool is generally used in countries with non-convertible currencies or partially-convertible currencies. The recipient of the local currency may be allowed to freely dispose of the funds, required to hold the funds with the central bank for some period of time, or allowed to use the funds subject to certain restrictions. In other cases, the ability to hold or use the foreign exchange may be otherwise limited.

In this method, money supply is increased by the central bank when it purchases the foreign currency by issuing (selling) the local currency. The central bank may subsequently reduce the money supply by various means, including selling bonds or foreign exchange interventions.

===Margin requirements and other tools===
In some countries, central banks may have other tools that work indirectly to limit lending practices and otherwise restrict or regulate capital markets. For example, a central bank may regulate [[margin lending]], whereby individuals or companies may borrow against pledged securities. The margin requirement establishes a minimum ratio of the value of the securities to the amount borrowed.

Central banks often have requirements for the quality of assets that may be held by financial institutions; these requirements may act as a limit on the amount of risk and leverage created by the financial system. These requirements may be direct, such as requiring certain assets to bear certain minimum [[credit rating]]s, or indirect, by the central bank lending to counterparties only when security of a certain quality is pledged as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].

====Examples of use====
The [[People's Bank of China]] has been forced into particularly aggressive and differentiating tactics by the extreme complexity and rapid expansion of the economy it manages. It imposed some absolute restrictions on lending to specific industries in 2003, and continues to require between 1% and 3% more reserves&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBGNAME63I20101111 Reuters – China hit some banks with extra RRR increase]&lt;/ref&gt; from large urban banks (typically focusing on export) than rural ones. This is not by any means an unusual situation. The USA historically had very wide ranges of reserve requirements between its dozen branches. Domestic development is thought to be optimized mostly by reserve requirements rather than by capital adequacy methods, since they can be more finely tuned and regionally varied.

==Banking supervision and other activities==
{{Finance sidebar}}

In some countries a central bank through its subsidiaries controls and monitors the banking sector. In other countries banking supervision is carried out by a government department such as the UK Treasury, or an independent government agency (for example, UK's [[Financial Services Authority]]). It examines the banks' [[balance sheet]]s and behaviour and policies toward [[consumers]]. Apart from refinancing, it also provides banks with services such as transfer of funds, [[bank notes]] and [[coin]]s or foreign currency. Thus it is often described as the &quot;bank of banks&quot;.

Many countries such as the United States will monitor and control the banking sector through different agencies and for different purposes, although there is usually significant cooperation between the agencies. For example, [[money center bank]]s, [[deposit-taking institution]]s, and other types of financial institutions may be subject to different (and occasionally overlapping) regulation. Some types of banking regulation may be delegated to other levels of government, such as state or provincial governments.

Any cartel of banks is particularly closely watched and controlled. Most countries control bank mergers and are wary of concentration in this industry due to the danger of groupthink and runaway lending bubbles based on a [[single point of failure]], the [[credit culture]] of the few large banks.

==Independence==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2009}}
{{unbalanced|section|date=February 2009}}
Over the past decade, there has been a trend towards increasing the independence of central banks as a way of improving long-term economic performance. However, while a large volume of economic research has been done to define the relationship between central bank independence and economic performance, the results are ambiguous.

Advocates of central bank independence argue that a central bank which is too susceptible to political direction or pressure may encourage economic cycles (&quot;[[boom and bust]]&quot;), as politicians may be tempted to boost economic activity in advance of an election, to the detriment of the long-term health of the economy and the country. In this context, independence is usually defined as the central bank's operational and management independence from the government.

The literature on central bank independence has defined a number of types of independence.

;Legal independence: The independence of the central bank is enshrined in law. This type of independence is limited in a democratic state; in almost all cases the central bank is accountable at some level to government officials, either through a government minister or directly to a legislature. Even defining degrees of legal independence has proven to be a challenge since legislation typically provides only a framework within which the government and the central bank work out their relationship.

;Goal independence: The central bank has the right to set its own policy goals, whether inflation targeting, control of the money supply, or maintaining a fixed exchange rate. While this type of independence is more common, many central banks prefer to announce their policy goals in partnership with the appropriate government departments. This increases the transparency of the policy setting process and thereby increases the credibility of the goals chosen by providing assurance that they will not be changed without notice. In addition, the setting of common goals by the central bank and the government helps to avoid situations where monetary and fiscal policy are in conflict; a policy combination that is clearly sub-optimal.

;Operational independence: The central bank has the independence to determine the best way of achieving its policy goals, including the types of instruments used and the timing of their use. This is the most common form of central bank independence. The granting of independence to the Bank of England in 1997 was, in fact, the granting of operational independence; the inflation target continued to be announced in the Chancellor's annual budget speech to Parliament.

;Management independence: The central bank has the authority to run its own operations (appointing staff, setting budgets, and so on.) without excessive involvement of the government. The other forms of independence are not possible unless the central bank has a significant degree of management independence. One of the most common statistical indicators used in the literature as a proxy for central bank independence is the &quot;turn-over-rate&quot; of central bank governors. If a government is in the habit of appointing and replacing the governor frequently, it clearly has the capacity to micro-manage the central bank through its choice of governors.

It is argued that an independent central bank can run a more credible monetary policy, making market expectations more responsive to signals from the central bank. Recently, both the Bank of England (1997) and the European Central Bank have been made independent and follow a set of published [[inflation targeting|inflation targets]] so that markets know what to expect. Even the [[People's Bank of China]] has been accorded great latitude due to the difficulty of problems it faces, though in the [[People's Republic of China]] the official role of the bank remains that of a [[national bank]] rather than a central bank, underlined by the official refusal to &quot;unpeg&quot; the yuan or to revalue it &quot;under pressure&quot;. The People's Bank of China's independence can thus be read more as independence from the USA which rules the financial markets, than from the [[Communist Party of China]] which rules the country. The fact that the Communist Party is not elected also relieves the pressure to please people, increasing its independence.

Governments generally have some degree of influence over even &quot;independent&quot; central banks; the aim of independence is primarily to prevent short-term interference. For example, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is appointed by the [[President of the U.S.]] (all nominees for this post are recommended by the owners of the Federal Reserve, as are all the board members), and his choice must be confirmed by the [[Congress of the United States|Congress]].

International organizations such as the [[World Bank]], the [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]] and the [[IMF]] are strong supporters of central bank independence. This results, in part, from a belief in the intrinsic merits of increased independence. The support for independence from the [[international organizations]] also derives partly from the connection between increased independence for the central bank and increased transparency in the policy-making process. The IMF's [[Financial Services Action Plan|FSAP]] review self-assessment, for example, includes a number of questions about central bank independence in the transparency section. An independent central bank will score higher in the review than one that is not independent.

==Criticism==
According to the [[Austrian School]], central banking tends to wreak havoc on an economy by systematically devaluing a currency by over creating this currency against nothing of intrinsic value (such as gold), resulting in never-ending inflation. The main opponents to [[fractional reserve]] central banking are the proponents of the [[Austrian business cycle theory]], including [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Murray Rothbard]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/story/1905 How the Business Cycle Happens], Murray Rothbard&lt;/ref&gt; though this economic theory is not generally accepted by mainstream economists. F. A. Hayek shared a [[Nobel Prize in economics]] (with [[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm school]] economist, [[Gunnar Myrdal]]) in 1974 based on &quot;their pioneering work in the theory of money&quot; among other contributions.

==== Alternatives ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
[[Demurrage_(currency)#Theory|Demurrage currencies]] provide an alternative and perhaps complementary means towards central banking's goal of sustaining economic growth with different specific characteristics and a mechanism that follows naturally from the use of commodity currencies, is more uniform in operation, does not devalue the currency unit, and is more predictable and potentially more decentralized in its operation. Historically, the idea of demurrage influenced [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes']] prescription for net-inflationary central bank policy.

{{Infobox chlorine}}
'''Chlorine''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|l|ɔər|iː|n}} {{Respell|KLOHR|een}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word 'χλωρóς' (''khlôros'', meaning 'pale green')) is the [[chemical element]] with [[atomic number]] 17 and symbol '''Cl'''. It is a [[halogen]], found in the [[periodic table]] in [[group 17]]. As the [[chloride]] ion, which is part of [[common salt]] and other compounds, it is [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant in nature]] and necessary to most forms of life, including [[human]]s. In its elemental form (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or &quot;dichlorine&quot;) under [[standard conditions]], chlorine is a powerful [[oxidizing agent|oxidant]] and is used in [[Bleach (chemical)|bleaching]] and disinfectants, as well as an essential reagent in the chemical industry. As a common disinfectant, chlorine compounds are used in [[swimming pool]]s to keep them clean and [[swimming pool sanitation|sanitary]]. In the [[upper atmosphere]], chlorine-containing molecules such as [[chlorofluorocarbons]] have been implicated in [[ozone depletion]].

==Characteristics==
===Physical characteristics===
[[File:Liquid chlorine.jpg|thumb|Chlorine, liquified under a pressure of 8 bar at room temperature. The liquid column size is ca. 0.3×3 cm.]]
At [[standard temperature and pressure]], two chlorine atoms form the [[diatomic molecule]] Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/chemicals/cn/Chlorine.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is a yellow-green gas that has its distinctive strong smell, the smell of bleach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/chlorine/basics/facts.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The bonding between the two atoms is relatively weak (only 242.580 ±0.004&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol), which makes the Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule highly reactive. The boiling point at regular atmosphere is around −34 ˚C, but it can be liquefied at room temperature with pressures above 8 atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nist.gov/pml/process/fluid/srd_134_chlorine.cfm Chlorine properties], NIST&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical characteristics===
Along with [[fluorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and [[astatine]], chlorine is a member of the [[halogen]] series that forms the group 17 (formerly VII, VIIA, or VIIB) of the periodic table. Chlorine forms compounds with almost all of the elements to give compounds that are usually called chlorides. Chlorine gas reacts with most organic compounds, and will even sluggishly support the combustion of [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

====Hydrolysis====
At 25&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] and atmospheric pressure, one [[litre|liter]] of [[water]] dissolves 3.26 g or 1.02&amp;nbsp;L of gaseous chlorine.{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=409}} Solutions of chlorine in water contain chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrochloric acid, and hypochlorous acid:
:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} HCl + HClO
This conversion to the right is called [[disproportionation]], because the ingredient chlorine both increases and decreases in formal oxidation state. The solubility of chlorine in water is increased if the water contains dissolved alkali hydroxide, and in this way, [[chlorine bleach]] is produced.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|pp=857–858}}
:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; → ClO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Chlorine gas only exists in a neutral or acidic solution.

====Compounds====
{{See also|Category:Chlorine compounds}}
Chlorine exists in all odd numbered [[oxidation states]] from −1 to +7, as well as the elemental state of zero and four in chlorine dioxide (see table below, and also structures in [[chlorite]]).{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=806}} Progressing through the states, hydrochloric acid can be oxidized using manganese dioxide, or [[hydrogen chloride]] gas oxidized catalytically by air to form elemental chlorine gas.{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=408}}

=====Chlorine oxides=====
Chlorine forms a variety of oxides, as seen above: [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[dichlorine monoxide]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[dichlorine hexoxide]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[dichlorine heptoxide]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;). The anionic derivatives of these same oxides are also well known including [[chlorate]] ({{chem|ClO|3|-}}), [[chlorite]] ({{chem|ClO|2|-}}), [[hypochlorite]] (ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[perchlorate]] ({{chem|ClO|4|-}}). The acid derivatives of these anions are [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), [[chloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The chloroxy cation [[chloryl]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is known and has the same structure as [[chlorite]] but with a positive charge and chlorine in the +5 oxidation state.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|pp=844–850}} The compound &quot;chlorine trioxide&quot;, rather than being the expected +6 oxidation state, is instead a mixture of +5 and +7 states, occurring as the ionic compound chloryl perchlorate, {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+|[ClO|4|]|-}} commonly called [[dichlorine hexoxide]].{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=849}}

In hot concentrated alkali solution [[hypochlorite]] disproportionates:
:2 ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{chem|ClO|2|-}}
:ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{chem|ClO|2|-}} → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{chem|ClO|3|-}}
[[Sodium chlorate]] and [[potassium chlorate]] can be crystallized from solutions formed by the above reactions. If their crystals are heated, they undergo a further, final disproportionation:
:4 {{chem|ClO|3|-}} → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 {{chem|ClO|4|-}}

This same progression from chloride to perchlorate can be accomplished by electrolysis. The anode reaction progression is:&lt;ref name=&quot;c_w&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Cotton, F.

Each step is accompanied at the cathode by
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (−0.83 volts)

=====Interhalogen compounds=====
Chlorine oxidizes bromide and iodide salts to bromine and iodine, respectively. However, it cannot oxidize fluoride salts to fluorine. It makes a variety of interhalogen compounds such as the chlorine fluorides, [[chlorine monofluoride]] (ClF), [[chlorine trifluoride]] (ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chlorine pentafluoride]] (ClF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). Chlorides of bromine and iodine are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=fEKbJrqKovUC&amp;pg=PA133|pages = 133–143|title = Advances in inorganic chemistry and radiochemistry|isbn = 9780120236039|author1 = Emeléus, H. J|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Organochlorine compounds=====
{{main|Organochloride}}
Chlorine is used extensively in [[organic chemistry|organic]] in [[substitution (chemistry)|substitution]] and addition reactions. Chlorine often imparts many desired properties to an [[organic compound]], in part due to its electronegativity. Organochlorine compounds are also serious pollutants, either as side products of industrial processes or as persistent pesticides.

Many important industrial products are produced via organochlorine intermediates. Examples include [[polycarbonate]]s, [[polyurethane]]s, [[silicone]]s, [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], [[carboxymethyl cellulose]], and [[propylene oxide]]. Like the other halogens, chlorine participates in [[free-radical substitution reaction]]s with hydrogen-containing organic compounds. When applied to organic substrates, reaction is often—but not invariably—non-regioselective, and, hence, may result in a mixture of isomeric products. It is often difficult to control the degree of substitution as well, so multiple substitutions are common. If the different reaction products are easily separated, e.g., by distillation, substitutive free-radical chlorination (in some cases accompanied by concurrent thermal dehydrochlorination) may be a useful synthetic route. Industrial examples of this are the production of [[methyl chloride]], [[methylene chloride]], [[chloroform]], and [[carbon tetrachloride]] from methane, [[allyl chloride]] from propylene, and [[trichloroethylene]], and [[tetrachloroethylene]] from [[ethylene dichloride|1,2-dichloroethane]].

Like the other halides, chlorine undergoes electrophilic additions reactions, the most notable one being the chlorination of alkenes and aromatic compounds with a Lewis acid catalyst. Organic chlorine compounds tend to be less reactive in nucleophilic substitution reactions than the corresponding bromine or iodine derivatives, but they tend to be cheaper. They may be activated for reaction by substituting with a tosylate group, or by the use of a catalytic amount of [[sodium iodide]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=====Chlorides=====
{{main|Chloride}}
Chlorine combines with almost all elements to give chlorides. Compounds with [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[xenon]], and [[krypton]] are known, but do not form by direct reaction of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs, 9th ed.|publisher=Merck &amp; Co.|location = Rahway, N.J.|year=1976|isbn=0911910263|editor=Windholz, Martha ''et al.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloride is one of the most common anions in nature. [[Hydrogen chloride]] and its aqueous solution, [[hydrochloric acid]], are produced on megaton scale annually both as valued intermediates but sometimes as undesirable pollutants.

===Occurrence===
{{See also|Category:Halide minerals}}
In nature, chlorine is found primarily as the [[chloride ion]], a component of the salt that is deposited in the earth or dissolved in the [[ocean]]s — about 1.9% of the mass of seawater is chloride ions. Even higher concentrations of chloride are found in the [[Dead Sea]] and in underground [[brine]] deposits. Most chloride salts are soluble in water, thus, chloride-containing minerals are usually only found in abundance in dry climates or deep underground. In the Earth's crust, chlorine is present at average concentrations of about 126 parts per million,{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=795}} predominantly in such minerals as ''[[halite]]'' ([[sodium chloride]]), ''[[sylvite]]'' ([[potassium chloride]]), and ''[[carnallite]]'' (potassium magnesium chloride hexahydrate). Over 2000 naturally occurring organic chlorine compounds are known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro Chlor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/upload/documents/document236.pdf|title=Risk assessment and the cycling of natural organochlorines|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interstellar medium, chlorine is produced in [[supernova]]e via the [[r-process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cameron, A.G.W. |title=Stellar Evolution, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Nucleogenesis| journal=CRL-41|month=June| year=1957|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/CRL-41.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of chlorine}}
Chlorine has a wide range of [[Isotopes of chlorine|isotopes]]. The two stable [[isotope]]s are &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl (75.77%) and &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl (24.23%).&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they give chlorine an [[atomic weight]] of 35.4527&amp;nbsp;g/mol. The [[half-integer]] value for chlorine's weight caused some confusion in the early days of chemistry, when it had been postulated that atoms were composed of even units of hydrogen (see [[Proust's law]]), and the existence of chemical [[isotope]]s was unsuspected.

Trace amounts of [[radioactive]] [[Chlorine-36|&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl]] exist in the environment, in a ratio of about 7x10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; to 1 with stable isotopes. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is produced in the atmosphere by [[spallation]] of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;[[argon|Ar]] by interactions with [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s. In the subsurface environment, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is generated primarily as a result of [[neutron capture]] by &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl or [[muon capture]] by &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;[[calcium|Ca]]. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl decays to &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;[[sulfur|S]] and to &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;[[argon|Ar]], with a combined [[half-life]] of 308,000 years. The half-life of this [[hydrophilic]] nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for [[geologic dating]] in the range of 60,000 to 1&amp;nbsp;million years. Additionally, large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl were produced by irradiation of [[seawater]] during atmospheric detonations of [[nuclear weapon]]s between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in [[soil]] and [[ground water]], &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/weller/|title = The earliest salt production in the world: an early Neolithic exploitation in Poiana Slatinei-Lunca, Romania |accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Belgian chemist and physician [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=790}}

Elemental chlorine was first prepared and studied in 1774 by Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], and, therefore, he is credited for its discovery.&lt;ref name=krogt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Cl |title=17 Chlorine |publisher=Elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called it &quot;''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air''&quot; since it is a gas (then called &quot;airs&quot;) and it came from [[hydrochloric acid]] (then known as &quot;muriatic acid&quot;).&lt;ref name=krogt/&gt; However, he failed to establish chlorine as an element, mistakenly thinking that it was the [[oxide]] obtained from the hydrochloric acid (see [[phlogiston theory]]).
&lt;ref name=krogt/&gt; He named the new element within this oxide as ''muriaticum''.&lt;ref name=krogt/&gt; Regardless of what he thought, Scheele did isolate chlorine by reacting [[Manganese dioxide|MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (as the mineral [[pyrolusite]]) with HCl:{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=790}}

:4 HCl + MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Scheele observed several of the properties of chlorine: the bleaching effect on [[Litmus test (chemistry)|litmus]], the deadly effect on insects, the yellow green color, and the smell similar to [[aqua regia]].{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}}

At the time, common chemical theory was: any acid is a compound that contains oxygen (still sounding in the German and Dutch names of [[oxygen]]: ''sauerstoff'' or ''zuurstof'', both translating into English as ''acid stuff''), so a number of chemists, including [[Claude Berthollet]], suggested that Scheele's ''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air'' must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, ''muriaticum''.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=792}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA158|page=158|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Ihde, Aaron John|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1984|isbn=0486642356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1915|title = The discovery of the elements.

In 1809, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis-Jacques Thénard]] tried to decompose ''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air'' by reacting it with charcoal to release the free element ''muriaticum'' (and carbon dioxide).&lt;ref name=&quot;krogt&quot;/&gt; They did not succeed and published a report in which they considered the possibility that ''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air'' is an element, but were not convinced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = On the nature and the properties of muriatic acid and of oxygenated muriatic acid|journal = Mémoires de Physique et de Chimie de la Société d'Arcueil|volume = 2|pages = 339–358|year = 1809|url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/thenard.html|text = &quot;In fact, oxygenated muriatic acid is not decomposed by charcoal, and it might be supposed, from this fact and those that are communicated in this Memoir, that this gas is a simple body.

In 1810, [[Sir Humphry Davy]] tried the same experiment again, and concluded that it is an element, and not a compound.&lt;ref name=krogt/&gt; He named this new element as chlorine, from the Greek word χλωρος (''chlōros''), meaning green-yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sir Humphry Davy |title = On a Combination of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygene Gas|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume = 101|pages = 155–162|year = 1811|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1811.0008|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Davy-Chlorine-1811.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name halogen, meaning salt producer, was originally defined for chlorine (in 1811 by [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]]), and it was later applied to the rest of the elements in this family.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=789}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=J.

==Production==
{{Main|Chlorine production}}
In industry, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} Along with chlorine, this [[chloralkali process]] yields [[hydrogen]] gas and [[sodium hydroxide]], according to the following [[chemical equation]]:{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=408}}

:2 NaCl + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH
The electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations:

:Cathode: 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)
:Anode: 2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) → Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Overall process: 2 NaCl (or KCl) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH (or KOH)
In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an [[asbestos]] (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an [[anode]], preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro Chlor3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/animations/diaphragm-cell.asp|title=Diaphragm cell|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the [[Causticity|caustic]] [[alkali]] is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali but they are not burdened with the problem of preventing mercury discharge into the environment and they more energy efficient. Membrane cell electrolysis employ [[Semipermeable membrane|permeable membrane]] as an [[ion exchange]]r. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment, leaving at a lower [[concentration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro Chlor4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/animations/membrane-cell.asp|title=Membrane cell|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is more efficient than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide at about 32% concentration, but requires very pure brine.

===Laboratory methods===
Small amounts of chlorine gas can be made in the laboratory by combining hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide. Alternatively a strong acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid reacts with [[sodium hypochlorite]] or [[sodium chlorate]] solution to release chlorine gas. In the home, accidents occur when hypochlorite bleach solutions are combined with certain acidic drain-cleaners.

==Applications==
===Production of industrial and consumer products===
Principal applications of chlorine are in the production of a wide range of industrial and consumer products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro Chlor5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/uses|title=Uses|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chlorine Tree&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chlorinetree.org|title=Chlorine Tree|publisher=Chlorine Tree|accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is used in making plastics, solvents for dry cleaning and metal degreasing, textiles, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, insecticides, dyestuffs, household cleaning products, etc. Quantitavely, about 63% and 18% of all chlorine are used in the manufacture of organic and inorganic chlorine compounds, respectively,{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} and about 15,000 chlorine compounds are being used commercially.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}} The remaining 19% is used for bleaches and dissifection products.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are [[1,2-dichloroethane]] and [[vinyl chloride]], intermediates in the production of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Other particularly important organochlorines are [[methyl chloride]], [[methylene chloride]], [[chloroform]], [[vinylidene chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[perchloroethylene]], [[allyl chloride]], [[epichlorohydrin]], [[chlorobenzene]], dichlorobenzenes, and [[trichlorobenzene]]s. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, HOCl, NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, BiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SOCI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CIF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ICl, ICl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, MoCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}}{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=412}}

===Purification and disinfection===
{{Main|Chlorination}}
Chlorine is an important chemical for [[water purification]] (such as water treatment plants), in [[disinfectant]]s, and in [[bleach]]. Chlorine in water is more than three times as effective as a disinfectant against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' than an equivalent concentration of [[bromine]], and is more than six times more effective than an equivalent concentration of [[iodine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koski TA, Stuart LS, Ortenzio LF|title=Comparison of chlorine, bromine, iodine as disinfectants for swimming pool water|journal = Applied Microbiology|volume = 14|issue = 2|year = 1966|pages = 276–279|pmid=4959984|pmc=546668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorine is usually used (in the form of [[hypochlorous acid]]) to kill [[bacteria]] and other microbes in [[drinking water]] supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather [[sodium hypochlorite]], formed from chlorine and [[sodium hydroxide]], or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = Hammond, C. R.|title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition| publisher =CRC press| year = 2000| isbn = 0849304814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often impractical to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment, so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used. These include [[hypochlorite]] solutions, which gradually release chlorine into the water, and compounds like [[sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione]] (dihydrate or anhydrous), sometimes referred to as &quot;dichlor&quot;, and [[trichloro-s-triazinetrione]], sometimes referred to as &quot;trichlor&quot;. These compounds are stable while solid and may be used in powdered, granular, or tablet form. When added in small amounts to pool water or industrial water systems, the chlorine atoms hydrolyze from the rest of the molecule forming hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which acts as a general biocide, killing germs, micro-organisms, algae, and so on.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=860}}{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=411}}

===Use as a weapon===
====World War I====
{{Main|Poison gas in World War I}}

Chlorine gas, also known as '''bertholite''', was first [[chemical warfare|used as a weapon]] in [[World War I]] by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. As described by the soldiers it had a distinctive smell of a mixture between pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest. Chlorine can react with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form [[hydrochloric acid]], an irritant that can be lethal. The damage done by chlorine gas can be prevented by a gas mask, or other filtration method, which makes the overall chance of death by chlorine gas much lower than those of other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, [[Fritz Haber]] of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate [[IG Farben]], who developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an [[trench|entrenched]] enemy. It is alleged that Haber's role in the use of chlorine as a deadly weapon drove his wife, [[Clara Immerwahr]], to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC&amp;pg=PA226|page=226|title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production|isbn=9780262693134|author1=Smil, Vaclav|date=2004-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Several books I (stone) looked into only claimed that this is a possibility while the Immerwahr article says there is source for the motive of here suicide--&gt; After its first use, chlorine was utilized by both sides as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly [[phosgene]] and [[mustard gas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First World War&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm|title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas|publisher=First World War.com|accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq War====
{{Main|2007 chlorine bombings in Iraq}}
[[File:Chlorine attack1.jpg|thumb|right|Chlorine &quot;attack&quot; on an acetal resin plumbing joint.]]
Chlorine gas has also been used by insurgents against the local population and coalition forces in the [[Iraq War]] in the form of [[chlorine bomb]]s. On March 17, 2007, for example, three chlorine filled trucks were detonated in the Anbar province killing two and sickening over 350.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnchlorine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.main/index.html|last=Mahdi|first=Basim|publisher=CNN|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2007-03-17|title= Iraq gas attack makes hundreds ill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other chlorine bomb attacks resulted in higher death tolls, with more than 30 deaths on two separate occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chlorine bomb BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6660585.stm|publisher = BBC News|date=2007-05-17|accessdate = 2007-05-17|title = 'Chlorine bomb' hits Iraq village}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the deaths were caused by the force of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine, since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. The Iraqi authorities have tightened up security for chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water for the population.

===Chlorine cracking===
The element is widely used for purifying water owing to its powerful oxidizing properties, especially potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred owing to [[stress corrosion cracking]] of [[stainless steel]] rods used to suspend them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cEmq232h1zcC&amp;pg=PA148|page=148|title=Corrosion of steel in concrete: prevention, diagnosis, repair|author=Bertolini, Luca; Elsener, Bernhard; Pedeferri, Pietro; Polder, Rob B.|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2004|isbn=3527308008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[polymer]]s are also sensitive to attack, including [[acetal resin]] and [[polybutene]]. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic supplies, and [[stress corrosion cracking]] caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. One example shows an acetal joint in a water supply system, which, when it fractured, caused substantial physical damage to computers in the labs below the supply. The cracks started at [[injection molding]] defects in the joint and grew slowly until finally triggered. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis, P.R. |title=Polymer Product Failure|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SFm8rKotSaUC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=1 January 2000|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|isbn=9781859571927|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;msds-cl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westlake.com/datasheets/MSDS_Chlorine.pdf |title=Chlorine MSDS|date=October 23, 1997 (Revised November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations of as low as 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60&amp;nbsp;ppm. About 1000&amp;nbsp;ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}} Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system, and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes.&lt;ref name=tox&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Environmental Research|volume = 85|issue = 2|year = 2001 |doi = 10.1006/enrs.2000.4110 |title = The Toxicology of Chlorine|author = Winder, Chris|pages = 105–114|pmid = 11161660}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations above 30&amp;nbsp;ppm, it begins to react with water and cells, which change it into hydrochloric acid (HCl) and [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO).

When used at specified levels for water disinfection, the reaction of chlorine with water is not a major concern for human health. However, other materials present in the water may generate disinfection by-products that can damage human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/news/stories/news4724.html|title=What's in your Water?: Disinfectants Create Toxic By-products|date=2009-03-31|work=ACES News|publisher=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences – University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=SD|last2=Plewa|first2=MJ|last3=Wagner|first3=ED|last4=Schoeny|first4=R|last5=Demarini|first5=DM|title=Occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of regulated and emerging disinfection by-products in drinking water: a review and roadmap for research|journal=Mutation research|volume=636|issue=1–3|pages=178–242|year=2007|pmid=17980649|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2007.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calcium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|l|s|i|əm}} {{respell|KAL|see-əm}}) is the [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Ca''' and [[atomic number]] 20. It has an atomic mass of 40.078 amu. Calcium is a soft gray [[alkaline earth metal]], and is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fifth most abundant element by mass]] in the [[Earth]]'s [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. Calcium is also the fifth most abundant dissolved ion in [[seawater]] by both molarity and mass, after [[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[magnesium]], and [[sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of method for the analysis of the various parameters of the carbon dioxide system in sea water, version 2|author= Dickson, A. G. and Goyet, C. |publisher =ORNL/CDIAC-74|year=1994|url=http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ftp/cdiac74/chapter5.pdf| chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium is essential for living [[organism]]s, particularly in [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[physiology]], where movement of the calcium ion Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into and out of the [[cytoplasm]] functions as a signal for many cellular processes. As a major material used in mineralization of bones and shells, calcium is the most abundant [[metal]] by mass in many [[animal]]s.

==Notable characteristics==
[[File:FlammenfärbungCa.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Flame test]]. Brick red color originates from calcium.]]
Chemically calcium is reactive and soft for a metal (though harder than lead, it can be cut with a knife with difficulty). It is a silvery metallic element that must be extracted by [[electrolysis]] from a fused salt like [[calcium chloride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pauling&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Pauling, Linus|title= General Chemistry|page= 627|year= 1970|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0716701499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once produced, it rapidly forms a gray-white [[oxide]] and [[nitride]] coating when exposed to air. In bulk-form (typically as chips or &quot;turnings&quot;) the metal is somewhat difficult to ignite, more so even than magnesium chips; but when lit, the metal burns in air with a brilliant high-intensity red light. Calcium metal reacts with [[water]], evolving hydrogen gas at a rate rapid enough to be noticeable, but not fast enough at room temperature to generate much heat. In powdered form, however, the reaction with water is extremely rapid, as the increased surface area of the powder accelerates the reaction with the water. Part of the slowness of the calcium-water reaction results from the metal being partly protected by insoluble white [[calcium hydroxide]]. In water solutions of acids, where this salt is soluble, calcium reacts vigorously.

Calcium, with a density of 1.55 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, is the lightest of the alkaline earth metals; magnesium ([[specific gravity]] 1.74) and beryllium (1.84) are more dense, although lighter in atomic mass. From strontium onward, the alkali earth metals become more dense with increasing atomic mass.

It has two [[Allotropy|allotropes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{doi|10.1007/BF02873196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium has a higher electrical resistivity than [[copper]] or [[aluminium]], yet weight-for-weight, due to its much lower density, it is a rather better conductor than either. However, its use in terrestrial applications is usually limited by its high reactivity with air.

Calcium salts are colorless from any contribution of the calcium, and ionic solutions of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) are colorless as well. Many calcium salts are not soluble in water. When in solution, the calcium ion to the human taste varies remarkably, being reported as mildly salty, sour, &quot;mineral like&quot; or even &quot;soothing.&quot; It is apparent that many animals can taste, or develop a taste, for calcium, and use this sense to detect the mineral in [[salt lick]]s or other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/81/4/1567 |title=Calcium: Taste, Intake, and Appetite|author=Tordoff, M. G.|volume= 81|issue=4 |page=1567|journal=Physiological Reviews|pmid=11581497|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In human nutrition, soluble calcium salts may be added to tart juices without much effect to the average palate.

Calcium is the fifth most abundant element by mass in the human body, where it is a common cellular ionic messenger with many functions, and serves also as a structural element in bone. It is the relatively high atomic-numbered calcium in the skeleton which causes bone to be radio-opaque. Of the human body's solid components after drying and burning of organics (as for example, after [[cremation]]), about a third of the total &quot;mineral&quot; mass remaining, is the approximately one kilogram of calcium which composes the average skeleton (the remainder being mostly phosphorus and oxygen).

===H and K lines===
Visible spectra of many stars, including the [[Sun]], exhibit strong [[Spectral line|absorption line]]s of singly ionized calcium. Prominent among these are the H-line at 3968.5&amp;nbsp;[[Ångstrom|Å]] and the K line at 3933.7&amp;nbsp;Å of singly ionized calcium, or Ca&amp;nbsp;II. For the Sun and stars with low temperatures, the prominence of the H and K lines can be an indication of strong magnetic activity in the [[chromosphere]]. Measurement of periodic variations of these active regions can also be used to deduce the rotation periods of these stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Compounds==
Calcium, combined with [[phosphate]] to form [[hydroxylapatite]], is the mineral portion of human and animal bones and teeth. The mineral portion of some [[coral]]s can also be transformed into hydroxylapatite.

[[Calcium hydroxide]] (slaked lime) is used in many chemical refinery processes and is made by heating [[limestone]] at high temperature (above 825 °C) and then carefully adding water to it. When lime is mixed with sand, it hardens into a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and is turned into [[plaster]] by [[carbon dioxide]] uptake. Mixed with other compounds, lime forms an important part of [[Portland cement]].

[[Calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the common compounds of calcium. It is heated to form quicklime (CaO), which is then added to water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). This forms another material known as slaked lime (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is an inexpensive base material used throughout the chemical industry. Chalk, marble, and limestone are all forms of calcium carbonate.

When water percolates through [[limestone]] or other soluble [[carbonate]] rocks, it partially dissolves the rock and causes cave formation and characteristic [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s and also forms [[hard water]]. Other important calcium compounds are [[calcium nitrate]], [[calcium sulfide]], [[calcium chloride]], [[calcium carbide]], [[calcium cyanamide]] and [[calcium hypochlorite]].

A few calcium compounds in the oxidation state +1 have also been investigated recently.&lt;ref name=&quot;West&quot;/&gt;

==Nucleosynthesis==
{{Template:Expand section|information on other calcium [[isotope]]s|date=March 2011}}
Calcium-40 is created in extremely large and hot (over 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]]) stars, as part of the [[silicon-burning process]] in which [[alpha particles]] are added to [[silicon]] atoms. The process fuses an atom of [[argon]] and an atom of [[helium]]:

&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Ar + [[Helium-4|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]] = &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of calcium}}
Calcium has four stable [[isotope]]s (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Ca and &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca), plus two more isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ca and [[Calcium-48|&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca]]) that have such long half-lives that for all practical purposes they also can be considered stable. The 20% range in relative mass among naturally occurring calcium isotopes is greater than for any element except hydrogen and helium. Calcium also has a [[cosmogenic isotope]], [[radioactive]] &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, which has a [[half-life]] of 103,000 years. Unlike [[cosmogenic isotope]]s that are produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Ca is produced by [[neutron]] activation of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca. Most of its production is in the upper metre or so of the soil column, where the cosmogenic neutron flux is still sufficiently strong. &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Ca has received much attention in stellar studies because it decays to &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;K, a critical indicator of solar-system anomalies.

97% of naturally occurring calcium is in the form of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca. &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca is one of the daughter products of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K decay, along with &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar. While [[K-Ar dating]] has been used extensively in the [[geology|geological]] sciences, the prevalence of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca in nature has impeded its use in dating. Techniques using [[mass spectrometry]] and a double spike isotope dilution have been used for [[Potassium|K]]-Ca age dating.

The most abundant isotope, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, has a nucleus of 20 [[proton]]s and 20 [[neutron]]s. This is the heaviest stable isotope of any element which has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. In supernova explosions, calcium is formed from the reaction of carbon with various numbers of alpha particles (helium nuclei), until the most common calcium isotope (containing 10 helium nuclei) has been synthesized.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Isotope fractionation===
As with the isotopes of other elements, a variety of processes fractionate, or alter the relative abundance of, calcium isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=WA|last2=Papanastassiou|first2=DA|last3=Tombrello|first3=TA|title=Ca isotope fractionation on the earth and other solar system materials|journal=Geochim Cosmochim Acta|year=1978|volume=42|pages=1075–90|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(78)90105-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best studied of these processes is the mass dependent [[fractionation]] of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals, such as [[calcite]], [[aragonite]] and [[apatite]], from solution. Isotopically light calcium is preferentially incorporated into minerals, leaving the solution from which the mineral precipitated enriched in isotopically heavy calcium. At room temperature the magnitude of this fractionation is roughly 0.25‰ (0.025%) per atomic mass unit (AMU). Mass-dependant differences in calcium isotope composition conventionally are expressed the ratio of two isotopes (usually &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J|last2=DePaolo|first2=DJ|title=Calcium isotope fractionation between soft and mineralized tissues as a monitor of calcium use in vertebrates|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|year=1999|volume=96|pages=13709–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.24.13709|pmid=10570137|issue=24|pmc=24129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J|title=Biological control of calcium isotopic abundances in the global calcium cycle|journal=Geochim. Et Cosmochim. Acta|year=1997|volume=61|pages=2505–2510|last2=DePaolo|first2=D |issue=12|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00047-1 | bibcode = 1997GeCoA..61.2505S }}&lt;/ref&gt; that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, soft tissue &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca rises. Soft tissue &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca falls when bone resorption exceeds bone formation. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J|title=Natural calcium isotopic composition of urine as a marker of bone mineral balance|pmid=17463176|journal=Clinical Chemistry|year=2007|volume=653|pages=1155–1158|last2=Bullen|first2=T|last3=Anbar|first3=AD|last4=Puzas|first4=JE|last5=Shackelford|first5=L|last6=Leblanc|first6=A|last7=Smith|first7=SM|issue=6|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2006.080143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system exists in the ocean, where seawater &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from seawater by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean, and fall when calcium input exceeds mineral precipitation. It follows that rising &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca corresponds to falling seawater Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, and falling &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca corresponds to rising seawater Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration is not constant, and that the ocean probably never is in “steady state” with respect to its calcium input and output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fantle|first1=M|last2=DePaolo|first2=D|title=Ca isotopes in carbonate sediment and pore fluid from ODP Site 807A: The Ca2+(aq)–calcite equilibrium fractionation factor and calcite recrystallization rates in Pleistocene sediments|journal=Geochim Cosmochim Acta|year=2007|volume=71|pages=2524–2546|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2007.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffith|first1=Elizabeth M.|title=A Dynamic marine calcium cycle during the past 28 million years|pmid=19074345|journal=Science|year=2008|volume=322|pages=1671–1674|last2= Paytan |first2= Adina |last3= Caldeira |first3= Ken|last4= Bullen |first4= Thomas last5= Thomas |first5= Ellen |issue=12|doi=10.1126/science.1163614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the [[carbon cycle]] (see below).

==Geochemical cycling==
Calcium provides an important link between [[tectonics]], [[climate]] and the [[carbon cycle]]. In the simplest terms, uplift of mountains exposes Ca-bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into surface water. This Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; eventually is transported to the ocean where it reacts with dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[limestone]]. Some of this limestone settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks. Dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, along with [[carbonate]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions, are referred to as [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] (DIC).

[[Image:Pamukkale Hierapolis Travertine pools.JPG|thumb| right| Travertine terraces [[Pamukkale]], Turkey]]

The actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) that forms when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with water at seawater [[pH]]:

: {{chem|Ca|2+}} + 2{{chem|HCO|3|-}} → {{chem|CaCO|3}} (limestone) + {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Note that at ocean pH most of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced in this reaction is immediately converted back into HCO3&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the ocean/atmosphere into the [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Marine carbonate chemistry
|publisher = National Council for Science and the Environment
|accessdate = 2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result is that each Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berner|first1=Robert|title= The long-term carbon cycle, fossil fuels and atmospheric composition |journal=Nature|year=2003|volume=426|pages= 323–326|doi=10.1038/nature02131|pmid=14628061|issue=6964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Analogous cycles involving magnesium, and to a much smaller extent strontium and barium, have the same effect.

As the weathering of limestone (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) liberates equimolar amounts of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it has no net effect on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of the atmosphere and ocean. The weathering of [[silicate]] rocks like [[granite]], on the other hand, is a net CO2 sink because it produces abundant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; but very little CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==History==
Calcium (from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|''calx''}}, [[genitive case|genitive]] ''calcis'', meaning &quot;lime&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|calx|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; was known as early as the first century when the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] prepared lime as [[calcium oxide]]. Literature dating back to 975 AD notes that [[plaster of paris]] (calcium sulfate), is useful for setting broken bones. It was not isolated until 1808 in [[England]] when [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] [[Electrolysis|electrolyzed]] a mixture of lime and [[mercuric oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Davy, H. (1808) &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of  the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia],&quot; ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 98, pages 333-370.&lt;/ref&gt; Davy was trying to isolate calcium; when he heard that Swedish chemist [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] and Pontin prepared calcium amalgam by electrolyzing lime in mercury, he tried it himself. He worked with electrolysis throughout his life and also discovered/isolated [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], [[boron]] and [[barium]]. Calcium metal was not available in large scale until the beginning of the 20th century.

==Occurrence==

{{category see also|Calcium minerals}}
Calcium is not naturally found in its elemental state. Calcium occurs most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]] in the minerals [[calcite]], [[dolomite]] and [[gypsum]]. It also occurs in [[igneous rocks|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks]] chiefly in the [[silicate minerals]]: [[plagioclase]], [[amphibole]]s, [[pyroxene]]s and [[garnet]]s

Calcium is an important component of a [[healthy diet]] and a [[Dietary mineral|mineral]] necessary for life. The [[National Osteoporosis Foundation]] says, &quot;Calcium plays an important role in building stronger, denser bones early in life and keeping bones strong and healthy later in life.&quot; Approximately 99 percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/calcium/ |title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Calcium |publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, NIH |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the calcium in the body has other important uses, such as some [[exocytosis]], especially [[chemical synapse#Neurotransmitter release|neurotransmitter release]], and [[muscle contraction]]. In the [[electrical conduction system of the heart]], calcium replaces sodium as the mineral that depolarizes the cell, proliferating the action potential. In cardiac muscle, sodium influx commences an action potential, but during potassium efflux, the cardiac myocyte experiences calcium influx, prolonging the action potential and creating a plateau phase of dynamic equilibrium. Long-term [[Hypocalcaemia|calcium deficiency]] can lead to rickets and poor blood clotting and in case of a menopausal woman, it can lead to [[osteoporosis]], in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures. While a lifelong deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, over-retention can cause [[hypercalcemia]] (elevated levels of calcium in the blood), impaired kidney function and decreased absorption of other minerals.&lt;ref name=&quot;committee&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D and fluoride|location= Washington DC|publisher= The National Academies Press|year= 1997|isbn=0309064031}}&lt;/ref&gt; High calcium intakes or high calcium absorption were previously thought to contribute to the development of kidney stones.

[[Dairy product]]s, such as milk and cheese, are a well-known source of calcium. Some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people, particularly those of non Indo-European descent, are [[Lactose intolerance|lactose-intolerant]], leaving them unable to consume non-fermented dairy products in quantities larger than about half a liter per serving. Others, such as [[vegans]], avoid dairy products for ethical and health reasons. Fortunately, many good sources of calcium exist. These include [[seaweeds]] such as [[kelp]], [[wakame]] and [[hijiki]]; nuts and seeds (like [[almond]]s and [[sesame]]); blackstrap [[molasses]]; [[beans]]; [[figs]]; [[quinoa]]; [[amaranth]]; [[collard greens]]; [[okra]]; [[rutabaga]]; [[broccoli]]; [[dandelion]] leaves; [[kale]]; and fortified products such as orange juice and [[soy milk]].  An overlooked source of calcium is eggshell, which can be ground into a powder and mixed into food or a glass of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schaafsma, Anne and Beelen, Gerard M|title=Eggshell powder, a comparable or better source of calcium than purified calcium carbonate: piglet studies|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=79 |issue=12 |pages=1596–1600 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199909)79:12&lt;1596::AID-JSFA406&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12064336&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schaafsma A, van Doormaal JJ, Muskiet FA, Hofstede GJ, Pakan I, van der Veer E |title=Positive effects of a chicken eggshell powder-enriched vitamin-mineral supplement on femoral neck bone mineral density in healthy late post-menopausal Dutch women |journal=Br.

The calcium content of most foods can be found in the USDA National Nutrient Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search |title=USDA National Nutrient Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary calcium supplements===
[[Image:500 mg calcium supplements with vitamin D.jpg|thumb|500 milligram calcium supplements made from [[calcium carbonate]]]]
Calcium supplements are used to prevent and to treat calcium deficiencies. Most experts recommend that supplements be taken with food and that no more than 600&amp;nbsp;mg should be taken at a time because the percent of calcium absorbed decreases as the amount of calcium in the supplement increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;DietaryFactSheet&quot;/&gt; It is recommended to spread doses throughout the day. Recommended daily calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000 to 1500&amp;nbsp;mg. It is recommended to take supplements with food to aid in absorption.

[[Vitamin D]] is added to some calcium supplements. Proper vitamin D status is important because vitamin D is converted to a hormone in the body which then induces the synthesis of intestinal proteins responsible for calcium absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Combs, G |title=The Vitamins| page=161|publisher= Academic Press|year= 2008|isbn=0121834905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The absorption of calcium from most food and commonly used dietary supplements is very similar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Weaver, CM|chapter= Calcium|title= Present Knowledge in Nutrition, 9th Ed|volume =I| page= 377|publisher= ILSI Press|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrary to what many calcium supplement manufacturers claim in their promotional materials.
*[[Milk]] is an excellent source of dietary calcium for those whose bodies tolerate it because it has a high concentration of calcium and the calcium in milk is excellently absorbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot;/&gt;
*[[Soymilk]] and other vegetable milks are usually sold with calcium added so that their calcium concentration is as high as in milk
*Also different kind of [[juice]]s boosted with calcium are widely available.
*[[Calcium carbonate]] is the most common and least expensive calcium supplement. It should be taken with food. It depends on low pH levels for proper absorption in the intestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Nutr. |volume=135 |issue=10|page=2379|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/135/10/2379|pmid=16177199|year=2005|last2=Martin|first2=BR|last3=Weaver|first3=CM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martini, Ligia and Wood, Richard J|title=Relative bioavailability of calcium-rich dietary sources in the elderly|url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/76/6/1345|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=76 |issue=6|pages=1345–1350|year=2002|pmid=12450902}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most people digest calcium carbonate very well, some might develop gastrointestinal discomfort or gas. Taking magnesium with it can help to avoid constipation. Calcium carbonate is 40% elemental calcium. 1000&amp;nbsp;mg will provide 400&amp;nbsp;mg of calcium. However, supplement labels will usually indicate how much calcium is present in each serving, not how much calcium carbonate is present.
*[[Antacids]] frequently contain calcium carbonate, and are a commonly used, inexpensive calcium supplement
*[[Coral calcium]] is a salt of calcium derived from fossilized coral reefs. Coral calcium is composed of calcium carbonate and trace minerals.
*[[Calcium citrate]] can be taken without food and is the supplement of choice for individuals with achlorhydria or who are taking histamine-2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors.&lt;ref name = &quot;osgknm&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0115426507022003286|title=Calcium Supplementation in Clinical Practice: A Review of Forms, Doses, and Indications|year=2007|author=Straub, D. A.|journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice|volume=22|pages=286–96|pmid=17507729|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more easily digested and absorbed than calcium carbonate if taken on an empty stomach and less likely to cause constipation and gas than calcium carbonate. It also has a lower risk of contributing to the formation of kidney stones. Calcium citrate is about 21% elemental calcium. 1000&amp;nbsp;mg will provide 210&amp;nbsp;mg of calcium. It is more expensive than calcium carbonate and more of it must be taken to get the same amount of calcium.
*[[Calcium phosphate]] costs more than calcium carbonate, but less than calcium citrate. It is easily absorbed and is less likely to cause constipation and gas than either.
*[[Calcium lactate]] has similar absorption as calcium carbonate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jf020065g|title=Calcium Absorption from Three Salts and CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-Fortified Bread in Premenopausal Women|year=2002|author=Martin, Berdine R.|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=50|pages=3874–6|pmid=12059174|last2=Weaver|first2=CM|last3=Heaney|first3=RP|last4=Packard|first4=PT|last5=Smith|first5=DL|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is more expensive. Calcium lactate and calcium gluconate are less concentrated forms of calcium and are not practical oral supplements.&lt;ref name = &quot;osgknm&quot;/&gt;
*Calcium [[chelates]] are synthetic calcium compounds, with calcium bound to an organic molecule, such as malate, aspartate, or fumarate. These forms of calcium may be better absorbed on an empty stomach. However, in general they are absorbed similarly to calcium carbonate and other common calcium supplements when taken with food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jf0200422|title=Absorption of Calcium Fumarate Salts Is Equivalent to Other Calcium Salts When Measured in the Rat Model|year=2002|author=Weaver, Connie M.|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=50|pages=4974–5|pmid=12166992|last2=Martin|first2=BR|last3=Costa|first3=NM|last4=Saleeb|first4=FZ|last5=Huth|first5=PJ|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'chelate' mimics the action that natural food performs by keeping the calcium soluble in the intestine. Thus, on an empty stomach, in some individuals, chelates might theoretically be absorbed better.
*[[Hydroxylapatite#Supplement|Microcrystalline hydroxyapatite]] (MH) is marketed as a calcium supplement, and has in some randomized trials been found to be more effective than calcium carbonate.

In July 2006, a report citing research from [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in Seattle, Washington claimed that women in their 50s gained {{convert|5|lb}} less in a period of 10 years by taking more than 500&amp;nbsp;mg of calcium supplements than those who did not. However, the doctor in charge of the study, Dr. Alejandro J. Gonzalez also noted it would be &quot;going out on a limb&quot; to suggest calcium supplements as a weight-limiting aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;WeightSupplements&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=

==Hazards and toxicity==
Compared to other metals, the calcium ion and most calcium compounds have low toxicity. This is not surprising given the very high natural abundance of calcium compounds in the environment and in organisms. Calcium poses few, if any, serious environmental problems. Acute calcium poisoning is rare, and difficult to achieve unless calcium compounds are administered intravenously. For example, the oral [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for rats for [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium chloride]] are 6.45 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Lewis |first= R.

Calcium metal is hazardous because of its sometimes violent reactions with water and acids. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and [[calcium hydroxide]] that [[Saponification|saponifies]] the fats and liquefies the proteins (e.g., hair) that block drains. When swallowed calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth, esophagus and stomach, and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Rumack BH. POISINDEX. Information System Micromedex, Inc., Englewood, CO, 2010; CCIS Volume 143. Hall AH and Rumack BH (Eds)&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive consumption of calcium carbonate antacids/dietary supplements (such as Tums) over a period of weeks or months can cause [[milk-alkali syndrome]], with symptoms ranging from [[hypercalcemia]] to potentially fatal [[renal failure]]. What constitutes “excessive” consumption is not well known and probably varies a great deal from person to person. Persons who consume more than 10&amp;nbsp;grams/day of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (=4 g Ca) are at risk of developing milk-alkali syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beall DP, Henslee HB, Webb HR, Scofield RH |title=Milk-alkali syndrome: a historical review and description of the modern version of the syndrome |journal=Am.

Oral calcium supplements diminish the absorption of [[thyroxine]] when taken within four to six hours of each other. &lt;ref&gt;http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/283/21/2822.long&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, people taking both calcium and thyroxine run the risk of inadequate thyroid hormone replacement and thence [[hypothyroidism]] if they take them simultaneously or near-simultaneously.

{{Infobox chromium}}
'''Chromium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|r|oʊ|m|i|əm}} {{Respell|KROH|mee-əm}}) is a [[chemical element]] which has the symbol '''Cr''' and [[atomic number]] 24, first element in [[Group 6 element|Group 6]]. It is a steely-gray, [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous]], hard [[metal]] that takes a high polish and has a high melting point. It is also odorless, tasteless, and malleable. The name of the element is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word &quot;chrōma&quot; (χρώμα), meaning [[colour]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxrw%3Dma χρώμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; because many of its compounds are intensely coloured. It was discovered by [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] in the mineral [[crocoite]] (''[[lead chromate]]'') in 1797. Crocoite was used as a pigment, and after the discovery that the mineral chromite also contains chromium, this latter mineral was used to produce pigments as well.

Chromium was regarded with great interest because of its high [[corrosion]] resistance and hardness. A major development was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding chromium to form [[stainless steel]]. This application, along with [[chrome plating]] ([[electroplating]] with chromium) are currently the highest-volume uses of the metal. Chromium and [[ferrochromium]] are produced from the single commercially viable ore, chromite, by silicothermic or [[aluminothermic reaction]] or by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]] processes. Although trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) is required in trace amounts for [[sugar]] and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], few cases have been reported where its complete removal from the diet has caused [[chromium deficiency]]. In larger amounts and different forms chromium can be toxic and [[carcinogenic]]. The most prominent example of toxic chromium is [[hexavalent chromium]] (Cr(VI)). Abandoned chromium production sites often require [[Environmental remediation|environmental cleanup]].

==Characteristics==
===Physical===
Chromium is remarkable for its magnetic properties: it is the only elemental solid which shows [[antiferromagnetic]] ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38 °C, it transforms into a [[paramagnetic]] state.&lt;ref name=&quot;fawcett&quot;/&gt;

====Passivation====
Chromium metal left standing in air is [[passivation|passivated]] by oxygen, forming a thin protective oxide surface layer. This layer is a [[spinel]] structure only a few atoms thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying material. This barrier is in contrast to iron or plain carbon steels, where the oxygen migrates into the underlying material and causes [[rust]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The oxidation of alloys|url = http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0034-4885/39/5/001/rpv39i5p401.pdf|last = Wallwork|first = G. R.|year = 1976|journal = Reports on the Progress Physics|volume = 39|pages = 401–485|doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/39/5/001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passivation can be enhanced by short contact with [[oxidizing acid]]s like [[nitric acid]]. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. The opposite effect can be achieved by treatment with a strong reducing reactant that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.&lt;ref name = &quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

Chromium, unlike metals such as iron and nickel, does not suffer from [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. However, it does suffer from nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=CGMrAAAAYAAJ|title = High-temperature oxidation-resistant coatings: coatings for protection from oxidation of superalloys, refractory metals, and graphite|author = National Research Council (U.S.).

===Occurrence===
Chromium is the 21st most [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|abundant element in Earth's crust]] with an average concentration of 100 ppm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emsley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley|first=John|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2001|location = Oxford, England, UK|isbn = 0198503407|chapter = Chromium|pages=495–498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium compounds are found in the environment, due to [[erosion]] of chromium-containing rocks and can be distributed by volcanic eruptions. The concentrations range in soil is between 1 and 3000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, in sea water 5 to 800&amp;nbsp;µg/liter, and in rivers and lakes 26&amp;nbsp;µg/liter to 5.2&amp;nbsp;mg/liter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crspeci&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title =Chromium occurrence in the environment and methods of its speciation|volume = 107|issue = 3|journal = Environmental Pollution|year = 2000|pages = 263–283|doi = 10.1016/S0269-7491(99)00168-2|first = J.|last = Kotaś|pmid =15092973|last2 =Stasicka|first2 =Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rare, deposits of [[Native metal|native]] chromium exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM67/AM67_854.pdf|title = New Mineral Names|journal = American Mineralogist|volume = 67|pages = 854–860|year = l982|first = Michael|last = Fleischer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-1037.html Chromium] (with location data), Mindat&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Udachnaya Pipe]] in [[Russia]] produces samples of the native metal.

The relation between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) strongly depends on [[pH]] and [[oxidative]] properties of the location, but in most cases, the Cr(III) is the dominating species,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crspeci&quot;/&gt; although in some areas the ground water can contain up to 39&amp;nbsp;µg/liter of total chromium of which 30&amp;nbsp;µg/liter is present as Cr(VI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Natural Occurrence of Hexavalent Chromium in the Aromas Red Sands Aquifer, California|volume = 39|issue = 15|journal = Environmental Science and Technology |year = 2005 |pages = 5505–5511|doi = 10.1021/es048835n|first = A.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of chromium}}
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s; &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr being the most abundant (83.789% [[natural abundance]]). 19 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a [[half-life]] of (more than) 1.8{{e|17}} years, and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2 [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr is the [[radiogenic]] decay product of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;[[manganese|Mn]]. Chromium [[isotope|isotopic]] contents are typically combined with [[manganese]] isotopic contents and have found application in [[isotope geology]]. [[manganese|Mn]]-Cr isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;[[Aluminium|Al]] and &lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;[[Palladium|Pd]] for the early history of the [[solar system]]. Variations in &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr/&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn/&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotopic composition must result from in-situ decay of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr provides additional evidence for [[nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthetic]] processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.&lt;ref name=&quot;53Mn53Cr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume = 63|issue = 23–24|year = 1999|pages = 4111–4117|doi = 10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00312-9|title = &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn-&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr evolution of the early solar system|first = J.

The isotopes of chromium range in [[atomic mass]] from 43&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Cr) to 67&amp;nbsp;u (&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Cr).

Chromium is a member of the [[transition metal]]s, in [[Group 6 element|group 6]]. Chromium(0) has an electronic configuration of 4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, owing to the lower energy of the [[Spin states (d electrons)|high spin configuration]]. Chromium exhibits a wide range of possible [[oxidation state]]s, where the +3 state is most stable energetically; the +3 and +6 states are most commonly observed in chromium compounds, whereas the +1, +4 and +5 states are rare.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmidt&quot;/&gt;

===Chromium(III)===
[[File:Chlorid chromitý.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Chromium(III) chloride hexahydrate ([CrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]]
[[File:Chromium(III)-chloride-purple-anhydrous-sunlight.jpg|thumb|upright|Anhydrous chromium(III) chloride (CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]]

A large number of chromium(III) compounds are known. Chromium(III) can be obtained by dissolving elemental chromium in acids like [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]]. The {{chem|Cr|3+}} ion has a similar radius (63&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]]) to the {{chem|Al|3+}} ion (radius 50&amp;nbsp;pm), so they can replace each other in some compounds, such as in [[chrome alum]] and [[alum]]. When a trace amount of {{chem|Cr|3+}} replaces {{chem|Al|3+}} in [[corundum]] (aluminium oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), the red-colored [[ruby]] is formed.
 
Chromium(III) ions tend to adopt [[octahedral molecular geometry]], with six [[ligand]]s.  The colors of these solutions is determined by the ligands attached to the Cr centre.  The commercially available [[chromium(III) chloride]] hydrate is the dark green complex [CrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl, but two other forms are known: pale green [CrCl(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the violet [Cr(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If water-free green [[chromium(III) chloride]] is dissolved in water then the green solution turns violet after some time, due to the substitution of water for chloride in the inner [[coordination sphere]]. This kind of reaction is also observed in [[chrome alum]] solutions and other water-soluble chromium(III) salts. The reverse reaction may be induced by heating the solution.

Chromium(III) hydroxide (Cr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]], dissolving in acidic solutions to form [Cr(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and in basic solutions to form {{chem|[Cr(OH)|6|]|3-}}. It is dehydrated by heating to form the green [[chromium(III) oxide]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the stable oxide with a crystal structure identical to that of [[corundum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

===Chromium(VI)===
[[File:Chrom(VI)-oxid.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chromium(VI) oxide]]
[[Hexavalent chromium|Chromium(VI) compounds]] are powerful oxidants at low or neutral pH.  Most important are [[chromate]] anion ({{chem|CrO|4|2-}}) and [[dichromate]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) anions, which exist in equilibrium:
:2 [CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{\leftarrow}&lt;/math&gt; [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Chromium(VI) halides are known also and include hexafluoride CrF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and [[chromyl chloride]] ({{chem|CrO|2|Cl|2}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1081–1095|isbn = 3110075113|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|chapter = Chromium| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sodium chromate]] is produced industrially by the oxidative roasting of [[chromite]] ore with [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] or [[sodium carbonate]]. The dominant species is therefore, by the [[law of mass action]], determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange ([[dichromate]]), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of [[potassium chromate]]. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex [[oxyanion]]s of chromium is possible.

Both the chromate and dichromate anions are strong oxidizing reagents at low pH:&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Chroman sodný.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sodium chromate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
:{{chem|Cr|2|O|7|2-}} + 14 {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 {{chem|Cr|3+}} + 21 {{chem|H|2|O}} (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.33&amp;nbsp;V)

They are, however, only moderately oxidizing at high pH:&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt; 
:{{chem|CrO|4|2-}} + 4 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 3 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|Cr(OH)|3}} + 5 {{chem|OH|-}} (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.13&amp;nbsp;V)

Chromium(VI) compounds in solution can be detected by adding an acidic [[hydrogen peroxide]] solution. The unstable dark blue [[chromium(VI) peroxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed, which can be stabilized as an ether adduct {{chem|CrO|5|·OR|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

[[Chromic acid]] has the hypothetical formula {{chem|H|2|CrO|4}}. It is a vaguely described chemical, despite many well-defined chromates and dichromates are known. The dark red [[chromium(VI) oxide]] {{chem|CrO|3}}, the acid [[anhydride]] of chromic acid, is sold industrially as &quot;chromic acid&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt; It can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate, and is an strong oxidizing agent.

In 2010, the [[Environmental Working Group]] studied the drinking water in 35 American cities. The study was the first nationwide analysis measuring the presence of the chemical in U.S. water systems. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with [[Norman, Oklahoma]], at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Note: Concentrations of Cr VI in US municipal drinking water supplies reported by EWG are within likely, natural background levels for the areas tested and not necessarily indicative of industrial pollution [http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/lahontan/water_issues/projects/pge/docs/pge_background_study_faq2.pdf (CalEPA Fact Sheet)], as asserted by EWG. This factor was not taken into consideration in their report.

===Chromium(IV) and chromium(V)===
The oxidation state +5 is only realized in few compounds but are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate. The only binary compound is the volatile chromium(V) fluoride (CrF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). This red solid has a melting point of 30 °C and a boiling point of 117 °C. It can be synthesized by treating chromium metal with fluorine at 400 °C and 200 bar pressure. The peroxochromate(V) is another example of the +5 oxidation state. [[Potassium tetraperoxochromate(V)|Potassium peroxochromate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]) is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures. This red brown compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at 150–170&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=969592612&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;fi...|title = Preparation, Structure and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Tetraperoxo Complexes of Cr&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nb&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ta&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt; (PhD thesis, University of Siegen, 2003)|first = Gentiana|last = Haxhillazi|publisher= University Siegen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds of chromium(IV) (in the +4 oxidation state) are slightly more common than those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides, CrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and CrBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, can be produced by treating the trihalides ({{chem|CrX|3}}) with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable in water.

===Chromium(I) and chromium(II)===
Many chromium(II) compounds are known, including the water-stable [[chromium(II) chloride]], {{chem|CrCl|2}}, which can be made by reduction of chromium(III) chloride with zinc. The resulting bright blue solution is only stable at neutral [[pH]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt; Many chromous carboxylates are also known, most famously, the red [[chromous acetate]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which features a quadruple bond.

Many chromium(0) compounds are known. Most are derivatives of [[chromium hexacarbonyl]] or [[bis(benzene)chromium]].

==History==
Weapons found in burial pits dating from the late 3rd century BC [[Qin Dynasty]] of the [[Terracotta Army]] near [[Xi'an]], [[China]] have been analyzed by archaeologists. Although buried more than 2,000 years ago, the ancient [[bronze]] tips of [[crossbow]] bolts and swords found at the site showed no sign of corrosion, because the bronze was coated with chromium.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, Maurice. (2004). ''The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army''. Rochester: Bear and Company. ISBN 159143033X. Page 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium came to the attention of westerners in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, [[Johann Gottlob Lehmann (scientist)|Johann Gottlob Lehmann]] found an orange-red mineral in the [[Beryozovskoye deposit|Beryozovskoye mines]] in the [[Ural Mountains]] which he named ''Siberian red lead''. Though misidentified as a [[lead]] compound with [[selenium]] and [[iron]] components, the mineral was [[Crocoite]] (''[[lead chromate]]'') with a formula of PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChromiumVI&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Chromium (VI) Handbook|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2005|isbn = 9781566706087|pages = 7–11|author = Guertin, Jacques; Jacobs, James Alan and Avakian, Cynthia P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1770, [[Peter Simon Pallas]] visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had useful properties as a [[pigment]] in [[paint]]s. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment developed rapidly. A bright [[yellow]] pigment made from crocoite also became fashionable.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChromiumVI&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cut Ruby.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The red colour of rubies is from a small amount of chromium(III).]]

In 1797, [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] received samples of crocoite [[ore]]. He produced [[chromium(VI) oxide|chromium oxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by mixing crocoite with [[hydrochloric acid]]. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://books.google.com/?id=6dgPAAAAQAAJ|journal =Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Art|year = 1798|pages = 146|volume =3|title = Memoir on a New Metallic Acid which exists in the Red Lead of Sibiria|first = Louis Nicolas|last = Vauquelin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious [[gemstone]]s, such as [[ruby]] or [[emerald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChromiumVI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last = van der Krogt|first = Peter|title = Chromium|url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Cr|accessdate = 2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1800s, chromium was primarily used as a component of paints and in [[tanning]] salts. At first, crocoite from [[Russia]] was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near [[Baltimore]], [[United States]]. This made the United states the largest producer of chromium products till 1848 when large deposits of chromite where found near [[Bursa]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;/&gt;

Chromium is also known for its luster when polished. It is used as a protective and decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by [[electroplating]]. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crplating&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Nickel and Chromium Plating| publisher = Woodhead Publishing|year = 1993| isbn = 9781855730816| pages = 9–12|chapter = History of Chromium Plating|author = Dennis, J.

Metal alloys now account for 85% of the use of chromium. The remainder is used in the [[chemical industry]] and [[refractory]] and [[foundry]] industries.

[[File:Chromium zone refined and 1cm3 cube.jpg|left|thumb|chromium, remelted in a horizontal arc zone-refiner, showing large visible crystal grains]]
Approximately 4.4 million metric tons of marketable chromite ore were produced in 2000, and converted into ~3.3 million tons of ferro-chrome with an approximate market value of 2.5 billion [[United States dollar]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS2002Yb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/chromium/chrommyb02.pdf|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2009-02-16|title = Mineral Yearbook 2002: Chromium|first = John F|last = Papp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest producers of chromium ore have been [[South Africa]] (44%) [[India]] (18%), [[Kazakhstan]] (16%) [[Zimbabwe]] (5%), [[Finland]] (4%) [[Iran]] (4%) and [[Brazil]] (2%) with several other countries producing the rest of less than 10% of the world production.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS2002Yb&quot;/&gt;

The two main products of chromium ore refining are [[ferrochromium]] and metallic chromium. For those products the ore smelter process differs considerably. For the production of ferrochromium, the chromite ore (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is reduced in large scale in [[electric arc furnace]] or in smaller smelters with either [[aluminium]] or [[silicon]] in an [[aluminothermic reaction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IndMin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Industrial Minerals &amp; Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses|edition = 7th|publisher = SME|year = 2006|isbn = 9780873352338|chapter = Chromite|first = John F|last = Papp |coauthor = Lipin Bruce R.|url = http://books.google.com/?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;pg=PA309}}

[[File:World Chromium Production 2002.svg|thumb|300px|Chromium ore output in 2002&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS2002Yb&quot;/&gt;]]
For the production of pure chromium, the iron has to be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[sodium carbonate]] in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the [[chromate]]s and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndMin&quot;/&gt;

:4 FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 7 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:2 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The dichromate is converted to the chromium(III) oxide by reduction with carbon and then reduced in an aluminothermic reaction to chromium.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndMin&quot;/&gt;
:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO

==Applications==
===Metallurgy===
[[File:Motorcycle Reflections bw edit.jpg|thumb|Decorative chrome plating on a motorcycle.]]
The strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The [[high speed steel|high speed tool steels]] contain between 3 and 5% chromium. [[Stainless steel]], the main corrosion-proof metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to [[iron]] in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium is added to the molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high temperature properties of these nickel [[superalloy]]s, they are used in [[jet engine]]s and [[gas turbine]]s in lieu of common structural materials.&lt;ref name =&quot;superal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Nickel-Based Superalloys|first = H. K. D. H.|last =Bhadeshia|url = http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|accessdate = 2009-02-17|publisher = University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium makes it a good surface coating, being still the most &quot;popular&quot; metal coating with unbeatable combined durability. A thin layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by [[electroplating]] techniques. There are two deposition methods: Thin, below 1&amp;nbsp;µm thickness, layers are deposited by [[chrome plating]], and are used for decorative surfaces. If wear-resistant surfaces are needed then thicker chromium layers are deposited. 
Both methods normally use acidic chromate or [[dichromate]] solutions. To prevent the energy consuming change in oxidation state, the use of Chromium(III) sulfate is under development, but for most applications, the established process is used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crplating&quot;/&gt;

In the [[chromate conversion coating]] process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This [[passivation]] and the self healing properties by the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Edwards |first = Joseph |title = Coating and Surface Treatment Systems for Metals |publisher = Finishing Publications Ltd. and ASMy International |year = 1997|pages = 66–71 |isbn = 0-904477-16-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating method are under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Surface and Coatings Technology|volume = 140|issue = 1| year = 2001|doi = 10.1016/S0257-8972(01)01003-9|title = Effects of chromate and chromate conversion coatings on corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3|first = J.|last = Zhao|url = https://dspace03.it.ohio-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/36519/1/55_FrankelG_EffectsChromateChromateConversion_2001_p51-57.pdf|pages = 51–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Anodizing]] of aluminium is another electrochemical process, which does not lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses [[chromic acid]] as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.&lt;ref name=&quot;surface&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = ASM Handbook: Surface Engineering|first = J.

The high toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds, used in the established chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium or at least a change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crplating&quot;/&gt;

===Dye and pigment===

The mineral [[crocoite]] ([[lead chromate]] PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, [[chrome yellow]] was, together with [[cadmium yellow]], one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not degrade in the light and has a strong color. The signaling effect of yellow was used for school buses in the United States and for Postal Service (for example [[Deutsche Post]]) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was substituted by organic pigments or other lead-free alternatives. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·Pb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Chrome green is a mixture of [[Prussian blue]] and [[chrome yellow]], while the chrome oxide green is [[Chromium(III) oxide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cryel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://books.google.com/?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&amp;pg=PA106|title = Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia|first = Rutherford John|last = Gettens|publisher = Courier Dover Publications|year = 1966|isbn = 9780486215976|pages = 105–106|chapter =Chrome yellow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass is colored green by the addition of chromium(III) oxide.

The toxicity of chromium(VI) salts is used in the preservation of wood.

===Refractory material===
The high heat resistivity and high melting point makes [[chromite]] and chromium(III) oxide a material for high temperature refractory applications, like [[blast furnace]]s, cement [[kiln]]s, molds for the firing of [[brick]]s and as foundry sands for the [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] of metals. In these applications, the refractory materials are made from mixtures of chromite and magnesite.

Chromium has no verfied biological role.

The acute [[mouth|oral]] [[toxicity]] for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150&amp;nbsp;µg/kg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;/&gt; In the body, chromium(VI) is reduced by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also [[sulfate]] and [[phosphate]] ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong [[oxidation]]al properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. [[Hemolysis]], [[renal]] and liver failure are the results of these damages. Aggressive dialysis can improve the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium toxicity, carcinogenicity and allergenicity: Review of the literature from 1985 to 2000 |first = A.

The first mechanism includes highly reactive [[hydroxyl radical]]s and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the [[DNA]]. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium carcinogenicity and toxicity |first = M.

Chromium salts (chromates) are also the cause of [[allergic reaction]]s in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives. Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic [[contact dermatitis]] and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin, sometimes referred to as &quot;chrome ulcers&quot;. This condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-producing manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = DermNet NZ|title = Chrome Contact Allergy|url = http://dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/chrome-allergy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; &quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Investigation of the threshold for allergic reactivity to chromium |first = David |last = Basketter |journal = Contact Dermatitis |volume = 44 |issue = 2 |pages = 70–74 |year = 2000 |doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.440202.x |last2 = Horev |first2 = L. |last3 = Slodovnik |first3 = D.|last4 = Merimes |first4 = S. |last5 = Trattner |first5 = A.|last6 = Ingber |first6 = A. |pmid = 11205406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental issues===
As chromium compounds were used in [[dye]]s and [[paint]]s and the [[tanning]] of [[leather]], these compounds are often found in soil and [[groundwater]] at abandoned industrial sites, now needing [[environmental cleanup]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] per the treatment of [[brownfield land]].

'''Cymbals''' are a common [[percussion instrument]]. Cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various [[alloys]]; see [[cymbal making]] for a discussion of their manufacture. The greater majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (see: [[crotales]]). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate a crash, ride or crash ride, and a pair of [[hi-hat]] cymbals.

== Etymology ==
[[File:NAMA Cymbale.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] bronze cymbal, 5th century BCE, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
The word cymbal is derived from the [[Latin]] ''cymbalum'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of  the [[Greek language|Greek]] word κύμβαλον (''kumbalon''), &quot;cymbal&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Fmbalon κύμβαλον], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn derives from κύμβος (''kumbos''), &quot;cup&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Fmbos κύμβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy ==
The anatomy of the cymbal plays a large part in the sound it creates.&lt;ref&gt;Sabian.com education, Anatomy page http://sabian.com/EN/education/cymbal_anatomy.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  The hole is drilled in the center of the cymbal and it is used to either mount the cymbal on a stand or straps (for hand playing).  The bell, dome, or cup is the raised section immediately surrounding the hole.  The bell produces a higher &quot;pinging&quot; [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] than the rest of the cymbal.  The bow is the rest of the surface surrounding the bell.  The bow is sometimes described in two areas: the ride and crash area.  The ride area is the thicker section closer to the bell while the crash area is the thinner tapering section near the edge.  The edge or rim is the immediate circumference of the cymbal.  

Cymbals are measured by their diameter often in inches or centimeters.  The size of the cymbal affects its sound, larger cymbals usually being louder and having longer [[sustain]].  The weight describes how thick the cymbal is.  Cymbal weights are important to the sound they produce and how they play.  Heavier cymbals have a louder volume, more cut, and better stick articulation (when using drum sticks).  Thin cymbals have a fuller sound, a lowered pitch, and faster response.  

The profile of the cymbal is the vertical distance of the bow from the bottom of the bell to the cymbal edge (higher profile cymbals are more bowl shaped).  The profile affects the pitch of the cymbal; Higher profile cymbals have higher pitch.

== Types ==
=== Orchestral cymbals ===
Cymbals offer a composer nearly endless amounts of color and effect. Their unique timbre allows them to project even against a full orchestra and through the heaviest of orchestrations and enhance articulation and nearly any dynamic. Cymbals have been utilized historically to suggest frenzy, fury or bacchanalian revels, as seen in the Venus music in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', [[Grieg]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt suite]]'', and Osmin's aria &quot;O wie will ich triumphieren&quot; from Mozart's ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail''.

==== Clash cymbals ====
[[Image:Crash cymbals profile.png|thumb|100px|A pair of clash cymbals in profile. The bell is in green and the straps are in red.]]

Orchestral [[clash cymbal]]s are traditionally used in pairs, each one having a strap set in the bell of the cymbal by which they are held. Such a pair is also known as '''crash cymbals''' or plates.

The sound can be obtained by rubbing their edges together in a sliding movement  for a &quot;sizzle&quot;, striking them against each other in what is called a &quot;clash&quot;, tapping the edge of one against the body of the other in what is called a &quot;tap-clash&quot;, scraping the edge of one from the inside of the bell to the edge for a &quot;scrape&quot; or &quot;zischen,&quot; or shutting the cymbals together and choking the sound in what is called a &quot;hi-hat chick&quot; or crush. A skilled player can obtain an enormous dynamic range from such a pair of cymbals. For example, in [[Beethoven's ninth symphony]], the percussionist is employed to first play cymbals at pianissimo, adding a touch of colour rather than loud clash.

[[Image:Chinese New Year Seattle 2007 - 25.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese style clash cymbals in use.]]

Clash cymbals are usually [[damping|damped]] by pressing them against the player's body. A composer may write ''laissez vibrer'', &quot;Let vibrate&quot; (usually abbreviated l.v.), ''secco'' (dry), or equivalent indications on the score; more usually, the player must judge exactly when to damp the cymbals based on the written duration of clash and the context in which it occurs.

Clash cymbals have traditionally been accompanied by the [[bass drum]] playing an identical [[Part (music)|part]]. This combination, played loudly, is an effective way to accentuate a note since the two instruments together contribute to both very low and very high frequency ranges and provide a satisfying &quot;clash-bang-wallop&quot;. In older music the composer sometimes provided just one part for this pair of instruments, writing ''senza piatti'' or ''piatti soli'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: &quot;without cymbals&quot; or &quot;cymbals only&quot;) if the bass drum is to remain silent. This came from the common practice of only having one percussionist play both instruments, using one cymbal mounted to the shell of the bass drum itself.  The player would clash the cymbals with his left hand and use a mallet to strike the bass drum in his right.  This method is often employed today in pit orchestras and is called for specifically by composers who desire a certain effect.  [[Stravinsky]] calls for this in his ballet [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]  and [[Mahler]] calls for this in his [[Titan Symphony]].  However, the modern convention is for the instruments to have independent parts.

Clash cymbals evolved into the low-sock and from this to the modern [[hi-hat]]. Even in a modern drum kit, they remain paired with the bass drum as the two instruments which are played with the player's feet. However, hi-hat cymbals tend to be heavy with little taper, more similar to a [[ride cymbal]] than to a [[clash cymbal]] as found in a drum kit, and perform a ride rather than a clash function.

==== Suspended cymbal ====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)]] --&gt;
Another use of cymbals is the [[suspended cymbal]]. This instrument takes its name from the traditional method of suspending the cymbal by means of a leather strap or rope, thus allowing the cymbal to vibrate as freely as possible for maximum musical effect. Early jazz drumming pioneers borrowed this style of cymbal mounting during the early 1900s and later drummers further developed this instrument in to the mounted horizontal or nearly horizontally mounted &quot;crash&quot; cymbals of a modern [[drum kit]], However, most modern drum kits do not employ a leather strap suspension system. Many modern drum kits use a mount with felt or otherwise dampening fabric to act as a barrier to hold the cymbals between metal clamps: thus forming the modern day ride cymbal.

Suspended cymbals can be played with yarn, sponge or cord wrapped [[Drum stick#Mallets|mallets]]. The first known instance of using a sponge-headed mallet on a cymbal is the final chord of Hector Berlioz' [[Symphonie Fantastique]]. Composers sometimes specifically request other types of mallets like felt mallets or [[timpani]] beaters for different attack and sustain qualities.
 
Suspended cymbals can produce bright and slicing tones when forcefully struck, and give an eerie transparent &quot;windy&quot; sound when played quietly. A tremolo, or roll (played with two mallets alternately striking on opposing sides of the cymbal) can build in volume from almost inaudible to an overwhelming climax in a satisfyingly smooth manner (as in Humperdink's Mother Goose Suite). 

The edge of a suspended cymbal may be hit with shoulder of a [[drum stick]] to obtain a sound somewhat akin to that of a pair of clash cymbals. Other methods of playing include scraping a coin or a [[triangle (instrument)|triangle]] beater rapidly across the ridges on the top of the cymbal, giving a &quot;zing&quot; sound (as in the fourth movement of Dvořák's Symphony No. 9). Other effects that can be used include drawing a cello or bass bow across the edge of the cymbal for a sound not unlike squealing car brakes.

==== Ancient cymbals ====
Ancient cymbals or tuned cymbals are much more rarely called for. Their timbre is entirely different, more like that of small hand-bells or of the notes of the keyed harmonica. They are not struck full against each other, but by one of their edges, and the note given in by them is higher in proportion as they are thicker and smaller. Berlioz's ''Romeo and Juliet'' calls for two pairs of cymbals, modelled on some old Pompeian instruments no larger than the hand (some are no larger than a crown piece), and tuned to F and B flat. The modern instruments descended from this line are the [[crotal]]es.

'''Cadmium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|d|m|i|əm}} {{respell|KAD|mee-əm}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Cd''' and [[atomic number]] 48. The soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Similar to zinc it prefers [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds and similar to mercury it shows a low melting point compared to [[transition metal]]s. Cadmium and its [[congeners]] are not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Average concentration in the earth’s crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and therefore is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a [[pigment]] and for corrosion resistant plating on [[steel]]. Cadmium compounds were used to stabilize [[plastic]]. With the exception of its use in [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] and [[cadmium telluride]] [[solar panel]]s, the use of cadmium is generally decreasing in its other applications. These declines have been due to competing technologies, cadmium’s [[toxicity]] in certain forms and concentration and resulting regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Article Cadmium&lt;/ref&gt; Although cadmium is toxic, one [[enzyme]], a [[carbonic anhydrase]] with cadmium as [[reactive center]] has been discovered.

===Physical properties===
Cadmium is a soft, [[malleable]], [[ductile]], bluish-white [[Bivalent (chemistry)|bivalent]] [[metal]]. It is similar in many respects to zinc but forms  [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]] compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages =1056–1057|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|language = German | chapter = Cadmium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
{{Category see also|Cadmium compounds}}
The most common [[oxidation state]] of cadmium is +2, though rare examples of +1 can be found. Cadmium and its [[congeners]] are not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = F. Albert| last = Cotton  | title = Advanced Inorganic Chemistry|edition =6 |publisher =John Wiley and Sons  |year =1999  | chapter = Survey of Transition-Metal Chemistry |pages = 633 |isbn = 0471199575}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous [[cadmium oxide]] (CdO). The [[crystalline]] form of the same compound is dark red and changes color when heated, similar to [[zinc oxide]]. [[Hydrochloric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]] and [[nitric acid]] dissolve cadmium by forming [[cadmium chloride]] (CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [[cadmium sulfate]] (CdSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[cadmium nitrate]] (Cd(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The oxidation state +1 can be reached by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and [[aluminium chloride]], forming the Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation, which is similar to the Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation in [[mercury(I) chloride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot;/&gt;
:Cd + CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Isotopes===
[[Image:Cadmium cutoff.png|thumb|left|The cadmium-113 total cross section clearly showing the cadmium cutoff.]]
{{Main|Isotopes of cadmium}}
Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 [[isotope]]s. For two of them, natural [[radioactivity]] was observed, and three others are predicted to be radioactive but their decay is not observed, due to extremely long [[half-life]] times. The two natural radioactive isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is 7.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years) and &lt;sup&gt;116&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is 2.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; years). The other three are &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Cd ([[double electron capture]]), and &lt;sup&gt;114&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on their half-life times have been set. At least three isotopes - &lt;sup&gt;110&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, and &lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt;Cd - are stable. Among the isotopes absent in natural cadmium, the most long-lived are &lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 2.5 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 minutes. This element also has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;113m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.1 years), &lt;sup&gt;115m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 44.6 days), and &lt;sup&gt;117m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.36 hours).&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Cd) to 131.946 u (&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element 47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element 49 ([[indium]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;/&gt;

One isotope of cadmium, &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, absorbs neutrons with very high probability if they have an energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' and transmits them readily otherwise. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5 eV. Neutrons with energy below the cutoff are deemed slow neutrons, distinguishing them from intermediate and fast neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knoll |first=G. F. |title=Radiation Detection and Measurement, 3rd edition |publisher=Wiley |year=1999 |isbn=978-0471073383|page=505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadmium is created via the long [[S-process]] in low-medium mass stars (.6 -&gt; 10 solar masses), lasting thousands of years to do.  It requires a [[silver]] atom to capture a [[neutron]] and then undergo [[beta decay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=TOjwtYYb63cC&amp;pg=PA233 | chapter = Stellar Nucleosynthesis| pages = 230–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Friedrich Strohmeyer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Friedrich Stromeyer]]]]
Cadmium ([[Latin]] ''cadmia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''καδμεία'' meaning &quot;[[calamine]]&quot;, a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was named after the Greek mythological character, Κάδμος [[Cadmus]], the founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] simultaneously in 1817 by [[Friedrich Stromeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Annalen der Physik|year = 1818|pages = 113|volume = 59|title = Noch ein schreiben über das neue Metall(Another letter about the new metal)|author = Hermann|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k150680/f125.chemindefer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann]], both in [[Germany]], as an impurity in zinc carbonate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]] (calamine), and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, since the metal was found in this zinc compound. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and reduction of the [[cadmium sulfide|sulfide]]. Even though cadmium and its compounds may be toxic in certain forms and concentrations, the [[British Pharmaceutical Codex]] from 1907 states that [[cadmium iodide]] was used as a [[medication]] to treat &quot;enlarged joints, scrofulous glands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=PmohO5jV2YsC|pages = 159|title = Medical Lexicon: A Dictionary of Medical Science|first = Robley|last = Dunglison|authorlink=Robley Dunglison|publisher = Henry C. Lea|year = 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chilblains&quot;.

In 1927, the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|International Conference on Weights and Measures]] redefined the [[meter]] in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = On the new determination of the meter|journal = Measurement Techniques|volume = 1|issue = 3|year = 1958|doi = 10.1007/BF00974680|pages = 259–264|first= G. D.|last = Burdun|url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/tk70442064438147/fulltext.pdf?page=1|format = pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has since been changed (see [[krypton]]).

After the industrial scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s the major application was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In 1944, 62% and in 1956 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;YB1956&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/EcoNatRes/EcoNatRes-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=EcoNatRes.MinYB1956v1.p0289&amp;id=EcoNatRes.MinYB1956v1&amp;isize=XL&amp;q1=cadmium|title = Minerals Yearbook 1956: Cadmium|first = Arnold M.|last = Lansche|accessdate = 2008-04-21|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second application was red, orange and yellow pigments based on sulfides and selenides of cadmium. In 1956, 24% of the cadmium used within the United States was used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;YB1956&quot;/&gt; The stabilizing effect of cadmium-containing chemicals (carboxylates such as the laureate and the stearate) on PVC led to a increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The use of cadmium in applications such as pigments, coatings, stabilizers and alloys declined due to environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2006, only 7% of total cadmium consumption was used for plating and coating and only 10% was used for pigments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
The decrease in consumption in other applications was made up by a growing demand of cadmium in nickel-cadmium batteries, which accounted for 81% of the cadmium consumption in the United States in 2006.&lt;!-- The overall consumption of cadmium has decreased by more than 90% from the 1970s till 2008.--&gt;&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cadmium/|title=USGS Commodity Report cadmium|accessdate = 2009-08-08|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[Image:CadmiumMetalUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|Cadmium metal]]
{{category see also|Cadmium minerals}}
Cadmium-containing ores are rare and are found to occur in small quantities. However, traces do naturally occur in phosphate, and have been shown to transmit in food through fertilizer application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume = 84|issue = 8|pages =777–785|title = Effects of phosphorus and zinc fertilizer on cadmium uptake and distribution in flax and durum wheat|first = You|last = Jiao|doi = 10.1002/jsfa.1648|year = 2004|last2 = Grant|first2 = Cynthia A.|last3 = Bailey|first3 = Loraine D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenockite]] (Cd[[sulfur|S]]), the only cadmium [[mineral]] of importance, is nearly always associated with [[sphalerite]] (ZnS). As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, [[lead]] and [[copper]]. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling [[iron]] and [[steel]] scrap. Production in the United States began in 1907, but it was not until after [[World War I]] that cadmium came into wide use.&lt;ref name=&quot;price&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cadmium/140798.pdf | title = Annual Average Cadmium Price | first = Jozef | last = Plachy | publisher = USGS| accessdate = 2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lifecycle&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2003.12.001 | title = Life cycle impact analysis of cadmium in CdTe PV production | year = 2004 | last1 = Fthenakis | first1 = V | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume = 8 | pages = 303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Batteries===
[[Image:NiCd various.jpg|thumb|Ni-Cd batteries]]
In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], predominantly in [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]]. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. The cell consists of a positive [[nickel hydroxide]] [[electrode]] and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an [[alkaline]] [[electrolyte]] ([[potassium hydroxide]]). The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in 2004 with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0.002%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20060628BRI09328+FULL-TEXT+DOC+XML+V0//EN|title=Battery collection; recycling, nature protected |publisher=[[European Union]]|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition). In addition, titanium embrittlement caused by cadmium-plated tool residues resulted in banishment of these tools (along with routine tool testing programs to detect any cadmium contamination) from the A-12/SR-71 and U-2 programs, and subsequent aircraft programs using titanium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/breaking-through-technological-barriers.html|title = CIA - Breaking Through Technological Barriers - Finding The Right Metal (A-12 program)}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Biological role==
Cadmium has no known useful role in higher organisms.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Heavy_metal?topic=49498 ''Heavy metal''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment.] eds E.Monosson &amp; C.Cleveland. Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; A role for cadmium in lower lifeforms has recently been found. A cadmium-dependent [[carbonic anhydrase]] has been found in marine [[diatom]]s. Cadmium performs the same function as zinc in other anhydrases, but the diatoms live in environments with very low zinc concentrations and thus they utilize cadmium to perform functions normally carried out by zinc. The discovery relied on the use of X-ray absorption fluorescence spectroscopy (XAFS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Inhalation of cadmium-containing fumes can result initially in [[metal fume fever]] but may progress to chemical [[pneumonitis]], [[pulmonary edema]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=vgHXTId8rnYC&amp;dq|title = Principles and Methods of Toxicology|first = Andrew Wallace|last = Hayes|publisher = CRC Press|place = Philadelphia|year = 2007|pages = 858–861|isbn=9780849337789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadmium is also an environmental hazard. Human exposures to environmental cadmium are primarily the result of fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; However, there have been a few instances of general population toxicity as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water. In the decades leading up to [[World War II]], Japanese mining operations contaminated the [[Jinzū River]] with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops growing along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consuming the contaminated rice developed [[itai-itai]] disease and renal abnormalities, including [[proteinuria]] and [[glucosuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0773057mw738u05/|title = Environmental cadmium exposure, adverse effects, and preventative measures in Japan|first = Koji|last = Nogawa|journal = Biometals|year = 2004|volume = 17|issue = 5|pages =581–587|doi = 10.1023/B:BIOM.0000045742.81440.9c|pmid = 15688869|last2 = Kobayashi|first2 = E|last3 = Okubo|first3 = Y|last4 = Suwazono|first4 = Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems as long as the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, while cadmium is a major factor in the Itai Itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's [[ROHS|Restriction on Hazardous Substances]] (RoHS) directive, which bans certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Commission Decision of 12 October 2006 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards exemptions for applications of lead and cadmium (notified under document number C(2006) 4790 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:283:0048:0049:EN:PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been research linking exposure to cadmium to lung and prostate cancer. However, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in the scientific community. More recent studies suggest that arsenic rather than cadmium may lead to the increased lung cancer mortality rates. Furthermore, most data regarding the carcinogenicity of cadmium rely on research confounded by the presence of other carcinogenic substances.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. It has been estimated that about 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. The absorption of cadmium from the lungs is much more effective than that from the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled via cigarette smoke may be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.pu.04.050183.002055|journal = Annual Review of Public Health|volume = 4|pmid = 6860444|pages = 367–367|year = 1983|title = Cadmium|first = L.|last = Friberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, smokers have 4-5 times higher blood cadmium concentrations and 2-3 times higher kidney cadmium concentrations than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from [[passive smoking]]. No significant effect on blood cadmium concentrations could be detected in children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health|volume = 24|pages = 11–51|year = 1998|title = Health effects of cadmium exposure—a review of the literature and a risk estimate|first = L.|last = Jarup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox curium}}
'''Curium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|jʊər|i|əm}} {{respell|KEWR|ee-əm}}) is a [[synthetic element|synthetic chemical element]] with the symbol '''Cm''' and [[atomic number]] 96. This [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[transuranic element]] of the [[actinide]] series was named after [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie]]. Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in summer 1944 by the group of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most curium is produced by bombarding [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]] with [[neutron]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s – one [[tonne]] of spent [[nuclear fuel]] contains about 20&amp;nbsp;grams of curium.

Curium is a hard, dense silvery metal with a relatively high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]], it becomes [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits [[valence]] +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] complexes with various organic compounds, but there is no evidence of its incorporation into [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. When introduced into human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver where it promotes [[cancer]].

All known [[isotope]]s of curium are highly radioactive and have a small [[critical mass]] for a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. They predominantly emit  [[alpha radiation|α-particles]], and the heat released in this process can potentially produce electricity in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s. This application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu [[radionuclide]] for power sources in [[artificial pacemaker]]s. It served as the [[alpha radiation|α-source]] in the [[alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]]s installed on the [[Mars Pathfinder|Sojourner]], [[Mars rover|Mars]], [[Mars 96]], [[Mars Exploration Rover|Athena]], [[Spirit rover|Spirit]] and [[Opportunity rover]]s to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and the [[Moon]]. Such a spectrometer will also be used by the [[Philae lander]] of the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] spacecraft to probe the surface of the [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]] [[comet]].

==History==
[[File:Glenn Seaborg 1964.png|thumb|left|upright|Glenn T. Seaborg]]
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|left|upright|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939.]]
Although curium had likely been produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in 1944, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]]. In their experiments, they used a 60-inch [[cyclotron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The New Chemistry: A Showcase for Modern Chemistry and Its Applications|first = Nina|last = Hall|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2000|pages = 8–9|isbn = 9780521452243|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curium was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]) at the [[University of Chicago]]. It was the third [[transuranium element]] to be discovered even though it is the fourth in the series – the lighter element [[americium]] was unknown at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;E96&quot;&gt;Seaborg, G. T.; James, R. A. and Ghiorso, A.: &quot;The New Element Curium (Atomic Number 96)&quot;, NNES PPR ''(National Nuclear Energy Series, Plutonium Project Record)'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;14&amp;nbsp;B, ''The Transuranium Elements: Research Papers'', Paper No.&amp;nbsp;22.2, McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York, 1949; [http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/rd_accomplishments/display_biblio.cgi?id=ACC0049&amp;numPages=13&amp;fp=N Abstract]; [http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0049.pdf Full text (January&amp;nbsp;1948)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrs&quot;/&gt;

The sample was prepared as follows: first [[plutonium]] nitrate solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by [[annealing]]. Following cyclotron irradiation of the oxide, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]] and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The residue was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]], and further separation was carried out by [[ion exchange]] to yield a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that the Berkeley group initially called those elements ''[[wikt:pandemonium|pandemonium]]'' (from Greek for ''all demons'' or ''hell'') and ''[[wikt:delirium|delirium]]'' (from Latin for ''madness'').&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Robert E. [http://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&amp;pg=PA322 The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, ISBN 0313334382 p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pandemonium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|delirium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curium-242 isotope was produced in July–August 1944 by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu with [[alpha radiation|α-particles]] to produce curium with the release of a [[neutron]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239\!\,}_{\ 94}Pu\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{242}_{\ 96}Cm\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n}&lt;/math&gt;

Curium-242 was unambiguously identified by the characteristic energy of the α-particles emitted during the decay:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{242}_{\ 96}Cm\ \longrightarrow \ ^{238}_{\ 94}Pu\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He}&lt;/math&gt;
The [[half-life]] of this [[alpha decay]] was first measured as 150 days and then corrected to 162.8 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

Another isotope &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Cm was produced in a similar reaction in March 1945:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{240}_{\ 96}Cm\ +\ 3\ ^{1}_{0}n}&lt;/math&gt;
The half-life of the &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Cm α-decay was correctly determined as 26.7 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

The discovery of curium, as well as americium, in 1944 was closely related to the [[Manhattan Project]], the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the [[Quiz Kids]], five days before the official presentation at an [[American Chemical Society]] meeting on November 11, 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/americium.html|title = Chemical &amp; Engineering News: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Americium|accessdate = 07-12-2008| first = Rachel Sheremeta|last = Pepling|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of curium (&lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Cm), their production and compounds were later patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, G.

{{double image|left|Marie Curie (Nobel-Chem).png|150|Curie-pierre.jpg|150|Marie and Pierre Curie}}
The new element was named after [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie]] who are noted for discovering [[radium]] and for their work in [[radioactivity]]. It followed the example of [[gadolinium]], a [[lanthanide]] element above curium in the periodic table, which was named after the explorer of the [[rare earth element]]s [[Johan Gadolin]]:&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, p. 1252&lt;/ref&gt;
::''&quot;As the name for the element of atomic number 96 we should like to propose &quot;curium&quot; , with symbol Cm. The evidence indicates that element 96 contains seven 5f electrons and is thus analogous to the element gadolinium with its seven 4f electrons in the regular rare earth series. On this base element 96 is named after the Curies in a manner analogous to the naming of gadolinium, in which the chemist Gadolin was honored.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E96&quot;/&gt;''

The first curium samples were barely visible, and were identified by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and [[Isadore Perlman]] created the first substantial sample of 30&amp;nbsp;µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding [[americium]]-241 with neutrons.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond C.

A synthetic, radioactive element, curium is a hard dense metal with silvery-white appearance and physical and chemical properties resembling those of [[gadolinium]]. Its melting point of 1340 °C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637 °C), plutonium (639 °C) and americium (1173 °C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312 °C. The boiling point of curium is 3110 °C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, [[space group]] P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc, lattice parameters ''a'' = 365 [[picometer|pm]]and ''c'' = 1182 pm, and four [[formula unit]]s per [[unit cell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Milman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milman|first1=V|title=Crystal structures of curium compounds: an ab initio study|journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|volume=322|issue=2–3|page=165|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(03)00321-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal consists of a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packing]] with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum.

Curium has peculiar magnetic properties. Whereas its neighbor element actinium shows no deviation from [[Curie–Weiss law|Curie-Weiss]] [[paramagnetism]] in the entire temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] state upon cooling to 65–52 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanellakopulos|first1=B|title=The magnetic susceptibility of Americium and curium metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=17|issue=6|page=713|year=1975|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(75)90392-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fournier|first1=J|title=Curium: A new magnetic element|journal=Physica B+C|volume=86–88|page=30|year=1977|doi=10.1016/0378-4363(77)90214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and β-Cm exhibits a [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, curium pnictides show [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] transitions upon cooling: &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;CmN and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;CmAs at 109 K,&lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;CmP at 73 K and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;CmSb at 162 K.

In accordance with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There is a significant increase in resistvity over time (about 10 µOhm·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium is similar to that of gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, [[polonium]] and [[thorium]].&lt;ref name=res/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schenkel|first1=R|title=The electrical resistivity of 244Cm metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=23|issue=6|page=389|year=1977|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(77)90239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20 [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]] and 7 [[nuclear isomer]]s between &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cm are known for curium, and no stable [[isotope]]s. The longest half-lives have been reported for &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (15.6 million years) and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (348,000 years). Other long-lived isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (half-life 8500 years), &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (8,300 years) and &lt;sup&gt;246&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (4,760 years). Curium-250 is unusual by that it predominantly (about 86%) decays via [[spontaneous fission]]. The most commonly used curium isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm with the half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G|doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X|title=The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|year=1997|page=1|issue=1|volume=624|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All isotopes between &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, as well as &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, undergo a self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] and thus in principle can act as a [[nuclear fuel]] in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the [[nuclear fission]] cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm. These can be used in [[thermal-neutron reactor]]s, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for[[fast breeder reactor]]s since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burnup increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;irsn&quot;&gt;Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire: [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf &quot;Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety. data and limits for actinides in transport&quot;], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm will create [[californium]]. This is strong [[neutron]] emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the [[minor actinides]] are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

The table to the right lists the [[critical mass]]es for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30&amp;nbsp;cm of steel), the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4&amp;nbsp;kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30&amp;nbsp;cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be as small as 59&amp;nbsp;gram for &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, 155&amp;nbsp;gram for &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 1550&amp;nbsp;gram for &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;246&lt;/sup&gt;Cm were listed as large as 371&amp;nbsp;kg and 70.1&amp;nbsp;kg, respectively, by some research groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;irsn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Okundo, H. and Kawasaki, H. |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/39/10/1072/_pdf |title=Critical and Subcritical Mass Calculations of Curium-243 to −247 Based on JENDL-3.2 for Revision of ANSI/ANS-8.15|journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology|year=2002|volume=39|pages=1072–1085|doi=10.3327/jnst.39.1072|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, curium is not used as a nuclear fuel owing to its low availability and high price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/atg/__2.html § 2 Begriffsbestimmungen (Atomic Energy Act)] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore could be used in portable [[nuclear weapon]]s, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jukka Lehto|author2=Xiaolin Hou|title=Chemistry and Analysis of Radionuclides: Laboratory Techniques and Methodology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v2iRJaO3SMIC&amp;pg=PA303|accessdate=19 April 2011|date=2 February 2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527326587|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occurrence===
[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|Several isotopes of curium were detected in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
The longest-lived isotope of curium, &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, has a half-life of 15.6 million years. Therefore, all [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] curium, that is curium present on the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent [[nuclear fuel]]. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]], which were conducted between 1945 and 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;lenntech&quot;&gt;[http://www.lenntech.de/pse/pse.htm Curium] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; So the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (1 November 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), beside [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[plutonium]] and [[americium]] also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and curium, in particular &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, &lt;sup&gt;246&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and smaller quantities of &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=P.|last2=Studier|first2=M.|last3=Diamond|first3=H.|last4=Mech|first4=J.|last5=Inghram|first5=M.|last6=Pyle|first6=G.|last7=Stevens|first7=C.|last8=Fried|first8=S.|last9=Manning|first9=W.|title=Transplutonium Elements in Thermonuclear Test Debris|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|issue=1|page=180|year=1956|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atmospheric curium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of curium at the sandy soil particles than in water present in the soil pores. An even higher ratio of about 18,000 was measured in [[loam]] soils.&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt;

==Synthesis==
===Isotope preparation===
Curium is produced in small quantities in [[nuclear reactor]]s, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains the high price of curium, which has been be quoted at 160–185 [[United States dollar|USD]] per [[milligram]],&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 170 USD/g for &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm.&lt;ref name=lect/&gt; In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U captures a neutron and converts into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;U, which via [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; decay]] transforms into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Such [[nuclear fusion]] process is used in the [[breeder reactor]]s for producing [[fissile]] material.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{238}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{239}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow [23.5 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 93}Np\ \xrightarrow [2.3565 \ d]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 94}Pu}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;(the times are [[half-life|half-lives]])&lt;/small&gt;.

Further neutron capture followed by β&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;-decay produces the &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am isotope of [[americium]] which further converts into &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {2(n,\gamma)} \ ^{241}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [14.35 \ yr]{\beta^-} \ ^{241}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{242}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [16.02 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{242}_{\ 96}Cm}&lt;/math&gt;.

For research purposes, curium is obtained by irradiating not uranium but plutonium, which is available in large amounts from spent nuclear fuel. Much higher neutron flux is used for the irradiation that results in a different reaction chain and formation of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:&lt;ref name = &quot;Morrs&quot;&gt;Morss, L. R.; Edelstein, N. M. and Fugere, J. (eds): ''The Chemistry of the Actinide Elements and transactinides'', volume 3, Springer-Verlag, Dordrecht 2006, ISBN 1-4020-3555-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {4(n,\gamma)} \ ^{243}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [4,956 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{243}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [10.1 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{244}_{\ 96}Cm}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{244}_{\ 96}Cm\ \xrightarrow [18.11 \ yr]{\alpha} \ ^{240}_{\ 94}Pu}&lt;/math&gt;

Curium-244 decays into &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu by emission of alpha particle, but it also absorbs neutrons resulting in a small amount of heavier curium isotopes. Among those, &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons.&lt;ref name=haire/&gt; Synthesis of &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm via [[neutron absorption]] is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (64 min), which converts by β&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; decay to the [[berkelium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk.&lt;ref name=haire/&gt; 
&lt;!-- Curium-250 is obtained instead from the α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf. For this however, the production rate is low as &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf decays mainly by spontaneous fission, and only slightly by emission of α-particles into &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm.{{cn}} --&gt;

The above cascade of (n,γ) reactions produces a mixture of different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, and therefore a selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 is favored for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the [[californium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, which is available in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50&amp;nbsp;mg of &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.&lt;ref name=haire&gt;{{cite book

Another interesting for research isotope &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm can be obtained from the α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, and the latter isotope is produced in minute quantities from the β&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;-decay of the [[berkelium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk.

Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes as [[oxide]]s, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. [[MOX fuel]]) in [[nitric acid]], and remove the bulk of the uranium and plutonium using a [[PUREX]] ('''P'''lutonium – '''UR'''anium '''EX'''traction) type extraction with [[tributyl phosphate]] in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ([[raffinate]]) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step [[chromatographic]] and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 34–48&lt;/ref&gt;  [[BTBP|''Bis''-triazinyl bipyridine]] complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Magnusson D, Christiansen B, Foreman MRS, Geist A, Glatz JP, Malmbeck R, Modolo G, Serrano-Purroy D and Sorel C|journal = Solvent Extraction and Ion Exchange|year = 2009|volume = 27|issue = 2|page = 97|doi = 10.1080/07366290802672204|title = Demonstration of a SANEX Process in Centrifugal Contactors using the CyMe4-BTBP Molecule on a Genuine Fuel Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous [[sodium bicarbonate]] with [[ozone]] at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic curium is obtained by [[Redox|reduction]] of its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted in the environment free from water and oxygen, in the apparatus made of [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]], using elemental [[barium]] or [[lithium]] as reducing agents.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Morrs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;CM_METALL&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cunning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=B.B.|last2=Wallmann|first2=J.C.|title=Crystal structure and melting point of curium metal|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=26|issue=2|page=271|year=1964|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(64)80069-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=J|last2=Peterson|first2=J|title=Preparation and structural studies of elemental curium-248 and the nitrides of curium-248 and berkelium-249|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=66|issue=2|page=201|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(79)90229-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry'', System No. 71, Volume 7 a, transuranics, Part B 1, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxides===
Curium readily reacts with oxygen forming mostly Cm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxides,&lt;ref name=&quot;lenntech&quot;/&gt; but the divalent oxide CmO is also known.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOWI_1972&quot;&gt;Holleman, p. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Black CmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained by burning curium [[oxalate]] (Cm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrate (Cm(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or hydroxide in pure oxygen.&lt;ref Name=&quot;asprey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=g1268&gt;Greenwood, p. 1268&lt;/ref&gt; Upon heating to 600–650 °C in vacuum (about 0.01 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]), it transforms into the whitish Cm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=&quot;asprey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asprey|first1=L.

Alternatively, Cm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained by reducing CmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with molecular [[hydrogen]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haug|first1=H|title=Curium sesquioxide Cm2O3|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=29|issue=11|page=2753|year=1967|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(67)80014-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, a number of ternary oxides of the type M(II)CmO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are known, where M stays for a divalent metal, such as barium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuger|first1=J|last2=Haire|first2=R|last3=Peterson|first3=J|title=Molar enthalpies of formation of BaCmO3 and BaCfO3|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|volume=200|issue=1–2|page=181|year=1993|doi=10.1016/0925-8388(93)90491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halides===
The colorless curium(III) fluoride (CmF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be produced by introducing fluoride ions into curium(III)-containing solutions. The brown tetravalent curium(IV) fluoride (CmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) on the other hand is only obtained by reacting curium(III) fluoride with molecular [[fluorine]]:&lt;ref name = &quot;Morrs&quot;/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2\ CmF_3\ +\ F_2\ \longrightarrow\ 2\ CmF_4}&lt;/math&gt;

A series of ternary fluorides are known of the form A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Cm&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;, where A stands for [[alkali metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keenan|first1=T|title=Lattice constants of K7Cm6F31 trends in the 1:1 and 7:6 alkali metal-actinide(IV) series|journal=Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry Letters|volume=3|issue=10|page=391|year=1967|doi=10.1016/0020-1650(67)80092-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colorless [[curium(III) chloride]] (CmCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is produced in the reaction of [[curium(III) hydroxide]] (Cm(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with anhydrous [[hydrogen chloride]] gas. It can further be converted into other halides, such as curium(III) bromide (colorless to light green) and curium(III) iodide (colorless), by reacting it with the [[ammonia]] salt of the corresponding halide at elevated temperature of about 400–450 °C:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asprey|first1=L.
