==Colours, crest, mascot &amp; anthem==
[[Image:Scrumpy.jpg|thumb|Scrumpy, Bristol City FC mascot]]

Bristol City have played in red and white since the 1890s, occasionally also including black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Bristol_City/Bristol_City.htm|title=Bristol City|publisher=www.historicalkits.co.uk|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2010–2011 season's kit is made by [[Adidas]] (The 1st year of a 4 year deal).
*The club's crest is a simplified version of the [[coat of arms]] of the city of Bristol.
* The club's mascot is Scrumpy the [[European Robin|Robin]] who has been the club's mascot since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/34517490@N00/2952027137/|title=Bristol City mascot|publisher=flikr|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The club's official anthem is One For The Bristol City by [[The Wurzels]]. First released in 1976, it is the tune the team run out to at home matches. A newly-recorded version of the song reached number 66 in the UK charts in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wurzels/_/One+for+the+Bristol+City|title=One for the Bristol City – The Wurzels|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries==
{{See|Bristol Derby}}
{{See|Severnside Derby}}
{{See|Westcountry Derby}}
Bristol City's traditional and biggest rivals are [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. The clubs have met 105 times, with the first meeting in 1897. Bristol City have the most wins on 43. However, the clubs have not been in the same league for a number of years, and meetings have been inconsistent in the 21st Century. They were last in the same division in the [[2000–01 Football League|2000-01 Season]]. Since then, they have only met twice, in the two-legged southern final of the 2006-07 [[Football League Trophy]].

City's other main rivals are [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], who play in nearby [[Cardiff]]. Desite being a local derby, it crosses the [[Wales-England border]], making it one of the few international derbies in the United Kingdom. Both clubs have been at similar levels over the past 10 years, except between 2003 and 2007 when Cardiff were a division above. This has meant frequent meetings in the league including in the semi-finals of the [[Football League One play-offs#2003|2003 Second Division play-offs]]. Both clubs are currently in the championship. with Bristol City winning their most recent encounter 3-0 at Ashton Gate on New Year's Day 2011.

Other clubs have been seen as 'third rivals' by the fans and media. [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] are seen by many as rivals, being nicknamed 'Swindle' by City fans. [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] have also been considered rivals despite a distance of over 100 miles. The rivalry has developed in recent years as the two clubs were the highest ranking [[West Country]] clubs for a number of years, and meetings were seen as a decider of the 'Best in the west'. [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]] and even [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] have previously been mentioned as rivals, but very rarely.

==Stadium==
{{Main|Ashton Gate stadium}}

Bristol City play at [[Ashton Gate stadium|Ashton Gate]] in the south-west of Bristol, just south of the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]]. The ground has an all-seated capacity of about 21,500, with an effective capacity (depending on how many away tickets are allocated, and how they are segregated) of around 19,100. It was the home of Bedminster F.C. until the 1900 merger, and the merged team played some games there the following season, but it did not become the permanent home of Bristol City until 1904.

In the past plans were considered for expansion work to be carried out at Ashton Gate. There were also proposals to build a new 36,000-seat stadium at [[Hengrove|Hengrove Park]]. This was turned down in a local referendum in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/committee/2001/ua/ua000/0126_4.pdf |title=Hengrove Park- Football Stadium Referendum December 2000 |work=Bristol City Council |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the local council was looking at possible sites for a new 40,000-seat stadium which would house both City, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Rovers]] and [[Bristol Rugby]], but these plans were scrapped and it is widely accepted that this would not have been welcomed by the majority of supporters from all clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2519157.stm |date=2002-11-27 |title=Bristol super-stadium plan collapses |work=BBC |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashton Gate's current capacity is an average size for [[Football League Championship|Championship]] grounds, however in November 2007 the club announced plans to relocate to a new 30,000 capacity [[Bristol City Stadium|stadium]] in [[Ashton Vale]] with the option of expanding to 42,000 should it be considered for World Cup football in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~1178896,00.html|title=Bristol City Announce New Stadium|publisher=www.bcfc.co.uk|date=2007-11-29|accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/AshtonValeIndex/0,,10327,00.html|title=New Stadium at Ashton Vale|publisher=www.bcfc.co.uk|date=2008-11-29|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as football, Ashton Gate has played host to many big music concerts in recent years, including those of [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Elton John]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[The Who]], [[Ronan Keating]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Westlife]].

==Bristol City Women's FC==
The women's team was formed in 1990 supported by the club's community officer. Their greatest achievement was reaching the semi-finals of the [[FA Women's Cup]] in 1994 and winning promotion to the [[FA Women's Premier League National Division|Premier League]] in 2004. Following the decision by the FA to fund only one centre of excellence in Bristol, the two senior teams were disbanded in June 2008 and the girls youth side merged with the [[Bristol Academy W.F.C.|Bristol Academy for girls at Filton College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~1035029,00.html|title=WOMEN'S TEAM TO FOLD|publisher=BCFC|date=2008-06-19|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the senior players, with coach Wayne Roberts, moved to the University of Bath in summer 2008 and now play as AFC TeamBath Ladies in the [[South West Combination Women's Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teambath.com/?p=3523|title=Bristol City Ladies to get new lease of life at TeamBath|publisher=Team Bath|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioterrorism''' is [[terrorism]] involving the intentional release or dissemination of [[biological agent]]s. These agents are ([[bacteria]], [[viruses]], or [[toxin]]s), and may be in a naturally-occurring or a human-modified form. For the use of this method in [[war]]fare, see [[biological warfare]].

==Definition==
According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC):
{{quote|A ''bioterrorism attack'' 

is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, toxins or other harmful agents used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or in food. Terrorists tend to use biological agents because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, cannot.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDCBioterrorismOverview&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Bioterrorism Overview|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/bioterrorism/overview.asp|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2008-02-12|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bioterrorism is an attractive weapon because biological agents are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain, can be easily disseminated, and can cause widespread fear and panic beyond the actual physical damage they can cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medmicro.wisc.edu/undergraduate/courses/554/ppt/BT-PHproblem081030.ppt#332,5,Advantages of Biologics as Weapons Bioterrorism: A Threat to National Security or Public Health Defining Issue? MM&amp;I 554 University of Wisconsin–Madison and Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, September 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Military leaders, however, have learned that, as a military asset, bioterrorism has some important limitations; it is difficult to employ a bioweapon in a way that only the enemy is affected and not friendly forces. A biological weapon is useful to [[terrorists]] mainly as a method of creating mass panic and disruption to a state or a country. However, technologists such as Bill Joy have warned of the potential power which genetic engineering might place in the hands of future bio-terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Joy|first=Bill|title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us: How 21st Century Technologies Threaten to Make Humans an Endangered Species|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2007-03-31|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0553528350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of agents that do not cause harm to humans but disrupt the [[economy]] have been discussed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} A highly relevant pathogen in this context is the [[foot-and-mouth disease]] (FMD) virus, which is capable of causing widespread economic damage and public concern (as witnessed in the 2001 and 2007 FMD outbreaks in the UK), whilst having almost no capacity to infect humans.

==History==
===Early use===

Biological terrorism dates as far back as [[Roman civilization|Ancient Rome]], when faeces were thrown into faces of enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Block|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early version of biological terrorism continued on into the 14th century where the bubonic plague was used to infiltrate enemy cities,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} both by instilling the fear of infection in residences, in hopes that they would evacuate, and also to destroy defending forces that would not yield to the attack. The use of disease as a weapon in this stage of history exhibited a lack of control aggressors had over their own biological weapons. Primitive medical technology provided limited means of protection for the aggressor and a battle's surrounding geographical regions. After the battle was won, the inability to contain enemies who escaped death led to widespread epidemics affecting not only the enemy forces, but also surrounding regions' inhabitants. Due to the use of these biological weapons, and the apparent lack of medical advancement necessary to defend surrounding regions from them, widespread epidemics such as the [[bubonic plague]] quickly moved across all of Europe, destroying a large portion of its population. The victims of biological terrorism in fact became weapons themselves. This was noted in the Middle Ages, but medical advancements had not progressed far enough to prevent the consequences of a weapons use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eitzen|Takafuji|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, [[Biological warfare#History|biological warfare]] became more complex. Countries began to develop weapons which were much more effective, and much less likely to cause infection to the wrong party. One significant enhancement in biological weapon development was the first use of [[anthrax]]. Anthrax effectiveness was initially limited to victims of large dosages. This became a weapon of choice because it is easily transferred, has a high mortality rate, and could be easily obtained. Also, variants of the anthrax bacterium can be found all around the world making it the biological weapon of choice in the early 19th century. Another property of anthrax that helped fuel its use as a biological weapon is its poor ability to spread far beyond the targeted population. Anthrax could not be spread from person to person.

===Twentieth Century===
By the time [[World War I]] began, attempts to use [[anthrax]] were directed at animal populations. This generally proved to be ineffective. Shortly after the start of World War I, Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in the United States, Russia, Romania, and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;GregoryBWaggDMilitaryMedicine&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Gregory|first=B|coauthors=Waag, D.|title=Military Medicine: Medical aspects of biological warfare|url=http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/biological_warfare/BW-ch06.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-22|year=1997|publisher=Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army|id=Library of Congress 97-22242}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[Anton Dilger]] lived in Germany, but in 1915 he was sent to the United States carrying cultures of [[glanders]], a virulent disease of horses and mules. Dilger set up a laboratory in his home in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]]. He used [[stevedore]]s working the docks in Baltimore to infect horses with [[glanders]] while they were waiting to be shipped to Britain. Dilger was under suspicion as being a German agent, but was never arrested. Dilger eventually fled to Madrid, Spain, where he died during the Influenza Pandemic of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Experts Q &amp; A|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weapon/sfeature/qa.html|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2006-12-15|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the Russians arrested a German agent with similar intentions. Germany and its allies infected French cavalry horses and many of Russia’s mules and horses on the Eastern Front. These actions hindered artillery and troop movements, as well as supply convoys.&lt;ref name=&quot;GregoryBWaggDMilitaryMedicine&quot; /&gt;

American biological weapon development began in 1942. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] placed [[George W. Merck]] in charge of the effort to create a development program.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott, S.L., and Hagerman, Edward, World War Two Origins, Chapter 2, in The United States and Biological Warfare, Indiana University Press, 1998 ISBN 0-253-33472-1, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; These programs continued until 1969, when by executive order President [[Richard Nixon]] shut down all programs related to American offensive use of biological weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;GregoryBWaggDMilitaryMedicine&quot; /&gt;

US President [[Richard M. Nixon]] announced his new policy on biological warfare at a press conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on November 25, 1969. “Biological weapons have massive, unpredictable, and potentially uncontrollable consequences,” he declared. “They may produce global epidemics and impair the health of future generations.” He then stated the in recognition of these dangers, the United States had decided to destroy its entire stockpile of biological agents and confine its future biological research program to defensive measures, such as vaccines and field detectors.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Jonathan B. and Mahan, Erin R., President Nixon’s Decision to Renounce the U.S. Offensive Biological Weapons Program, National Defense University Press, Washington, D.C., October 2009, available at http://www.ndu.edu/WMDCenter/docUploaded/cswmd-cs1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1970s passed, global efforts to prevent the development of biological weapons and their use were widespread. 

On August 10, 1972, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] formally transmitted the Biological Weapons Convention to the United States Senate for ratification. In his transmittal, he states: &quot;I am transmitting herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons, and on their Destruction, opened for signature at Washington, London and Moscow on April 10, 1972. The text of this Convention is the result of some three years of intensive debate and negotiation at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva and at the United Nations. It provides that the Parties undertake not to develop, produce, stockpile, acquire or retain biological agents or toxins, of types and in quantities that have no justification for peaceful purposes, as well as weapons, equipment and means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Woolley, John T. and Peters, Gerhard, The American Presidency Project [online], Santa Barbara, CA. Available from World Wide Web at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3523&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 police in [[Chicago]] arrested two college students, Allen Schwander and Stephen Pera, who had planned to poison the city's water supply with [[typhoid]] and other bacteria. Schwander had founded a terrorist group, &quot;[[R.I.S.E.]]&quot;, while Pera collected and grew cultures from the hospital where he worked. The two men fled to [[Cuba]] after being released on bail. Schwander died of natural causes in 1974, while Pera returned to the U.S. in 1975 and was put on probation.&lt;ref&gt;W. Seth Carus, &quot;R.I.S.E.&quot;, in ''Toxic Terror: Assessing Terrorist Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons'' (MIT Press, 2000), p55, p69&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, efforts to use biological warfare has been more apparent in small radical organizations attempting to create fear in the eyes of large groups. Some efforts have been partially effective in creating fear, due to the lack of visibility associated with modern biological weapon use by small organizations.
;[[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack|1984 - USA - Rajneeshee bioterror attack]]: In [[Oregon]] in 1984, followers of the [[Rajneesh|Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] attempted to control a local [[election]] by incapacitating the local population. This was done by infecting [[salad]] bars in 11 restaurants, produce in grocery stores, doorknobs, and other public domains with ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' bacteria in the city of [[The Dalles]], [[Oregon]]. The attack infected 751 people with severe [[food poisoning]]. However, there were no fatalities. This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medmicro.wisc.edu/undergraduate/courses/554/ppt/BT-PHproblem081030.ppt#363,15, Past U.S. Incidents of                Food Bioterrorism Bioterrorism: A Threat to National Security or Public Health Defining Issue, University of Wisconsin–Madison and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, MM&amp;I 554, September 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

; 1993 - Japan - [[Aum Shinrikyo]] anthrax release in Kameido : In June 1993 the religious group [[Aum Shinrikyo]] released anthrax in Tokyo. Eyewitnesses reported a foul odor. The attack was a total failure, infecting not a single person. The reason for this, ironically, is that the group used the vaccine strain of the bacterium. The spores recovered from the attack showed that they were identical to an anthrax vaccine strain given to animals at the time. These vaccine strains are missing the genes that cause a symptomatic response. &lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdc.com/ncidod/EID/vol10no1/03-0238.htm, CDC-'''Bacillus anthracis''' Incident, Kameido, Tokyo, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[2001 anthrax attacks|2001 - USA - Anthrax Attacks]] : In September and October 2001, several cases of anthrax broke out in the [[United States]] in the 2001 anthrax attacks, caused deliberately. Letters laced with infectious anthrax were delivered to news media offices and the U.S Congress. The letters killed 5. Tests on the anthrax strain used in the attack pointed to a domestic source, possibly from the biological weapons program. Still the attacks provoked efforts to define [[biodefense]] and [[biosecurity]], where more limited definitions of [[biosafety]] had focused on unintentional or accidental impacts of agricultural and medical technologies.

==Types of agents==
Under current [[United States law]], [[bio-agents]] which have been declared by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] or the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] to have the &quot;potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety&quot; are officially defined as &quot;[[select agents]]&quot;. The CDC categorizes these agents (A, B or C) and administers the [[Select Agent Program]], which regulates the laboratories which may possess, use, or transfer select agents within the United States.

===Category A===
These high-priority agents pose a risk to national security, can be easily transmitted and disseminated, result in high mortality, have potential major public health impact, may cause public panic, or require special action for public health preparedness.

; [[Tularemia]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/ CDC Tularemia]&lt;/ref&gt; Tularemia, or rabbit fever, has a very low fatality rate if treated, but can severely incapacitate. The disease is caused by the ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' bacterium, and can be contracted through contact with the [[fur]], inhalation, ingestion of contaminated water or insect bites. Francisella tularensis is very infectious. A small number (10-50 or so organisms) can cause disease. If F. tularensis were used as a weapon, the bacteria would likely be made airborne for exposure by inhalation. People who inhale an infectious aerosol would generally experience severe respiratory illness, including life-threatening pneumonia and systemic infection, if they are not treated. The bacteria that cause tularemia occur widely in nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory, although manufacturing an effective aerosol weapon would require considerable sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/facts.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Anthrax disease|Anthrax]] : Anthrax is a non-contagious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium ''Bacillus anthracis''. An [[anthrax vaccines|anthrax vaccine]] does exist but requires many injections for stable use. When discovered early anthrax can be cured by administering [[antibiotic]]s (such as [[ciprofloxacin]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/596063?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov Vietri N. J. et al, A Short Course of Antibiotic Treatment Is Effective in Preventing Death from Experimental Inhalational Anthrax after Discontinuing Antibiotics, The Journal of Infectious Diseases 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Its first modern incidence in biological warfare were when Scandinavian &quot;freedom fighters&quot; supplied by the German General Staff used anthrax with unknown results against the Imperial Russian Army in Finland in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Bisher, Jamie, &quot;During World War I, Terrorists Schemed to Use Anthrax in the Cause of Finnish Independence,&quot; Military History, August 2003, pp. 17-22.[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027151654/http://geocities.com/jamie_bisher/anthrax.htm Anthrax Sabotage in Finland]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the [[Aum Shinrikyo]] used anthrax in an unsuccessful attempt in Tokyo with zero fatalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Anthrax was used in a [[2001 anthrax attack|series of attacks]] on the offices of several United States Senators in late 2001. The anthrax was in a powder form and it was delivered by the mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol8no10/02-0330.htm Puneet K. Dewan, Alicia M. Fry, Kayla Laserson, et al Inhalational Anthrax Outbreak among Postal Workers, Washington, D.C., 2001 Emerging Infectious Diseases, Vol 8, No 10, October 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax is one of the few biological agents that federal employees have been vaccinated for. The strain used in the 2001 anthrax attack was identical to the strain used by the [[USAMRIID]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2265 New Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Smallpox]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/ CDC Smallpox]&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox is a highly contagious [[virus]]. It is transmitted easily through the atmosphere and has a high [[mortality rate]] (20-40%). Smallpox was [[smallpox#Eradication|eradicated]] in the world in the 1970s, thanks to a worldwide vaccination program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/prep/cdc-prep.asp What CDC Is Doing to Protect the Public From Smallpox]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some virus samples are still available in [[Russia]]n and [[United States|America]]n laboratories. Some believe that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, cultures of smallpox have become available in other countries. Although people born pre-1970 will have been vaccinated for smallpox under the WHO program, the effectiveness of vaccination is limited since the vaccine provides high level of immunity for only 3 to 5 years. Revaccination's protection lasts longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallpox.mil/messageMap/messageMapAll.asp?cID=57 Military Vaccination Program website]&lt;/ref&gt; As a biological weapon smallpox is dangerous because of the highly contagious nature of both the infected and their pox. Also, the infrequency with which vaccines are administered among the general population since the eradication of the disease would leave most people unprotected in the event of an outbreak. Smallpox occurs only in humans, and has no external hosts or vectors.
; [[Botulinum toxin]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/botulism/ CDC Botulism]&lt;/ref&gt; Botulinum toxin is one of the deadliest toxins known, and is produced by the bacterium ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''. Botulism causes death by [[respiratory failure]] and [[paralysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/botulism/factsheet.asp CDC Botulism Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the toxin is readily available worldwide due to its cosmetic applications in injections.
; [[Bubonic plague]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/plague/ CDC Plague]&lt;/ref&gt; Plague is a disease caused by the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' bacterium. Rodents are the normal host of plague, and the disease is transmitted to humans by [[flea]] bites and occasionally by [[aerosol]] in the form of [[pneumonic plague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/index.htm CDC Plague Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The disease has a history of use in biological warfare dating back many centuries, and is considered a threat due to its ease of culture and ability to remain in circulation among local rodents for a long period of time. The weaponized threat comes mainly in the form of pneumonic plague (infection by inhalation)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/plague/faq.asp Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Plague]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the disease that caused the [[Black Death]] in Medieval Europe.
; [[Viral hemorrhagic fever]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vhf/ CDC VuralHemirrhagic Fevers]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes hemorrhagic fevers caused by the [[Filoviridae]] ([[Marburg virus|Marburg]] and [[Ebola]]), and by the [[Arenaviridae]] (for example the [[Lassa fever]] and the [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]]). Ebola has fatality rates ranging from 50-90%. No cure currently exists, although vaccines are in development. The United States and the erstwhile Soviet Union both investigated the use of Ebola for biological warfare, and the [[Aum Shinrikyo]] group possessed cultures of the virus.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Death from Ebola is commonly due to [[multiple organ failure]] and [[hypovolemic shock]]. Marburg was first discovered in [[Marburg]], Germany. No treatments currently exist aside from supportive care. The arenaviruses have a greatly reduced fatality rate, but a larger presence, chiefly in central [[Africa]] and [[South America]].

===Category C===
Category C agents are emerging [[pathogen]]s that might be [[genetic engineering|engineered]] for mass dissemination because of their availability, ease of production and dissemination, high mortality rate, or ability to cause a major health impact. This category includes viruses such as the [[Nipah virus]] and [[hantavirus]]. [[SARS]] and [[H1N1]] have been potential diseases in this category. 
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}

==Planning and response==
Planning may involve the development of biological identification systems.

Until recently in the [[United States]], most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than ordinary people in cities. Financial cutbacks have limited the tracking of disease outbreaks. Some outbreaks, such as food poisoning due to ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Salmonella]]'', could be of either natural or deliberate origin.

===Preparedness===
Biological agents are relatively easy to obtain by terrorists and are becoming more threatening in the U.S., and laboratories are working on advanced detection systems to provide early warning, identify [[contamination|contaminated areas]] and populations at risk, and to facilitate prompt treatment. Methods for predicting the use of biological agents in urban areas as well as assessing the area for the hazards associated with a biological attack are being established in major cities. In addition, [[forensic]] technologies are working on identifying biological agents, their geographical origins and/or their initial son. Efforts include decontamination technologies to restore facilities without causing additional environmental concerns.

Early detection and rapid response to bioterrorism depend on close cooperation between [[public health]] authorities and law enforcement; however, such cooperation is currently lacking. National detection assets and vaccine stockpiles are not useful if local and state officials do not have access to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bernett|first=Brian C.|title=US Biodefense and Homeland Security: Toward Detection and Attribution|url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-24|year=2006|month=December|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|location=Monteray, California, United States|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosurveillance===
In 1999, the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Center for [[Biomedical]] Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called [[RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance)]]. RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect the a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other systems like it, collect data from sources including clinic data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|coauthors=Espino, Jeremy;''et al.''|title=Healthcare Information Management Systems|url=|accessdate=2009-05-22|edition=3|year=2004|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|pages=513–539|chapter=The role of clinical information systems in public health surveillance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|coauthors=Aryel, Ron;''et al.''|title=Availability and Comparative Value of Data Elements Required for an Effective Bioterrorism Detection System|url=http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2001-11-28|publisher=Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance Laboratory|id=|page=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Michael Wagner, the codirector of the RODS laboratory, and [[Ron Aryel]], a subcontractor, conceived of the idea of obtaining live data feeds from &quot;non-traditional&quot; (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nation-wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems&quot; /&gt;

On February 5, 2002, [[George W. Bush]] visited the RODS laboratory and used it as a model for a [[USD|$]]300 million spending proposal to equip all 50 states with biosurveillance systems. In a speech delivered at the nearby [[Masonic temple]], Bush compared the RODS system to a modern &quot;[[DEW]]&quot; line (referring to the Cold War ballistic missile early warning system).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Togyer|first=Jason|title=Pitt Magazine: Airborne Defense|url=http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/june2002/feature1.html|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2002-06|publisher=University of Pittsburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles and practices of biosurveillance, a new interdisciplinary science, were defined and described in the ''Handbook of Biosurveillance'', edited by Michael Wagner, Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel, and published in 2006. Biosurveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism).

Data which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information. Health-related data such as that from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, electronic [[health record systems]], medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help; researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by [[ranching]] and [[feedlot]] operations, food processors, [[drinking water]] systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData&quot; /&gt; Intuitively, one would expect systems which collect more than one type of data to be more useful than systems which collect only one type of information (such as single-purpose laboratory or 911 call-center based systems), and be less prone to [[false alarms]], and this appears to be the case.

In [[Europe]], disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergency. The system not only monitors infected persons, but attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak.

Researchers are experimenting with devices to detect the existence of a threat:

* Tiny [[integrated circuit|electronic chips]] that would contain living [[neuron|nerve cells]] to warn of the presence of bacterial toxins (identification of broad range toxins)
* [[Fiber-optic]] tubes lined with [[antibody|antibodies]] coupled to light-emitting molecules (identification of specific pathogens, such as anthrax, botulinum, ricin)

New research shows that ultraviolet [[avalanche photodiodes]] offer the high gain, reliability and robustness needed to detect anthrax and other bioterrorism agents in the air. The fabrication methods and device characteristics were described at the 50th Electronic Materials Conference in Santa Barbara on June 25, 2008. Details of the photodiodes were also published in the February 14, 2008 issue of the journal Electronics Letters and the November 2007 issue of the journal IEEE Photonics Technology Letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541788/ Avalanche Photodiodes Target Bioterrorism Agents] Newswise, Retrieved on June 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to bioterrorism incident or threat==
Government agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials/decontamination units and emergency medical units. The US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the [[US Marine Corp]]'s [[Chemical Biological Incident Response Force]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[20th Support Command (CBRNE)]], which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and [[decontamination|decontaminate]] victims exposed to bioterror agents.

The '''Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit''' (also known as the ''Stealth Bomber'') is an [[United States|American]] [[heavy bomber]] with low observable [[stealth aircraft|stealth]] technology designed to [[penetration (warfare)| penetrate]] dense [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defenses]] and deploy both [[conventional weapons|conventional]] and [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] weapons. Because of its considerable [[capital costs|capital]] and [[operating costs| operational costs]], the [[megaproject|project]] was controversial in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and among the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Congress slashed initial plans to purchase 132 bombers to 21.

Manufactured by [[Northrop Grumman]], the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737 million in 1997 dollars (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|737000000|1997|r=2}}}} today).&lt;ref name=Gao&gt;[http://www.fas.org/man/gao/nsiad97181.htm &quot;B-2 Bomber: Cost and Operational Issues Letter Report, 08/14/97, GAO/NSIAD-97-181.&quot;] ''United States General Accounting Office'' (GAO).

Twenty B-2s are operated by the [[United States Air Force]].  Though originally designed in the 1980s for [[Cold War]] operations scenarios, B-2s were first used in combat to drop [[bomb]]s on [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, and saw continued use during the wars in [[Iraq War | Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name = B-2_AF_fact_sheet /&gt;  One aircraft was [[Andersen Air Force Base B-2 accident| lost in 2008]] when it crashed just after takeoff; the crew ejected safely.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfsen, Bruce.

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12813168 &quot;Libya military operation: Who should command?&quot;]. BBC News, 21 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bomber has a crew of two and can drop up to 80 {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}-class [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] [[GPS]]-guided bombs, or 16 {{convert|2400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[B83 nuclear bomb]]s in a single pass through extremely dense [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defenses]]. The B-2 is the only aircraft that can carry large air to surface [[Standoff missile|standoff]] weapons in a stealth configuration. The program has been the subject of [[espionage]] and [[counter-espionage]] activity and the B-2 has provided prominent public spectacles at [[air show]]s since the 1990s.

==Development==
===ATB project===

The B-2 Spirit originated from the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) [[black project]] that began in 1979.&lt;ref name=Pace_p20-27&gt;Pace 1999, pp. 20–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cold War]] was long underway, and on the campaign trail in 1979 and 1980, presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] promised to [[1980 presidential election#Campaign promises|restore American military strength]]. On 22 August 1980, the incumbent [[Carter administration]] publicly disclosed that the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) was working to develop stealth aircraft including the ATB.&lt;ref name=goodall&gt;Goodall 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed publicly in 2007 that [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] scientists helped assess the mission effectiveness of the aircraft under [[Classified information|classified]] contract during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, John M. and James E. Kinnu. [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA464771 &quot;B-2 System Engineering Case Study.&quot;] ''Air Force Center for Systems Engineering'', 31 May 2007. Retrieved: 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the building face is a blue and red rectangular flag. In the foreground is a star shape imposed on the ground]]

After the evaluations of the companies' proposals, the ATB competition was reduced to the [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]]/[[Boeing]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]/[[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] teams with each receiving a study contract for further work.&lt;ref name=Pace_p20-27/&gt; Both teams used flying wing designs.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt; Northrop had previous experience from the development of the [[Northrop YB-35|YB-35]] and [[Northrop YB-49|YB-49]] flying wing aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Donald 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Northrop design was larger while the Lockheed design included a small tail.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;Rich, Ben and Leo Janos. ''Skunk Works''. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company, 1994. ISBN 0-316-74300-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The black project was funded under the code name &quot;Aurora&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt; The Northrop/Boeing team's ATB design was selected over the Lockheed/Rockwell design on 20 October 1981.&lt;ref name=Pace_p20-27/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spick_p339&gt;Spick 2000, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northrop design received the designation B-2 and the name &quot;Spirit&quot;. The bomber's design was changed in the mid-1980s when the mission profile was changed from high-altitude to low-altitude, terrain-following. The redesign delayed the B-2's first flight by two years and added about US$1 billion to the program's cost.&lt;ref name=goodall/&gt; An estimated US$23 billion was secretly spent for [[research and development]] on the B-2 by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Bruce.

The B-2 was first publicly displayed on 22 November 1988, at Air Force [[Plant 42]], [[Palmdale, California]], where it was assembled. This initial viewing was heavily guarded and guests were not allowed to see the rear of the B-2. However, ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|Aviation Week]]'' editors found that there was no ban on overflying the airfield apron/presentation area and, to the chagrin of the USAF, took pictures from above of the aircraft's then-secret planform and suppressed engine exhausts. The B-2's first public flight was on 17 July 1989 from Palmdale.&lt;ref name=Pace_p29-36&gt;Pace 1999, pp. 29–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procurement===

A procurement of 132 aircraft was planned in the mid-1980s, but was later reduced to 75.&lt;ref name=Pace_p75-76&gt;Pace 1999, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, the [[Soviet Union]] had disintegrated, which effectively eliminated the Spirit's primary [[Cold War]] mission. Under budgetary pressures and congressional opposition, in his 1992 [[State of the Union Address]], President [[George H.W. Bush]] announced B-2 production would be limited to 20 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/executive/transcript.asp?cat=current_event&amp;code=bush_admin&amp;year=1992 &quot;President George H.

Retrieved: 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, however, the Clinton administration, though originally committed to ending production of the bombers at 20 aircraft, authorized the conversion of a 21st bomber, a [[prototype]] test model, to Block 30 fully operational status at a cost of nearly $500 million.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Bradley. &quot;US to add one B-2 plane to 20 plane fleet.&quot; ''Washington Post'', 22 March 1996, p. A20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Espionage ===

In 1984 a [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] employee, [[Thomas Patrick Cavanaugh|Thomas Cavanaugh]], was arrested for attempting to sell [[classified information]] to the [[Soviet Union]], which apparently was smuggled out of the [[Pico Rivera, California]] factory.&lt;ref&gt;AP.

Retrieved: 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh was eventually sentenced to life in prison and released under parole in 2001.

[[Noshir Gowadia]], a design engineer who worked on the B-2's propulsion system, was arrested in October 2005 for selling B-2 related classified information to foreign countries. His trial was initially scheduled for 12 February 2008, but he received a [[continuance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070222093416/http://honolulu.fbi.gov/pressrel/2005/goodwin102605.htm &quot;Press Release.&quot;] ''FBI Honolulu.''

===Program costs===
[[File:B-2 spirit bombing.jpg|thumb|In a 1994 [[live fire exercise]] near [[Point Mugu, California]], a B-2 drops forty-seven {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} class [[Mark 82 bomb|Mark 82]] bombs, which is more than half of a B-2's total ordnance payload]]

The program was the subject of public controversy for its costs to American taxpayers. In 1996 the [[General Accounting Office]] disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers &quot;will be, by far, the most costly bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis&quot;, costing over three times as much as the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B]] (US$9.6 million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H ($US6.8 million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance in turn. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours respectively for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's 172&amp;nbsp;ft (52.4&amp;nbsp;m) wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealthy properties, especially its &quot;low-observable&quot; stealthy skins.&lt;ref&gt;Capaccio, Tony. &quot;The B-2's Stealthy Skins Need Tender, Lengthy Care.&quot; ''Defense Week'', 27 May 1997, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?NSIAD-96-192 &quot;Air Force, Options to Retire of Restructure the Force would Reduce Planned Spending, NSIAD-96-192.&quot;] ''US General Accounting Office'', September 1996, pp. 53, 56.

The total &quot;military construction&quot; cost related to the program was projected to be US$553.6 million in 1997 dollars. The cost to procure each B-2 was US$737 million in 1997 dollars, based only on a fleet cost of US$15.48 billion.&lt;ref name=Gao/&gt; The [[procurement]] cost per aircraft as detailed in [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] (GAO) reports, which include spare parts and software support, was $929 million per aircraft in 1997 dollars.&lt;ref name=Gao/&gt;

The total program cost projected through 2004 was US$44.75 billion in 1997 dollars. This includes development, procurement, facilities, construction, and spare parts. The total program cost averaged US$2.13 billion per aircraft.&lt;ref name=Gao/&gt;

=== Opposition ===

In its consideration of the fiscal year 1990 defense budget, the House Armed Services Committee trimmed $800 million from the B-2 [[research and development]] budget, while at the same time staving off a motion to kill the bomber. Opposition in committee and in Congress more largely was broad and bipartisan, with Congressmen [[Ron Dellums]] (D-CA), [[John Kasich]] (R-OH), and [[John G. Rowland]] (R-CT) authorizing the motion to kill the bomber and others in the Senate such as [[Jim Exon]] (D-NE) and [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) also opposing the project.&lt;ref name=Schmitt&gt;Schmitt, Eric.

Retrieved: 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing cost of the B-2 program, and evidence of flaws in the aircraft's ability to elude detection by radar,&lt;ref name=Schmitt/&gt; were among factors that drove opposition. At the peak production period specified in 1989, the schedule called for spending US$7 billion to $8 billion per year in 1989 dollars, something Committee Chair [[Les Aspin]] (D-WI) said &quot;won't fly financially.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sorenson_p168&gt;Sorenson 1995, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Department of Defense accused Northrop of using faulty components in the [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]]. Efforts have also been made to reduce the probability of bird ingestion, which could damage engine fan blades.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Moisture in sensors led to stealth bomber crash, Air Force report says.&quot; ''Kansas City Star'', 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, a number of prominent members of Congress began to oppose the program's expansion, including former Democratic presidential nominee [[John Kerry]], who cast votes against the B-2 in 1989, 1991 and 1992 while a US Senator representing [[Massachusetts]]. By 1992, Republican President [[George H.W. Bush]] called for the cancellation of the B-2 and promised to cut military spending by 30% in the wake of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/zell_millers_attack_on_kerry_a_little.html &quot;Zell Miller's Attack on Kerry: A Little Out Of Date.&quot;] ''FactCheck.org'', 4 October 2004. Retrieved: 26 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1995, on the basis of its 1995 Heavy Bomber Force Study, the DOD determined that additional B-2 procurements would exacerbate efforts to develop and implement long term recapitalization plans for the [[USAF]] bomber force.

In October 1995, former [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[Michael E. Ryan|General Mike Ryan]], and Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[John Shalikashvili]], strongly recommended against Congressional action to fund the purchase of any additional B-2s, arguing that to do so would require unacceptable cuts in existing conventional and nuclear-capable aircraft to pay for the new bombers,&lt;ref&gt;Bender,Brian and John Robinson. &quot;More Stealth Bombers Mean Less Combat Power&quot;. ''Defense Daily'', 5 August 1997, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and because the military had much higher priorities on which to spend its limited procurement dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?NSIAD-96-192 &quot;Air Force, Options to Retire of Restructure the Force would Reduce Planned Spending, NSIAD-96-192&quot;.] ''US General Accounting Office,'' September 1996, p. 70. Retrieved: 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some B-2 advocates argued that procuring twenty additional aircraft would save money because B-2s would be able to deeply penetrate anti-aircraft defenses and use low-cost, short-range attack weapons rather than expensive standoff weapons. However, in 1995, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), and its Director of National Security Analysis, found that additional B-2s would reduce the cost of weapons expended by the bomber force by less than US$2 billion in 1995 dollars during the first two weeks of a conflict, which is when the Air Force envisions bombers would make their greatest contribution. This is a small fraction of the US$26.8 billion (in 1995 dollars) life cycle cost that the CBO projected an additional 20 B-2s would cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?NSIAD-96-192 &quot;Air Force, Options to Retire of Restructure the Force would Reduce Planned Spending, NSIAD-96-192&quot;.] ''US General Accounting Office'', September 1996, p. 72. Retrieved: 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, as [[Ranking Member]] of the [[U.S. House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] and National Security Committee, Congressman [[Ron Dellums]] (D-CA), a long-time opponent of the bomber, cited five independent studies and offered an amendment to that year's defense authorization bill to cap production of the bombers with the existing 21 aircraft. The amendment was narrowly defeated.&lt;ref name=Amendment&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/970623-b2.htm &quot;Debate on Dellums Amendment to 1998 Defense Authorization Act.&quot;] ''fas.org'', 23 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Congress did not approve funding for the purchase of any additional B-2 bombers.

===Upgrades===

A number of upgrade packages were applied to the B-2 during the 21st century. In 2004, Northrop Grumman tested a new alternate high-frequency material (AHFM) for use as a [[radar-absorbent material]] coating for the B-2.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Jim.

[[File:B2 Spirit closeup.JPEG|thumb|The B-2's engines are buried within its wing to conceal the induction fans and minimize their exhaust signature. The crew of two sit side-by-side in the cockpit.]]

The B-2's low-observable, or &quot;[[Stealth aircraft|stealth]]&quot;, characteristics give it the ability to penetrate an enemy's most sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses to attack its most heavily defended targets. The bomber's stealth comes from a combination of reduced acoustic, infrared, visual and radar signatures, making it difficult for opposition defenses to detect, track and engage the aircraft. Many specific aspects of the low-observability process remain classified. The B-2's composite materials, special coatings and [[flying wing]] design, which reduces the number of leading edges, contribute to its stealth characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403300063.html &quot;B-2.&quot;] ''Encyclopedia.com''.

The blending of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and large payload gives the B-2 significant advantages over previous bombers. The U.S. Air Force reports its range as approximately {{convert|6000|nmi|mi km|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=B-2_AF_fact_sheet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spick_p340-1&gt;Spick 2000, pp. 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, its low-observation ability provides the B-2 greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing its range and providing a better field of view for the aircraft's sensors. It combines GPS Aided Targeting System (GATS) with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-aided bombs such as [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] (JDAM). This uses its [[passive electronically scanned array]] [[APQ-181 radar]] to correct GPS errors of targets and gain much better than laser-guided weapon accuracy when &quot;unguided&quot; gravity bombs are equipped with a GPS-aided &quot;smart&quot; guidance tail kit. It can bomb 16 targets in a single pass when equipped with 1,000 or 2,000-pound (450&amp;nbsp;kg or 900&amp;nbsp;kg) bombs, or as many as 80 when carrying {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs.

As with the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] and [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]], the B-2 provides the versatility inherent in manned bombers. Like other bombers, its assigned targets can be canceled or changed while in flight, the particular weapon assigned to a target can be changed, and the timing of attack, or the route to the target can be changed while in flight.

From 1989 to 2004, the [[South Dakota Air and Space Museum]] located on the grounds of [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]] displayed the 10-short-ton (9-[[metric ton|metric-ton]]) &quot;Honda- Stealth&quot;, a 60% scale [[mock-up]] of a stealthy bomber which had been built by North American [[Honda]] in 1988 for an [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfb4.com/HondaStealth.html &quot;Honda- Stealth&quot;] ''wfb4.com.'' Retrieved: 1 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an actual replica of a B-2, the mock-up was close enough to the B-2's design to arouse suspicion that Honda had intercepted classified, [[top secret]] information, as the B-2 project was still officially classified in 1988. Honda donated the model to the museum in 1989, on condition that the model be destroyed if it was ever replaced with a different example. In 2005, when the museum received a B-1 Lancer for display (Ellsworth being a B-1 base), the museum destroyed the mock-up.&lt;ref&gt;Cissell, Bill.

}}
The '''beaver''' ([[genus]] '''''Castor''''') is a primarily [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], large,  [[semi-aquatic]] [[rodent]].  ''Castor'' includes two [[extant taxon|extant]] species, [[North American Beaver]] ''(Castor canadensis)'' (native to [[North America]]) and [[Eurasian Beaver]] ''(Castor fiber)'' ([[Eurasia]]).  Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the [[capybara]]). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline is due to extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because their harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MotW5&quot;&gt;Nowak, Ronald M. 1991. pp.  364–367. ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' Fifth Edition, vol. I. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt;

== General ==
Beavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes (known as &quot;lodges&quot;) in the resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float build materials that are difficult to haul over land.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge.
[[File:Beaverbones.jpg|thumb|300px|A beaver skeleton]]
[[Image:Beaver skeleton.jpg|thumb|300px|A beaver [[skeleton]] on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].]]
They are known for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water. This serves as a warning to beavers in the area.  Once a beaver has sounded the alarm, nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers, and can stay under water for as long as 15 minutes.

Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood of [[quaking aspen]], [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]], [[willow]], [[alder]], [[birch]], [[maple]] and [[cherry]] trees. They also eat sedges, pondweed, and water lilies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/wmh/13_4_7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Beavers do not hibernate, but store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is generally above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often keeps the water from freezing in and around the food pile, providing a location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge.

Fossil remains of beavers are found in the peat and other superficial deposits of Britain and the continent of Europe; while in the [[Pleistocene]] formations of Britain and Siberia, occur remains of a giant extinct beaver, ''[[Trogontherium|Trogontherium cuvieri]]'', representing a genus by itself.

Beavers have webbed hind-feet, and a broad, scaly tail. They have poor eyesight, but keen senses of hearing, smell, and touch.  A beaver's teeth grow continuously so that they will not be worn down by chewing on wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beaversolutions.com/about_beaver_biology.asp |title=Beaver Biology |publisher=Beaver Solutions |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their four incisors are composed of hard orange enamel on the front and a softer [[dentin]] on the back.  The chisel-like ends of incisors are maintained by their self-sharpening wear pattern.

Beavers continue to grow throughout life. Adult specimens weighing over {{convert|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} are not uncommon. Females are as large as or larger than males of the same age, which is uncommon among [[mammal]]s. Beavers live up to 24 years of age in the wild.

== Etymology ==
The word is descended from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] name of the animal, cf. Sanskrit ''babhru's,'' brown, [[Latin|Lat.]] ''fiber,'' [[German language|Ger.]] ''Biber,'' [[Russian language|Russ.]] ''bobr;'' the root ''bhru'' has given &quot;[[brown]]&quot;, and, through [[Romance languages|Romanic]], &quot;[[bronze]]&quot; and &quot;[[burnish]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB11&quot;&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 11th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Species ==
They are the only [[extant taxon|extant]] members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Castoridae]], which contains a single [[genus]], '''''Castor'''''. [[genetics|Genetic]] [[research]] has shown the European and North American beaver populations to be distinct species and that [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization is unlikely. Beavers are closely related to [[squirrel]]s (Sciuridae), agreeing in certain structural peculiarities of the lower jaw and skull. In the Sciuridae the two main bones (tibia and fibula) of the lower half of the leg are quite separate, the tail is round and hairy, and the habitats are arboreal and terrestrial. In the beavers or Castoridae these bones are in close contact at their lower ends, the tail is depressed, expanded and scaly, and their habitats are aquatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB11&quot; /&gt;

[[File:beaver tracks.jpg|thumb|400px|North American beaver tracks]]
Although superficially similar to each other, there are several important differences between the two species. Eurasian beavers tend to be bigger, with larger, less rounded heads, longer, narrower muzzles, thinner, shorter and lighter underfur, narrower, less oval-shaped tails and shorter shin bones, making them less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. Eurasian beavers have longer nasal bones than their North American cousins, with the widest point being at the end of the snout for the fomer, and in the middle for the latter. The nasal opening for the Eurasian species is triangular, unlike that of the North American race which is square. The ''[[foramen magnum]]'' is rounded in the Eurasian beaver, and triangular in the North American. The [[anal gland]]s of the Eurasian beaver are larger and thin-walled with a large internal volume compared to that of the North American breed. Finally, the guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have a longer hollow medulla at their tips. Fur colour is also different. Overall, 66% of Eurasian beavers have pale brown or beige fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown and only 4% have blackish coats. In North American beavers,50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown and 6% are blackish.&lt;ref name=&quot;andy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Kitchener, Andrew |url= |title=Beavers |year=2001 |isbn=1-873580-55-X |page=144 |publisher=Whittet |location=Stowmarket }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 [[chromosomes]], while Eurasian beavers have 48. Also, more than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in one stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.&lt;ref name=&quot;andy&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Beaver pho34.jpg|thumb|A European Beaver]]
The Eurasian Beaver (''Castor fiber'') was nearly hunted to [[extinction]] in Europe, both for fur and for ''[[castoreum]]'', a secretion of its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties. However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. Several thousand live on the [[Elbe]], the [[Rhone River|Rhone]] and in parts of [[Scandinavia]]. A thriving community lives in northeast [[Poland]], and the Eurasian Beaver also returned to the [[Morava River]] banks in [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]].

=== North American Beaver ===
{{Main|North American Beaver}}
[[File:Castor canadensis.jpg|thumb|A North American Beaver]]
The North American Beaver ''(Castor canadensis)'', also called the Canadian Beaver (which is also the name of a subspecies), American Beaver, or simply Beaver in North America, is native to Canada, much of the United States and parts of northern Mexico. The chief feature distinguishing ''C. canadensis'' from '' C. fiber'' is the form of the nasal bones of the skull.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB11&quot; /&gt;  This species was introduced to the Argentine and Chilean Tierra del Fuego, as well as Finland, France, Poland and Russia.

The North American beaver's preferred food is the water-lily (''[[Nuphar luteum]]''), which bears a resemblance to a cabbage-stalk, and grows at the bottom of lakes and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beaversww.org/beaver.html |title=The Beaver (Castor canadensis) |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-05-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430104013/http://www.beaversww.org/beaver.html |archivedate = 2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beavers also gnaw the bark of [[birch]], [[poplar]], and [[willow]] trees; but during the summer a more varied herbage, with the addition of berries, is consumed.
These animals are often trapped for their fur. During the early 19th century, trapping eliminated this animal from large portions of its original range. However, through trap and transfer and habitat conservation it made a nearly complete recovery by the 1940s. Beaver reintroduction in British Columbia was facilitated by Eric Collier as recounted in his book ''Three Against the Wilderness.''  Beaver furs were used to make clothing and top-hats. Much of the early exploration of North America was driven by the quest for this animal's fur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountainsofstone.com/oregon_country.htm Manifest Destiny: The Oregon Country and Westward Expansion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Habitat ==
[[File:BeaverSwimming.JPG|thumb|right|Beaver swimming]]
The habitat of the beaver is the [[riparian zone]], inclusive of stream bed. The actions of beavers for hundreds of thousands of years in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] have kept these watery systems healthy and in good repair, although a human observing all the downed trees might think that the beavers were doing just the opposite.

The beaver works as a [[keystone species]] in an [[ecosystem]] by creating [[wetlands]] that are used by many other species. Next to humans, no other extant animal appears to do more to shape its landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Beaver. In ''Animals''. Retrieved June 15, 2009, from http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/beaver.html (beavers second only to humans in their ability to manipulate and change their environment)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beavers fell trees for several reasons. They fell large mature trees, usually in strategic locations, to form the basis of a dam, but European beavers tend to use small diameter (&lt;10&amp;nbsp;cm) trees for this purpose. Beavers fell small trees, especially young second-growth trees, for food. Broadleaved trees re-grow as a [[coppice]], providing easy-to-reach stems and leaves for food in subsequent years. Ponds created by beavers can also kill some tree species by drowning but this creates standing dead wood, which is very important for a wide range of animals and plants.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Dams ===
{{Main|Beaver dam}}
[[File:Beaver signs.JPG|thumb|left|These trees, up to {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, were felled by beavers in one night.]]
Beaver dams are created as a protection against predators, such as coyotes, wolves and bears, and to provide easy access to food during winter. Beavers always work at night and are prolific builders, carrying mud and stones with their fore-paws and timber between their teeth. Because of this, destroying a beaver dam without removing the beavers is difficult, especially if the dam is downstream of an active lodge. Beavers can rebuild such primary dams overnight, though they may not defend secondary dams as vigorously. (Beavers may create a series of dams along a river.)

==== Lodges ==== &lt;!-- This is a section-redirect for [[Beaver lodge]] --&gt;
[[File:Beaverlodge.JPG|thumb|Beaver lodge, approx. {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter. [[Ontario, Canada]]]]

The ponds created by well-maintained dams help isolate the beavers' homes, their ''lodges'', which are created from severed branches and mud. The beavers cover their lodges late every autumn with fresh mud, which freezes when the frost sets in. The mud becomes almost as hard as stone, and neither [[Gray Wolf|wolves]] nor [[wolverine]]s can penetrate it.

The lodge has underwater entrances to make entry nearly impossible for any other animal (however, [[muskrats]] have been seen living inside beaver lodges with the beavers who made them).&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Mammals'' Episode 4, &quot;Chisellers&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  A very small amount of the lodge is actually used as a living area. Contrary to popular belief, beavers actually dig out their dens with underwater entrances after they finish building the dams and lodge structures. There are typically two dens within the lodge, one for drying off after exiting the water, and another, drier one where the family actually lives.
[[File:Beaver lodge.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of lodge]]
Beaver houses are formed of the same materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure, and seldom contain more than four adult and six or eight young beavers. Some of the larger houses have one or more partitions, but these are only posts of the main building left by the builders to support the roof, for the apartments usually have no communication with each other except by water.

When the ice breaks up in spring beavers always leave their embankments and rove about until just before fall, when they return to their old habitations and lay in their winter stock of wood. They seldom begin to repair the houses until the frost sets in, and never finish the outer coating until the cold becomes severe. When they erect a new habitation they fell the wood early in summer, but seldom begin building until nearly the end of August.

===Water Quality and Beaver===
Beaver ponds, and the wetlands that succeed them, remove sediments and pollutants from waterways, including total suspended solids, total nitrogen, phosphates, carbon and silicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Beaver pond biogeochemical effects in the Maryland Coastal Plain |journal=Biogeochemistry |date=2000-06 |pages=217–239 |jstor=1469618 |author=David L.

The term ‘beaver fever’ is a misnomer coined by the American press in the 1970s, following findings that the parasite [[Giardia lamblia]], which causes [[Giardiasis]], is carried by beavers. However, further research has shown that the many animals and birds carry this parasite, and the major source of water contamination is by other humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reintroducing the European Beaver in Britain |journal=British Wildlife |year=2008 |url=http://www.beaversinengland.com/downloads/ReintroducingtheEuropeanBeaverinBritain.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-05 |author=Martin Gaywood, Dave Batty, Colin Galbraith }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Waterborne giardiasis: sources of Giardia cysts and evidence pertaining to their implication in human infection in P.

=== Invasiveness ===
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|Beaver dam in [[Tierra del Fuego]]]]
Beavers often modify their natural environment by building dams, and are therefore considered as pests or [[invasive species]] in some places. For example, in the 1940s, beavers were brought to the island and province of [[Tierra Del Fuego]] in southern [[Argentina]] for commercial fur production. However, the project failed and a few pairs of beavers were released into the wild. They quickly spread throughout the island, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. As the habitat is not adapted to withstand the impact of beavers (e.g., unlike in the Northern Hemisphere, trees native to Tierra del Fuego do not [[coppice]]), beavers have had a detrimental impact. They are now considered a serious invasive species on the island, due to their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made for their eradication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/NATURE/9907/09/argentina.beaver/ |title=Argentina eager to rid island of beavers|publisher=CNN|date=1999-07-09 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chicago]], several beavers have returned and made a home near the [[Lincoln Park]]'s North Pond. The &quot;[[Lincoln Park Beaver]]&quot; has not been as well received by the [[Chicago Park District]] and the [[Lincoln Park]] Conservancy, which was concerned over damage to trees in the area.

==Social behavior==
===Family life===
[[File:Beaver 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A beaver pair]]
The basic social units of beaver social organization are families consisting of an adult male and adult female in a monogamous pair and their kits and yearlings.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;&gt;Sun, Lixing, and Dietland Muller-Schwarze. ''The Beaver: Natural History of a Wetland Engineer''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press/Comstock Publishing Associates, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Beaver families can have as many as ten members in addition to the monogamous pair. Groups this size or close to this size build more lodges to live in while smaller families usually need only one.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; However, large families in the northern hemisphere have been recorded living in one lodge. Beaver pairs mate for life; however, if a beaver's mate dies, it will partner with another one. Extra-pair copulations also occur.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; In addition to being monogamous, both the male and female take part in raising offspring. They also both mark and defend the territory and build and repair the dam and lodge.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; When young are born, they spend their first month in the lodge and their mother is the primary caretaker while their father maintains the territory.  In the time after they leave the lodge for the first time, yearlings will help their parents build food caches in the fall and repair dams and lodges. Still, adults do the majority of the work and young beavers help their parents for reasons based on natural selection rather than kin selection. They are dependent on them for food and for learning life skills.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; Young beavers spend most of their time playing but also copy their parents' behavior. However while copying behavior helps imprint life skills in young beavers it is not necessarily immediately beneficial for parents as the young beaver do not perform the tasks as well as the parents.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; 

Older offspring, which are around two years old, may also live in families and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year olds will also help in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; While these helping two-year olds helps increase chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family and two-year olds only stay and help their families if there is a shortage of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; When beavers leave their natal territories, they usually do not settle far.&lt;ref name= &quot;Bjorkoyli 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bjorkoyli | first1 = Tore | last2 = Rosell | first2 = Frank | year = 2002 | title = A Test of the Dear Enemy Phenomenon in the Eurasian Beaver | url = | journal = Animal Behavior | volume = 63 | issue = 6| pages = 1073–78 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2002.3010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 1998&quot;&gt;Sun, Lixing, and Dietland Muller-Schwarze. (1998) &quot;Anal Gland Secretion Codes for Relatedness in the Beaver, Castor Canadensis.&quot; Ethology 104: 917-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Related beavers share more features in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beavers.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 1998&quot;/&gt; Being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior and it causes more tolerant behavior among neighboring beavers.&lt;ref name= &quot;Bjorkoyli 2002&quot;/&gt;

===Territories and spacing===
[[File:AmericanBeaver.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Beaver and its dam]]
Beavers maintain and defend territories, which are areas for feeding, nesting and mating.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lixing 2003&quot;/&gt; They invest much energy in their territories, building their dams and becoming familiar with the area.&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosell | first1 = Frank | last2 = Nolet | first2 = Bart A. | year = 1997 | title = Factors Affecting Scent-Marking Behavior in Eurasian Beaver (Castor Fiber) | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 673–89 | doi = 10.1023/B:JOEC.0000006403.74674.8a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beavers mark their territories by constructing scent mounts made of mud, debris and castoreum,&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 2000&quot;&gt;Rosell, Frank, and Andrezej Czech. (2000) &quot;Response of Foraging Eurasian Beavers Castor Fiber to Predator Odours.&quot; Wildlife Biology 6(1): 13-21.&lt;/ref&gt; a urine based substance excreted though the beavers castor sacs between the pelvis and base of the tail.&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 1997&quot;/&gt; These scent mounts are established on the border of the territory.&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 2000&quot;/&gt; Once a beaver detects another scent in its territory, finding the intruder takes priority, even over food.&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 2000&quot;/&gt; 
Because they invest so much energy in their territories, beavers are intolerant of intruders and the holder of the territory is more likely to escalate an aggressive encounter.&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 1997&quot;/&gt;  These encounters are often violent. In order to avoid such situations, a beaver marks its territory with as many scent mounds as possible, signaling to intruders that the territory holder has enough energy to maintain its territory and thus able to put up a good defense.  As such, territories with more scent mounts are avoided more often than ones with fewer mounts.&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 1997&quot;/&gt; Scent marking increases in August during the dispersal of yearlings, in an attempt to prevent them from intruding on territories.&lt;ref name= &quot;Rosell 1997&quot;/&gt;  Beaver also exhibit a behavior known as the &quot;Dear Enemy Phenomenon&quot;. A territory holding beaver will investigate and become familiar with the scents of its neighbors.&lt;ref name= &quot;Bjorkoyli 2002&quot;/&gt; As such they respond less aggressively to intrusions by their territorial neighbours than intrusions by nonterritorial floaters or &quot;strangers&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Bjorkoyli 2002&quot;/&gt; This ability could be advantageous in facilitating differential treatment of wandering strangers versus established neighbours.&lt;ref name= &quot;Bjorkoyli 2002&quot;/&gt;

== Commercial uses ==
[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait by Napoleon Sarony - albumen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Oscar Wilde]] in beaver [[fur coat]]]]
Both beaver [[testicles]] and [[castoreum]], a bitter-tasting secretion with a slightly fetid odor contained in the castor sacs of male or female beaver, have been articles of trade for use in traditional medicine.  [[Yupik]] ([[Eskimo]]) medicine used dried beaver testicles like willow bark to relieve pain. Beaver testicles were exported from [[Levant]] (a region centered on [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]]) from the tenth to nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;PMID 12576209&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Claudius Aelianus]] comically described beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters, which is not possible because the beaver's testicles are inside its body.  European beavers (''[[Castor fiber]]'') were eventually hunted nearly to extinction in part for the production of castoreum, which was used as an [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], and [[antipyretic]].  Castoreum was described in the 1911 [[British Pharmaceutical Codex]] for use in [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[hysterical]] conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising [[blood pressure]] and increasing [[cardiac output]].  The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of [[salicin]] from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to [[salicylic acid]] and has an action very similar to aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/2005/03/28/S31/1/ |title=The quest for pain relief: how much have we improved on the past? |author=Stephen Pincock |date=2005-03-28 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Castoreum continues to be used in [[perfume]] production.

Much of the early exploration and trade of Canada was based on the quest for beaver. See [[Canadian canoe routes (early)]] and related articles. The most valuable part of the beaver is its inner fur whose many minute barbs make it excellent for [[felt]]ing, especially for hats. In Canada a 'made beaver' or ''castor gras'' that an Indian had worn or slept on was more valuable than a fresh skin since this tended to wear off the outer guard hairs.

In wider culture, the beaver is famed for its industriousness. The English verb &quot;to beaver&quot; means to work hard and constantly.

=== As a national emblem ===
The importance of the Beaver in the development of Canada through the fur trade led to its designation as the [[List of national animals|national animal]]. It is depicted on the [[Nickel (Canadian coin)|Canadian five-cent piece]] and was on the first pictorial postage stamp issued in the [[British North America|Canadian colonies]] in 1849 (the so-called &quot;[[Postage stamps and postal history of Canada|Three-Penny Beaver]]&quot;). As a [[national symbol]], the beaver was chosen to be the mascot of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Montreal]] with the name &quot;Amik&quot; (&quot;beaver&quot; in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]). The beaver is also the symbol of many units and organizations within the [[Canadian Forces]], such as on the cap badges of the [[Royal 22e Régiment|Royal 22&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Régiment]] and the [[Canadian Military Engineers]]. [[Toronto Police Services]], [[London Police Service]], [[Canadian Pacific Railway Police Service]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] crest bears the beaver on their crest or coat of arms.

=== In dietary law ===
In the 17th century, based on a question raised by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] ruled that the beaver was a [[fish]] (beaver flesh was a  part of the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival) for purposes of dietary law.  Therefore, the general prohibition on the consumption of [[meat]] on Fridays during [[Lent]] did not apply to beaver meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chowdc.org/Papers/Saunders%202001.html ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmyakin.org/2005/02/lent_roundup.html |title=Lenten Reader Roundup |publisher=Jimmy Akin.Org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}Lacoursière, Jacques. ''Une histoire du Québec'' ISBN 2-89448-050-4 Explains that Bishop François de Laval in the 17th century posed the question to the theologians of the [[Sorbonne]], who ruled in favour of this decision.&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal basis for the decision probably rests with the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]], which bases animal classification as much on habit as anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3147.htm ''The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas''] II. 147:8 provides legal foundation upon which theologians argued in favour of beaver being like fish.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is similar to the Church's classification of the [[capybara]], another semi-aquatic rodent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/in-days-before-easter-venezuelans-tuck-into/11063/ |title=In Days Before Easter, Venezuelans Tuck Into Rodent-Related Delicacy |publisher=The New York Sun|date=2005-03-24 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In computer science ===
In [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], a ''[[busy beaver]]'' (from the colloquial expression for &quot;industrious person&quot;) is a [[Turing machine]] that attains the maximum &quot;operational busyness&quot; (such as measured by the number of steps performed, or the number of nonblank symbols finally on the tape) among all the Turing machines in a certain class.

== Trapping ==
Beavers have been trapped for millennia, and this continues to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;myfoxchicago.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Park District Kills Beaver in Lincoln Park |author= |date=April, 2009 |newspaper=MyFoxChicago.com  |url=http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/beaver_north_pond_apr09 |accessdate=Dec. 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaver pelts were used for [[barter (economics)|barter]] by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the 17th century to gain European goods. They were then shipped back to Great Britain and [[France]] where they were made into clothing items. Widespread hunting and trapping of beavers led to their [[endangered species|endangerment]]. Eventually, the [[fur trade]] declined due to decreasing demand in Europe and the takeover of trapping grounds to support the growing agriculture sector. A small resurgence in beaver trapping has occurred in some areas where there is an over-population of beaver; trapping is done when the fur is of value, and the remainder of the animal may be used as feed. In the 1976/1977 season, 500,000 beaver pelts were harvested in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, Ronald M. 1991. pp. 638. ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' Fifth Edition, vol. I.

'''Bears''' are [[mammal]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Ursidae'''. Bears are classified as [[caniformia|caniforms]], or doglike carnivorans, with the [[pinniped]]s being their closest living relatives. Although there are only eight living [[species]] of bear, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of [[habitat]]s throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and partially in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Bears are found in the [[continent]]s of [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]].

Common characteristics of modern bears include a large body with stocky legs, a long snout, shaggy hair, [[plantigrade]] paws with five nonretractile claws, and a short tail. While the [[polar bear]] is mostly carnivorous and the [[giant panda]] feeds almost entirely on [[bamboo]], the remaining six species are omnivorous, with largely varied diets including both plants and animals.

With the exceptions of [[mating|courting]] individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They are generally [[diurnality|diurnal]], but may be active during the night ([[nocturnal]]) or twilight ([[crepuscular]]), particularly around humans. Bears are aided by an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]], and despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they can run quickly and are adept climbers and swimmers. In autumn some bear species forage large amounts of fermented fruits which affects their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/241001,slovakia-warns-of-tipsy-bears.html|accessdate=2008-11-11|title=Slovakia warns of tipsy bears|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKfsKyJo |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bears use shelters such as caves and burrows as their dens, which are occupied by most species during the winter for a long period of sleep similar to [[hibernation]].

Bears have been hunted since [[prehistoric]] times for their meat and fur. To this day, they play a prominent role in the [[The Arts|arts]], [[mythology]], and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, the bear's existence has been pressured through the encroachment on its habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear parts, including the [[Asia]]n [[bile bear]] market. The [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] lists six bear species as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or [[endangered species|endangered]], and even [[least concern]] species such as the [[brown bear]] are at risk of [[extirpation]] in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations is prohibited, but still ongoing.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;bear&quot; comes from [[Old English]] ''bera'' and belongs to a family of names for the bear in [[Germanic languages]], in origin from an adjective meaning &quot;brown&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;indo-european1959&quot;&gt;[[Pokorny (1959)]] [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=\data\ie\pokorny]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Scandinavia the word for bear is ''[[Bjorn|björn]]'' (or ''bjørn''), and is a relatively common given name for males. The use of this name is ancient and has been found mentioned in several [[runestone]] inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;http://hildebrand.raa.se/arkeologi/uppland.asp&lt;/ref&gt; In Germanic culture, the bear was a symbol of the warrior, as evident from the Old English term ''[[beorn]]'' which can take the meaning of both &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;warrior&quot;.

The reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] name of the bear is ''*h₂ŕ̥tḱos'', whence [[Sanskrit]] ''r̥kṣa'', [[Avestan]] ''arša'', [[Classical Greek|Greek]] ''ἄρκτος'' (arktos), [[Latin]] ''ursus'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''arth'' (whence perhaps &quot;[[Arthur]]&quot;), [[Albanian langyage|Albanian]] ari, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] arj. Also compared is Hittite ''ḫartagga-'', the name of a monster or predator.&lt;ref name=&quot;indo-european1959&quot;/&gt;
In the [[binomial name]] of the [[brown bear]], ''Ursus arctos'', [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linné]] simply combined the Latin and Greek names.

The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for bear, ''*h₂ŕ̥tḱos'' seems to have been subject to [[taboo deformation]] or replacement in some languages (as was the word for [[wolf]], ''wlk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;os''), resulting in the use of numerous unrelated words with meanings like &quot;brown one&quot; (English ''bruin'') and &quot;honey-eater&quot; (Slavic ''medved'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/bear.html |title=Bears |accessdate=2009-03-12 |last=Votruba |first=Martin |work=Slovak Studies Program |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKg2MOh4 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some Indo-European language groups do not share the same PIE root. The theory of the bear taboo is taught to almost all beginning students of Indo-European and historical linguistics; the putative original PIE word for bear is itself descriptive, because a cognate word in Sanskrit is ''rakṣas'', meaning &quot;harm, injury&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudline.org/LinguisticArchaeology.html |title=The Brown One, The Honey Eater, The Shaggy Coat, The Destroyer |publisher=Cloudline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKg2yviN |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary history==
The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder '''[[Caniformia]]''', or &quot;doglike&quot; carnivores, within the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''[[Carnivora]]'''. Bears' closest living relatives are the [[pinniped]]s and [[musteloidea|musteloid]]s.&lt;ref name=Hunt2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Welsey-Hunt, G.D. &amp; Flynn, J.J. | year = 2005 | title = Phylogeny of the Carnivora: basal relationships among the Carnivoramorphans, and assessment of the position of ‘Miacoidea’ relative to Carnivora | journal = Journal of Systematic Palaeontology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28 | doi = 10.1017/S1477201904001518}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following [[synapomorphy|synapomorphic]] (derived) traits set bears apart from related families:
* presence of an [[alisphenoid]] canal
* paroccipital processes that are large and not fused to the [[auditory bullae]]
* auditory bullae are not enlarged
* [[lacrimal bone]] is [[vestigial]]
* cheek teeth are [[molar tooth#Molars among species|bunodont]] and hence indicative of a broad, hypocarnivorous (non-strictly meat-eating) diet (although [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] (strictly meat-eating) taxa are known from the fossil record)&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wang, Xiaoming, Malcolm C. McKenna, and Demberelyin Dashzeveg | year = 2005 | title = Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon (Arctoidea, Carnivora) from Hsanda Gol Formation, Central Mongolia and Phylogeny of Basal Arctoids with Comments on Zoogeography | journal = American Museum Novitates | issue = 3483 | page = 57 | url = http://www.nhm.org/expeditions/rrc/wang/documents/Wangetal2005ShandGolarctoids.pdf }} {{dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[carnassials]] are flattened
Additionally, members of this family possess posteriorly oriented M2 postprotocrista [[molar (tooth)|molars]], elongated m2 molars, and a reduction of the premolars.

Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: [[Ailuropodinae]] (monotypic with the [[giant panda]]), [[Tremarctinae]] (monotypic with the [[Spectacled Bear]]), and [[Ursinae]] (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending upon authority).

===Fossil bears===
The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily ''[[Amphicynodontinae]]'', including ''[[Parictis]]'' (late [[Eocene]] to early middle [[Miocene]], 38-18 million years (Ma) ago) and the slightly younger ''Allocyon'' (early [[Oligocene]], 34-30 Ma), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, and a diet perhaps more similar to that of a badger. ''Parictis'' does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene.&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;{{cite book | author = Kemp, T.S. | year = 2005 | title = The Origin and Evolution of Mammals | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-850760-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether late Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (~37 Ma) and continuing into the early Oligocene.&lt;ref name=Wang2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wang Banyue and Qiu Zhanxiang | year = 2005 | title = Notes on Early Oligocene Ursids (Carnivora, Mammalia) from Saint Jacques, Nei Mongol, China | journal = Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | issue = 279 | pages = 116–124 | url = http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/447/22/B279a05.pdf | doi = 10.1206/0003-0090(2003)279&lt;0116:C&gt;2.0.CO;2 | volume = 279|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lQDJK1oN |archivedate = 2009-11-20|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; European genera morphologically very similar to ''Allocyon'', and also the much younger American ''[[Kolponomos]]'' (~18 Ma), are known from the Oligocene, including ''Amphicticeps'' and ''[[Amphicynodon]]''.

[[File:Plithocyon armagnacensis.JPG|thumb|left|''Plithocyon armagnacensis'' skull]] The raccoon-sized, dog-like ''[[Cephalogale]]'' is the oldest-known member of the subfamily '''[[Hemicyoninae]]''' which first appeared during the middle [[Oligocene]] in Eurasia ~30 Ma ago. The subfamily also includes the younger genera ''[[Phoberocyon]]'' (~20-15 Ma), and ''[[Plithocyon]]'' (~15-7 Ma).

A ''Cephalogale''-like species gave rise to the genus ''[[Ursavus]]'' during the early Oligocene (30-28 Ma); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears. Species of ''Ursavus'' subsequently entered North America together with ''Amphicynodon'' and ''Cephalogale'' during the early Miocene (21-18 Ma).

Members of living lineages of bears diverged from ''Ursavus'' ~20 Ma ago, likely via the species ''Ursavus elmensis''. Based on genetic and morphological data, the subfamily '''[[Ailuropodinae]]''' (pandas) was the first to diverge from other living bears ~19 Ma ago, although no fossils of this group have been found pre-dating about 5 Ma.&lt;ref name=krause2008/&gt;

The New World short-faced bears ('''[[Tremarctinae]]''') differentiated from [[Ursinae]] following a dispersal event into North America during the mid Miocene (~13 Ma).&lt;ref name=krause2008/&gt; They [[Great American Interchange|invaded South America]] (~1 Ma) following formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Soibelzon | first = L.

This genus is probably the direct ancestor to the [[Arctodus|North American short-faced bears]] (genus ''Arctodus''), the [[Arctotherium|South American short-faced bears]] (''Pararctotherium'' and ''Arctotherium''), and the [[spectacled bears]], ''Tremarctos'', represented by both an extinct North American species (''[[Tremarctos floridanus|T. floridanus]]''), and the lone surviving representative of the '''Tremarctinae''', the South American [[spectacled bear]] (''T. ornatus'').

[[File:Teufelshöhle-Höhlenbär-Dreiviertelprofil.jpg|thumb|Fossil of [[Cave bear]] (''Ursus spelaeus'')]]The subfamily [[Ursinae]] experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa ~5.3-4.5 Ma ago coincident with major environmental changes, with the first members of the genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'' also appearing around this time.&lt;ref name=krause2008/&gt; The [[sloth bear]] is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (~5.3 Ma); it took on its peculiar morphology related to its diet on termites and ants no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3-4 Ma ago, the species ''Ursus minimus'' appears in the fossil record of Europe, which apart from size is nearly identical to today's [[Asiatic black bear]]. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from ''U. minimus'', the black bears (including the [[sun bear]], the Asiatic black bear, and the [[American black bear]]), and the brown bears. Modern [[brown bear]]s evolved from ''U. minimus'' via ''[[Ursus etruscus]]'', which itself is ancestral to both the extinct [[Pleistocene]] [[cave bear]] and the ancestor of today's brown and [[polar bears]]. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into N. America from Eurasia as early as 4 Ma ago during the early Pliocene.&lt;ref name=Qiu &gt;{{cite journal | author = Qiu Zhanxiang | year = 2003 | title = Dispersals of Neogene Carnivorans between Asia and North America | journal = Bulletin American Museum of Natural History | issue = 279 | pages = 18–31 | url = http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/447/25/B279a02.pdf | doi = 10.1206/0003-0090(2003)279&lt;0018:C&gt;2.0.CO;2 | volume = 279|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lQDJK0Fa |archivedate = 2009-11-20|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fossil record of bears is exceptionally good. Direct ancestor-descendent relationships between individual species are often fairly well established, with sufficient intermediate forms known to make the precise cut-off between an ancestral and its daughter species subjective.&lt;ref name=Kurten&gt;Kurtén, B., 1995.

Other extinct bear genera include ''Agriarctos'', ''Indarctos'', and ''[[Agriotherium]]'' (sometimes placed within [[hemicyonidae|hemicyonids]]).

===Taxonomic revisions of living bear species===
The [[giant panda]]'s taxonomy (subfamily [[Ailuropodinae]]) has long been debated. Its original classification by [[Armand David]] in 1869 was within the bear genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'', but in 1870 it was reclassified by [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]] to the [[raccoon]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Lindburg, Donald G. (2004). ''Giant Pandas: Biology and Conservation'', pp. 7–9. University of California Press
&lt;/ref&gt; In recent studies, the majority of [[DNA]] analyses suggest that the giant panda has a much closer relationship to other bears and should be considered a member of the family Ursidae.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf R. P. Bininda-Emonds. &quot;Phylogenetic Position of the Giant Panda&quot;. In Lindburg, Donald G. (2004) ''Giant Pandas: Biology and Conservation'', pp. 11–35. University of California Press
&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of divergence dates place the giant panda as the most ancient offshoot among living [[taxa]] within Ursidae, having split from other bears 17.9 to 22.1 Ma ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;krause2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krause | first = J. | authorlink =  | coauthors = Unger, T.; Noçon, A.; Malaspinas, A.; Kolokotronis, S.; Stiller, M.; Soibelzon, L.; Spriggs, H.; Dear, P.

There is also evidence that, unlike their neighbors elsewhere, the [[brown bear]]s of Alaska's [[ABC islands (Alaska)|ABC islands]] are more closely related to [[polar bears]] than they are to other brown bears in the world. Researchers Gerald Shields and Sandra Talbot of the [[University of Alaska]] Fairbanks Institute of Arctic [[Biology]] studied the [[DNA]] of several samples of the species and found that their DNA is different from that of other brown bears. The researchers discovered that their DNA was unique compared to brown bears anywhere else in the world. The discovery has shown that while all other brown bears share a brown bear as their closest relative, those of Alaska's ABC Islands differ and share their closest relation with the polar bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF13/1314.html |title=The Brown Bear: Father of the Polar Bear?, Alaska Science Forum |publisher=Gi.alaska.edu |date=1996-12-05 |accessdate=2010-10-16|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqqFrYLO |archivedate = 2010-01-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the very rare [[Tibetan blue bear]], which is a type of brown bear. This animal has never been photographed.

[[Koala]]s are often referred to as bears due to their appearance; they are not bears, however, but [[marsupial]]s.

The genera ''[[Melursus]]'' and ''[[Helarctos]]'' are sometimes also included in ''Ursus''. The Asiatic black bear and the polar bear used to be placed in their own genera, ''Selenarctos'' and ''Thalarctos'' which are now placed at [[subgenus]] rank.

A number of hybrids have been bred between American black, brown, and polar bears (see [[Ursid hybrid]]s).

==Biology==
===Morphology===
[[File:Black bear large.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite being [[quadruped]]s, bears can stand and sit similarly to humans.]]
[[File:Bear foot.jpg|thumb|left|Unlike other carnivora, bears have [[plantigrade]] hind feet]]
Bears are generally bulky and robust animals with relatively short legs. Bears are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] with regard to size, with the males being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species, and where a species varies in size across its distribution individuals from larger sized areas tend also to vary more. Bears are the most massive terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, with some Polar Bears and Brown Bears weighing over {{convert|750|kg}}. As to which species is the largest may depend on whether the assessment is based on which species has the largest individuals (brown bears) or on the largest average size (polar bears). The smallest bears are the [[Sun Bear]]s of Asia, which weigh an average of {{convert|65|kg}} for the males and {{convert|45|kg}} for the females.&lt;ref name = &quot;HMW&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | first = David L. | last = Garshelis | editor-last = Wilson | editor-first = Don| editor2-last =Mittermeier | editor2-first = Russell | contribution = Family Ursidae (Bears) | title = [[Handbook of the Mammals of the World]]. Volume 1: Carnivores | year = 2009 | pages = | place = Barcelona | publisher = Lynx Edicions | isbn = 978-84-96553-49-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other land carnivorans, bears are [[plantigrade]]. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are still quite fast with the brown bear reaching {{convert|30|mph}} although they are still slower than [[Felinae|felines]] and [[dog|canines]]. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Bears have non-retractable claws which are used for digging, climbing, tearing and catching prey. Their ears are rounded.

Bears have an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]], a better sense of smell in fact than the [[Canidae|dogs]] (Canidae), or possibly any other mammal. This sense of smell is used for signalling between bears (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to find most of their diet.&lt;ref name = &quot;HMW&quot;/&gt;

====Dentition====
Unlike most other members of the [[Carnivora]], bears have relatively undeveloped [[carnassial]] teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter. The [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] are large, and the [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth flat and crushing. There is considerable variation in [[dentition|dental formula]] even within a given species. It has been suggested that this indicates bears are still in the process of evolving from a carnivorous to a predominantly herbivorous diet. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved fully functional carnassials, as their diet has switched back towards carnivory.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Bunnell, Fred|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|page= 87|isbn= 978-0-87196-871-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dental formula for living bears is:
{{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.2-4.2|lower=3.1.2-4.3}}

===Distribution and habitat===
The bears are mostly found in the northern hemisphere, with a single species, the [[spectacled bear]], occurring in South America. The [[Atlas Bear]], a subspecies of the Brown Bear, was the only bear native to [[Africa]]. It was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but has been extinct since around the 1870s. All the other species are found in North America, Asia and Europe. The most widespread species is the Brown Bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia to the western areas of North America. The American Black Bear is restricted to North America, and the Polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species are Asian.&lt;ref name = &quot;HMW&quot;/&gt;

With the exception of the Polar Bear the bears are mostly forest species. Some species, particularly the Brown Bear, may inhabit or seasonally use other areas such as alpine scrub or tundra.

===Behaviour===
While many people think that bears are [[nocturnal]], they are in fact generally [[diurnality|diurnal]], active for the most part during the day. The belief that they are nocturnal apparently comes from the habits of bears that live near humans which engage in some nocturnal activities, such as raiding trash cans or crops while avoiding humans. The sloth bear of Asia is the most nocturnal of the bears, but this varies by individual and females with cubs are often diurnal in order to avoid competition with males and nocturnal predators.&lt;ref name = &quot;HMW&quot;/&gt; Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the Carnivora. Liaisons between breeding bears are brief, and the only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs).&lt;ref name = &quot;HMW&quot;/&gt;

===Vocalizations===
Bears produce a variety of vocalizations such as:

* '''Moaning''': produced mostly as mild warnings to potential threats or in fear.
* '''Barking''': produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position.
* '''Huffing''': made during courtship or between mother and cubs to warn of danger.
* '''Growling''': produced as strong warnings to potential threats or in anger.
* '''Roaring''': used much for the same reasons as growls and also to proclaim territory and for intimidation.

===Diet and interspecific interactions===
[[File:19-Formosan Black Bear.JPG|thumb|left|[[Asian black bear]] feeding on berries]]
[[File:Bear Alaska (3).jpg|thumb|[[Brown bear]]s make use of infrequent but predictable salmon runs in order to feed]]

Their carnivorous reputation non-withstanding, most bears have adopted a diet of more plant than animal matter and are completely opportunistic omnivores. Some bears will climb trees in order to obtain [[mast (botany)|mast]] (edible vegatative or reproductive parts such as acorns); smaller species which are more able to climb include a greater amount of this in their diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;diet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattson|first=David J.|year=1998|title=Diet and Morphology of Extant and Recently Extinct Northern Bears |journal=Ursus, A Selection of Papers from the Tenth International Conference on Bear Research and Management, Fairbanks, Alaska, July 1995, and Mora, Sweden, September 1995|volume=10|pages=479–496|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3873160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such masts can be very important to the diet of these species, and mast failures may result in long range movements by bears looking for alternate sources of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Christopher|year=2007|title=Influence of mast production on black bear non-hunting mortalities in West Virginia|journal=Ursus|volume=18|issue=1|pages=46–53| doi = 10.2192/1537-6176(2007)18[46:IOMPOB]2.0.CO;2|last2=Pack|first2=James C.|last3=Igo|first3=William K.|last4=Billings|first4=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; One exception is the [[polar bear]], which has adopted a diet mainly of [[marine mammal]]s to survive in the Arctic. The other exception is the [[giant panda]] which has adopted a diet mainly of [[bamboo]]. [[Isotope analysis|Stable isotope analysis]] of the [[extinction|extinct]] giant short-faced bear (''[[Arctodus simus]]'') shows that it was also an exclusive meat eater, probably a [[scavenger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Matheus|first=Paul E. |year=1995|title=Diet and Co-ecology of Pleistocene Short-Faced Bears and Brown Bears in Eastern Beringia |journal=Quaternary Research|volume=44|issue=3|pages=447–453 | doi = 10.1006/qres.1995.1090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sloth bear]], though not as specialized as the previous two species, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears and developed a long, suctioning tongue in order to feed on the [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s and other burrowing [[insect]]s that they favour. At certain times of the year these insects can make up 90% of their diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joshi|first=Anup|year=1997|title=Seasonal and Habitat-Related Diets of Sloth Bears in Nepal |journal=Journal of Mammalology|volume=1978|issue=2|pages=584–597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All bears will feed on any food source that becomes available, and the nature of that varies seasonally. A study of Asiatic black bears in [[Taiwan]] found that they would consume large numbers of acorns when they were most common, and switch to [[ungulate]]s in other times of the year.&lt;ref name = &quot;asiablackdiet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Mei-Hsiu|year=2002|title=Diets of Asiatic black bears in Taiwan, with Methodological and Geographical Comparisons |journal=Ursus|volume=13|pages=111–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When taking warm-blooded animals, bears will typically take small or young animals, as they are easier to catch. Although (besides polar bears) both species of black bear and the [[brown bear]] can sometimes take large prey, such as [[ungulate]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;asiablackdiet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zager| first=Peter|year=2006|title=The role of American black bears and brown bears as predators on ungulates in North America|journal=Ursus|volume=17|issue=2|pages=95–108|doi = 10.2192/1537-6176(2006)17[95:TROABB]2.0.CO;2|last2=Beecham|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, bears will feed on other large animals when they encounter a carcass, whether or not the carcass is claimed by or is the kill of another predator. This competition is the main source of interspecies conflict. Bears are typically the apex predators in their range due to their size and power, and can defend a carcass against nearly all comers. Mother bears also can usually defend their cubs against other predators. The [[tiger]] is the only known predator known to regularly prey on adult bears, including [[sloth bear]]s, [[Asiatic black bear]]s, [[giant panda]]s, [[sun bear]]s and small [[brown bear]]s.

===Breeding===
[[File:Bear cub.jpg|thumb|Bear cubs, like this [[American Black Bear]], are sometimes killed by males]]
The age at which bears reach [[sexual maturity]] is highly variable, both between and within species. Sexual maturity is dependent on body condition, which is in turn dependent upon the food supply available to the growing individual. In the females of smaller species may have young in as little as two years, whereas the larger species may not rear young until they are four or even nine years old. First breeding may be even later in males, where competition for mates may leave younger males without access to females.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMW&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Black Bears mating.jpg|left|thumb|[[American Black Bear]]s mating]]
The bear's courtship period is very brief. Bears in northern climates reproduce seasonally, usually after a period of inactivity similar to hibernation, although tropical species breed all year round. Cubs are born toothless, blind, and bald. The cubs of brown bears, usually born in [[litter (animal)|litters]] of 1–3, will typically stay with the mother for two full seasons. They feed on their mother's milk through the duration of their relationship with their mother, although as the cubs continue to grow, nursing becomes less frequent and cubs learn to begin hunting with the mother. They will remain with the mother for approximately three years, until she enters the next cycle of [[estrus]] and drives the cubs off. Bears will reach sexual maturity in five to seven years. Male bears, especially Polar and Brown Bears, will kill and sometimes devour cubs born to another father in order to induce a female to breed again. Female bears are often successful in driving off males in protection of their cubs, despite being rather smaller.

===Winter dormancy===
[[File:Cub polar bear is nursing 2.OGG|[[Polar bear]] mother is nursing her cub|thumb]]
Many bears of northern regions are assumed to [[hibernation|hibernate]] in the winter. While many bear species do go into a [[physiological]] state often colloquially called &quot;hibernation&quot; or &quot;[[winter sleep]]&quot;, it is not true hibernation. In true hibernators, body temperatures drop to near ambient and heart rate slows drastically, but the animals periodically rouse themselves to urinate or defecate and to eat from stored food. The body temperature of bears, on the other hand, drops only a few degrees from normal and heart rate slows only slightly. They normally do not wake during this &quot;hibernation&quot;, and therefore do not eat, drink, urinate or defecate the entire period. Higher body heat and being easily roused may be adaptations, because females give birth to their cubs during this winter sleep.

Some species, such as the [[polar bear]], [[American black bear]], [[sloth bear]] and the [[brown bear]], are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people. All bears are physically powerful and are likely capable of fatally attacking a person, but they, for the most part, are shy, are easily frightened and will avoid humans. Injuries caused by bears are rare, but are often widely reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Douglas|year=2003|title=Polar Bear-Human Interactions in Canadian National Parks, 1986-2000 |journal=Ursus|volume=14|issue=1|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger that bears pose is often vastly exaggerated, in part by the human imagination. However, when a mother feels her cubs are threatened, she will behave ferociously. It is recommended to give all bears a wide berth because they are behaviorally unpredictable.

Bears may also come into conflict with humans where they raid crops or attack livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;crops&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fredriksson|first=Gabriella|year=2005|title=Human–sun bear conflicts in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo|journal=Ursus|volume=16|issue=1|pages=130–137|doi=10.2192/1537-6176(2005)016[0130:HBCIEK]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;livestock&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Issac|year=2006|title=Andean bear–livestock conflicts: a review|journal=Ursus|volume=17|issue=1|pages=8–15|doi = 10.2192/1537-6176(2006)17[8:ABCAR]2.0.CO;2|last2=Paisley|first2=Susanna|last3=Wallace|first3=Robert|last4=Jorgenson|first4=Jeffrey P.|last5=Cuesta|first5=Francisco|last6=Castellanos|first6=Armando}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems may be the work of only a few bears but create a climate of conflict as farmers and ranchers may perceive all losses as due to bears and advocate the preventive removal of all bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;livestock&quot;/&gt; Mitigation methods may be used to reduce bear damage to crops, and reduce local antipathy towards bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;crops&quot;/&gt;

Laws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from hunters' [[habitat destruction]]. Public perception of bears is often very positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diet, ability to stand on two legs, and symbolic importance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellert|first=Stephen|title=Public Attitudes toward Bears and Their Conservation |journal=Bears: Their Biology and Management|volume=9|issue=1|pages=43–50|doi=10.2307/3872683|year=1994|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3872683}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is widespread support for bear protection, at least in more affluent societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersone|first=Žanete|year=2004|title=Public perception of large carnivores in Latvia|journal=Ursus|volume=15|issue=2|pages=181–187|doi=10.2192/1537-6176(2004)015&lt;0181:PPOLCI&gt;2.0.CO;2|last2=Ozolinš|first2=Jānis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more rural and poorer regions attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs that they incur to farmers and ranchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;livestock&quot;/&gt; Some populated areas with bear populations have also outlawed the feeding of bears, including allowing them access to garbage or other food waste. Bears in captivity have been trained to dance, box, or ride [[bicycle]]s; however, this use of the animals became controversial in the late 20th century. Bears were kept for [[Bear-baiting|baiting]] in Europe at least since the 16th century.

===Bears as food and medicine===
Many people{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} enjoy hunting bears and eating them. Their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In [[Cantonese cuisine]], bear paws are considered a delicacy. The peoples of China, Japan, and Korea use bears' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of traditional [[Chinese medicine]]. It is believed more than 12,000 [[bile bear]]s are kept on farms, farmed for their bile, in China, Vietnam and South Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6742671.stm|title=BBC Test kit targets cruel bear trade | date=2007-06-11 | accessdate=2010-01-01|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKg09Jgj |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no |work=BBC News |first=Richard |last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear meat must be cooked thoroughly as it can often be infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'', which can cause [[trichinosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5327a2.htm|

==Culture==
===Names===
The female first name &quot;Ursula&quot;, originally derived from a Christian [[St. Ursula|saint]]'s name and common in English- and German-speaking countries, means &quot;little she-bear&quot; (dimunitive of [[Latin]] ''ursa''). In Switzerland the male first name &quot;Urs&quot; is especially popular, whereas the name of the canton and city of [[Bern]] is derived from ''Bär'', [[German language|German]] for bear.

In Scandinavia, the male personal names [[Björn]] (Sweden, Iceland) and [[Bjørn]] (Norway, Denmark) meaning &quot;bear&quot; are relatively common. In Finland, male personal name [[Otso]] is a old poetic name for bear, similar to [[Kontio]].

In [[Russian (language)|Russian]] and other [[Slavic languages]], the word for bear, &quot;[[Medved]]&quot; (медведь), and variants or derivatives such as [[Medvedev (surname)|Medvedev]] are common surnames.

The [[Irish people|Irish]] family name &quot;McMahon&quot; means &quot;Son of Bear&quot; in [[Irish language|Irish]].

In East European Jewish communities, the name &quot;Ber&quot; (בער) — [[Yiddish]] cognate of &quot;Bear&quot; — has been attested as a common male first name, at least since the 18th century, and was among others the name of several prominent [[Rabbi]]s. The Yiddish &quot;Ber&quot; is still in use among [[Orthodox Jewish]] communities in Israel, the US and other countries.

With the transition from Yiddish to [[Hebrew]] under the influence of [[Zionism]], the Hebrew word for &quot;bear&quot;, &quot;Dov&quot; (דב), was taken up in contemporary [[Israel]] and is at present among the commonly used male first names in that country.

&quot;[[Ten Bears]]&quot; (Paruasemana) was the name of a well-known 19th Century chieftain among the [[Comanche]]. Also among other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes, bear-related names are attested.

===Myth and legend===
[[File:Theodor Kittelsen-En uheldig bjørnejakt.jpg|thumb|&quot;En uheldig bjørnejakt&quot; (An Unfortunate Bear Hunt) by [[Theodor Kittelsen]].]]
[[File:ShunsenOniguma.jpg|thumb|upright|Onikuma from ''[[Ehon Hyaku Monogatari]]'']]
[[File:Corbinian-panel-bear.jpg|thumb|left|According to his [[hagiography]], a bear killed [[Saint Corbinian]]'s pack horse on the way to Rome and so the saint commanded it to carry his load. Once he arrived in Rome, however, he let the bear go.]]
There is evidence of prehistoric [[bear worship]], see [[Arctic]], [[Arcturus]], [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], [[Berserker]], [[Kalevala]]. Anthropologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have regarded this as a common feature in most of the [[fishing]] and [[hunting]]-[[tribe]]s. The prehistoric [[Finns]], along with most [[Siberian peoples]], considered the bear as the spirit of one's forefathers. This is why the bear (''karhu'') was a greatly respected animal, with several euphemistic names (such as ''otso'', ''mesikämmen'' and ''kontio''). The bear is the national animal of [[Finland]].

This kind of attitude is reflected in the traditional [[Russia]]n [[fairy tale]] &quot;''[[Morozko]]''&quot;, whose arrogant protagonist Ivan tries to kill a mother bear and her cubs — and is punished and humbled by having his own head turned magically into a bear's head and being subsequently shunned by human society.

&quot;[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]&quot; is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear, and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. In the 1970s this story was adapted into the [[East German]] [[fantasy film]] [[The Singing Ringing Tree]] and broadcast on British television.

There has been evidence about early bear worship in China and among the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] culture as well (see [[Iomante]]). [[Korean people]] in their [[Korean mythology|mythology]] identify the bear as their ancestor and symbolic animal. According to the Korean legend, a god imposed a difficult test on a she-bear, and when she passed it the god [[40th century BC#Mythology|turned her into a woman]] and married her.

[[File:BXVI CoA like gfx PioM.svg|thumb|upright|The saddled &quot;bear of St. [[Corbinian]]&quot; the emblem of [[Freising]], here incorporated in the arms of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]]]
Legends of saints taming bears are common in the Alpine zone. In the arms of the bishopric of [[Freising]] (''see illustration'') the bear is the dangerous totem animal tamed by St. [[Corbinian]] and made to carry his civilised baggage over the mountains.
A bear also features prominently in the legend of St. [[Romedius]], who is also said to have tamed one of these animals and had the same bear carry him from his hermitage in the mountains to the city of [[Trento]].
[[File:Coa Abbey Saint Gall.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]]]] Similar stories are told of [[Saint Gall]] and [[Saint Columbanus]].
This recurrent motif was used by the Church as a symbol of the victory of Christianity over Paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoreau]] (2007)''L'ours. Historie d'un roi déchu''&lt;/ref&gt; In the Norse settlements of northern England during the tenth century a type of &quot;hogback&quot; grave cover of a long narrow block of stone with a shaped apex like the roof beam of a long house, is carved with a muzzled, thus Christianised, bear clasping each gable end. Though the best collection of these is in the church at [[Brompton, Hambleton|Brompton, North Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;Noted and illustrated in Richard Hall, ''Viking Age Archaeology'' 1995:43 and fig. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; their distribution ranges across northern England and southern Scotland, with a scattered few in the north Midlands and single survivals in Wales, Cornwall and Ireland; a late group is found in the [[Orkney Islands]].

[[File:The Three Bears - Project Gutenberg eText 17034.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;The Three Bears&quot;, [[Arthur Rackham]]'s illustration to ''English Fairy Tales'', by
[[Flora Annie Steel]]]]
Bears are a popular feature of many children's stories including Goldilocks and [[The Story of the Three Bears]], the [[Berenstein Bears]], and [[Winnie the Pooh]].

The [[constellation]]s [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]] represent bears.

===Symbolic use===
{{details|Bears in heraldry}}

[[File:IranUSSRBritain.jpg|thumb|upright|The British Lion, the [[Persian Cat]] and the [[Russian Bear]] (see [[The Great Game]])]]
The [[Russian bear]] is a common [[National personification]] for [[Russia]] (as well as the [[Soviet Union]]). The [[brown bear]] is also Germany's and [[Finland]]'s national animal.

[[File:Flag of California.svg|thumb|upright|The [[flag of California]]]] In the [[United States]], the [[American black bear|black bear]] is the [[state animal]] of [[Louisiana]], [[New Mexico]], and [[West Virginia]]; the [[grizzly bear]] is the state animal of both [[Montana]] and [[California]].

In the UK, the bear and staff has long featured on the heraldic arms of [[Warwickshire]] county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/warwicks.html WARWICKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL] [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk Civic heraldry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bears appear in the [[canting arms]] of [[Bern]] and [[Berlin]].

Also, &quot;bear&quot;, &quot;[[brown bear|bruin]]&quot;, or specific types of bears are popular [[nickname]]s or [[mascot]]s, for example, for sports teams ([[Chicago Bears]], [[California Golden Bears]], [[UCLA Bruins]], [[Boston Bruins]]); and a bear cub called [[Misha]] was [[mascot]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], [[USSR]].[[File:SmokeyTheBearHeadshot.GIF|thumb|upright|Smokey Bear]]

[[Smokey Bear]] has become a part of [[United States|American]] culture since his introduction in 1944. Known to almost all Americans, he and his message, &quot;Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires&quot; (updated in 2001 to &quot;Only You Can Prevent Wildfires&quot;) has been a symbol of preserving woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=129 |title=Forest Fire Prevention - Smokey Bear (1944–Present) |publisher=Ad Council |date=1944-08-09 |accessdate=2010-10-16|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKg3eCG9 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smokey wears a [[Campaign hat|hat]] similar to one worn by U.S. Forest Service rangers; state police officers in some states wear a similar style, giving rise to the [[CB slang]] &quot;bear&quot; or &quot;Smokey&quot; for the [[highway patrol]].

The name [[Beowulf]] has been hypothesized to mean &quot;bee-wolf&quot;, a [[kenning]] for &quot;bear&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, Henry. (1884) ''Anglo-Saxon Reader in Prose and Verse''  The Clarendon Press, page 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Figures of speech===
The physical attributes and behaviours of bears are commonly used in figures of speech in English.
* In the [[stock market]], a ''[[bear market]]'' is a period of declining prices. Pessimistic forecasting or negative activity is said to be ''bearish'' (due to the stereotypical posture of bears looking downwards), and one who expresses bearish sentiment is a ''bear''. Its opposite is a ''bull market'', and ''bullish'' sentiment from ''bulls''.
* In [[gay slang]], the term &quot;[[bear community|bear]]&quot; refers to male individuals who possess physical attributes much like a bear, such as a heavy build, abundant body hair, and commonly facial hair.
* A ''[[bear hug]]'' is typically a tight [[hug]] that involves wrapping one's arms around another person, often leaving that person's arms immobile. It was used in the [[Ronald Reagan]] political ad &quot;[[Bear in the woods]]&quot;.
* ''Bear tracking'' - in the [[old West]]ern states of the [[U.S.]] and to this day in the former [[Dakota Territory]], the expression, &quot;You ain't just a bear trackin'.&quot;, is used to mean &quot;You ain't lying&quot; or &quot;That's for sure&quot; or &quot;You're not just blowing smoke&quot;. This expression evolved as an outgrowth of the experience pioneer hunters and mountainmen had when tracking bear. Bears often lay down false tracks and are notorious for doubling back on anything tracking them. If you are not following bear tracks, you are not following false trails or leads in your thoughts, words or deeds.
* In [[Korean culture]] a person is referred to as being &quot;like a bear&quot; when they are stubborn or not sensitive to what is happening around their surroundings. Used as a phrase to call a person &quot;stubborn bear.&quot;
* The [[Bible]] compares [[King David]]'s &quot;bitter warriors&quot;, who fight with such fury that they could overcome many times their number of opponents, with &quot;a bear robbed of her whelps in the field&quot; (2 [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] 17:8 [[s:Bible (King James)/2 Samuel#Chapter 17]]). The term &quot;a bereaved bear&quot; (דב שכול), derived from this Biblical source, is still used in the literary [[Hebrew]] of contemporary [[Israel]].

===Teddy bears===
{{Main|Teddy bear}}
Around the world, many children have [[stuffed toy]]s in the form of bears.

==Scientific/Conservation Organizations==
The two authoritative organizations for seeking scientific information (for example,, natural history, management, conservation, and so on.) on bear species of the world are the ''International Association for Bear Research &amp; Management'' ([[International Bear Association]]- IBA) and the ''[[Bear Specialist Group]]'' of the Species Survival Commission - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The '''Bald Eagle''' (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'') is a [[bird of prey]] found in [[North America]]. It is the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and [[national symbol|symbol]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. This [[sea eagle]] has two known sub-species and forms a [[Cryptic species complex|species pair]] with the [[White-tailed Eagle]]. Its range includes most of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], all of the [[contiguous United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

In the late 20th century the Bald Eagle was on the brink of [[extirpation]] in the continental United States, while flourishing in much of Alaska and Canada. Populations recovered and stabilized, so the species was removed from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government's]] list of [[endangered species]] and transferred to the list of [[threatened species]] on July 12, 1995, and it was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the [[Continental United States|Lower 48]] States on June 28, 2007.

Bald Eagles are not actually [[bald]].  The name derives from the older meaning of the word, &quot;white headed&quot;.

==Description==
The [[plumage]] of an adult Bald Eagle is evenly brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but [[sexual dimorphism]] is evident in the species in that females are 25 percent larger than males.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; The beak, feet, and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Haliaeetus_leucocephalus.html|title=Bald Eagle ''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Geology|author=Harris|accessdate= 2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[beak]] is large and hooked, with a yellow [[cere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;/&gt;

The plumage of the immature is brown, speckled with white until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Immature Bald Eagles are distinguishable from the [[Golden Eagle]] in that the former has a more protruding head with a larger [[beak]], straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat, and feathers which do not completely cover the legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;sibley&quot;&gt;[[David Allen Sibley|Sibley, D.]] (2000).

Its diet consists mainly of [[fish]], but it is an opportunistic feeder. It hunts fish by swooping down and snatching the fish out of the water with its talons. It is sexually mature at four years or five years of age. In the wild, Bald Eagles can live up to thirty years, and often survive longer in captivity.&lt;ref name=sop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/regional/oneaglefacts.html|title=Bald Eagle Fact Sheet|publisher=Southern Ontario Bald Eagle Monitoring Project|accessdate= 2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bald Eagle builds the largest [[bird nest|nest]] of any North American bird, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide, and one&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]] (1.1&amp;nbsp;[[short ton|ton]]s) in weight.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;

The call consists of weak chirping whistles, harsher and more shrill from young birds than adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;sibley&quot;/&gt;

The average lifespan of Bald Eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest living to be about 30. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location.&lt;ref name=sop/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
A species placed in the genus ''Haliaeetus'' ([[sea eagle]]s) which gets both its common and scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. ''Bald'' in the [[English language|English]] name is derived from the word ''[[piebald]]'', and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dudley|first=Karen |title=Bald Eagles|publisher=Raintree Steck-Vaughn Publishers|year=1998|page=7|isbn=0-8172-4571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name is derived from ''Haliaeetus'', [[New Latin]] for &quot;sea eagle&quot; (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''haliaetos''), and ''leucocephalus'', Latinized Ancient Greek for &quot;white head,&quot; from λευκος ''leukos'' (&quot;white&quot;) and κεφαλη ''kephale'' (&quot;head&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/Whats_in_a_name/default.cfm?id=19|author=Joshua Dietz|title=What's in a Name|publisher=Smithsonian National Zoological Park|accessdate=August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liddell 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bald Eagle was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', under the name ''Falco leucocephalus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carolus | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

*'''''H. l. leucocephalus''''' (Linnaeus, 1766) is the nominate subspecies.

The Bald Eagle forms a [[species pair]] with the [[Eurasia]]n [[White-tailed Eagle]]. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the White-tailed Eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The pair diverged from other Sea Eagles at the beginning of the Early [[Miocene]] (c. 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ma (unit)|Ma BP]]) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle [[Oligocene]], 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this [[genus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Wink | first =M | title =A mtDNA phylogeny of sea eagles (genus ''Haliaeetus'') based on nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome ''b'' gene | journal =Biochemical Systematics and Ecology | volume =24 | issue = 7-8| pages =783–791 | year =1996 | url =http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/institute/fak14/ipmb/phazb/pubwink/1996/20_1996.pdf |format=PDF | accessdate =2008-11-07 | doi =10.1016/S0305-1978(97)81217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two species probably diverged in the North [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], as the White-tailed Eagle spread westwards into Eurasia and the Bald Eagle spread eastwards into North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Habitat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bald-eagles.info/habitat.php|title=Bald Eagle Habitat|publisher=Bald-Eagles.info|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and range==
[[File:Bald Eagle and salmon.jpg|Juvenile with [[salmon]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]].|thumb|left]]
The Bald Eagle prefers habitats near seacoasts, rivers, large lakes, oceans, and other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}, and lakes with an area greater than
{{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}} are optimal for breeding Bald Eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/animals/bird/hale/all.html|title=Wildlife Species: ''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''|publisher=USDA Forest Service|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bald Eagle requires old-growth and mature stands of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] or [[hardwood]] trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Selected trees must have good visibility, an open structure, and proximity to prey, but the height or species of tree is not as important as an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Forests used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60 percent, and no less than 20 percent, and be in close proximity to water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt;

The Bald Eagle is extremely sensitive to human activity, and is found most commonly in areas free of human disturbance. It chooses sites more than {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from low-density human disturbance and more than {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from medium- to high-density human disturbance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt; Occasionally Bald Eagles will venture into large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the [[Willamette River]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.willamette-riverkeeper.org/documents/RossIslandFactSheet.pdf|title=Ross Island FAQ|year=2009|work=Willamette Riverkeeper website|publisher=Willamette Riverkeeper|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this sensitivity, a family of Bald Eagles recently moved to the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson |first=Jen |url=http://gothamist.com/2010/02/05/bald_eagle_1.php |title=Bald Eagle Spotted Near Fairway |publisher=Gothamist |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bald Eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of [[Canada]], all of the [[continental United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is the only sea eagle [[endemism|endemic]] to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the [[bayou]]s of [[Louisiana]] to the [[Sonoran Desert]] and the eastern deciduous forests of [[Quebec]] and [[New England]], northern birds are [[bird migration|migratory]], while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to [[Alaska]], the [[Aleutian Islands]], northern and eastern Canada, and [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull87&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Bull J, Farrand, J Jr |title=Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds: Eastern Region |year=1987 |publisher=Alfred A.

It has occurred as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] twice in [[Ireland]]; a juvenile was shot illegally in [[Fermanagh]] on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a White-tailed Eagle), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in [[County Kerry|Kerry]] on November 15, 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bou.org.uk/recrep25.html|author=[[British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee]]|title=25th Report (October 1998)|publisher=British Ornithologists Union |accessdate=2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bald Eagles will also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in [[Squamish, British Columbia]], about halfway between [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]. The birds primarily gather along the [[Squamish River|Squamish]] and [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]] Rivers, attracted by the [[salmon]] spawning in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle1.html|author=Hope Rutledge|title=Where to View Bald Eagles|accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:DollywoodBaldEagle.jpg|right|thumb|Bald Eagle at Eagle Mountain Sanctuary in [[Dollywood]] theme park]]
The Bald Eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on [[thermal|thermal convection currents]]. It reaches speeds of {{convert|56|–|70|km/h|mph|abbr=off|sp=us}} when gliding and flapping, and about {{convert|48|km/h|mph|sp=us}} while carrying fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;/&gt; Its dive speed is between {{convert|120|-|160|km/h|mph|abbr=off|sp=us}}, though it seldom dives vertically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagles.org/moreabout.html |title=Bald Eagle Facts and Information |publisher=Eagles.org |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2009-03-03| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730055210/http://www.eagles.org/moreabout.html| archivedate = July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. The Bald Eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of [[thermal]]s, [[updraft]]s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, when thermals are produced by the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;

===Diet===
The Bald Eagle's diet is opportunistic and varied, but most feed mainly on [[fish]]. In the [[Pacific Northwest]], spawning [[trout]] and [[salmon]] provide most of the Bald Eagles' diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Daum | first = David W. | title = Bald Eagle | publisher =Alaska Department of Fish &amp; Game | date = | url =http://www.adfg.state.ak.us/pubs/notebook/bird/eagles.php | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally, eagles may rely largely on [[carrion]], especially in winter, and they will scavenge carcasses up to the size of [[whale]]s, though it seems that carcasses of [[ungulate]]s and large [[fish]] are preferred. They also may sometimes feed on subsistence scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps. Mammalian prey includes [[rabbit]]s, [[hare]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[beaver]]s, and [[deer]] fawns. Preferred avian prey includes [[grebe]]s, [[alcid]]s, [[duck]]s, [[gull]]s, [[coot]]s, [[egret]]s, and [[geese]]. Most live prey are quite a bit smaller than the eagle, but predatory attacks on larger birds such as [[swan]]s have been recorded. [[Reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s and [[crustacean]]s (especially [[crab]]s) are preyed on when available.
[[File:Bald eagle fish.jpg|thumb|left|With a freshly caught fish.]]
To hunt fish, easily their most important live prey, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its [[talons]]. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have structures on their toes called spiricules that allow them to grasp fish. [[Osprey]] also have this adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Terres| first =J.

It may swim to safety, but some eagles drown or succumb to [[hypothermia]]. When competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing [[mammal]]s such as [[coyote]]s and [[fox]]es, and birds such as [[corvid]]s, [[gull]]s, [[vulture]]s and other [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s. Bald Eagles may be displaced by themselves or by [[Golden Eagle]]s. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the individual animal. Occasionally, Bald Eagles will steal fish and other prey away from smaller raptors, such as [[Osprey]]s, a practice known as [[kleptoparasitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jorde|first=D.G.|authorlink=|title=Kleptoparasitism by Bald Eagles wintering in South-Central Nebraska|journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|volume =59|issue=2|pages=183–188|year =1998 | url =http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/JFO/v059n02/p0183-p0188.pdf |format=PDF| doi = | id = | accessdate =2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy adult Bald Eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered apex predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-bald_eagle.html |title=San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: Bald Eagle |publisher=Sandiegozoo.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, an adult eagle investigating a [[Peregrine Falcon]] nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent Peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/660/articles/behavior |title=Cornell University |publisher=Bna.birds.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Dan Pancamo Baytown Bald Eagles Fall 2010-1.jpg|right|thumb|Bald Eagles mating]]
Bald Eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that Bald Eagles mate for life. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the other will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinterland&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Bald Eagle | author =R.F. Stocek | publisher =Canadian Wildlife Service | url =http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=27 | accessdate = 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bald Eagle courtship involves elaborate calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12202-32581--,00.html|publisher=Michigan Department of Natural Resources|title=Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) |accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} across and weigh {{convert|1|t|ST|abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}};&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; one nest in Florida was found to be {{convert|6.1|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, {{convert|2.9|m|ft|sp=us}} across, and to weigh {{convert|3|ST|t|1|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Erickson, L. |year=2007 |publisher=Journey North |url=http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/eagle/NestAbout1.html |title=Bald Eagle, About Bald Eagle Nests}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trails.com/arts/amazing-bird-records.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the Bald Eagle will nest on the ground. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, but it is rare for all three chicks to successfully fly. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs. The other parent will hunt for food or look for nesting material. The eggs average about {{convert|73|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and have a breadth of {{convert|55|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Terres | first =John K. | authorlink =John Kenneth Terres | title =The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds | publisher =Knopf | year =1980 | location =New York, NY | page =477 | doi = | isbn =0-394-46651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
===Population decline and recovery===
Once a common sight in much of the continent, the Bald Eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide [[DDT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Leslie |title=Birds of Prey: Their biology and ecology |page=226|year=1976 |publisher=Hamlyn |location= |isbn=0-600-31306-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bald Eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to [[biomagnification]]. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's [[calcium]] metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull87&quot;/&gt; It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the Bald Eagle population was 300,000–500,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bald Eagle Facts and Information | publisher = [[American eagle foundation]] | url=http://www.eagles.org/moreabout.html | accessdate=2008-01-03| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071206030939/http://www.eagles.org/moreabout.html| archivedate = December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the US.
Other factors in Bald Eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as illegal shooting, which was described as &quot;the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles,&quot; according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald Eagle populations have also been negatively affected by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milloy|first=Steven|title=Bald Eagle|publisher=Fox News|date = 2006-07-06|url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,202447,00.html|accessdate = 2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|1918 Migratory Bird Treaty]], later extended to all of North America. The 1940 Bald Eagle Protection Act in the U.S., which protected the Bald Eagle and the [[Golden Eagle]], prohibited commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The Bald Eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Also in 1972, DDT was banned in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =EPA press release | title = DDT Ban Takes Effect | publisher =United States Environmental Protection Agency | date = 1972-12-31 | url =http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/ddt/01.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Barrera, Jorge | title = Agent Orange has left deadly legacy Fight continues to ban pesticides and herbicides across Canada | date = 2005-07-04 | url =http://www.nben.ca/environews/media/mediaarchives/05/july/legacy.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus 38319.JPG|thumb|upright|First-year]]

With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The Bald Eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992;&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; the [[U.S. state]] with the largest resident population is [[Alaska]], with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] with 20,000–30,000 in 1992.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;

It was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, when it was reclassified from &quot;Endangered&quot; to &quot;Threatened.&quot; On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated &quot;To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.&quot; It was de-listed on June 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Bald Eagle Soars Off Endangered Species List | publisher =U.S. Department of the Interior | date =2007-06-28 | url =http://www.doi.gov/news/07_News_Releases/070628.html| accessdate =2007-08-27| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070713141429/http://www.doi.gov/news/07_News_Releases/070628.html| archivedate = July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been assigned a risk level of [[Least Concern]] category on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IUCN&quot;/&gt;

===In captivity===

[[License|Permits]] are required to keep Bald Eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles. Bald Eagles cannot legally be kept for [[falconry]] in the United States. As a rule, the Bald Eagle is a poor choice for public shows, being timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native American Tribes can obtain a &quot;Native American Religious Use&quot; permit to keep non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies. The Bald Eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maestrelli|first=John R.|title=Breeding Bald Eagles in Captivity|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|volume=87|issue=I|pages=|month =March|year=1975|url=http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:XHsa26srbBgJ:elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Wilson/v087n01/p0045-p0053.pdf+bald+eagle+%2B+breeding+in+captivity&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us|accessdate =2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, a license is required to keep Bald Eagles for [[falconry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997|publisher=Ministry of Attorney General|url=http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/ca733c6b-d473-44df-952a-203eb9829bcd/4/frame/?search=browseStatutes&amp;context=|accessdate =2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The national bird of the United States===
The Bald Eagle is the national bird of the United States of America. It appears on most of its official seals, including the [[Seal of the President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;4 U.S.C. § 41; [http://www.greatseal.com/symbols/eagle.html The Bald Eagle on the Great Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Continental Congress]] adopted the current design for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] including a Bald Eagle grasping 13 [[arrow]]s and a 13-leaf [[olive branch]] with its talons on June 20, 1782.&lt;ref name=&quot;seal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=5|title=Original Design of the Great Seal of the United States (1782)|accessdate= 2007-08-19 |publisher= National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The official description was in text only; no diagram was included. [http://www.greatseal.com/symbols/blazon.html Text of the Act].&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the [[Roman Republic]], in which eagle imagery was prominent.
[[File:Seal Of The President Of The United States Of America.svg|thumb|right|upright|[[Seal of the President of the United States]].]]

The Bald Eagle can be found on both national seals and on the back of several coins (including the [[Quarter (U.S. coin)|quarter]] dollar coin until 1999), with its head oriented towards the olive branch. Between 1916 and 1945, the [[Flag of the President of the United States|Presidential Flag]] showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the [[urban legend]] that the seal is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/turnhead.htm |title=A Turn of the Head|accessdate=2007-08-19|author= Mikkelson, Barbara &amp; Mikkelson, David P |publisher=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that [[Benjamin Franklin]] ever supported the [[Wild Turkey]] as a symbol of the United States over the Bald Eagle. The origin of this claim is a letter Franklin wrote to his daughter in 1784 from Paris. However, this letter was a criticism of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and never mentions the choice of the Bald Eagle for the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a [[order (decoration)|noble order]] which was unwelcome in the newly independent [[Republic]]. The reference to the two birds is a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]], for whom the Society was named. Franklin viewed the creation of the Society as being contrary to the ideals of Cincinnatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey |title=American Heraldry Society &amp;#124; MMM / The Arms of the United States: Benjamin Franklin and the Turkey |publisher=Americanheraldry.org |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in Native American culture===
[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An adult eagle landing on its [[bird nest|nest]]]]
The Bald Eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the [[Golden Eagle]], are central to many religious and [[Native American mythology|spiritual]] customs among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pequot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pequotmuseum.org/Home/CrossPaths/CrossPathsSpring2003/TheSacredMessengers.htm|author=Julie Collier|title=The Sacred Messengers|publisher=Mashantucket Pequot Museum|accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[pow wow]] dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. The [[Lakota people|Lakota]], for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melmer&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Melmer|first=David|title =Bald eagles may come off threatened list|publisher =Indian Country Today|date =2007-06-11|url =http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=1096415182|accessdate=2007-08-23| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070924211819/http://indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=1096415182| archivedate = September 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] scattered eagle down to welcome important guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown, Steven C; Averill, Lloyd J.|title=Sun Dogs and Eagle Down|publisher=University of Washington Press|url=http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/BROSUN.html|accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Choctaw]] explained that the Bald Eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, is a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=greg_obrien_eagle&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Greg|title=Choctaws in a Revolutionary Age, 1750-1830|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|chapter=Power Derived from the Outside World|page=58|isbn=0-8032-8622-8|year=2005|origyear=2002, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Sun Dance]], which is practiced by many [[Plains Indian]] tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a [[medicine man]] may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Lawrence, Elizabeth Atwood|title=The Symbolic Role of Animals in the Plains Indian Sun Dance|publisher=University of Washington Press|url=http://www.psyeta.org/sa/sa1.1/lawrence.html|accessdate=2007-08-23| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070716065757/http://www.psyeta.org/sa/sa1.1/lawrence.html| archivedate = July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current [[eagle feather law]] stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain Bald or Golden Eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeMeo|first=Antonia M.|title =Access to Eagles and Eagle Parts: Environmental Protection v.

The '''brown bear''' ('''''Ursus arctos''''') is a large [[bear]] distributed across much of northern [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. It can weigh from {{convert|300|to|780|kg|lb}} and its largest subspecies, the [[Kodiak Bear]], rivals the [[polar bear]] as the largest member of the bear family&lt;ref name=&quot;kodiak&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/polar_bear.pdf |format=PDF |title=Polar bear, (Ursus maritimus) |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife service |accessdate=2008-03-22 |quote=Appearance. The polar bear is the largest member of the bear family, with the exception of Alaska's Kodiak brown bears, which equal polar bears in size.}} ([http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/SpeciesReport.do?spcode=A0IJ Overview page])&lt;/ref&gt; and as the largest land-based predator.&lt;ref name=&quot;boddington&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Fair Chase in North America | author = Craig Boddington, illustrations by Ken Carlson | edition = illustrated | publisher = [[Boone and Crockett Club]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0940864479, 9780940864474 | page = 45 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Rri8xdwgdQ0C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=largest+predator+bear }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several recognized subspecies within the brown bear species. In North America, two types are generally recognized, the coastal brown bear and the inland grizzly, and the two types could broadly define all brown bear subspecies. Grizzlies weigh as little as 350&amp;nbsp;lb (159&amp;nbsp;kg) in [[Yukon]], while a brown bear, living on a steady, nutritious diet of spawning [[salmon]], from coastal [[Alaska]] and [[Russia]] can weigh 1,500&amp;nbsp;lb (682&amp;nbsp;kg). The exact number of overall brown subspecies remains in debate.

While the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a [[least concern]] species by the [[IUCN]], with a total population of approximately 200,000. Its principal range countries are [[Russia]], the [[United States]] (mostly in [[Alaska]]), [[Canada]], the [[Carpathian]] region (especially [[Romania]], but also [[Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]], and so on), the [[Balkans]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], where it is the national animal. The brown bear is the most widely distributed of all bears.

==Naming and etymology==
The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the ''[[bruin]]'', from [[Middle English]], based on the name of the bear in ''History of [[Reynard the Fox]]'', translated by [[William Caxton]], from [[Middle Dutch]] ''bruun'' or ''bruyn'', meaning ''[[brown]]'' (the color).&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Old West]], the grizzly was termed &quot;Old Ephraim&quot; and sometimes as &quot;Moccasin Joe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rooseeltv&quot;&gt;[http://www.fullbooks.com/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches1.html Hunting the Grisly and other Sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Brown bears are thought to have evolved from ''Ursus etruscus''. The oldest fossils occur in China from about 0.5 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]]. They entered Europe about 250,000 years ago, and North Africa shortly after. Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the [[British Isles]], where it is thought they outcompeted [[cave bear]]s. The species entered Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;/&gt; It is thought brown bears were unable to migrate south until the extinction of the much larger ''[[Arctodus simus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;/&gt; Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: grizzlies are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula. Brown bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;Bruce McLellan and David C. Reiner (1994). [http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_9/McLellan_Reiner_Vol_9.pdf A Review of bear evolution] Int. Conf. Bear Res. and Manage. 9(1):85–96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subspecies===
There is little agreement on classification of brown bears. Some systems have proposed as many as 90 subspecies, while recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five clades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designating the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Population of Grizzly Bears as a Distinct Population Segment; Removing the Yellowstone Distinct Population Segment of Grizzly Bears From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife |accessdate=August 1, 2006 |author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=2006-11-17 |publisher=Federal Register / Vol. 70, No. 221 |pages=69854–69884 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060825042929/http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |archivedate = August 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA analysis recently revealed that the identified subspecies of brown bears, both Eurasian and North American, are genetically quite homogeneous, and that their genetic [[phylogeography]] does not correspond to their traditional taxonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waits&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnrhome.uidaho.edu/documents/Waits%20et%20al%201998%20cb.pdf&amp;pid=78496&amp;doc=1 |title=Mitochondrial DNA Phylogeography of the North American Brown Bear and Implications for Conservation|accessdate=August 1, 2006 |author=Lisette P.

===Hybrids===
{{Main|Grizzly–polar bear hybrid}}
A grizzly–polar bear hybrid (known as a ''pizzly Bear'' or ''grolar bear'') is a rare [[ursid hybrid]] resulting from a union of a brown bear and a [[polar bear]]. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the [[DNA]] of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[arctic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;msn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12738644/?GT1=8199 |title=Wild find: Half grizzly, half polar bear: Hunter bags what expert 'never thought would happen' in wild |publisher=MSNBC.MSN.com |date=May 11, 2006 |accessdate=2006-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mallet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hybridization, ecological races and the nature of species: empirical evidence for the ease of speciation |author=[[James Mallet]] |year=2008 |issue=  1506|pages=2971–2986 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0081 |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Phil.

| valign=&quot;top&quot; | Until recently, this bear was considered a separate species. Today, it is considered to belong to the ''[[European Brown Bear|U. arctos arctos]]'' subspecies. Scientific evidence based on DNA studies would furthermore indicate the European brown bear can be divided into two distinct lineages. &quot;There is a clear division into two main mitochondrial lineages in modern European brown bear populations. These populations are divided into those carrying an eastern lineage (clade IIIa, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of Russian, northern Scandinavian and eastern European populations, and those carrying a western lineage (clade I, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of two subgroups, one believed to originate from the Iberian Peninsula, including southern Scandinavian bears and the Pyreneean populations; and the other from the Italian–Balkan peninsulas (Taberlet et al. 1994; see however Kohn et al. 1995). In addition, based on the subfossil record in northwestern Moldova and mitochondrial DNA data from modern populations, a Carpathian refuge has also been proposed (Sommer &amp; Benecke 2005; Saarma et al. 2007).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/macepdf/VALDIOSERA_ME07_Bears.pdf Staying out in the cold: glacial refugia and mitochondrial DNA phylogeography in ancient European brown bears], &quot;Molecular Ecology&quot;, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2007, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brown bear is the largest animal on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], although one of the smallest of the brown bears, since males rarely surpass 180&amp;nbsp;kg and adult females average 130&amp;nbsp;kg. Their fur varies from a pale cream color to dark brown, but always with a distinctively darker, nearly black tone at the paws and a yellowish tinge at the tip of each hair. The brown bear population is considered [[Endangered species|endangered]] in Spain. 

The brown bear population in the [[Pyrenees]] stems mostly from bears reintroduced from [[Slovenia]], with one or two remaining original males.&lt;ref name=&quot;La recuperació del rei dels boscos&quot;/&gt;

==Physical description==
[[File:Bearclaw2.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear claws are longer and less curved than those of black bears]]
[[File:Bear skull.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear skull]]
Brown bears have very large and curved claws, those present on the forelimbs being longer than those on the hind limbs. They may reach {{Convert|5|to|6|cm|in|sigfig=2}} and sometimes {{Convert|7|to|10|cm|in|sigfig=2}} along the curve.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;&gt;''Mammals of the Soviet Union'' Vol.II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), V.G Heptner and N.P Naumov editors, Science Publishers, Inc. USA. 1998. ISBN 1-886106-81-9&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally dark with a light tip, with some forms having completely light claws.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Brown bear claws are longer and straighter than those of American black bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;''Bear Anatomy and Physiology'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons &amp; Burford, Publishers, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The claws are blunt, while those of a black bear are sharp.

Adults have massive, heavily built [[wikt:concave|concave]] skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The forehead is high and rises steeply.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; The projections of the skull are well developed when compared to those of [[Asian black bear]]s: the latter have [[sagittal crest]]s not exceeding more than 19–20% of the total length of the skull, while the former have sagittal crests comprising up to 40–41% of the skull's length. Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The [[braincase]] is relatively small and elongated. There is a great deal of geographical variation in the skull, and presents itself chiefly in dimensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Grizzlies, for example, tend to have flatter profiles than European and coastal American brown bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;living&quot;/&gt; Skull lengths of Russian bears tend to be {{Convert|31.5|to|45.5|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for males, and {{Convert|27.5|to|39.7|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for females. The width of the [[zygomatic arch]]es in males is {{Convert|17.5|to|27.7|cm|in|sigfig=2}}, and {{Convert|14.7|to|24.7|cm|in|sigfig=2}} in females.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Brown bears have very strong teeth: the [[incisors]] are relatively big and the [[canine teeth]] are large, the lower ones being strongly curved. The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of the alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Although they have powerful jaws, brown bear jaws are incapable of breaking large bones with the ease of [[spotted hyena]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/~ecmwww/journal/smi/pdf/smi99-37.pdf ''ENAMEL MICROSTRUCTURAL SPECIALIZATION IN THE CANINE OF THE SPOTTED HYENA, CROCUTA CROCUTA'', John M.

The dimensions of brown bears fluctuate very greatly according to sex, age, individual, geographic location, and season. The normal range of physical dimensions for a brown bear is a head-and-body length of 1.7 to 2.8 meters (5.6 to 9.2&amp;nbsp;ft) and a shoulder height of 90 to 150 centimeters (35–60&amp;nbsp;in). The smallest subspecies is the [[Eurasian brown bear]], whose mature females weigh as little as {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats.

The largest subspecies are the [[Kodiak bear]], [[Siberian Brown Bear|Siberian brown bear]], and the bears from coastal Russia, Alaska, and British Columbia. It is not unusual for large males in coastal regions to stand over {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} while on their hind legs, and to weigh up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=bears.trivia |publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Wildlife Conservation |year=2008 |title=Kodiak Bear Fact Sheet |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heaviest recorded brown bear weighed over {{Convert|1150|kg|lb|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

Brown bears have long, thick fur, with a moderately long mane at the back of the neck. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver tips, while in China, brown bears are bicolored with a yellow-brown or whitish cape across the shoulders. North American grizzlies can be dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish brown. Black hairs usually have white tips.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; The winter fur is very thick and long, especially in northern subspecies, and can reach {{Convert|11|to|12|cm|in|sigfig=1}} at the [[withers]]. The winter hairs are thin, yet rough to the touch. The summer fur is much shorter and sparser, and its length and density varies geographically.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Brown bear seaguls.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Brown bear at Brooks Falls]]
There are about 200,000 brown bears in the world. The largest populations are in Russia with 120,000, the United States with 32,500, and [[Canada]] with 21,750. About 95% of the brown bear population in the United States is in Alaska, though in the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly but steadily along the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and the western [[Great Plains]]. Although many people hold the belief some brown bears may be present in [[Mexico]] and the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]], both are almost certainly extinct. The last Mexican brown bear was shot in 1960. In [[Europe]], there are 14,000&amp;nbsp;brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from [[Spain]] (estimated at only 20-25 animals in the [[Pyrenees]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/societat/20100802/neixen-quatre-cries-dos-bru-als-pirineus/416750.shtml | title = Neixen quatre cries d'ós bru als Pirineus | accessdate = 2010-11-19 | language = [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://margalloecologistes.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/situacio-preocupant-de-los-bru-als-pirineus/ | title = Situació preocupant de l'ós bru als Pirineus | accessdate = 2010-11-19 | language = [[Catalan language|Catalan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a range shared between [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Andorra]], and some 85-90 animals in [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[León]], in the [[Picos de Europa]] and adjacent areas in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.consumer.es/web/es/medio_ambiente/2003/06/26/62830.php | title = La población del oso pardo en España se reduce a 90 ejemplares | accessdate = 2010-11-19 | language = [[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some 100 animals in 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;La recuperació del rei dels boscos&quot;/&gt;) in the west, to [[Russia]] in the east, and from [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] in the north to [[Romania]] (4000–5000), [[Bulgaria]] (900–1200), [[Slovakia]] (with about 600–800 animals), [[Slovenia]] (500-700 animals)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medvedi.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=86&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greece]] (with about 200 animals) in the south. They are extinct in the [[British Isles]], extremely threatened in [[France]] and [[Spain]], and in trouble over most of [[Central Europe]]. The Carpathian brown bear population of [[Romania]] is the largest in Europe outside Russia, estimated at 4,500 to 5,000 bears, although declining alarmingly due to overhunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://proaction.tripod.com/localcampaigns/id26.html | title = Proact Local Campaigns: Carpathian Brown Bear | accessdate = 2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a smaller brown bear population in the Carpathian Mountains in [[Ukraine]] (estimated at about 200 in 2005), [[Slovakia]] and [[Poland]] (estimated at about 100 in 2009 in the latter country).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://carpathianbear.pl/en/projects/management-plan | title = Carpathian Brown Bear Management Plan [in Poland]| accessdate = 2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total Carpathian population is estimated at about 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/species/profiles/mammals/brown_bear2/brownbear_population_distribution/ | title = Brown Bear - Population &amp; Distribution: A Truly International Species| accessdate = 2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Europe]] is home to a large bear population, with an estimated 2,500 (range 2,350–2,900) in [[Sweden]], about 1,600 in [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.suurpedot.fi/www/fi/lajit/karhu/index.php | title = Suurpedot.fi – Karhu | accessdate = 2010-10-22 | language = finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 700 in [[Estonia]] and 70 in [[Norway]]. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500–3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kora.ch/sp-ois/bear-ois/index.htm Bear Online Information System for Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown bears were once native to [[Asia]], the [[Atlas Mountains]] in [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4003325.stm |title=Ancient bear made early migration |work=[[BBC News]] |date=November 12, 2004 |accessdate=January 2, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but are now [[extinct]] in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas. They prefer semiopen country, usually in mountainous areas.

Brown bears live in [[Alaska]], east through the [[Yukon]] and [[Northwest Territories]], south through [[British Columbia]] and through the western half of [[Alberta]]. Small populations exist in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]] of northwest [[Wyoming]] (with about 600 animals), the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem of northwest [[Montana]] (with about 750 animals), the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem of northwest Montana and northeast [[Idaho]] (with about 30–40 animals), the Selkirk Ecosystem of northeast [[Washington state|Washington]] and northwest Idaho (with about 40–50 animals), and the North Cascades Ecosystem of northcentral Washington (with about 5–10 animals). These five ecosystems combine for a total of roughly 1,470 wild grizzlies still persisting in the contiguous United States. Unfortunately, these populations are isolated from each other, inhibiting any genetic flow between ecosystems. This poses one of the greatest threats to the future survival of the grizzly bear in the contiguous United States.

In [[Asia]], brown bears are found in most of Russia, parts of the [[Middle East]], and in a small area of [[Manchuria]] in [[China]]. They can also be found on the island of [[Hokkaidō]] in [[Japan]], western China, and parts of [[North Korea]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[India]]. 

The population of brown bears in the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range between [[France]] and [[Spain]] is so low, estimated at 14 to 18, with a shortage of females, that bears, mostly female, from [[Slovenia]] were released in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species' presence in the area, despite protests from French farmers.

A small population of brown bears ([[Ursus arctos marsicanus]]) still lives in central Italy (Apennine mountains, Abruzzo and Latium), with no more than 70 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.

In [[Arctic]] areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing. The [[global warming|warming of that region]] has allowed the species to move farther north into what was once exclusively the domain of the [[polar bear]]. In non-Arctic areas, habitat loss is blamed as the leading cause of endangerment, followed by hunting.

North American brown bears, or [[grizzly bears]], seem to prefer open landscapes, whereas in Eurasia they inhabit mostly dense forests. It is thought the Eurasian bears which colonized America were [[tundra]]-adapted. This is indicated by brown bears in the [[Chukotka Peninsula]] on the Asian side of Bering Strait, which are the only Asian brown bears to live year-round in lowland tundra like their North American cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbearhunt.com/ |title=Brown Bear Hunting in Russia |publisher=Russianbearhunt.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
The brown bear is primarily [[nocturnal]]. In the summer, it gains up to {{Convert|180|kg|lb}} of [[fat]], on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes very lethargic. Although they are not full [[hibernation|hibernators]], and can be woken easily; both sexes like to [[maternity den|den]] in a protected spot, such as a [[cave]], crevice, or hollow log, during the winter months. Brown bears are mostly solitary, although they may gather in large numbers at major food sources and form social hierarchies based on age and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egbert | first1 = Allan L. | last2 = Stokes | first2 = Allen W. | year = 1974 | title = The social behaviour of brown bears on an Alaskan salmon stream | url =http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_3/Egbert_Stokes_Egbert_Vol_3.pdf | format=PDF | journal = International Conference Bear Res. and Manage | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 41–56 | jstor=3872753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult male bears are particularly aggressive and are avoided by adolescent and subadult males. Female bears with cubs rival adult males in aggression, and are more intolerant of other bears than single females. Young adolescent males tend to be least aggressive, and have been observed in nonagonistic interactions with each other. In his ''Great Bear Almanac'', Gary Brown lists 11 different sounds bears produce in 9 different contexts. Sounds expressing anger or aggravation include growls, roars, woofs, champs and smacks, while sounds expressing nervousness or pain include woofs, grunts and bawls. Sows will bleat or hum when communicating with their cubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

===Reproduction===

The mating season is from late May to early July. Being serially [[monogamous]], brown bears remain with the same mate from several days to a couple of weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bear-hunting.org/types-of-bears/ Types of Bears] – Information on Specific Bear Species (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Females mature sexually between the age of 5 and 7 years, while males usually mate a few years later, when they are large and strong enough to successfully compete with other males for mating rights.

Through the process of [[delayed implantation]], a female's fertilized egg divides and floats freely in the uterus for six months. During winter dormancy, the fetus attaches to the [[uterus|uterine]] wall. The cubs are born eight weeks later, while the mother sleeps. If the mother does not gain enough weight to survive through the winter, the embryo does not implant and is reabsorbed into the body. The average litter has one to four cubs, usually two. There have been cases of bears with five cubs, although females sometimes adopt stray cubs. Older females tend to give birth to larger litters. The size of a litter also depends on factors such as geographic location and food supply. At birth, the cubs are blind, toothless, hairless, and weigh less than {{Convert|450|g|lb|sigfig=1}}. They feed on their mother's milk until spring or even early summer, depending on climate conditions. At this time, the cubs weigh {{Convert|7|to|9|kg|lb}} and have developed enough to follow her and begin to forage for solid food.

Cubs remain with their mother from two to four years, during which time they learn survival techniques, such as which foods have the highest nutritional values and where to obtain them; how to hunt, fish, and defend themselves; and where to den. The cubs learn by following and imitating their mother's actions during the period they are with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowofthebear.com/reproduction.html |title=Brown Bear Reproduction |publisher=Shadowofthebear.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080501092730/http://www.shadowofthebear.com/reproduction.html |archivedate = May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears practice [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01152.x | title = Mating Strategies in Relation to Sexually Selected Infanticide in a Non-Social Carnivore: The Brown Bear | year = 2006 | last1 = Bellemain | first1 = Eva | last2 = Swenson | first2 = Jon E. | last3 = Taberlet | first3 = Pierre | journal = Ethology | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 238–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An adult male bear may kill the cubs of another bear either to make the female sexually receptive or simply for consumption. Cubs flee up a tree when they see a strange male bear, and the mother defends them, even though the male may be twice her size.

===Dietary habits===
[[File:Brown Bear Feeding on Salmon.jpg|thumb|150px|Brown bear feeding on [[salmon]]]]
They are [[omnivore]]s and feed on a variety of plant products, including berries, [[root]]s, and [[shoot|sprout]]s, and [[fungi]], as well as meat products such as [[fish]], [[insect]]s, and small [[mammal]]s. Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary [[food energy]] from vegetable matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |title=Alaska Office of Economic Development |publisher=Dced.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity. For example, bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of [[moth]]s during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 in a day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowstonepark.com/MoreToKnow/ShowNewsDetails.aspx?newsid=163 |title=Yellowstone Grizzly Bears Eat 40,000 Moths a Day In August |publisher=Yellowstonepark.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas of Russia and Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning [[salmon]], whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas. Brown bears also occasionally prey on large mammals, such as [[deer]] (including [[elk]], [[moose]] and [[caribou]]), [[bighorn sheep]], [[mountain goat]]s, [[bison]] and [[muskoxen]]. When brown bears attack these animals, they tend to choose the young ones, as they are easier to catch. When hunting, the bear pins its prey to the ground and then tears and eats it alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=French |first1= S. P. |last2= French |first2=M. G. |title=Predatory behavior of grizzly bears feeding on elk calves in Yellowstone National Park, 1986–1988 |year=  1990 |journal=International Conf.

They also feed on [[carrion]], and use their size to intimidate other predators, such as [[wolf|wolves]], [[cougar]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[black bear]]s from their kills.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
[[File:Wolfbear.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear being followed by a [[wolf]]]]
Brown bears often use their large size for intimidation when a kill or a territory is in dispute with another large predator and they are normally dominant in such interactions. Sometimes, the conflict will escalate to the point of violence, but usually threat displays are sufficient, since most animals try to avoid potential bodily harm. However, the massive strength and size of the brown bear will usually result in it winning violent conflicts, even against wolf packs and Siberian Tigers. In situations where the interspecies conflict turns deadly, brown bears may also eat the competitor, despite it not being the primary reason for attack.

Brown bears regularly intimidate [[wolf|wolves]] away from their kills. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], brown bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project Director Doug Smith wrote, &quot;It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when.&quot; Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. Given the opportunity, both species prey on the other's cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Betsy Downey |title=Personal Encounter. Wolf-Grizzly interaction in Yellowstone National Park |publisher=[[International Wolf Center]] |url=http://www.wolf.org/wolves/news/iwmag/2006/spring/personalencounter.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conclusively, the individual power of the bear against the collective strength of the wolf pack usually results in a long battle for kills or domination. In some areas, the brown bear also regularly displaces [[cougar]]s from their kills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/pss/3873109&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult bears are generally immune from predatory attacks from anything other than other bears. Some bears emerging from hibernation seek tigers to steal their kills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tigersnow&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthiessen |first=Peter |coauthors=Hornocker, Maurice |year=2001 |title=Tigers In The Snow |publisher=North Point Press |isbn=0865475962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Russian Far East]] brown bears along with smaller [[Asiatic black bear]]s constitute 5–8% of the diet of [[Siberian tiger]]s. In particular, the brown bear's input is estimated to be 1.0–1.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;der-tiger&quot;&gt;Vratislav Mazak: ''Der Tiger''. Nachdruck der 3. Auflage von 1983.

Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, [[American black bear]]s are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the brown bear's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/upload/predation.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |title=Probable grizzly bear predation on an American black bear in Yellowstone National Park |author=Kerry A.

There has been a recent increase in interactions between brown bears and [[polar bear]]s, theorized to be caused by [[climate change]]. Brown bears have been seen moving increasingly northward into territories formerly claimed by polar bears. Brown bears tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwb.adn.com/front/story/6415667p-6294323c.html adn.com | front: Polar bears, grizzlies increasingly gather on North Slope&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/DyeHard/Story?id=582243&amp;page=3 |title=ABC News: Grizzlies Encroaching on Polar Bear Country |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:BärenspurP1050395.jpg|thumb|Front [[paw]] imprint]]
[[File:Grizzly rear paw print.jpg|thumb|Rear paw imprint]]
Bears become attracted to human-created food sources, such as garbage dumps, litter bins, and dumpsters; they venture into human dwellings or [[barn]]s in search of food as humans encroach into bear habitats. In the U.S., bears sometimes kill and eat farm animals. When bears come to associate human activity with a &quot;food reward&quot;, they are likely to continue to become emboldened; the likelihood of human-bear encounters increases, as they may return to the same location despite relocation. The saying,''' &quot;a fed bear is a dead bear&quot;''', has come into use to popularize the idea that allowing bears to scavenge human garbage, such as trash cans and campers' backpacks, [[pet food]], or other food sources that draw the bear into contact with humans, can result in a bear's death.

Relocation of the bear has been used to separate the bear from the human environment, but it does not address the problem of the bear's newly-learned association of humans with food or the environmental situations which created the human-habituated bear. &quot;Placing a bear in habitat used by other bears may lead to competition and social conflict, and result in the injury or death of the less dominant bear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html |title=http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html |accessdate= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yellowstone National Park]], an enormous reserve located in the western United States, contains prime habitat for the grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), and due to the enormous number of visitors, human-bear encounters are common. The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already endangered species. The grizzly bear is officially described as &quot;threatened&quot; in the U.S. Though the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.

In Europe, part of the problem lies with [[shepherd]]s; over the past two centuries, many sheep and goat herders have gradually abandoned the more traditional practice of using [[dog]]s to guard flocks, which have concurrently grown larger. Typically, they allow the herds to graze freely over sizeable tracts of land. As bears reclaim parts of their range, they may eat livestock. In some cases, the shepherds shoot the bear, thinking their livelihood is under threat. Many are now better informed about the ample compensation available, and will make a claim when they lose livestock to a bear.

===Legal status===
* The grizzly bear, sometimes called the ''silvertip bear'', is listed as threatened in the [[contiguous United States]]. It is slowly repopulating in areas where it was previously extirpated, though it is still vulnerable.

The bear is alluded to in the names of the sports teams of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (the [[California Golden Bears]]), and of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (the [[UCLA Bruins]]) and in the mascot of [[University of California, Riverside]] (Scottie the Bear, dressed in a Highland [[kilt]]).
* The Mexican grizzly bear is listed as an [[endangered species]], but it may be extinct.
* In Canada, it is listed as vulnerable in Alberta, British Columbia, Northwest Territories, and Yukon Territory. Prairie populations of grizzly bear are listed as extirpated in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.

* The brown bear is also the national animal of [[Finland]].
* The brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] coin, minted since 1993.

===Bear encounters===
There are an average of two fatal attacks by bears per year in North America.&lt;ref&gt;''Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance'', [[Stephen Herrero]], revised edition, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scandinavia]], there are only four known cases since 1902 of bear encounters which have resulted in death. The two most common causes for bear attack are surprise and curiosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;akscience&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.absc.usgs.gov/research/brownbears/attacks/bear-human_conflicts.htm |title=Ursus arctos californicus |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |author=WTom S. Smith, Ph.D. and Steven Herrero, Ph.D. |publisher=Alaska Science Center – Biological Science Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of bears, such as polar bears, are more likely to attack humans when searching for food, while [[American black bear]]s are much less likely to attack.

The Alaska Science Center ranks the following as the most likely reasons for bear attacks:&lt;ref name=&quot;akscience&quot; /&gt;
# Surprise
# Curiosity
# Invaded personal space (this includes a mother bear protecting her young)
# Predatory intent
# Hunting wounded
# Carcass defense
# Provoked charge

Aggressive behavior in brown bears is favored by numerous selection variables. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult brown bears are too large to escape danger by climbing trees, so they respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased aggressiveness also assists female brown bears in better ensuring the survival of their young to reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2004/04/04-27-04tdc/04-27-04dscihealth-column-01.asp Why are grizzly bears more aggressive than our black bears?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of brown bear-caused human fatalities in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bear.org/Black/Articles/How_Dangerous_are_Black_Bears.html How Dangerous are Black Bears&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on humans===
[[File:Bear trap GTNP1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A drum or barrel trap used to safely relocate bears parked adjacent to a building in [[Grand Teton National Park]] in [[Wyoming]] in the [[United States]]]]
As a rule, brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and will attack if they are surprised or feel threatened.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;''Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance'' by Stephen Herrero, Hurtig Publishers Ltd./ Edmonton 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Sows with cubs account for the majority of injuries and fatalities in North America. [[Habituation|Habituated]] or food-conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and, in some cases, to associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with no attacks being recorded against parties of six people or more. In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound,&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; and seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to &quot;disarm&quot; their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;/&gt; Such a bite can be as severe as that of a tiger, with some human victims having had their heads completely crushed by a bear bite.&lt;ref name=&quot;living&quot;&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/livinganimalsofw01cornrich#page/n7/mode/2up ''The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations'' Volume 1: Mammals, by Cornish, C.

People who assert their presence through noises tend to be less vulnerable, as they alert bears to their presence. In direct confrontations, people who run are statistically more likely to be attacked than those who stand their ground. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last only a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt;

Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the [[former Soviet Union]], though exceptions exist in districts where they are not pursued by hunters.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Siberian bears, for example, tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more persecuted European counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iugb-moscow2009.ru/cd/doc_eng/pz1/Baskin_docladP1_eng.pdf WOLVES, BEARS AND HUMAN ANTI-PREDATOR ADAPTATIONS]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a [[platinum]] mining compound in the Olyotorsky district of northern Kamchatka was besieged by a group of 30 bears, who killed two guards and prevented workers from leaving their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4387144.ece Bears besiege Russian mine after killing guards]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people a year are killed by brown bears in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dinets.travel.ru/russianbears.htm Brown Bears of Russia]&lt;/ref&gt; In Scandinavia, only three fatal attacks were recorded in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;britbear&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.toothandclaw.org.uk/species.asp | title = Brown Bear | work = | publisher = Tooth &amp; Claw| accessdate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, a large brown bear nicknamed &quot;''Kesagake''&quot; (袈裟懸け, &quot;[[Kesa (clothing)|kesa]]-style slasher&quot;) made history for causing the [[Sankebetsu brown bear incident|worst bear attack in Japanese history]] at [[Tomamae, Hokkaidō]] during December, 1915, killing seven people (including one pregnant woman) and wounding three others (with possibly another three previous fatalities to its credit) before being gunned down after a large-scale beast-hunt. Today, there is still a shrine at Rokusensawa (六線沢), where the event took place, in memory of the victims of the incident.

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes sympatric to brown bears often viewed them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the Natives, they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When Natives hunted grizzlies, the act was done with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4–10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Indians actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of Natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnr.uidaho.edu/wlf520/pdf/geist.pdf Did Large Predators keep Humans out of North America?]&lt;/ref&gt; Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through to the 1950s, though it increased to four per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to one injury every two years during the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2002, there have been only two human injuries caused by grizzly bears in a developed area. Though grizzly attacks were rare in the backcountry before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately one per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowstone-bearman.com/yell_bear_maul_info.html Bear Caused Human Injuries and Deaths In Yellowstone National Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of defense from bears===
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2010}}
A study by Canadian and US researchers has found [[pepper spray]] to be more effective at stopping aggressive bear behavior than guns, working in 92% of studied incidents versus 67% for guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying pepper spray is highly recommended by many authorities when traveling in bear country; however, carrying two means of deterrent, one of which is a large caliber gun, is also advised. Solid shotgun slugs, or three buckshot rounds, or a semiautomatic pistol of .45 caliber or more is suggested if a heavy hunting rifle is not available. Guns remain a viable, last resort option to be used in defense of life from aggressive bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith_brown_bear_projects&quot;&gt;{{cite web

According to the Alaska Science Center, a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12 gauge]] [[shotgun]] with [[slug (projectile)|slugs]] has been the most effective weapon. There have been fewer injuries as a result of only carrying lethal loads in the shotgun, as opposed to deterrent rounds.

Campers are often told to wear bright colored red ribbons and bells, and carry whistles to ward off bears. They are told to look for grizzly scat in camping areas, and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly scat is difficult to differentiate from black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.

===Culture===
Many Native American tribes both respected and feared the brown bear, even thinking of it as a god.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.support-native-american-art.com/Native-American-Animal-Symbols-Bears.html Native American Animal Symbols – The Bear]&lt;/ref&gt; One tale tells of how the black bear was a creation of the [[Great Spirit]], while the grizzly was created by the Evil Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Folklore and Legends of the North American Indian'' compiled by Joshua B Lippincott, published by Abela Publishing Ltd, 2009, ISBN 0-9560584-6-9&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kwakiutl]] mythology, black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy. Black Bear Woman's children, in turn, killed Grizzly Bear Woman's own cubs.&lt;ref&gt;''Kwakiutl String Figures'' Julia P. Averkieva and Mark A. Sherman, published by UBC Press, 1992, ISBN 0-7748-0432-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[grizzly bear]] is the state animal of both [[Montana]] and [[California]].

Brown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. &quot;[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]&quot; is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear, and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With &quot;[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]&quot;, a story from England, the three bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of [[Snow White and Rose Red]]; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book [[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?]] to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals.

The [[Russian bear]] is a common [[national personification]] for [[Russia]] (as well as the [[Soviet Union]]). The brown bear is also [[Germany]]'s and [[Finland]]'s national animal.

The school mascot for each of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[University of Alberta]] is the brown bear.

The coat of arms of [[Madrid]] depicts a bear reaching up into a ''madroño'' or [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'') to eat some of its fruit, whereas the Swiss city of [[Bern]]'s coat of arms also depicts a bear and the city's name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear. 

In the town of [[Prats de Molló]], in [[Vallespir]], [[Northern Catalonia]], a &quot;bear festival&quot; (''festa de l'ós'') is celebrated annually at the beginning of spring, in which the locals dress up as bears, cover themselves with soot or coal and oil, and &quot;attack&quot; the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. The festival ends with the ''ball de l'os'' (bear dance).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''BCS theory''' &amp;mdash; proposed by [[John Bardeen|Bardeen]], [[Leon Neil Cooper|Cooper]], and [[John Robert Schrieffer|Schrieffer]] in 1957 &amp;mdash; is the first [[microscopic theory]] of [[superconductivity]] since its discovery in 1911. The theory describes [[superconductivity]] as a microscopic effect caused by a &quot;condensation&quot; of [[Cooper pair|pairs of electrons]] into a [[boson]]-like state.

==History==
The mid-1950s saw rapid progress in the understanding of superconductivity.  It began in the 1948 paper, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v74/i5/p562_1 On the Problem of the Molecular Theory of Superconductivity] where [[Fritz London]] proposed that the phenomenological [[London equations]] may be consequences of the [[quantum coherence|coherence]] of a [[quantum state]].  In 1953, [[Brian Pippard]], motivated by penetration experiments, proposed that this would modify the London equations via a new scale parameter called the [[coherence length]].  [[John Bardeen]] then argued in the 1955 paper, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v97/i6/p1724_1 Theory of the Meissner Effect in Superconductors] that such a modification naturally occurs in a theory with an energy gap.  The key ingredient was [[Leon Neil Cooper]]'s calculation of the bound states of electrons subject to an attractive force in his 1956 paper, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v104/i4/p1189_1 Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas].  

In 1957 Bardeen and Cooper assembled these ingredients and constructed such a theory, the BCS theory, with [[John Robert Schrieffer|Robert Schrieffer]].  The theory was first announced in February 1957 in the letter, [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=PHRVA,106,162  Microscopic theory of superconductivity].    The demonstration that the phase transition is second order, that it reproduces the Meissner effect and the calculations of specific heats and penetration depths appeared in the July 1957 article, [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=PHRVA,108,1175  Theory of superconductivity].  They received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1972 for this theory.  The 1950 [[Landau-Ginzburg theory]] of superconductivity is not cited in either of the BCS papers.

In 1986,  &quot;[[high-temperature superconductivity]]&quot; was  discovered (i.e. superconductivity at temperatures considerably above the previous limit of about 30&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]; up to about 130&amp;nbsp;K). It is believed that at these temperatures other effects are at play; these effects are not yet fully understood. (It is possible that these unknown effects also control superconductivity even at low temperatures for some
materials).

==Overview==
At sufficiently low temperatures, electrons near the [[Fermi surface]] become unstable against the formation of [[Cooper pair]]s. Cooper showed such binding will occur in the presence of an attractive potential, no matter how weak. In conventional superconductors, an attraction is generally attributed to an electron-lattice interaction. The BCS theory, however, requires only that the potential be attractive, regardless of its origin. In the BCS framework, superconductivity is a macroscopic effect which results from &quot;condensation&quot; of Cooper pairs. These have some bosonic properties, while bosons, at sufficiently low temperature, can form a large [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]. Superconductivity was simultaneously explained by [[Nikolay Bogoliubov]], by means of the so-called [[Bogoliubov transformation]]s. 

In many superconductors, the attractive interaction between electrons (necessary for pairing) is brought about indirectly by the interaction between the electrons and the vibrating crystal lattice (the [[phonon]]s). Roughly speaking the picture is the following:

An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice.  This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite &quot;spin&quot;, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. There are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, so that they overlap very strongly, forming a highly collective &quot;condensate&quot;. Breaking of one pair results in changing of energies of remained macroscopic number of pairs. If the required energy is higher than the energy provided by kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which is true at low temperatures), then the electrons will stay paired and resist all kicks, thus not experiencing resistance. Thus, the collective behaviour of &quot;condensate&quot; is a crucial ingredient of superconductivity.

===More details===
BCS theory starts from the assumption that there is some attraction between electrons, which can overcome the [[Coulomb repulsion]]. In most materials (in low temperature superconductors), this attraction is brought about indirectly by the coupling of electrons to the [[crystal lattice]] (as explained above). However, the results of BCS theory do ''not'' depend on the origin of the attractive interaction. The original results of BCS (discussed below) described an &quot;[[s-wave]]&quot; superconducting state, which is the rule among low-temperature superconductors but is not realized in many &quot;unconventional superconductors&quot;, such as the &quot;[[Atomic orbital|d-wave]]&quot; high-temperature superconductors.
Extensions of BCS theory exist to describe these other cases, although they are insufficient to completely describe the observed features of [[high-temperature superconductivity]].

BCS is able to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the
system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. This state is
now known as the &quot;BCS state&quot;. In the normal state of a metal, electrons move independently, whereas in the BCS state, they are bound into &quot;Cooper pairs&quot; by the attractive interaction.
The BCS formalism is based on the &quot;reduced&quot; potential for the electrons attraction. 
Within this potential, a variational [[ansatz]] for the wave function is proposed. This ansatz 
was later shown to be exact in the dense limit of pairs. Note that the continuous crossover between the dilute and dense regimes of attracting pairs of fermions is still an open problem, which now attracts a lot of attention within the field of ultracold gases.

==Successes of the BCS theory==
BCS derived several important theoretical predictions that are independent of the details of the interaction, since the quantitative predictions mentioned below hold for any sufficiently weak attraction between the electrons and this last condition is fulfilled for many low temperature superconductors - the so-called &quot;weak-coupling case&quot;. These have been confirmed in numerous experiments:

* The electrons are bound into Cooper pairs, and these pairs are correlated due to the Pauli exclusion principle for the electrons, from which they are constructed. Therefore, in order to break a pair, one has to change energies of all other pairs. This means there is an &quot;energy gap&quot; for &quot;single-particle excitation&quot;, unlike in the normal metal (where the state of an electron can be changed by adding an arbitrarily small amount of energy). This energy gap is highest at low temperatures but vanishes at the transition temperature when superconductivity ceases to exist.  The BCS theory gives an expression that shows how the gap grows with the strength of the attractive interaction and the (normal phase) single particle [[density of states]] at the [[Fermi energy]]. Furthermore, it describes how the density of states is changed on entering the superconducting state, where there are no electronic states any more at the Fermi energy. The energy gap is most directly observed in tunneling experiments&lt;ref name=&quot;Giaever&quot;&gt;Ivar Giaever - Nobel Lecture. Nobelprize.org. 16 Dec 2010 http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/giaever-lecture.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in reflection of microwaves from superconductors.

* BCS theory predicts the dependence of the value of the energy gap E at temperature T on the critical temperature T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  The ratio between the value of the energy gap at zero temperature and the value of the superconducting transition temperature (expressed in energy units) takes the universal value of 3.5, independent of material.  Near the critical temperature the relation asymptotes to
::&lt;math&gt;E=3.52k_BT_c\sqrt{1-(T/T_c)}&lt;/math&gt;
:which is of the form suggested the previous year by [[M. J. Buckingham]] in [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v101/i4/p1431_1 Very High Frequency Absorption in Superconductors] based on the fact that the superconducting phase transition is second order, that the superconducting phase has a mass gap and on Blevins, Gordy and Fairbank's experimental results the previous year on the absorption of millimeter waves by superconducting [[tin]].

* Due to the energy gap, the specific heat of the superconductor is suppressed strongly ([[exponential decay|exponentially]]) at low temperatures, there being no thermal excitations left. However, before reaching the transition temperature, the specific heat of the superconductor becomes even higher than that of the normal conductor (measured immediately above the transition) and the ratio of these two values is found to be universally given by 2.5.

* BCS theory correctly predicts the [[Meissner effect]], i.e. the expulsion of a [[magnetic field]] from the superconductor and the variation of the penetration depth (the extent of the screening currents flowing below the metal's surface) with temperature.   This had been demonstrated experimentally by [[Walther Meissner]] and [[Robert Ochsenfeld]] in their 1933 article [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1933NW.....21..787M Ein neuer Effekt bei Eintritt der Supraleitfähigkeit].

* It also describes the variation of the [[upper critical field|critical magnetic field]] (above which the superconductor can  no longer expel the field but becomes normal conducting) with temperature. BCS theory relates the value of  the critical field at zero temperature to the value of the transition temperature and the density of states at the Fermi energy.

* In its simplest form, BCS gives the superconducting transition temperature in terms of the electron-phonon coupling potential and the [[Debye]]{{dn}} cutoff energy:
:&lt;math&gt;k_B\,T_c = 1.14E_D\,{e^{-1/N(0)\,V}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
:Here N(0) is the electronic [[density of states]] at the [[Fermi energy]]. For more details, see [[Cooper pairs]].

* The BCS theory reproduces the '''isotope effect''', which is the experimental observation that for a given superconducting material, the critical temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the [[isotope]] used in the material.  The isotope effect was reported by two groups on the 24th of March 1950, who discovered it independently working with different [[mercury (element)|mercury]] isotopes, although a few days before publication they learned of each other's results at the ONR conference in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  The two groups are [[Emanuel Maxwell]], who published his results in [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v78/i4/p477_1 Isotope Effect in the Superconductivity of Mercury] and C. A. Reynolds, B. Serin, W. H. Wright, and L. B. Nesbitt who published their results 10 pages later in [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v78/i4/p487_1 Superconductivity of Isotopes of Mercury]. The choice of isotope ordinarily has little effect on the electrical properties of a material, but does affect the frequency of lattice vibrations, this effect suggested that superconductivity be related to vibrations of the lattice.  This is incorporated into the BCS theory, where lattice vibrations yield the binding energy of electrons in a Cooper pair.

'''Biathlon''' is a term used to describe any sporting event made up of two disciplines. However, biathlon usually refers specifically to the [[winter sport]] that combines [[cross-country skiing]] and [[rifle|rifle shooting]]. Other popular variants include summer biathlon, which combines cross-country running with riflery, [[modern biathlon]] and [[biathle]], which combine running with swimming.

==Concise history==
The sport has its origins in an exercise for [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[soldier]]s, as an alternative training for the [[army|military]].
The world's first known ski club, the Trysil Rifle and Ski Club, was formed in Norway in 1861 to promote national defense at the local level.

Called [[military patrol]], the combination of skiing and shooting was contested at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Military patrol at the 1924 Winter Olympics|1924]], and then [[Demonstration sport|demonstrated]] in [[Military patrol at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]], [[Military patrol at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], and [[Military patrol at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]], but did not regain Olympic recognition then, as the small number of competing countries disagreed on the rules (see also Governing body, below). During the mid-1950s, however, biathlon was introduced into the Soviet and Swedish winter sport circuits and was widely enjoyed by the public. This newfound popularity aided the effort of having biathlon gain entry into the Winter Olympics. 

The first [[Biathlon World Championships|World Championship]] in biathlon was held in 1958 in [[Austria]], and in 1960 the sport was finally included in the [[1960 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games]]. At [[1992 Winter Olympics|Albertville]] in 1992, women were first allowed in Olympic biathlon.

The competitions from 1958 to 1965 used high-power [[centerfire]] such as [[.30-06 Springfield]] and [[7.62x51mm NATO]], and so on, before the [[.22 Long Rifle]] [[rimfire]] cartridge was standardized in 1978. The ammunition was carried in a belt worn around the competitor's waist. The sole event was the men's 20&amp;nbsp;km individual, encompassing four separate ranges and firing distances of 100 m, 150 m, 200 m, and 250 m. The target distance was reduced to 150 m with the addition of the relay in 1966. The shooting range was further reduced to 50 m in 1978 with the mechanical targets making their debut at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]].

==Governing body==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ole Einar Bjørndalen]] --&gt;
In 1948, the ''Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon (UIPMB)'' was founded, to standardise the rules for biathlon and [[modern pentathlon]]. In 1993, the biathlon branch of the UIPMB created the [[International Biathlon Union]] (IBU), which officially separated from the UIPMB in 1998.

Presidents of the UIPMB/IBU:
* 1947–1949: [[Tom Wiborn]] ([[Sweden]])
* 1949–1960: [[Gustaf Dyrssen]] (Sweden)
* 1960–1988: [[Sven Thofelt]], (Sweden)
* 1988–1992: [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov (biathlon)|Igor Novikov]] ([[Soviet Union|USSR]]/[[Russia]])
* Since&amp;nbsp;1992: [[Anders Besseberg]] ([[Norway]])

==Championships==
The following articles list major international biathlon events and medalists. Contrary to the Olympics and World Championships (BWCH), the World Cup (BWC) is an entire winter season of (mostly) weekly races, where the medalists are those with the highest sums of World Cup points at the end of the season.

==Rules and equipment==

The complete rules of biathlon are given in the official IBU rule book (see [[#External links|External links]], below).

===Basic concepts===
A biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski around a cross-country track, and where the total distance is broken up by either two or four shooting rounds, half in prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total running distance/time. As in most races, the contestant with the shortest total time wins.

For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets; each missed target must be &quot;atoned for&quot; in one of three ways, depending on the competition format:
* by skiing around a {{convert|150|m|ft}} penalty loop, typically taking 20–30 seconds for top-level biathletes to complete (running time depending on weather/snow conditions),
* by having one minute added to a skier's total time, or
* by having to use an &quot;extra cartridge&quot; (placed at the shooting range) to finish off the target; only three such &quot;extras&quot; are available for each round, and a penalty loop must be made for each of the targets left standing.

In order to keep track of the contestants' progress and relative standing throughout a race, [[split time]]s (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting round. The large display screens commonly set up at biathlon arenas, as well as the information graphics shown as part of the TV picture, will typically list the split time of the fastest contestant at each intermediate point and the times and time differences to the closest runners-up.

===Skiing details===
All cross-country skiing techniques are permitted in biathlon, which means that the [[Cross-country skiing#Skate skiing|free technique]] is usually the preferred one, being the fastest. No equipment other than skis and ski poles may be used to move along the track. Minimum ski length is {{convert|4|cm|in}} less than the height of the skier. The rifle has to be carried by the skier during the race at all times.

===Shooting details===
The biathlete carries the small bore rifle, which weighs at least {{convert|3.5|kg|lb}}, including ammunition in magazines on his/her back during the race. The rifles use [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 LR]] ammunition and are [[bolt action]] or [[Fortner]] (straight-pull bolt) action.

The target range shooting distance is {{convert|50|m|ft}}. There are five circular targets to be hit in each shooting round. When shooting in the [[prone position]] the target diameter is {{convert|45|mm|in}}, when shooting in the standing position the target diameter is {{convert|115|mm|in}}. On all modern biathlon ranges, the targets are self-indicating, in that they flip from black to white when hit, giving the biathlete as well as the spectators instant visual feedback for each shot fired.

==Competition format==
===Individual===
The {{convert|20|km|mi}} individual race (15&amp;nbsp;km for women) is the oldest biathlon event; the distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete shoots four times at any shooting lane,&lt;ref&gt;Even in English speaking countries such as [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] each country may use different terms for the same thing in biathlon. For example: Stage (USA) vs. Bout (Canada), Shooting Point (USA) vs. Shooting Lane (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors' starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.

===Sprint===
The sprint is {{convert|10|km|mi}} for men and {{convert|7.5|km|mi}} for women; the distance is skied over three laps. The biathlete shoots twice at any shooting lane, once prone and once standing, for a total of 10 shots. For each miss, a penalty loop of 150 metres must be skied before the race can be continued. As in the individual competition, the biathletes start in intervals.

===Pursuit===
{{main|Pursuit racing}}
In a pursuit, biathletes' starts are separated by their time differences from a previous race,&lt;ref&gt;To be precise; the pursuit competition start intervals are determined by [[Rounding#Rounding to integer|common rounding]] to the nearest whole second of the biathletes' time differences from the previous race{{ndash}} the amount of time each biathlete lagged after the winner to the finish line.&lt;/ref&gt; most commonly a sprint. The contestant crossing the finish line first is the winner. The distance is {{convert|12.5|km|mi}} for men and {{convert|10|km|mi}} for women, skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order), and each miss means a penalty loop of 150 m. To prevent awkward and/or dangerous crowding of the skiing loops, and overcapacity at the shooting range, World Cup Pursuits are held with only the 60 top ranking biathletes after the preceding race. The biathletes shoot on a first-come, first-served basis at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived for all shooting bouts.

===Mass start===
In the mass start, all biathletes start at the same time and the first across the finish line wins. In this {{convert|15|km|mi}} or {{convert|12.5|km|mi}} for women competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone, two standing, in that order) with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to your bib (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.) with rest of the shooting bouts being at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the lane in fifth place, you shoot at lane five.). As in sprint races, competitors must ski one 150 m penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the Pursuit as here all contestants start simultaneously).

===Relay===
The relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski {{convert|7.5|km|mi}} (men) or {{convert|6|km|mi}} (women), each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.).

===Mixed relay===
The most recent addition to the number of biathlon competition variants, the mixed relay, is similar to the ordinary relay but for the composition of the teams, each of which consists of two women and two men. Legs 1 and 2 are done by the women, legs 3 and 4 by the men. The women's legs are 6&amp;nbsp;km and men's legs are 7.5&amp;nbsp;km as in ordinary relay competitions.

===Team (obsolete)===
A team consists of four biathletes, but unlike the relay competition, all team members start at the same time. Two athletes must shoot in the prone shooting round, the other two in the standing round. In case of a miss, the two non-shooting biathletes must ski a penalty loop of 150 m. The skiers must enter the shooting area together, and must also finish within 15 seconds of each other; otherwise a time penalty of one minute is added to the total time. Since 2004, this race format has been obsolete at the World Cup level.

==Biathlon venues==
World Cup events and World Championships in biathlon have traditionally been held at the following few locations. Due to the complicated shooting range equipment, which absolutely has to work in order to hold successful races, biathlon is a highly demanding sport for organisers.

:&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Since 2002, the [[Veltins-Arena]] has hosted a special end-of-year mixed team event, now called the &quot;[[Veltins Biathlon World Team Challenge]]&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Broadcasting==
Biathlon events are broadcast most regularly where the sport enjoys its greatest popularity, namely [[Germany]] ([[Das Erste|ARD]], [[ZDF]]), [[Austria]] ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]), [[Norway]] ([[Norsk Rikskringkasting|NRK]]), [[Finland]] ([[Yleisradio|YLE]]), [[Estonia]] ([[ETV (Estonia)|ETV]]), [[Latvia]] ([[LTV 7|LTV]]), [[Croatia]] ([[Hrvatska radiotelevizija|HRT]]), [[Poland]] ([[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]), [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]]), [[Russia]] ([[Russia 2]], [[Channel One (Russia)]]), [[Belarus]] ([[TVR (Belarus)|TVR]]), [[Slovenia]] ([[RTV Slovenia|RTV]]), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Radio-televizija Bosne i Hercegovine|BHRT]]), [[Bulgaria]] ([[Bulgarian National Television|BNT]]), [[South Korea]] ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]);&lt;!--sequence held in same order as on biathlonworld.com--&gt; it is broadcast on European-wide [[Eurosport]], which also broadcasts to the Asia-Pacific region. World Cup races are streamed (without commentary) via the IBU website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biathlonworld.com Startseite - www.biathlonworld.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and some of these events are available on the World Championship Sports Network (WCSN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcsn.com/ WCSN - The Home of World Champions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadcast distribution being one indicator, the constellation of a sport's main [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] usually gives a similar, and correlated, indication of popularity: for biathlon, these are the Germany-based companies [[E.ON|E.ON Ruhrgas]] (energy), [[Krombacher]] (beer), and [[Viessmann]] (boilers and other heating systems).

==Biathlon records and statistics==
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

==Biathlon variants==
Two common variations on traditional winter biathlon are ''summer biathlon'', where skiing is replaced by a cross-country run, and ''[[archery]] biathlon'' (or [[ski archery]]), where the rifle is replaced by a ''[[recurve bow]]''.

There have also been summer competitions in ''[[roller skiing|roller-ski]] biathlon'', ''[[mountain biking|mountain bike]] biathlon'' and ''[[orienteering]] biathlon''. ''Primitive Biathlon'' uses [[snowshoes]] and [[Muzzleloading|muzzleloaders]].

The [[Boy Scouts of America]] offers a ''Bikeathlon'' variant at their [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|national Scout jamboree]] that mixes [[BMX]] biking with [[air rifle]] shooting at biathlon type targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crosman.com/site/crosman_u_bikathalon :: Crosman: Summer House - Bikathalon::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cadets Canada]] also offers biathlon to cadets across Canada, with three stages; zones, provincial and national. Zone competitions are occasionally, due to lack of snow in some southern areas, held as summer biathlon. A .22LR caliber rifle is used at all levels. Races are shorter than world class events. More information can be found at the National Cadet Biathlon Championship website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadets.net/biathlon/ National Cadet Biathlon Championship - 2007 - Championnat national de biathlon des cadets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Police and Fire Games]], as well as the [http://www.cpaf.org/ Western States Police and Fire Games] (USA), offer a summer variant which combines cross-country running with service pistol shooting.

[[Image:Stoke newington breakfast 1.jpg|thumb|right|A small portion of bubble and squeak (left), as part of a [[Full breakfast|full English breakfast]].]] 
'''Bubble and squeak''' is a traditional [[England|English]] dish made with the shallow-fried [[leftovers|leftover]] vegetables from a [[roast dinner]]. The main ingredients are [[potato]] and [[cabbage]], but [[carrot]]s, [[pea]]s, [[brussels sprout]]s, and other vegetables can be added. The cold chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well-cooked and brown on the sides. It is often served with cold meat from the [[Sunday roast]], and pickles. 

The meat was traditionally added to the bubble and squeak itself, although nowadays it is more commonly made without meat. The earliest known recipe was by [[A New System of Domestic Cookery|Maria Rundell]] in 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;rundell&quot;&gt;Rundell, Maria Eliza Ketelby (1808). Bubble and Squeak. In ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=30tOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A new system of domestic cookery:Third edition]''.  p. 42. Google Book Search. Retrieved on January 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from the bubble and squeak sounds made as it cooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Pickett, Joseph P. et al. |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |date=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''bubble and squeak'' is used throughout the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. It may also be understood in parts of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usa&quot;&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SaQtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n50FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=bubble&amp;pg=4819%2C2454303 Hearty Luncheon and Supper Dishes] Reading Eagle, Jul 17, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usa2&quot;&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2004/11/17/cx_cv_1117food.html Forbes Lifestyle, Wine and Food] Forbes, Nov 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Bubble and squeak was a popular dish during [[World War II]], as it was an easy way of using leftovers during a period when most foods were subject to [[rationing]]. In more recent times, pre-prepared frozen and tinned versions became available.

'''Charles Hardin Holley''' (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959) known professionally as '''Buddy&amp;nbsp;Holly''', was an American [[singer-songwriter]] and a pioneer of [[rock and roll]]. Although his success lasted only a year and a half before his [[The Day the Music Died|death in an airplane crash]], Holly is described by critic Bruce Elder as &quot;the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|title=Buddy Holly|publisher=Allmusic.com|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4502|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works and innovations inspired and influenced contemporary and later musicians, notably [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Eric Clapton]], and exerted a profound influence on [[popular music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;[[National Public Radio|NPR]] article: &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100161470 Buddy Holly: 50 Years After The Music Died]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Holly was among the first group of inductees to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=hof&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/buddy-holly |title=Buddy Holly |publisher=rockhall.com |accessdate=February 12; 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Holly #13 among &quot;The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Immortals: The First Fifty|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (Issue 946; April 15, 2004)|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Charles Hardin Holley was born on September 7, 1936, in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], Texas, U.S.A. to Lawrence Odell and Ella Pauline (Drake) Holley. Holly was always called &quot;Buddy&quot; by his family. Older brothers Travis and Larry taught their sibling to play a variety of instruments, including the guitar, four-string banjo and lap steel guitar. At the age of five, his young voice and exuberance won him a talent contest singing a then-popular song, &quot;Have You Ever Gone Sailing (Down the River of Memories).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rock 2004. Page 43&quot;&gt;History of Rock &amp; Roll. By Thomas E. Larson. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company, Dubuque, Iowa. Copyright 2004. Page 43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, still retaining his soprano, he recorded a bluesy solo rendering of Hank Snow's &quot;My Two Timin' Woman&quot; on a [[wire recorder]] borrowed by a friend who worked in a music shop.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddyhollycenter.org/gallery/1936to56.aspx |title=Buddy Holly Timeline: 1936 to 1956 |publisher=Buddy Holly Center, City of Lubbock |accessdate=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, he met [[Bob Montgomery (musician)|Bob Montgomery]] at Hutchinson Junior High School. They shared an interest in music, and teamed up as &quot;Buddy and Bob&quot;. Initially influenced by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], they sang harmony duets at local clubs and high school talent shows. The duo performed on a local radio station [[KDAV]] Sunday broadcast that made them a top local act. Hutchinson Junior High School now has a mural honoring Holly, and [[Lubbock High School]], where he sang in the school choir, also honors the late musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lubbock High School | publisher = Hutchinson Junior High| url =http://www.lubbockschools.com/data/lmhutchinson.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Crickets===
{{Main|The Crickets}}
Holly saw [[Elvis Presley]] sing in Lubbock in 1955, and began to incorporate a [[rockabilly]] style, similar to that of [[Chuck Berry]], which had a strong rhythm acoustic and slap bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rock 2004. Page 43&quot;/&gt; On October 15, he opened the bill for Presley&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; in Lubbock, catching the eye of a [[Nashville]] talent scout.&lt;ref name=dmr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.desmoinesregister.com/holly/influence.php |title=Buddy Holly: Musical Influence ('Timeline: Follow the Story Through the Years', section) |publisher=[[Des Moines Register]] |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly's transition to rock continued when he opened for [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] at a local show organized by Eddie Crandall, the manager for [[Marty Robbins]].&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;

Following this performance, [[Decca Records]] signed him to a contract in February 1956, misspelling his name as &quot;Holly&quot;.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; He thereafter adopted the misspelled name for his professional career. Holly formed his own band, later to be called [[The Crickets]], consisting of Holly (lead guitar and vocals), [[Niki Sullivan]] (guitar), [[Joe B. Mauldin]] (bass), and [[Jerry Allison]] (drums). They went to Nashville for three recording sessions with producer [[Owen Bradley]].&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/oh-boy-why-buddy-holly-still-matters-today-1501271.html |title=Oh boy: Why Buddy Holly still matters today |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=January 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he chafed under a restrictive atmosphere that allowed him little input.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt; Among the tracks he recorded was an early version of &quot;[[That'll Be The Day]]&quot;, which took its title from a line that [[John Wayne]]'s character says repeatedly in the 1956 film, ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = That'll Be the Day | publisher = Rollingstone| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595884/thatll_be_the_day}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This initial version of the song played more slowly and about half an octave higher than the later hit version.) Decca released two singles, &quot;Blue Days, Black Nights&quot; and &quot;Modern Don Juan&quot;, that failed to make an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed,&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; insisting, however, that he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.&lt;ref&gt;Holly recorded his February 28, 1957 phone call with Decca, and the recording has survived: [http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/02/buddy-holly-on-line-one.html Buddy Holly On Line One].&lt;/ref&gt;

Holly then hired [[Norman Petty]] as manager, and the band began recording at Petty's studios in [[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]], New Mexico. Petty contacted music publishers and labels, and [[Brunswick Records]], a subsidiary of Decca, signed the Crickets on March 19, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddyhollycenter.org/gallery/1957.aspx |title=Buddy Holly Timeline: 1957 |publisher=Buddy Holly Center, City of Lubbock |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly signed as a solo artist with another Decca subsidiary, [[Coral Records]]. This put him in the unusual position of having two recording contracts at the same time.&lt;ref name=pc12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19761/m1/ |title=Show 12 - Big Rock Candy Mountain: Rock 'n' roll in the late fifties.

On May 27, 1957, &quot;That'll Be The Day&quot; was released as a single, credited to the Crickets to try to bypass Decca's claimed legal rights. When the song became a hit, Decca decided not to press its claim. &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; topped the [[Number-one hits of 1957 (United States)|US &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot;]] chart on September 23, and was the [[List of number-one singles from the 1950s (UK)|UK Singles Chart]] for three weeks in November.

Holly helped win over an all-black audience to rock and roll/rockabilly when the Crickets were booked at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] for August 16–22, 1957.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; Unlike the immediate acceptance shown in the 1978 movie ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'', it actually took several performances for the audience to warm up to him. In August 1957, the Crickets were the only white performers on a national tour including black neighborhood theaters.&lt;ref name=dmr/&gt;

As Holly was signed both as a solo artist and a member of the Crickets, two debut albums were released: ''[[The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets]]'' on November 27, 1957 and ''[[Buddy Holly (album)|Buddy Holly]]'' on February 20, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''All Music Guide to Country'', Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Backbeat Books, 2003, ISBN 0879307609 [http://books.google.com/books?id=LdxCPLZAExsC&amp;pg=PA353&amp;dq=%22The+Chirping+Crickets%22&amp;ei=-WeRSfbFJo2ONvHSjL0K&amp;client=firefox-a p 353].&lt;/ref&gt; His singles &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; and &quot;[[Oh, Boy!

In the liner notes to &quot;Buddy Holly: The Definitive Collection,&quot; Billy Altman notes &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; was originally written as &quot;Cindy Lou,&quot; but he later changed it to &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; prior to recording, as a tip of the hat to Crickets drummer Jerry Allison's girlfriend (and future wife), Peggy Sue Gerron.

Holly wrote the song &quot;[[True Love Ways]]&quot; about his relationship with his wife, [[María Elena Holly|Maria Elena]]. It was recorded in her presence on October 21, 1958 at Decca's Pythian Temple, with Dick Jacob, [[Coral-Brunswick]]'s new head of [[A&amp;R|Artists and Repertoire]], serving as both producer and conductor of the 18-piece orchestra, which included members of the [[New York Symphony Orchestra]], NBC Television's house orchestra and [[Boomie Richman|Abraham &quot;Boomie&quot; Richman]], formerly of [[Benny Goodman]]'s band.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

===Holly in New York===
The ambitious Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music/recording/publishing scene, while his band mates wanted to go back home to Lubbock.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As a result, the group split up in late 1958. The Hollys settled in [[Greenwich Village]], New York, in the new Brevoort apartment block at Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue. Here he recorded the series of acoustic songs, including &quot;[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]&quot; and &quot;What to Do,&quot; known as the &quot;Apartment Tapes,&quot; which were released after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=All Around the Town: Amazing Manhattan Facts and Curiosities |last=Bunyan |first=Patrick |year= |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |isbn=0823231747 |page=160 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ytpzn0EfA-YC&amp;lpg=PA160 |accessdate=2010-12-18 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hollys frequented many of New York's music venues, including [[The Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Maria Elena reported Buddy was keen to learn finger-style flamenco guitar, and would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} He wanted to develop collaborations between soul singers and rock 'n' roll, hoping to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and gospel legend [[Mahalia Jackson]]. He also had ambitions to work in film, like [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Eddie Cochran]], and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasburg's [[Actors' Studio]], where the likes of [[Marlon Brando]] and [[James Dean]] had trained.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

According to Billy Altman's liner notes to the Geffen/Universal compilation, &quot;Buddy Holly: The Definitive Collection&quot;, in addition to &quot;True Love Ways,&quot; during the October 1958 sessions at Decca's Pythian Temple, Holly also recorded two other songs, &quot;I Guess It Doesn't Matter Anymore&quot; and &quot;Raining In My Heart.&quot; The songs were firsts for Holly, not only in the use of orchestral backing players, but also the tracks were his first stereo recordings. In a cruel twist of fate, they were also to be his last formal studio recording sessions.

Holly was still having trouble getting his royalties from Petty, so he hired the noted lawyer Harold Orenstein at the recommendation of his friends the [[Everly Brothers]], who had engaged Orenstein following disputes with their own manager, Wesley Rose. Yet, with the money still being withheld by Petty and with rent due, Buddy was forced to go back on the road.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

===Death===

{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}
Holly was offered a spot in the Winter Dance Party, a three-week tour across the Midwest opening on January 23, 1959, by the GAC agency,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} with other notable performers such as [[Dion and the Belmonts]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and [[The Big Bopper|J. P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Richardson]]. He assembled a backing band consisting of [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass) and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums) and were billed as The Crickets.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The tour turned out to be a miserable ordeal for the performers, who were subjected to long overnight travel in a bus plagued with a faulty heating system in {{convert|-25|°F|°C|abbr=on}} temperatures. The bus also broke down several times between stops.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Following a performance at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], on February 2, 1959, Holly chartered a small airplane to take him to the next stop on the tour. He, Valens, Richardson and the pilot were killed en route to Moorhead, Minnesota, when their plane crashed soon after taking off from nearby [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]] in the early morning hours of February 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iowa Crash Kills 3 Singers; Rock 'n' Roll Stars and Pilot Die as Chartered Craft Falls After Its Take-Off |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10717F83C5C1A7B93C6A91789D85F4D8585F9 |agency=AP |newspaper=New York Times |date=4 February 1959 |page=1 |accessdate=2010-11-13 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandmate [[Waylon Jennings]] had given up his seat on the plane, causing Holly to jokingly tell Jennings, &quot;I hope your ol' bus freezes up!&quot; Jennings shot back facetiously, &quot;Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes!&quot; It was a statement that would haunt Jennings for decades.&lt;ref name=Jennings&gt;VH1's Behind the Music &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; interview with Waylon Jennings&lt;/ref&gt; The first song to commemorate the musicians was “Three Stars” by Eddie Cochran.

Holly's funeral was held on February 7, 1959, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Lubbock.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', Morning Edition, February 7, 1959, Section 1, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The service was officiated by Ben D. Johnson, who had presided at the Hollys' wedding just months earlier. The pallbearers were [[Jerry Allison]], [[Joe B.

The body was interred in the City of Lubbock Cemetery in the eastern part of the city. Holly's headstone carries the correct spelling of his surname (Holley) and a carving of his [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar.

Holly's pregnant wife, a widow after barely six months of marriage, miscarried soon after, ending that part of the Holly family tree. The miscarriage was reportedly due to “psychological trauma”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suddath&quot;/&gt; Because of this incident, authorities found it necessary, in the months following, to implement a policy against announcing victims’ names until after families had first been informed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suddath&quot;/&gt;[[María Elena Holly]] did not attend the funeral, and has never visited the grave site. She later told the ''Avalanche-Journal'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane.&lt;ref name=laj/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holly set the template for the standard rock and roll band: two guitars, bass, and drums.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; He was also one of the first in the genre to write, produce, and perform his own songs.

Holly managed to bridge the racial divide that marked music in America. Along with Elvis and others, Holly made rock and roll, with its roots in rockabilly country music and blues inspired rhythm and blues music, more popular among a broad white audience.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} From listening to their recordings, one had difficulty determining if the Crickets were white or black singers.{{who|date=November 2010}} Holly indeed sometimes played with black musicians [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]]. The Crickets were only the second white rock group to tour [[Great Britain]]. Holly's essential eyeglasses encouraged other musicians, such as [[John Lennon]], also to wear their glasses during performances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} 

In his biography of rock legend [[Elton John]], Phillip Norman recounted that by his early teens, John (then known as Reg Dwight) was wearing glasses &quot;not because he needed them, but in homage to Buddy Holly.&quot; After wearing glasses for a while, his eyes became adjusted to the lenses, and at that point he really did need glasses, which would years later establish John as one of the most famous &quot;four-eyes&quot; in rock and roll, though Holly is considered the first.

Contrary to popular belief, teenagers [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] did not attend a Holly concert, although they watched his television appearance on ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'';{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Tony Bramwell, a school friend of McCartney and [[George Harrison]], did.

During the January 1969 sessions for the ''[[Let It Be]]'' album, the Beatles played a slow impromptu version of &quot;Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues&quot; — although not written by Holly, it was popularized by him — with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} the recording was eventually released in the mid-1990s on ''[[Anthology 3]]''. In addition, [[John Lennon]] recorded a cover version of &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; on his 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]''. McCartney owns the [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishing rights]] to Holly's song catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Sir Paul's fortune boosted|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2974853.stm | date=April 25, 2003 | accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 17-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] attended the January 31, 1959, show, two nights before Holly's death. Dylan referred to this in his 1998 Grammy acceptance speech for his ''[[Time out of Mind]]'' being named [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]:

{{quote|&quot;And I just want to say that when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him...and he '''''looked''''' at me.

Keith Richards attended one of Holly's performances, where he heard &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; for the first time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[The Rolling Stones]] had an early hit covering the song.

Holly influenced many other singers during and after a career that lasted barely two years. Keith Richards once said Holly had &quot;an influence on everybody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wtha_Riser&quot;&gt;Dave Riser, &quot;The Music Never Died: How Buddy Holly Changed Music Forever&quot; (paper presented at the 87th annual meeting of the West Texas Historical Association, Fort Worth, Texas, February 27, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 24, 1978 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, [[Bruce Springsteen]] told Dave Marsh, &quot;I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest.&quot;

The [[Grateful Dead]] performed &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; 530 times over the course of their career, making it their seventh most-performed song.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The song also appears on eight of their official live recording releases.

Various rock and roll histories have asserted the singing group [[The Hollies]] were named in homage to Buddy Holly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} According to the band's website, although the group admired Holly (and years later produced an album covering some of his songs), their name was inspired primarily by the sprigs of [[holly]] in evidence around Christmas of 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollies.co.uk/goldmineintro.html |title=Beginnings |publisher=The Hollies official site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don McLean]]'s popular 1971 [[ballad (music)|ballad]] &quot;[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]&quot; is inspired by Holly and the day of the plane crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/buddyholly.asp |title=The Buddy Holly Connection |publisher=Don McLean |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' album is dedicated to Holly.

==Discography==
{{Main|Buddy Holly discography}}
Buddy Holly released only three albums in his lifetime. Nonetheless, he recorded so prolifically that Coral Records was able to release brand-new albums and singles for 10 years after his death, although the technical quality was very mixed, some being studio quality and others home recordings.

Buddy Holly continued to be promoted and sold as an &quot;active&quot; artist, and his records had a loyal following, especially in Europe. The demand for unissued Holly material was so great that Norman Petty resorted to overdubbing whatever he could find: alternate takes of studio recordings, originally rejected masters, &quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping&quot; and the other five 1959 tracks (adding new surf-guitar arrangements), and even Holly's amateur demos from 1954 (where the low-fidelity vocals are often muffled behind the new orchestrations). The last new Buddy Holly album was ''Giant'' (featuring the single &quot;[[Love Is Strange]]&quot;), issued in 1969. Between the 1959–60 Jack Hansen overdubs, the 1960s Norman Petty overdubs, various alternate takes, and Holly's undubbed originals, collectors can often choose from multiple versions of the same song. There are also many different versions of Holly's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; as well as tribute / compilation albums of Buddy's songs performed by various artists. One such album has been announced recently at an event at [[P.J. Clarke's]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/buddy-holly-whirled-in-and-left-with-a-bride/ Buddy Holly Whirled In and Left With a Bride, New York Times &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Listen to Me: Buddy Holly is being produced by [[Peter Asher]] and includes contributions from [[Stevie Nicks]], [[The Fray]], [[Cobra Starship]], [[Jeff Lynne]], Train's [[Pat Monahan]], [[Patrick Stump]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Imelda May]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Brian Wilson]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://truegreatoriginal.com/2011/05/true-love-ways-unveiled-buddy-hollys-great-music-great-romance/ True Love Ways Unveiled &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and musical depictions==
Holly's life story inspired a Hollywood [[biographical film]], ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]''. Star [[Gary Busey]] received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of Holly. The movie was widely criticized by the rock community and Holly's friends and family for [[The Buddy Holly Story#Inaccuracies|its inaccuracies]]. This led Paul McCartney to produce and host his own tribute to Holly in 1985, titled ''The Real Buddy Holly Story''. This video includes interviews with [[Keith Richards]], [[The Everly Brothers|Phil and Don Everly]], [[Sonny Curtis]], [[Jerry Allison]], Holly's family, and McCartney himself, among others.

In 1987, [[Marshall Crenshaw]] portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]''. He is featured performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the doomed airplane with [[Ritchie Valens]] and [[The Big Bopper]]. Crenshaw's version of &quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping&quot; is featured on the ''La Bamba'' original motion picture soundtrack.

''[[Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story]]'', the Jukebox Musical depicting his life, is credited as being the first of its kind, spawning a breed of jukebox shows, including the likes of '[[Mamma Mia]]'' and '[[We Will Rock You]]''. &quot;Buddy&quot;, as it is abbreviated on occasion, is still running in the UK after 22 years, with a UK tour that went out in February 2011.

==Personal life==
In June 1958, he met [[María Elena Holly|Maria Elena Santiago]], who worked as a receptionist for Murray Deutch, an executive for New York publisher Peer-Southern Music.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;Norman, Philip (1996) ''Buddy Holly: The Definitive Biography of Buddy Holly'', Macmillan: London&lt;/ref&gt; Holly managed to have Santiago invited to a luncheon at [[Howard Johnson's]], thanks to Deutch's secretary, Jo Harper. He asked her to have dinner with him that night at [[P. J. Clarke's]]. Holly proposed marriage to her on their very first date. &quot;While we were having dinner, he got up and came back with his hands behind his back. He brought out a red rose and said, 'This is for you. Would you marry me?'&quot; He went to her guardian's house the next morning to get her approval. Santiago at first thought he was kidding, but they married in Lubbock on August 15, 1958, less than two months later.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; &quot;I'd never had a boyfriend in my life. I'd never been on a date before. But when I saw Buddy, it was like magic. We had something special: love at first sight,&quot; she told the ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'' on what would have been their 50th wedding anniversary.&lt;ref name=laj&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/081508/loc_318846994.shtml |title=Buddy and Maria Elena Holly married 50 years ago |author=William Kerns |publisher=Lubbock Online |date=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newlyweds honeymooned in Acapulco.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

Maria Elena traveled on tours, doing everything from the laundry to equipment setup to ensuring the group got paid. Although Holly had already begun to become disillusioned with Norman Petty before meeting his bride, it was through Maria Elena and her aunt Provi, who was the head of Latin American music at Peer-Southern, that he began to fully realize what was going on with his manager, who was paying the band's royalties into his own company's account.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; Many fans became aware of his marriage only after his death.&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt;

==Lubbock==
[[Image:Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, TX IMG 0078.JPG|right|thumb|The Buddy Holly Center, a small museum located in Lubbock]]

Holly was based in Lubbock as his career took off between 1956 and 1958, moving to New York City after marrying [[María Elena Holly|Maria Elena Santiago]] in August 1958. Lubbock has a &quot;walk of fame&quot; with, as its centerpiece, a statue, created by sculptor Grant Speed in 1980, of Holly playing his Fender guitar. As of September 2010, the statue has been taken down for cleaning. The statue, along with the West Texas Walk of Fame, will be relocated to the Buddy and Maria Elena Holly Park directly west of the Buddy Holly Center at a later date. Lubbock has a street named after Holly, Buddy Holly Avenue, and a museum dedicated to Texas art and music named after him, the Buddy Holly Center. [[The Clash]] visited Lubbock to visit [[Lubbock High School]], where Holly was educated.&lt;ref name=&quot;WTHA_Driver&quot;&gt;Richard Driver, &quot;Down the Line: Buddy Holly and the Legacy of West Texas in the British Invasion&quot; (paper presented at the 87th annual meeting of the [[West Texas Historical Association]], [[Fort Worth, Texas]], February 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brewing''' is the production of [[beer]] through steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains) in water and then [[#Fermenting|fermenting]] with yeast. Brewing has [[History of beer|taken place since]] around the 6th millennium BC, and archeological evidence suggests that this technique was used in [[History of Egypt|ancient Egypt]]. Descriptions of various beer recipes can be found in [[Sumer]]ian writings, some of the oldest known writing of any sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John P. |last=Arnold |year=2005 |origyear=1911 |title=Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology |publisher=BeerBooks |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |pages=34 |isbn=978-0-9662084-1-2 |oclc=71834130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first= Max |last= Nelson |title= The barbarian's beverage: a history of beer in ancient Europe |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |year=2005 |chapterurl= http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0415311217?p=S00H&amp;checkSum=ha%2FMenougrV%2FCPWZg6P4td6OJoeMeVfRptT8FuSLUrk%3D |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-415-31121-2 |oclc= 58387214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-66615/beer|title=Beer|publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewing takes place in a [[brewery]] by a brewer, and the [[brewing industry]] is part of most western economies.

The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as [[malt]]ed [[barley]], which is able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a [[brewer's yeast]] to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as [[hops]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alabev.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.alabev.com/ingredie.htm alabev.com] ''The Ingredients of Beer''.

Retrieved 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the [[grain bill]].

There are several steps in the brewing process, which include [[malting]], [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], [[#Mashing|mashing]], [[#Lautering|lautering]], [[#Boiling|boiling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], [[#Conditioning|conditioning]], [[#Filtering|filtering]], and [[#Packaging|packaging]]. There are three main fermentation methods, [[#Warm_fermenting|warm]], [[#Cool fermenting|cool]] and [[#Spontaneous fermentation|wild or spontaneous]]. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the [[cask ale|cask]] or in the [[Bottle conditioning|bottle]].

Brewing specifically refers to the process of steeping, such as with making tea, [[sake]] and [[soy sauce]]. [[Wine]] and [[cider]] technically aren't brewed, rather vinted, as the entire fruit is pressed, and then the liquid extracted. [[Mead]] isn't technically brewed, as the honey is used entirely, as opposed to being steeped in water.

;Water
Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character.&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;/&gt; For example, [[Dublin]] has [[hard water]] well suited to making [[stout]], such as [[Guinness]]; while [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] has soft water well suited to making [[pale lager]], such as [[Pilsner Urquell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/aug04/resources.html|title=Geology and Beer|work=Geotimes|date=2004-08|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters of [[Beer in England#Burton upon Trent|Burton]] in England contain [[gypsum]], which benefits making [[pale ale]] to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as [[Burtonisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000098.html] Michael Jackson, BeerHunter, 19 October 1991, ''Brewing a good glass of water''. Retrieved 13 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

;Starch source
{{Main|Malt|Mash ingredients}}
The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin [[germination]], and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:en:1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry|Wikisource]] 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry. retrieved 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farm-direct.co.uk/farming/stockcrop/barley/malt.html Farm-direct] Oz, ''Barley Malt'', 6 February 2002. Retrieved 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is not only important in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the [[Mashing|mashed]] barley grains to form the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]]), but also as a rich source of [[amylase]], a [[digestion|digestive]] [[enzyme]] which facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and [[rye]], and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced [[gluten-free beer]] made with sorghum with no barley malt for people who cannot digest [[gluten]]-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.&lt;ref&gt;

;Hops
{{Main|Hops}}
Flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Burgess, ''Hops: Botany, Cultivation and Utilization'', Leonard Hill (1964), ISBN 0-471-12350-1&lt;/ref&gt; The flower of the [[Hop (plant)|hop vine]] is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. The flowers themselves are often called &quot;hops&quot;.

Hops were used by monastery breweries, such as Corvey in Westphalia, Germany, from 822 AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;sotp&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Martyn|last=Cornell|title=Beer: The Story of the Pint|year=2003|isbn=0-7553-1165-5|publisher=Headline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p62 --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bmar&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard W|last=Unger|title=Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance|pages=54–55|isbn=0-8122-3795-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;sotp&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- p63 --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bmar&quot;/&gt; Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, ''[[Glechoma hederacea#Cultivation and uses|Glechoma hederacea]]''. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like [[Absinth Wormwood|wormwood]] would be combined into a mixture known as [[gruit]] and used as hops are now used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Unger|2004|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fraoch.com/historicales.htm |title=Heatherale.co.uk |publisher=Fraoch.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080629071231/http://www.fraoch.com/historicales.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brasserie-lancelot.com/brasserie-lancelot.php |title=La Brasserie Lancelot est située au coeur de la Bretagne, dans des bâtiments rénovés de l'ancienne mine d'Or du Roc St-André, construits au 19 ème siècle sur des vestiges néolithiques |publisher=Brasserie-lancelot.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; use plants other than hops for flavouring.

Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer. They contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the [[International Bitterness Units scale]]. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. They also have an [[antibiotic]] effect that favours the activity of [[brewer's yeast]] over less desirable microorganisms, and hops aids in &quot;[[Head (beer)|head]] retention&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brewwiki.com/index.php/Head_Retention|title=Head Retention|publisher=BrewWiki|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hopsteiner.com/isopg1.htm|title=Hop Products: Iso-Extract|publisher=Hopsteiner|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last.

;Yeast
{{Main|Brewer's yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces uvarum}}
Yeast is the [[microorganism]] that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast [[metabolism|metabolises]] the sugars extracted from grains, which produces [[Ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]], and thereby turns [[wort (brewing)|wort]] into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.&lt;ref&gt;Ostergaard, S., Olsson, L., Nielsen, J., [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/34 Metabolic Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae], Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000 64: 34-50&lt;/ref&gt;
The dominant types of yeast used to make beer are ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', known as ale yeast, and ''[[Saccharomyces uvarum]]'', known as lager yeast; their use distinguishes [[ale]] and [[Pale lager|lager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dittmer|Desmond|2005|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' ferments [[lambic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hornsey|1999|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Torulaspora delbrueckii]]'' ferments Bavarian [[weissbier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mst.edu/~microbio/BIO221_2001/torulospora_delbrueckii.htm Web.mst.edu] David Horwitz, ''Torulaspora delbrueckii''.

Before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts. A few styles such as [[lambics]] rely on this method today, but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast [[Microbiological culture|cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hui|Khachatourians|1994|pp=847–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Clarifying agent
{{Main|Finings}}
Some brewers add one or more [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clarify clarifying] agents to beer, which typically [[precipitate]] (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear [[Bright beer|bright]] and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as [[wheat beer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter&amp;nbsp;— A pint of cloudy, please |publisher=Beerhunter.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brewing process==
{{Realale Brewing}}
All beers are brewed using a process based on a simple formula. Key to the process is [[malt]]ed [[cereal|grain]]—  mainly [[barley]], though other cereals, such as wheat or rice, may be added. [[Malt]] is made by allowing a grain to [[germination|germinate]], after which it is then dried in a [[kiln]] and sometimes roasted. The germination process creates a number of [[enzymes]], notably [[α-amylase]] and [[β-amylase]], which convert the starch in the grain into sugar. Depending on the amount of roasting, the malt will take on a dark colour and strongly influence the colour and flavour of the beer. The malt is crushed to break apart the grain kernels, expose the cotyledon which contains the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars, increase their surface area, and separate the smaller pieces from the husks.

There are several steps in the brewing process, which include [[malting]], [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], [[mashing]], [[lautering]], [[#Boiling|boiling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], [[#Conditioning|conditioning]], [[#Filtering|filtering]], and [[#Packaging|packaging]].

Malting is the process where the barley grain is made ready for brewing. Malting is broken down into three steps, which help to release the starches in the barley. First, during [[steeping]], the grain is added to a vat with water and allowed to soak for approximately 40 hours. During germination, the grain is spread out on the floor of the germination room for around 5 days. The goal of germination is to allow the starches in the barley grain to breakdown into shorter lengths. When this step is complete, the grain is referred to as green malt. The final part of malting is kilning. Here, the green malt goes through a very high temperature drying in a kiln. The temperature change is gradual so as not to disturb or damage the [[enzyme]]s in the grain. When kilning is complete, there is a finished [[malt]] as a product.&lt;ref name=ref-14&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alabev.com/ingredie.htm |title=The Ingredients of Beer |publisher=Birmingham Beverage Company |year=2009 |accessdate=23 Nov. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step in the brewing process is milling. This is when the grains that are going to be used in a batch of beer are cracked. Milling the grains makes it easier for them to absorb the water that they are mixed with and which extracts sugars from the malt.&lt;ref name=ref-4&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merchantduvin.com/pages/2_ale_university/aleu_brew_process.html |title=Ale University - Brewing Process |publisher=Merchant du Vin, |year=2009 |accessdate=12 Nov. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Milling can also influence the general characteristics of a beer.&lt;ref name=ref-20&gt;{{Cite news|author=Charlie Papazian |title=Beer Styles: Milling grain will influence beer character - part 11 Washington DC News, Restaurants, more by Top Local Experts, Examiner, |date=30 Sept. 2009 |accessdate=10 Nov. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mashing is the next step in the process. This process converts the starches released during the malting stage, into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is dropped into hot water in a large vessel known as a [[mash tun]]. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash. The leftover sugar rich water is then strained through the bottom of the mash in a process known as [[lautering]]. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about 75 °C (165-170 °F) (known as a mashout) to deactivate enzymes. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as [[Lautering#Sparging|sparging]]).&lt;ref name=ref-21&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ted Goldammer |title=The Brewer's Handbook: The Complete Book To Brewing Beer |publisher=Apex |edition=2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; |isbn=0967521238 |date=1 October 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point the liquid is known as [[Wort (brewing)|wort]]. The wort is moved into a large tank known as a &quot;copper&quot; or [[kettle]] where it is boiled with [[hops]] and sometimes other ingredients such as [[herbs]] or sugars. This stage is where many chemical and technical reactions take place, and where important decisions about the flavour, colour, and aroma of the beer are made.&lt;ref name=ref-1/&gt; The boiling process serves to terminate enzymatic processes, [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] proteins, [[isomerization|isomerize]] hop [[resin]]s, and concentrate and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] the wort. Hops add flavour, [[odor|aroma]] and [[Bitter (taste)|bitterness]] to the beer. At the end of the boil, the hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a &quot;whirlpool&quot;, where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.&lt;ref name=ref-2&gt;{{Cite book|author=I. Hornsey |title=A History of Beer and Brewing |edition=1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;|location=Washington D.C. |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn=0854046305 |year=2004 |accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the whirlpool, the wort then begins the process of cooling. This is when the wort is transferred rapidly from the whirlpool or brew kettle to a [[heat exchanger]] to be cooled. The heat exchanger consists of tubing inside a tub of cold water. It is very important to quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely.&lt;ref name=ref-4/&gt; Yeast is unable to grow in high temperatures.&lt;ref name=ref-1&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.fosters.com.au/enjoy/beer/history_of_beer.htm |title= History of Beer |publisher= Foster's Group Home |accessdate= 22 Nov 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the wort goes through the heat exchanger, the cooled wort goes into a fermentation tank. A type of yeast is selected and added, or &quot;pitched&quot;, to the fermentation tank.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref-1&quot;/&gt; When the yeast is added to the wort, the fermenting process begins, where the sugars turn into alcohol, [[carbon dioxide]] and other components.

The second to last stage in the brewing process is called racking. This is when the brewer racks the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank.&lt;ref name=ref-21/&gt;  Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate.&lt;ref name=ref-2/&gt;

After one to three weeks, the fresh (or &quot;green&quot;) beer is run off into [[conditioning tank]]s. After conditioning for a week to several months, the beer enters the finishing stage.&lt;ref name=ref-4/&gt; Here, beers that require [[filtration]] are filtered, and given their natural polish and colour. Filtration also helps to stabilize the flavour of the beer.&lt;ref name=ref-21/&gt; After the beer is filtered, it undergoes [[carbonation]], and is then moved to a holding tank until bottling.

Mashing is the process of combining a mix of milled [[grain]] (typically [[malt]]ed [[barley]] with [[Adjuncts|supplementary grains]] such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sorghum]], [[rye]] or [[wheat]]), known as the &quot;[[grain bill]]&quot;, and water, known as &quot;liquor&quot;, and heating this mixture in a vessel called a &quot;mash tun&quot;. Mashing allows the [[enzyme]]s in the malt to break down the [[starch]] in the grain into sugars, typically [[maltose]] to create a malty liquid called [[wort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ensminger|1994|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main methods - [[infusion]] mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and [[decoction]] mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rabin|Forget|1998|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably 45°C, 62°C and 73°C), and takes place in a &quot;mash tun&quot; - an insulated brewing vessel with a [[false bottom]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;&quot;Abdijbieren. Geestrijk erfgoed&quot; by Jef Van den Steen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080419004815/http://www.geocities.com/bierbrouwen/bereiding.html Bier brouwen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbeer.com/jjpalmer/ch14.html What is mashing?]&lt;/ref&gt; The end product of mashing is called a &quot;mash&quot;.

Mashing usually takes 1 to 2 hours, and during this time the various temperature rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and the intention of the brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to [[dextrin]]s and then to fermentable sugars such as [[maltose]]. A mash rest from {{convert|49|-|55|C|F}} activates various [[protease]]s, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as [[maize|corn]] and [[rice]], which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at {{convert|60|°C|°F|abbr=on}} activates β-[[glucanase]], which breaks down gummy β-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based β-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of {{convert|65|-|71|C|F}} is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later
in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest at the lower end of the range favors [[β-amylase]] enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like [[maltotriose]], [[maltose]], and [[glucose]] which are more fermentable by the [[yeast]]. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in [[ethanol|alcohol]]. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favors [[α-amylase]] enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and [[dextrin]]s which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and [[pH]] variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.&lt;ref&gt;Kunze, Wolfgang (2004) &quot;Technology Brewing and Malting&quot; [[VLB Berlin]], ISBN 3-921690-49-8 pp.214-218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lautering===
{{Main|Lautering}}
Lautering is the separation of the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]] (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hui|Smith|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, a lauter tun, or a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and [[Lautering#Sparging|sparging]], in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/lauter_tun.htm |title=Lauter Tun Use in Brewing Beer |publisher=www.beer-brewing.com |accessdate=2010-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating [[mash rake|rakes]] or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhammer, T. (2008) The Brewer's Handbook, 2nd edition, Apex, ISBN 978-0-9675212-3-7 pp 181 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one [[hectoliter]]. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates at each end of the structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/wort_separation/mash_filters.htm |title=Mash Filter Use in Brewing Beer |publisher=www.beer-brewing.com |accessdate=2010-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boiling==
Boiling the malt extracts, called wort, ensures its sterility, and thus prevents a lot of infections. During the boil hops are added, which contribute bitterness, flavour, and aroma compounds to the beer, and, along with the heat of the boil, causes proteins in the wort to coagulate and the [[pH]] of the wort to fall. Finally, the vapours produced during the boil volatilise off flavours, including [[dimethyl sulfide]] precursors.

The boil must be conducted so that it is even and intense. The boil lasts between 50 and 120 minutes, depending on its intensity, the hop addition schedule, and volume of water the brewer expects to evaporate.

===Boiling equipment===
[[File:Coors Brew Kettles.jpg|thumb|Brew kettles at [[Coors Brewing Company]].]]
The simplest boil kettles are direct-fired, with a burner underneath. These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing caramelisation and making clean up difficult.

Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses steam jackets in the kettle to boil the wort. The steam is delivered under pressure by an external boiler.

State-of-the-art breweries today use many interesting boiling methods, all of which achieve a more intense boiling and a more complete realisation of the goals of boiling.

Many breweries have a boiling unit outside of the kettle, sometimes called a [[calandria]], through which wort is pumped. The unit is usually a tall, thin cylinder, with many tubes upwards through it. These tubes provide an enormous surface area on which vapor bubbles can nucleate, and thus provides for excellent volitisation. The total volume of wort is circulated seven to twelve times an hour through this external boiler, ensuring that the wort is evenly boiled by the end of the boil. The wort is then boiled in the kettle at [[atmospheric pressure]], and through careful control the inlets and outlets on the external boiler, an overpressure can be achieved in the external boiler, raising the boiling point by a few Celsius degrees. Upon return to the boil kettle, a vigorous vaporisation occurs. The higher temperature due to increased vaporization can reduce boil times up to 30%. External boilers were originally designed to improve performance of kettles which did not provide adequate boiling effect, but have
since been adopted by the industry as a sole means of boiling wort.

Modern brewhouses can also be equipped with internal calandria, which requires no pump. It works on basically the same principle as external units, but relies on convection to move wort through the boiler. This can prevent overboiling, as a deflector above the boiler reduces foaming, and also reduces evaporation. Internal calandria are generally difficult to clean.

===Whirlpooling===
At the end of the boil, the wort is set into a whirlpool. The so-called teacup effect forces the denser solids (coagulated proteins, vegetable matter from hops) into a cone in the center of the whirlpool tank.

In most large breweries, there is a separate tank for whirlpooling. These tanks have a large diameter to encourage settling, and is flat bottomed or with an slope of 1 or 2° towards the outlet, a tangential inlet near the bottom of the whirlpool, and an outlet on the bottom near the outer edge of the whirlpool. A whirlpool should have no internal protrusions that might slow down the rotation of the liquid. The bottom of the whirlpool is often slightly sloped towards the outlet. Newer whirlpools often have &quot;[[Denk ring]]s&quot; suspended in the middle of the whirlpool. These rings are aligned horizontally and have about 75% of the diameter of the whirlpool. The Denk rings prevent the formation of secondary eddies in the whirlpool, encouraging the formation of a cohesive trub cone in the middle of the whirlpool. Smaller breweries often use the brewkettle as a whirlpool. The trub being the solids that the brewer wants to remove from the wort.

===Hopback===
A ''hopback'' is a sealed chamber that is inserted in between the brewing kettle and counter-flow [[wort (brewing)|wort]] chiller.  [[Hops]] are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the fermentation chamber.  It facilitates maximum retention of volatile hop aroma compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort.  Because it is a sealed chamber, the volatile hop compounds are trapped in the hot wort, and then the wort is immediately cooled, which keeps the volatile compounds in solution.

In the United Kingdom, it is common practice to use a hopback to clear the green wort (green wort is wort to which yeast has not yet been added). This device has the same effect as, but operates in a completely different manner than, a whirlpool. The two devices are often confused but are in function, quite different. While a whirlpool functions through the use of centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of fresh hop flowers in a confined space to act as a filter bed to remove trub (pronounced tr-oo-b, tr-uh-b in the UK). Furthermore, while a whirlpool is only useful for the removal of pelleted hops (as flowers don't tend to separate as easily), hopbacks are generally used only for the removal of whole flower hops (as the particles left by pellets tend to make it through the hopback.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|Hough|Stevens|Young|1982|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wort cooling===
After the whirlpool, the wort must be brought down to fermentation temperatures (20-26°Celsius)&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; before yeast is added. In modern breweries this is achieved through a plate [[heat exchanger]]. A plate heat exchanger has many ridged plates, which form two separate paths. The wort is pumped into the heat exchanger, and goes through every other gap between the plates. The cooling medium, usually water, goes through the other gaps. The ridges in the plates ensure turbulent flow. A good heat exchanger can drop 95 °C wort to 20 °C while warming the cooling medium from about 10 °C to 80 °C. The last few plates often use a cooling medium which can be cooled to below the [[freezing point]], which allows a finer control over the wort-out temperature, and also enables cooling to around 10 °C. After cooling, oxygen is often dissolved into the wort to revitalize the yeast and aid its reproduction.

While boiling, it is useful to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which unheated water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary.&lt;ref name=Kunze&gt;Kunze, Wolfgang (2004) &quot;Technology Brewing and Malting&quot; VLB Berlin, ISBN 3-921690-49-8, p.302&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kunze&quot;/&gt;

==Fermenting==
{{anchor|Brewing#Fermenting}}
[[File:Samadams2.jpg|thumb|left|Modern fermentation tanks]]
[[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] in brewing is the conversion of [[carbohydrate]]s to [[alcohol]]s and carbon dioxide or organic acids using [[yeast]]s, [[bacteria]], or a combination thereof, under [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] conditions. A more restricted definition of fermentation is the chemical conversion of [[sugar]]s into [[ethanol]].  The science of fermentation is known as [[wikt:zymurgy|zymurgy]].

After the wort is cooled and [[aerated]] — usually with [[Asepsis|sterile]] air — yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the [[malt]] are metabolized into [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]], and the product can be called beer for the first time. Fermentation happens in tanks which come in all sorts of forms, from enormous cylindro-conical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats.

Most breweries today use cylindro-conical vessels, or CCVs, which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's [[aperture]] is typically around 60°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow towards the cone's apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex.

Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters fermentation chambers, the risk can be well controlled.

Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally. Only a very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation as wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched more or less yearly.

After high [[krausen]] occurs, a [[bung]] device (German: ''Spundapparat'') is often put on the tanks to allow the [[Carbon|C]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;[[carbon dioxide|2]]&lt;/sub&gt; produced by the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer. This bung device can be set to a given pressure to match the type of beer being produced. The more pressure the bung holds back, the more carbonated the beer becomes.

==Fermentation methods==
{{See also|Beer styles}}
[[File:2009-03-21 Beer brewing bubbles.jpg|thumb|Beer fermenting]]
There are three main fermentation methods, [[#Warm fermenting|warm]], [[#Cool fermenting|cool]] and [[#Spontaneous fermentation|wild or spontaneous]]. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the [[cask ale|cask]] or in the [[Bottle conditioning|bottle]].

Brewing yeasts may be classed as &quot;top cropping&quot; (or &quot;top fermenting&quot;) and &quot;bottom cropping&quot; (or &quot;bottom-fermenting&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Priest|Stewart|2006|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was introduced by the [[Danish people|Dane]] [[Emil Christian Hansen]]. Top cropping yeasts are so called because they form a foam at the top of the [[wort]] during fermentation. They can produce higher [[ethanol|alcohol]] concentrations and in higher temperatures, typically {{convert|16|to|24|C|F}}, produce fruitier, sweeter beers. An example of a top cropping yeast is ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L3SU4ahY-m4C&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=Saccharomyces+cerevisiae+ale+yeast&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2zCOTeK5Oc24hAfD8uC7Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae%20ale%20yeast&amp;f=false |title=Brewing yeast and fermentation|author=Chris Boulton, David Quain|page=166 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, 2001|accessdate=2011-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Gibson|2010|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bottom cropping yeasts are typically used to produce cool fermented, [[lager]]-type beers, though they can also ferment at higher temperatures if kept under 34C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SrlVoXTm2rMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=lager+yeasts+lager+can+also+produce+ale&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NjKOTeP6B9O4hAfO7uW7Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=lager%20yeasts%20lager%20can%20also%20produce%20ale&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Brewing |author=Hans Michael Eßlinger|page=123|publisher=Wiley-VCH, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These yeasts ferment more sugars, creating a dryer beer, and grow well at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McFarland|2009|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of bottom cropping yeast is ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', formerly known as ''Saccharomyces carlsbergensis''.

For both types, yeast is fully distributed through the beer while it is fermenting, and both equally [[yeast flocculation|flocculate]] (clump together and precipitate to the bottom of the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts which may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell) which is technically different from true flocculation.

The most common top cropping brewer's yeast, ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate [[dough]] in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to produce fewer off-flavours and tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (with some strains, up to 22%).

To ensure purity of strain, a &quot;clean&quot; sample of brewing yeast is sometimes stored, either dried or refrigerated in a laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8rR-6Prg3TcC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=storing+pure+yeast+strains+freezer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cE4LTa6BFsrChAeBxdXLCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Yeast physiology and biotechnology''], page 140, Graeme M. Walker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=mKfpPwm5ceEC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=storing+pure+yeast+strains&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0U0LTdedPMXLhAfkicnLCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Microbiology of fermented foods, Volume 1''] Brian J. B. Wood&lt;/ref&gt; After a certain number of fermentation cycles, a full scale [[biological reproduction|propagation]] is produced from this laboratory sample. Typically, it is grown up in about three or four stages using sterile brewing wort and [[oxygen]].

===Warm fermenting===
Yeasts such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' are generally fermented at warm temperatures between {{convert|15|-|20|C|F}}, occasionally as high as {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=FBP&gt;{{Harvnb|Lea|Piggott|2003|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the yeast used by [[Dupont Brewery|Brasserie Dupont]] for [[saison]] ferments even higher at {{Convert|29|C|F|0}} to {{Convert|35|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the European Tradition'', pages 168 - 173, Phil Markowski, Brewers Publications (2004), ISBN 0-937381-84-5&lt;/ref&gt; They generally form a foam on the surface of the fermenting beer, as during the fermentation process its [[hydrophobic]] surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and rise; because of this they are often referred to as &quot;top cropping&quot; or &quot;top fermenting&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lea|Piggott|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;— though this distinction is less clear in modern brewing with the use of cylindro-conical tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamforth 2005 66&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bamforth|2005|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warm fermented beers are generally ready to drink within three weeks after the beginning of fermentation, although some brewers will condition them for several months.

===Cool fermenting===
{{Main|Lager}}
Lager is beer that has been cool fermented at around {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, compared to typical warm fermentation temperatures of {{convert|18|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. It is then stored for 30 days or longer close to the [[freezing]] point, and during this storage [[sulphur]] components developed during fermentation dissipate.

Though it is the cool fermenting that defines lager, the main technical difference with lager yeast is its ability to process [[raffinose]] (a [[trisaccharide]] composed of the sugars [[galactose]], [[fructose]], and [[glucose]]) which means that all sugars are fermented, resulting in a well [[Attenuation (brewing)|attentuated]] beer; warm fermenting yeast only [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cleave cleaves] and ferments the fructose portion of raffinose, leaving [[melibiose]], which it cannot further cleave into two [[monosaccharides]] due to its lack of melibiase, so ale remains sweeter with a lower conversion of sugar into alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamforth 2005 66&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eßlinger|2009|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raffinose is a minor dry component of Carlsberg barley, but once malted is practically nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|Briggs|Boulton|Brookes|2004|p=123}} See Table 4.16&lt;/ref&gt;

While the nature of yeast was not fully understood until [[Emil Hansen]] of the [[Carlsberg brewery]] in Denmark isolated a single yeast cell in the 1800s, brewers in [[Bavaria]] had for centuries been selecting cold-fermenting lager yeasts by storing (&quot;lagern&quot;) their beers in cold alpine caves. The process of natural selection meant that the wild yeasts that were most cold tolerant would be the ones that would remain actively fermenting in the beer that was stored in the caves. Some of these Bavarian yeasts were brought back to the Carlsberg brewery around the time that Hansen did his famous work.

Today, lagers represent the vast majority of beers produced, the most famous being a light lager called [[Pilsner]] which originated in [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], Czech Republic ''(Plzeň in [[Czech language|Czech]])''. Lagers range from very light to deep black.

Lager yeast normally ferments at a temperature of approximately 5 °C (40 °Fahrenheit).  Lager yeast can be fermented at a higher temperature normally used for top-fermenting yeast, and this application is often used in a beer style known as &quot;steam beer&quot;. ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'' is used in the brewing of [[lager]]

===Spontaneous fermentation===
{{Main|Lambic}}
These beers are primarily brewed around Brussels, Belgium. They are fermented in oak barrels after being inoculated with wild yeast and bacterias while cooling in a Koelship. Wild yeast and bacteria ferment the [[wort]](unfermented beer) in the oak barrels. The beers fermented from yeast and bacteria in the Brussels area are called [[Lambic]] beers. These bacteria add a sour flavour to the beer. Of the many styles of beer very few use bacteria, most are fermented with yeast alone and bacterial contamination is avoided.
However, with the advent of yeast banks and the [[National Collection of Yeast Cultures]] brewing these beers, although not through spontaneous fermentation, is possible anywhere. Specific bacteria cultures are also available to reproduce certain styles.

''[[Brettanomyces]]'' is a genus of yeast important in brewing [[lambic]], a beer produced not by the deliberate addition of brewer's yeasts, but by spontaneous fermentation with wild yeasts and bacteria.&lt;ref name=Verachtert1995&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Verachtert H, Iserentant D.|year=1995 |title=Properties of Belgian acid  beers and their microflora. 1. The production of gueuze and related refreshing acid beers |journal=Cerevesia |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary fermentation===
After initial or primary fermentation, the beer may be transferred into a second container, so that it is no longer exposed to the dead yeast and other debris (also known as &quot;trub&quot;) that have settled to the bottom of the primary fermenter. This prevents the formation of unwanted flavours and harmful compounds such as [[acetylaldehyde]]s, which are commonly blamed for hangovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Priest|Stewart|2006|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aldridge|1998|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; During secondary fermentation, most of the remaining yeast will settle to the bottom of the second fermenter, yielding a less hazy product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Priest|Stewart|2006|p=532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bottle fermentation'''
{{Main|Bottle conditioning}}
Some beers undergo a fermentation in the bottle, giving natural carbonation. This may be a second or third fermentation. They are bottled with a viable [[yeast]] population in suspension. If there is no residual fermentable sugar left, sugar may be added. The resulting fermentation generates [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] which is trapped in the bottle, remaining in solution and providing natural carbonation.

'''Cask conditioning'''
{{Main|Cask ale}}
Cask ale or cask-conditioned beer is the term for [[filtration|unfiltered]] and [[pasteurization|unpasteurised]] [[beer]] which is conditioned (including secondary fermentation) and served from a cask without additional nitrogen or [[carbon dioxide]] [[pressure]].

==Conditioning==
When the sugars in the fermenting beer have been almost completely digested, the fermentation slows down and the yeast starts to settle to the bottom of the tank. At this stage, the beer is cooled to around freezing, which encourages settling of the yeast, and causes proteins to coagulate and settle out with the yeast. If a separate conditioning tank is to be used, it is at this stage that the beer will be transferred into one. Unpleasant flavours such as phenolic compounds become insoluble in the cold beer, and the beer's flavour becomes smoother. During this time pressure is maintained on the tanks to prevent the beer from going flat.

Conditioning can take from 2 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer, depending on the type of beer. Additionally [[lagers]], at this point, are aged at near freezing temperatures for 1–6 months depending on style. This
cold aging serves to reduce [[sulphur]] compounds produced by the bottom-fermenting yeast and to produce a cleaner tasting final product with fewer [[esters]].

If the fermentation tanks have cooling jackets on them, as opposed to the whole fermentation cellar being cooled, conditioning can take place in the same tank as fermentation. Otherwise separate tanks (in a separate cellar) must be employed. This is where aging occurs.

==Filtering==
[[File:DE and yeast crop.jpg|right|thumb|A mixture of [[diatomaceous earth]] and [[yeast]] after filtering.]]
{{Main|Filtered beer}}
Filtering the beer stabilizes the flavour, and gives beer its polished shine and brilliance. Not all beer is filtered. When tax determination is required by local laws, it is typically done at this stage in a calibrated tank.

Filters come in many types. Many use pre-made filtration media such as sheets or candles, while others use a fine powder made of, for example, [[diatomaceous earth]], also called kieselguhr, which is introduced into the beer and recirculated past screens to form a filtration bed.

Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g. hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters tight enough to strain colour and body from the beer. Normally used filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine and sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration gives a glass of beer that you could read a newspaper through, with no noticeable cloudiness. Finally, as its name implies, sterile filtration is fine enough that almost all microorganisms in the beer are removed during the filtration process.

;Sheet (pad) filters
These filters use pre-made media and are relatively straightforward. The sheets are manufactured to allow only particles smaller than a given size through, and the brewer is free to choose how finely to filter the beer. The sheets are placed into the filtering frame, sterilized (with hot water, for example) and then used to filter the beer. The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked, and usually the sheets are disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.

It should be kept in mind that pre-made filters have two sides. One with loose holes, and the other with tight holes. Flow goes from the side with loose holes to the side with the tight holes, with the intent that large particles get stuck in the large holes while leaving enough room around the particles and filter medium for smaller particles to go through and get stuck in tighter holes.

Sheets are sold in nominal ratings, and typically 90% of particles larger than the nominal rating are caught by the sheet.

;Kieselguhr filters
Filters that use a powder medium are considerably more complicated to operate, but can filter much more beer before needing to be regenerated. Common media include [[diatomaceous earth]], or kieselguhr, and [[perlite]].

Packaging is putting the beer into the containers in which it will leave the brewery. Typically this means putting the beer into bottles, aluminium cans and [[keg]]s, but it may include putting the beer into bulk tanks for high-volume customers.

==Brewing methods==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breast reconstruction''' is the rebuilding of a [[breast]], usually in [[woman|women]]. It involves using [[autologous]] tissue or [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] material to construct a natural-looking breast. Often this includes the reformation of a natural-looking [[areola]] and [[nipple]]. This procedure involves the use of [[breast implant|implants]] or relocated flaps of the patient's own tissue.

==Overview==
The primary part of the procedure can often be carried out immediately following the mastectomy. As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities ([[high blood pressure]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]]) and [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] are higher-risk candidates. Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk. The infection rate may be higher with primary reconstruction (done at the same time as mastectomy), but there are psychologic and financial benefits to having a single primary reconstruction.  Patients expected to receive external beam radiation as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients.

Breast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually takes multiple operations. Sometimes these follow-up surgeries are spread out over weeks or months. If an implant is used, the individual runs the same risks and complications as those who use them for [[breast augmentation]] but has higher rates of [[capsular contracture]] (tightening or hardening of the scar tissue around the implant) and revisional surgeries. 

Outcomes based research on quality of life improvements and psychosocial benefits associated with breast reconstruction &lt;ref&gt;Harcourt, DM, Rumsey, NJ, Ambler, NR, et al. The psychological effect of mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction: a prospective, multicenter study. Plast Reconstr Surg 2003; 111:1060. PMID 12621175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandberg, Y, Malm, M, Blomqvist, L. A prospective and randomized study, &quot;SVEA,&quot; comparing effects of three methods for delayed breast reconstruction on quality of life, patient-defined problem areas of life, and cosmetic result. Plast Reconstr Surg 2000; 105:66. PMID 10626972&lt;/ref&gt; served as the stimulus in the United States for the 1998 [[Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act]][http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/whcra.html], which mandated health care payer coverage for breast and nipple reconstruction, contralateral procedures to achieve symmetry, and treatment for the sequelae of mastectomy. This was followed in 2001 by additional legislation imposing penalties on noncompliant insurers. Similar provisions for coverage exist in most countries worldwide through national health care programs.

==Techniques==

There are many methods for breast reconstruction. The two most common are:

*'''Tissue Expander - Breast implants''' This is the most common technique used in worldwide. The surgeon inserts a [[tissue expansion|tissue expander]], a temporary silastic implant, beneath a pocket under the pectoralis major muscle of the chest wall. The pectoral muscles may be released along its inferior edge to allow a larger, more supple pocket for the expander at the expense of thinner lower pole soft tissue coverage. The use of acellular human or animal dermal grafts have been described as an onlay patch to increase coverage of the implant when the pectoral muscle is released, which purports to improve both functional and aesthtic outcomes of implant-expander breast reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Breuing KH, Warren SM. Immediate bilateral breast reconstruction with implants and inferolateral AlloDerm slings. Ann Plast Surg. 2005 Sep;55(3):232-9. PMID: 16106158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salzberg CA. Nonexpansive immediate breast reconstruction using human acellular tissue matrix graft (AlloDerm). Ann Plast Surg. 2006 Jul;57(1):1-5. PMID 16799299&lt;/ref&gt; 
**In a process that can take weeks or months, [[saline (medicine)|saline]] solution is percutaneously injected to progressively expand the overlaying [[Biological tissue|tissue]]. Once the expander has reached an acceptable size, it may be removed and replaced with a more permanent implant. Reconstruction of the areola and nipple are usually performed in a separate operation after the skin has stretched to its final size.
*'''Flap reconstruction''' The second most common procedure uses tissue from other parts of the patient's body, such as the [[human back|back]], [[buttocks]], [[thigh]] or [[human abdomen|abdomen]]. This procedure may be performed by leaving the donor tissue connected to the original site to retain its blood supply (the vessels are tunnelled beneath the skin surface to the new site) or it may be cut off and new blood supply may be connected.
**'''The [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] flap ''' is the donor tissue available on the back. It is a large flat muscle which can be employed without significant loss of function. It can be moved into the breast defect while still attached to its blood supply under the arm pit (axilla). A latissimus flap is usually used to recruit soft-tissue coverage over an underlying implant. Enough volume can be recruited occasionally to reconstruct small breasts without an implant.
**'''Abdominal flaps''' The abdominal flap for breast reconstruction is the [[TRAM flap]] or its technically distinct variants of microvascular &quot;perforator flaps&quot; like the DIEP/SIEP flaps. Both use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus and the pubis. The [[DIEP flap]] and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts. The contour of the lower abdomen is reliably improved by these procedures which remove the same tissue as an [[abdominoplasty]] (tummy tuck.) TRAM flap procedures may weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but are tolerated well in most patients. To prevent muscle weakness and incisional hernias, the portion of abdominal wall exposed by reflection of the [[rectus abdominis]] muscle may be strengthened by a piece of surgical mesh placed over the defect and sutured in place. Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle, and purport the advantage of less weakening of the abdominal wall, though rectus abdominus muscle function may still be compromised. Other total autologous tissue breast reconstruction donor sites include the buttocks (superior or inferior gluteal artery perforator flaps (SGAP or IGAP)). The purpose of perforator flaps (DIEP, SIEA, SGAP, IGAP) is to provide sufficient skin and fat for an aesthetic reconstruction while minimizing morbidity from harvesting the underlying muscles.

==Other considerations==

Nipple reconstruction is usually delayed until after the breast mound reconstruction is completed so that the positioning can be planned precisely. There are several methods of reconstructing the nipple-areolar complex, including: 
* ''Nipple-Areolar Composite Graft (Sharing)'' - if the contralateral breast has not been reconstructed and the nipple and areolar are sufficiently large, tissue may be harvested and used to recreate the nipple-areolar complex on the reconstructed side. 
* ''Local Tissue Flaps'' - a nipple may be created by raising a small flap in the target area and producing a raised mound of skin. To create an areola, a circular incision may be made around the new nipple and sutured back again. The nipple and areolar region may then be tattooed to produce a realistic colour match with the contralateral breast.
* ''Local Tissue Flaps With Use of AlloDerm'' - as above, a nipple may be created by raising a small flap in the target area and producing a raised mound of skin. AlloDerm (cadaveric dermis) can then be inserted into the core of the new nipple acting like a &quot;strut&quot; which may help maintain the projection of the nipple for a longer period of time. The nipple and areolar region may then be tattooed later.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Garramone, D.O.; Benjamin Lam, D.O.:&quot;Use of AlloDerm in Primary Nipple Reconstruction to Improve Long-Term Nipple Projection&quot; Plastic &amp; Reconstructive Surgery Journal, May 2007, Volume 119, Issue 6, PMID: 17440338&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in breast reconstruction is to match the reconstructed breast to the mature breast on the other side (often fairly 'ptotic' - droopy.) This often requires a lift ([[mastopexy]]), [[breast reduction|reduction]], or augmentation of the other breast.

==Follow-up and Recovery==

Recovery from implant-based reconstruction is generally faster than with flap-based reconstructions, but both take at least three to six weeks of recovery and both require follow-up surgeries in order to construct a new areola and nipple. All recipients of these operations should refrain from strenuous [[sport]]s, overhead lifting, and [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] during the recovery period. TRAM flap patients can show abdominal-muscle weakness on EMG studies, but clinically most patients who have undergone unilateral breast reconstruction (reconstruction of one breast only) return to normal activities after recovery. 

Patients who have undergone bilateral breast reconstruction with TRAM flaps (i.e. reconstruction of both breasts) require sacrifice of both rectus muscles and tend to have permanent abdominal strength loss. For this reason, many plastic surgeons now frown upon bilateral breast reconstruction with TRAM flaps. This also explains the significant patient interest in perforator flap techniques such as the DIEP flap which preserves abdominal muscle function long-term. These patients tend to return to full activity after several weeks without permanent limitations.

There is little information about upper body exercise post-mastectomy. Issues such as simple mastectomy, mastectomy with reconstruction, and mastectomy with lymph node excision and reconstruction all factor into limitations to amount and extent of upper body exercise. Generally, cardiac exercise (treadmill, walking, etc.) are approved for rehabilitation post-surgery and for weight control.

Women who have undergone breast reconstruction must still be followed for local or regional recurrence of their cancer with manual exams of the breast/chest wall and axilla.

The most effective relief from breast reconstruction is [[hilotherapy]], a therapy that provides relief from [[hematoma]], [[pain]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] post-surgery without the dangers of [[frostbite]] and skin [[necrosis]].

The '''Brooklyn Historic Railway Association''''s (BHRA) shop, trolley barn and offices are located in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]], [[Brooklyn, New York]], on the historic Beard Street Piers (circa 1870). BHRA had a fleet of 16 [[tram|trolley]]s (15 [[PCC streetcar|PCC trolleys]] and a leased 1897 trolley car from [[Oslo, Norway]]). Restoration of Brooklyn's trolley routes was hampered due to the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] (DOT) withdrawing its support from the project. Construction was stopped on a 7-block extension to the line due to the removal and scrapping of rails, ties, and other items of railroad equipment by the DOT, which were stored on land that was slated for the &quot;Fairway&quot; supermarket project.

The BHRA's origin began with the rediscovery of the [[Atlantic Avenue Tunnel]] by Bob Diamond in 1980. BHRA was formed in 1982 to restore the historic tunnel. The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel (constructed in 1844) is the world's oldest [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnel. BHRA successfully filed and received designation for the tunnel on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. 

As of June 30, 2003, BHRA was ordered to remove and fill in all trolley tracks on public streets by the DOT.  The DOT revoked consent for the project to proceed or exist on city streets.  Shortly thereafter, BHRA completely ceased operation. Most of the PCC trolleys were removed from Brooklyn. Only the trolleys that are on the Beard Street Pier itself remain. Plans call for moving the remaining four trolleys to the Atlantic Avenue tunnel, as soon as it becomes practical.

The BHRA organized tours of the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel were suspended for a time, but were resumed in 2007.[http://www.nydailynews.com/boroughs/brooklyn/2007/07/26/2007-07-26_tunnel_vision_push.html] BHRA is planning more Atlantic Avenue tunnel tours throughout 2008.

A '''beta-lactam''' ring ([[Beta (letter)|β]]-lactam) is a [[lactam]] with a [[heteroatomic]] [[ring structure]], consisting of three [[carbon]] atoms and one [[nitrogen]] [[atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilchrist | first = T. | title = Heterocyclic Chemistry | publisher = Longman Scientific | location = Harlow | year = 1987 | isbn = 0582014212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A lactam is a cyclic [[amide]].

==Clinical significance==
The beta-lactam ring is part of the structure of several [[antibiotic]] families, the principal ones being the [[penicillin]]s, [[cephalosporins]], [[carbapenem]]s, and [[monobactam]]s, which are, therefore, also called ''[[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s''. These antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial [[cell wall]] synthesis. This has a lethal effect on [[bacteria]], especially on [[Gram-positive]] ones. Bacteria can, however, become [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] against beta-lactam antibiotics by expressing [[beta-lactamase]].

==History==
The first synthetic β-lactam was prepared by [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1907 by reaction of the [[Schiff base]] of [[aniline]] and [[benzaldehyde]] with [[diphenylketene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/anie.200702965 |title=Hugo (Ugo) Schiff, Schiff Bases, and a Century of β-Lactam Synthesis |year=2008 |author=Tidwell, Thomas T. |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=47 |pages=1016 |pmid=18022986 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Staudinger, Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1907, 356, 51 – 123.&lt;/ref&gt; in a [2+2][[cycloaddition]]:
:[[Image:StaudingerLactam.svg]]

== Beta-lactam resistance ==
Because of the popularity of beta-lactam drugs, certain bacteria have been able to develop counter-measures to traditional drug therapies.  An enzyme called [[beta-lactamase]] is present in many different types of bacteria, which serves to 'break' the beta lactam ring, which effectively nullifies the antibiotic's effectiveness. An example such enzyme is the [[NDM-1]] discovered in 2009.

As a response to bacterial resistance to beta-lactam drugs, there are drugs, such as [[Augmentin]]/[[CLA]], that are designed to disable the beta-lactamase enzyme.  [[Augmentin]]/[[CLA]] (FGP) is made of [[amoxicillin]], a beta-lactam antibiotic, and [[clavulanic acid]], a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  The clavulanic acid is designed to overwhelm all beta-lactamase enzymes, bind irreversibly to them, and effectively serve as an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] so that the amoxicillin is not affected by the beta-lactamase enzymes.

=== Secondary beta-lactam drug resistance ===
As a response to increased efficacy of beta-lactamase, some bacteria have changed the proteins that beta-lactam antibiotics bind, the [[penicillin-binding proteins]] (PBPs). Since the PBPs no longer recognize the beta-lactams, the antibiotics are, in essence, useless. This is the mechanism behind the [[MRSA|methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA).

== Mechanism ==
Penicillin, a beta-lactam, covalently binds to and inactivates a bacterium's transpeptidase enzymes.  Transpeptidase enzymes normally crosslink (i.e., connect) &quot;posts&quot; of 4 stacked amino acids into a &quot;fence,&quot; which is the peptide part of peptidoglycan (the rest of the structure is linked sugars that sit on top of the &quot;fence&quot; and further link the &quot;posts&quot;).  Peptidoglycan is the outermost and primary component of the cell wall (which protects and coats) in gram-positive bacteria like Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Transpeptidase or any other protein that binds to penicilin is known as a [[penicillin-binding protein]] or PBP. PBPs vary in their affinity for binding penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.  The amount of PBPs varies among bacterial species.

== Side-effects ==
The most common side-effects of beta-lactams include allergic reactions and gastrointestinal upset.  See individual drug entries for details.

The '''Bishopric of Brandenburg''' was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] established by [[Otto the Great]] in 948, including the territory between the [[Elbe]] on the west, the [[Oder]] on the east, and the [[Schwarze Elster]] on the south, and taking in the [[Uckermark]] to the north. Its seat was [[Brandenburg an der Havel|Brandenburg upon Havel]]. It was a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for some time, probably starting at 1161/1165, but never managed to gain control over a significant territory, being overshadowed by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which was originally seated in the same city. Chapter and cathedral, surrounded by further ecclesiastical institutions, were located on Dominsel (cathedral island), which formed a ''prince-episcopal [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] district'', distinct from the city of Brandenburg. Only in 1929 the - meanwhile former - immunity district was incorporated into the city itself.

==History==
[[Image:Brb dom 19jh.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The ''Cathedral of Ss. Peter and Paul'' in Brandenburg upon Havel, nineteenth century.]] The diocese was originally a [[suffragan]] of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]], but in 968 it came under the archiepiscopal jurisdiction of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]]. The [[Lutici|Lutician uprising of 983]] practically annihilated it; bishops continued to be named, but they were merely titular, until the downfall of the [[Wends]] in the twelfth century and the [[Ostsiedlung|German eastward settlement]] in the diocesan region revived the bishopric.

Bishop [[Wigers, Bishop of Brandenburg|Wigers]] (1138–60) was the first of a series of bishops of the [[Premonstratensian Order]], which chose the occupants of the [[episcopal see|see]] until 1447; in that year a bull of [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]] gave the right of nomination to the [[elector of Brandenburg]], with whom the bishops stood in a close feudal relation.

[[File:Burg Ziesar 14.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Castle of Ziesar'' (Burg Ziesar), now a museum also showing the history of the Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg.]] As rulers of [[imperial immediacy]], regnant in a, however, dispersed territory partitioned into the four bailiwicks ({{lang-de|Ämter}}) of Brandenburg/Havel, [[Ketzin]], [[Teltow]] and [[Ziesar]], the prince-bishops resided in their fortress in Ziesar. The last actual bishop was [[Matthias von Jagow]] (d. 1544), who took the side of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], married, and in every way furthered the undertakings of Elector [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]].

There were two more nominal bishops, but on the petition of the latter of these, the electoral prince [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg|John George]], the secularisation of the bishopric was undertaken and finally accomplished, in spite of legal proceedings to reassert the imperial immediacy of the [[prince-bishopric]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] and so to likewise preserve the diocese, which dragged on into the seventeenth century.

[[File:04SHANG4963.jpg|thumb|BASE jumping from a building in [[Shanghai]]]]
'''BASE jumping''', also sometimes written as '''B.A.S.E jumping''', is an activity that employs an initially packed [[parachute]] to jump from fixed objects.  &quot;B.A.S.E.&quot; is an [[acronym]] that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: [[building]]s, [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]e, spans ([[bridge]]s), and earth ([[cliff]]s).

==History==
The acronym &quot;B.A.S.E.&quot; was coined by filmmaker [[Carl Boenish]], his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield. Carl was the real catalyst behind modern BASE jumping, and in 1978, he filmed the first BASE jumps to be made using ram-air parachutes and the freefall tracking technique (from [[El Capitan]], in [[Yosemite National Park]]). While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping. BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as [[skydiving]] from aircraft, and is currently regarded by many as a fringe [[extreme sport]] or [[stunt]].

BASE numbers are awarded to those who have made at least one jump from each of the four categories (buildings, antennas, spans and earth). When Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield jumped together from a Houston skyscraper on 18 January 1981, they became the first to attain the exclusive BASE numbers (BASE #1 and #2, respectively), having already jumped from an antenna, [[span (architecture)|spans]], and earthen objects. Jean and Carl Boenish qualified for BASE numbers 3 and 4 soon after. A separate &quot;award&quot; was soon enacted for Night BASE jumping when Mayfield completed each category at night, becoming Night BASE #1, with Smith qualifying a few weeks later.

During the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components. Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed that were designed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping.

However, these and other sporadic incidents were one-time experiments, not the systematic pursuit of a new form of parachuting. After 1978, the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as a publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as a true recreational activity. It was this that popularised BASE jumping more widely among parachutists. Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE-jump off of the [[Troll Wall]]. By this time, the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps.

==Comparison with skydiving==
[[Image:03WAVRE006b.jpg|thumb|right|BASE jumping from antenna tower]]
BASE jumping grew out of skydiving. BASE jumps are generally made from much lower altitudes than skydives, and a BASE jump takes place close to the object serving as the jump platform. Because BASE jumps generally entail slower airspeeds than typical skydives (due to the limited altitude), a BASE jumper rarely achieves [[terminal velocity]]. Because higher airspeeds enable jumpers more aerodynamic control of their bodies, as well as more positive and quick parachute openings, the longer the delay, the better.

Skydivers use the air flow to stabilize their position, allowing the parachute to deploy cleanly. BASE jumpers, falling at lower speeds, have less aerodynamic control, and may tumble. The [[aircraft attitude|attitude]] of the body at the moment of jumping determines the stability of flight in the first few seconds, before sufficient airspeed has built up to enable aerodynamic stability. On low BASE jumps, parachute deployment takes place during this early phase of flight, so if a poor &quot;launch&quot; leads into a tumble, the jumper may not be able to correct this before the opening. If the parachute is deployed while the jumper is tumbling, there is a high risk of entanglement or malfunction. The jumper may also not be facing the right direction. Such an off-heading opening is not as problematic in skydiving, but an off-heading opening that results in object strike has caused many serious injuries and deaths in BASE jumping.

At an altitude of 600m (2,000 feet), having been in free-fall for at least 300m (1,000 feet), the jumper is falling at approximately 55&amp;nbsp;m/s (190&amp;nbsp;km/h, 120&amp;nbsp;mph), and is approximately 10.9 seconds from the ground. Most BASE jumps are made from less than 600m (2,000 feet). For example, a BASE jump from a 150m (500&amp;nbsp;foot) object is about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. On a BASE jump, the parachute must open at about half the airspeed of a similar skydive, and more quickly (in a shorter distance fallen). Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers often use specially designed harnesses and parachute containers, with extra large pilot chutes, and many jump with only one parachute, since there would be little time to utilize a reserve parachute. If modified, by removing the bag and slider, stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute, standard skydiving gear can be used for lower BASE jumps, but is then prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as &quot;line-overs&quot; and broken lines).

Another risk is that most BASE jumping venues have very small areas in which to land. A beginner skydiver, after parachute deployment, may have a three minute or more parachute ride to the ground. A BASE jump from 150m (500&amp;nbsp;foot) will have a parachute ride of only 10 to 15 seconds.

One way to make a parachute open very quickly is to use a [[static line]] or direct bag. These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This method enables the very lowest jumps (below 60m / 200&amp;nbsp;ft) to be made, although most BASE jumpers are more motivated to make higher jumps involving free fall. This method is similar to the [[paratrooper]]'s deployment system, also called a PCA (Pilot Chute Assist).

==Legal issues==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
The legal issues that a BASE jumper must consider concern permissions to use the object from which the jump is initiated and the area used for landing.

Surreptitious BASE jumps are often made from tall buildings and antenna towers. The general reluctance of the owners of these objects to allow their object to be used as a platform means many such BASE jumps are attempted covertly. While BASE jumping itself is generally not illegal; making events such as the &quot;Go Fast Games&quot; at the [[Royal Gorge Bridge]] possible; the covert nature of accessing objects usually necessitates trespassing on an object. Jumpers who are caught can expect to be charged with trespassing, as well as having charges like breaking and entering, reckless endangerment, vandalism, or other such charges pressed against them. Other people accompanying the jumper, such as ground crew, may also face charges. In some jurisdictions it may be permissible to use land until specifically told not to. [[Perrine Bridge]] in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], is an example of a man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.

[[Image:BASE jumping - Perrine Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A BASE jumper leaving the [[Perrine Bridge]] in Idaho]]
Once a year, on the third Saturday in October (&quot;[[Bridge Day]]&quot;), permission to BASE jump has explicitly been granted at the [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in [[Fayetteville, West Virginia]]. The New River Gorge Bridge deck is 876 feet (297 m) above the river. This annual event attracts about 450 BASE jumpers, and nearly 200,000 spectators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} If the conditions are good, in the six hours that it is legal, there may be over 1100 jumps. For many skydivers who would like to try BASE jumping, this will be the only fixed object from which they ever jump. On 21 October 2006, veteran BASE jumper [[Brian Lee Schubert]] of [[Alta Loma, Rancho Cucamonga, California|Alta Loma, California]] was killed jumping from the New River Gorge Bridge during Bridge Day activities. His parachute opened late and he plummeted to his death in the waters below. Jumps continued following the recovery of his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-21-wv-jump_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=BASE jumper dies at bridge event in West Virginia | date=22 October 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his friend [[Michael Pelkey]] were the first to make a BASE jump from [[El Capitan]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1966.

The National Park Service has the authority to ban specific activities in US National Parks, and has done so for BASE jumping. The authority comes from 36 CFR 2.17(3), which prohibits, &quot;Delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute, helicopter, or other airborne means, except in emergencies involving public safety or serious property loss, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit.&quot; Under that Regulation, BASE is not banned, but is allowable if a permit is issued by the Superintendent, which means that a mechanism to allow BASE in National Parks was always in place. However, National Park Service Management Policies have stated that BASE &quot;is not an appropriate public use activity within national park areas ...&quot; (2001 Management Policy 8.2.2.7.)  This meant that there could be no permitted air delivery. It is noted, however, that this policy has a proposed change that strikes the language banning it outright and replacing it with a different test. Whether this will be approved, and whether this will make the granting of permits easier, is open to speculation.

In the early days of BASE jumping, the Service issued permits under which jumpers could get authorization to jump from El Capitan. This program ran for three months in 1980 and then collapsed amid allegations of abuse by unauthorised jumpers. Since then, the Service has vigorously enforced the ban, charging jumpers with &quot;aerial delivery into a National Park&quot;. One jumper drowned in the [[Merced River]] while being chased by Park Rangers intent on arresting him. Despite this, illegal jumps continue in Yosemite at a rate estimated at a few hundred per year, often at night or dawn. El Capitan, [[Half Dome]] and [[Glacier Point]] have been used as jump sites.

Other US public land, including land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, does not ban air delivery, and there are numerous jumpable objects on BLM land.

The legal position is better at other sites and in other countries. For example, in Norway's [[Lysefjord]] (from the mountain [[Kjerag]]), BASE jumpers are made welcome. Many sites in the European Alps, near Chamonix and on the Eiger, are also open to jumpers. Some other Norwegian places, like the [[Troll Wall]], are banned because of dangerous rescue missions in the past.

==BASE jumping today==
[[Image:04KJER0243.jpg|thumb|right| Jumpers from a cliff]]
Upon completing a jump from all of the four object categories, a jumper may choose to apply for a &quot;BASE number&quot;, which are awarded sequentially.&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basenumbers.org/ |title=Base Numbers |publisher=Base Numbers |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; BASE #1 was awarded to Phil Smith of Houston, Texas in 1981. The 1000th application for a BASE number was filed in March 2005 and BASE #1000 was awarded to Matt Moilanen of Kalamazoo, Michigan. {{As of|2010|10}}, over 1,400 BASE numbers have been issued.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.basenumbers.org/ui.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

BASE jumping is often featured in action movies. The 2002 [[Vin Diesel]] film ''[[xXx]]'' includes a scene where Diesel's character catapults himself off the [[Foresthill Bridge]] in an open-topped car, landing safely as the car crashes on the ground. In the movie ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]'', includes the scene in which the main characters jump with [[wing suit]]s from the IFC Tower in [[Hong Kong]] and fly over the Bank of China, finally opening their parachutes to land on a moving freighter. The stunt was done in reality with no special effects by the stunt base jumpers Martin Rosén and Per Eriksson, members of the Swedish &quot;Team Bautasten&quot;. The scene was filmed by air to air camera man Mikael Nordqvist from the same team. Since the 1976 [[Mount Asgard]] jump featured in the pre-credits sequence to ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', James Bond movies have featured several BASE jumps, including one from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1985's ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] in 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and in ''[[Die Another Day]]'', 2002, [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond]] jumps from a melting iceberg. Of the James Bond jumps only the Mt Asgard and Eiffel Tower jumps were filmed in reality; the rest were special effects.

''[[Guinness World Records]]'' first listed a BASE jumping record with [[Carl Boenish]]'s 1984 leap from Trollveggen ([[Troll Wall]]) in Norway.  It was described as the highest BASE jump.&lt;ref name=&quot;record&quot;&gt;Here meaning &quot;greatest vertical descent,&quot; not &quot;highest starting elevation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (The jump was made two days before Boenish's death at the same site.) This record category is still in the ''Guinness'' book and is currently held by Australians Glenn Singleman and Heather Swan with a jump from [[Meru Peak]] in northern India at a starting elevation of {{convert|6604|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/leap-from-the-top-of-the-world/2006/06/08/1149359863372.html |title=Leap from the top of the world - World |publisher=smh.com.au |date=2006-06-08 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 8, 2006 Captain Daniel G. Schilling set the Guinness World Record for the most B.A.S.E. jumps in a twenty-four hour period.  Jumping off the Perrine Bridge he set the record with 201 jumps.

BASE competitions have been held since the early 1980s, with accurate landings or free fall aerobatics used as the judging criteria. Recent years have seen a formal competition held at the {{convert|452|m|ft}} high [[Petronas Towers]] in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, judged on landing accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

== Fatalities ==
BASE jumping is one of the world's most dangerous recreational activities, with overall fatalities in 2002 estimated at about one fatality per sixty participants.

{{two other uses||beauty as a characteristic of a person's appearance|Physical attractiveness}}
[[File:Rozeta Paryż notre-dame chalger.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Rayonnant]] [[rose window]] in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. Light was considered as the most beautiful revelation of God, as was manifested in [[Gothic architecture]].]]
'''Beauty''' is a characteristic of a [[person]], [[animal]], [[Location (geography)|place]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], or [[idea]] that provides a [[perception|perceptual]] experience of [[pleasure]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]], or [[Contentment|satisfaction]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Beauty is studied as part of [[aesthetics]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], and [[culture]].  An &quot;ideal beauty&quot; is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The experience of &quot;beauty&quot; often involves the interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Because this is a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience, it is often said that &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;phrase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html|title=Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Phrase Finder|year=2007|author=Gary Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its most profound sense, beauty may engender a [[salience (neuroscience)|salient]] experience of positive reflection about the meaning of one's own [[being|existence]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  A [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] of beauty is anything that resonates with personal meaning.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The classical Greek noun for &quot;beauty&quot; was κάλλος, ''kallos'', and the adjective for &quot;beautiful&quot; was καλός, ''kalos''. The [[Koine Greek]] word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, ''hōraios'',&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65&lt;/ref&gt; an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, ''hōra'', meaning &quot;hour.&quot; In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with &quot;being of one's hour.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Euripides, Alcestis 515&quot;&gt;Euripides, ''Alcestis'' 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, ''hōraios'' had many meanings, including &quot;youthful&quot; and &quot;ripe old age.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Euripides, Alcestis 515&quot;/&gt;

== Historical view of beauty ==
[[File:Cupola di santa maria del fiore dal campanile di giotto, 02.JPG|thumb|250px| [[Florence cathedral]] and dome. Since [[Renaissance]], harmony, symmetry and correct proportions are considered essencial element of the universal beauty.]]
There is evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in child development, and that the standards of attractiveness are similar across different genders and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190208 | author = Rhodes, G. | year = 2006 | title = The evolutionary psychology of facial beauty | url =  | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 57 | issue =  | pages = 199–226 | pmid = 16318594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symmetry (physical attractiveness)|Symmetry]] is also important because it suggests the absence of genetic or acquired defects{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

Although [[style]]{{dn}} and [[fashion]] vary widely, cross-cultural research has found a variety of commonalities in people's perception of beauty. The earliest Western theory of beauty can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] architecture is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that &quot;Virtue aims at the beautiful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to these{{Which?|date=November 2009}} philosophers' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a &quot;classical ideal&quot;. In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose appearance conforms to these tenets is still called a &quot;classical beauty&quot; or said to possess a &quot;classical beauty&quot;, whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. During the [[gothic]] era, the classical aestethical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Only God is beautiful and perfect, and men is flawed by the original sin and can achieve no beauty in his life if not through God. Later, the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Humanism]] rejected this view, and considered beauty as a product of rational order and harmony of proportions. Renaissance artists and architect (like [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his &quot;lives of artists&quot;) criticised the gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view over gothic art lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

The Age of Reason saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is &quot;unity in variety and variety in unity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the nature of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; that

:     Beauty is truth, truth beauty ,—that is all.
:     Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

In the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] pointed out the differences between beauty in its classical meaning and [[Sublime]]. The concept of the Sublime by Burke and Kant permitted to understand that even if Gothic art and architecture are not always &quot;symmetrical&quot; or adherent to classical standard of beauty as the other style, gothic art is by no mean &quot;ugly&quot; or irrational: it's just another aestehical cathegory, the Sublime cathegory.
The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthietics.&lt;ref&gt;The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster&lt;/ref&gt; This despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;The Will to Power&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers such as [[Roger Scruton]]&lt;ref&gt;Beauty: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Turner]]&lt;ref&gt;Beauty: The Value of Values&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Culture of Hope&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebirth of Value: Meditations on Beauty, Ecology, Religion, and Education&lt;/ref&gt; have returned to beauty as an important value. Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice.&lt;ref&gt;On Beauty and Being Just&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human beauty==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of ''Inner Beauty'', which includes psychological factors such as [[Personality type|personality]], [[intelligence]], [[wiktionary:Grace|grace]], [[politeness]], [[charisma]], [[integrity]], [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] and [[elegance]], and ''Outer Beauty'', (i.e. physical attractiveness) which includes physical factors, such as [[health]], [[youthfulness]], [[facial symmetry]], [[averageness]], and [[complexion]].

Standards of beauty are always evolving, based on what a culture considers valuable. Historical paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered to be the most beautiful throughout history.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is &quot;[[averageness]]&quot;, or &quot;[[koinophilia]]&quot;. When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the &quot;ideal&quot; image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when [[Francis Galton]], cousin of [[Charles Darwin]], overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of [[vegetarian]]s and [[criminal]]s to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.

Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1994.tb00503.x | author = Langlois, J.

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a [[waist-to-hip ratio]] of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with [[Female body shape|hourglass figures]] are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-300862/Born-mothers-curvy-hips.html |title=Born mothers have curvy hips &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Utton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People are influenced by the images they see in the media to determine what is or is not beautiful. Feminists and doctors have suggested that the very thin models featured in magazines promote [[eating disorders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/769290.stm | work=BBC News | title=Models link to teenage anorexia | date=May 30, 2000 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a [[Eurocentric]] concept of beauty, feelings of inferiority in women of color,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3626/is_200310/ai_n9248761/ |title=Aesthetic Resistance to Commercial Influences: The Impact of the Eurocentric Beauty Standard on Black College Women* &amp;#124; Journal of Negro Education, The &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31 | first=Dia | last=Sekayi | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genderforum.uni-koeln.de/genderealisations/weedon.html|title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=Gender Forum Electronic Journal|author=Chris Weedon, Cardiff University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[black is beautiful]] cultural movement sought to dispel this notion.&lt;ref name=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucks.edu/~docarmos/BCMnotes.html|title=Dr. DoCarmo's Notes on the Black Cultural Movement|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=Bucks County Community College|year=2007|author=Dr. DoCarmo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mixed race]] children are often perceived to be more attractive than their parents because their genetic diversity protects them from the inherited errors of their individual parents.&lt;ref&gt;Leroi, A. (2003). Mutants: On Genetic Variety and the Human Body. Viking books&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of beauty in men is known as '[[bishōnen]]' in [[Japan]]. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly [[Femininity|feminine]] features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their [[pop culture]] [[Japanese idol|idols]]. A multi-billion-dollar industry of [[Japanese Aesthetic Salons]] exists.

==Effects on society==
Beauty presents a standard of [[social comparison theory|comparison]], and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the &quot;beauty ideal&quot; may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In [[Malèna]], a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may &quot;woo&quot; their husbands.  The noted documentary [[Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld]] explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

Researchers have found that good looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by Sharon BegleyJuly 14, 2009 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/206597 |title=The Link Between Beauty and Grades |publisher=Newsweek |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, attractive patients receive more personalized care from their doctors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Studies have even shown that handsome criminals receive lighter sentences than less attractive convicts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author, [[Eva Ritvo]], show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/galderma/38432 IMAGE SURVEY REVEALS &quot;PERCEPTION IS REALITY&quot; WHEN IT COMES TO TEENAGERS&lt;/ref&gt;

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good looking.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, K. (2005). &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/07/08/looks/ Do pretty people earn more?]&quot; ''CNN News'', Time Warner.&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against others based on their appearance is known as [[lookism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] said of beauty &quot;Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XV.22.html City of God Book 15 Chapter 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ugliness==
'''Ugliness''' is a property of a person or thing that is unpleasant to look upon and results in a highly unfavorable evaluation. To be ugly is to be aesthetically unattractive, repulsive, or offensive.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World College Dictionary'', 3rd edition, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Like its opposite, beauty, ugliness involves a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] judgment and is at least partly in the &quot;eye of the beholder.&quot; Thus, the perception of ugliness can be mistaken or short-sighted, as in the story of ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'' by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. 

Although ugliness is normally viewed as a visible characteristic, it can also be an internal attribute. For example, an individual could be outwardly attractive but inwardly thoughtless and cruel. It is also possible to be in an &quot;ugly mood,&quot; which is a temporary, internal state of unpleasantness.

For some people, ugliness is a central aspect of their persona. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] had a lazy eye and a bloated, asymmetrical face, and he attributed many of his philosophical ideas to his life-long struggle to come to terms with his self-described ugliness.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt ugly&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/|title=The Phenomenology of Ugly|last=Martin|first=Andy|date=August 10, 2010|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] also used his ugliness as a philosophical touch point, concluding that philosophy can save us from our outward ugliness.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt ugly&quot; /&gt; Famous in his own time for his perceived ugliness, [[Abraham Lincoln]] was described by a contemporary: &quot;to say that he is ugly is nothing; to add that his figure is grotesque, is to convey no adequate impression.&quot; However, his looks proved to be an asset in his personal and political relationships, as his law partner [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] wrote, &quot;He was not a pretty man by any means, nor was he an ugly one; he was a homely man, careless of his looks, plain-looking and plain-acting. He had no pomp, display, or dignity, so-called. He appeared simple in his carriage and bearing. He was a sad-looking man; his melancholy dripped from him as he walked. His apparent gloom impressed his friends, and created sympathy for him - one means of his great success.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;carpenter lincoln&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=F.

[[Image:Brownian hierarchical.svg|thumb|Three different views of Brownian motion, with 32 steps, 256 steps, and 2048 steps denoted by progressively lighter colors]]
[[Image:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|A single realisation of three-dimensional Brownian motion for times 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2]]
'''Brownian motion''' (named after the botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]]) or '''pedesis''' (from {{lang-el|πήδησις}} &quot;leaping&quot;&lt;!--not to be confused with πέδησις &quot;braking&quot;--&gt;) is the assumably random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) or the mathematical model used to describe such random movements, which is often called a [[particle|particle theory]]. 

The mathematical model of Brownian motion has several real-world applications. An often quoted example is [[stock market]] fluctuations, however, movements in share prices may arise due to unforeseen events which do not repeat themselves.

Brownian motion is among the simplest of the continuous-time [[stochastic process|stochastic (or probabilistic) processes]], and it is a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes (see [[random walk]] and [[Donsker's theorem]]). This [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] is closely related to the universality of the [[normal distribution]]. In both cases, it is often mathematical convenience rather than the accuracy of the models that motivates their use.  This is because Brownian motion, whose time derivative is everywhere infinite,  is an idealised approximation to actual random physical processes, which always have a finite time scale.

==History==
[[Image:PerrinPlot2.svg|thumb|left|Reproduced from the book of [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]], ''Les Atomes'', three tracings of the motion of colloidal particles of radius 0.53&amp;nbsp;µm, as seen under the microscope, are displayed. Successive positions every 30 seconds are joined by straight line segments (the mesh size is 3.2&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, 1914, [http://www.archive.org/stream/atomsper00perruoft#page/115/mode/1up p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Roman [[Lucretius]]'s scientific poem &quot;[[On the Nature of Things]]&quot; (c. 60 BC) has a remarkable description of Brownian motion of dust particles. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [i.e., spontaneously]. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although the mingling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents, the glittering, tumbling motion of small dust particles is, indeed, caused chiefly by true Brownian dynamics.

[[Jan Ingenhousz]] had described the irregular motion of [[coal]] [[dust]] particles on the surface of [[ethanol|alcohol]] in 1785 - nevertheless Brownian motion is traditionally regarded as discovered by the botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in 1827. Brown was studying [[pollen]] grains of the plant ''[[Clarkia pulchella]]'' suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.

The first person to describe the mathematics behind Brownian motion was [[Thorvald N. Thiele]] in a paper on the method of [[least squares]] published in 1880. This was followed independently by [[Louis Bachelier]] in 1900 in his PhD thesis &quot;The theory of speculation&quot;, in which he presented a stochastic analysis of the stock and option markets. However, it was [[Albert Einstein]] (in one of his [[Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|1905 papers]]) and [[Marian Smoluchowski]] (1906) who independently brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists, and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules.

There are two parts to Einstein's theory: the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the mean square displacement of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities. In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas. In accordance to Avogadro's hypothesis this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22,414 cc at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as Avogadro's number, and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom since the latter is obtained by dividing the a mole of the gas by Avogadro's number.

The first part of Einstein's argument was to determine how far a Brownian particle will travel in a given time interval. Classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance on account of the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo, roughly of the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{21}&lt;/math&gt; collisions per second.&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar43&gt;S. Chandrasekhar, &quot;Stochastic problems in physics and astronomy,&quot; ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' vol. 15, pp. 1–89 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Einstein was led to consider the collective motion of Brownian particles where if &lt;math&gt;\rho(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''density'' of Brownian particles at point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; then it will satisfy the diffusion equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial^2\rho}{\partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion coefficient. Assuming all the particles were located at the origin at the initial time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, the diffusion equation has the solution,
[[File:Diffusion of Brownian particles.svg|thumb|300px|The characteristic bell-shaped curves of the diffusion of Brownian particles. The distribution begins as a [[Dirac delta function]], indicating that all the particles are located at the origin at time t=0, and for increasing times they become flatter and and flatter until the distribution becomes uniform in the asymptotic time limit.]]
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,t)=\frac{1}{(4\pi Dt)^{1/2}}e^{-x^2/4Dt}.&lt;/math&gt;
This expression allowed Einstein to calculate the moments directly. The first moment is seen to vanish meaning that the Brownian particle is equally likely to move to the left as it is to move to the right. The second moment is, however, non-vanishing and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\Delta x^2}=2Dt.&lt;/math&gt;
This expresses the mean square displacement in terms of the time elapsed and the diffusion constant. From this expression Einstein argued that the displacement of a Brownian particle is not proportional to the time elapsed, but rather, to the square root of time.&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A. Einstein,  ''Investigations of the Theory of Brownian Movement'' (Dover, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt; Here we have switched over from the &quot;ensemble&quot; of Brownian particles to the &quot;single&quot; Brownian particle because we can speak about the relative number of particles in a single instant in time equally as well as the amount of time that it takes a Brownian particle to reach a given point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavenda|first=Bernard H.|title=Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics|year=1985|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|isbn=0471906700|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of Einstein's theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities so that by measuring the mean square displacement in a given time interval and determining these physical parameters will lead to the determination of Avogadro's number. Einstein imagined a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces such that there sum will vanish. The beauty of the argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium. In his original treatment, Einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment, but the same conclusion can be arrived at in an infinite number of other ways. Consider, for instance, granules of particles in a gravitational field. Gravity tends to make the particles  settle down whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them thereby driving them up to regions of smaller concentration. Under the action of gravity the particles acquire a downward speed of &lt;math&gt;v=mg/\eta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of a granule, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; the acceleration due to gravity.  In a medium of high viscosity, the acceleration is damped leaving the force proportional to the velocity with the coefficient of viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, of the gas  as the constant of proportionality. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, the particles will be distributed according to the barometric distribution,
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\rho_0e^{-mgh/k_BT},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho-\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in density of particles separated by a height difference of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is Boltzmann's constant, or the ratio of the universal gas constant, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, to Avogadro's number, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature. It is Avogadro's number that is to be determined.

[[File:Brownian motion gamboge.jpg|thumb|The equilibrium distribution for particles of [[gamboge]] shows the tendency for granules to move to regions of lower concentration when affected by gravity.]]
The dynamic equilibrium is established by realizing that the more the granules are pulled down by gravity the greater will be the tendency for the granules to migrate to regions of lower concentration. The flux is given by Fick's law,
:&lt;math&gt;J=-D\frac{d\rho}{dh},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J=\rho v&lt;/math&gt;, and if we introduce the speed &lt;math&gt;v=mg/\eta&lt;/math&gt; under the action of gravity we find
:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{Dmg}{k_BT}.&lt;/math&gt;
In a state of dynamical equilibrium, this speed must be equal to &lt;math&gt;mg/\eta&lt;/math&gt; so that the mass of the particle and the gravitational acceleration disappear leaving
:&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{k_BT}{\eta}=\frac{RT}{N\eta}=\frac{\overline{\Delta x^2}}{2t},&lt;/math&gt;
as the expression for the diffusion coefficient.  The disappearance of &lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt; in the expression for the diffusion constant testifies to the fact that the expression is independent of the type of forces used to determine it. The second equality  follows from the definition of Boltzmann's constant as, &lt;math&gt;k_B=R/N&lt;/math&gt;, while the third equality follows from the first part of Einstein's theory. With the universal gas constant known, all other quantities are physically measurable, and this allows the determination of Avogadro's number, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

Specifically, Einstein predicted that Brownian motion of a particle in a fluid at a [[thermodynamic temperature]] ''T'' is characterised by a [[diffusion coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;D = k_B T / b \,&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''b'' is the [[drag (physics)#Very low Reynolds numbers&amp;nbsp;— Stokes' drag|linear drag]] constant of the particle (in the [[Stokes' law|Stokes]]/low-[[Reynolds number|Reynolds]] regime applicable for small particles).&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar43&gt;S. Chandrasekhar, &quot;Stochastic problems in physics and astronomy,&quot; ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' vol. 15, pp. 1–89 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[root mean square]] displacement in any direction after a time ''t'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2Dt}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar43/&gt;

At first the predictions of Einstein's formula were seemingly refuted by a series of experiments by Svedberg in 1906 and 1907, which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the predicted value, and by Henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than Einstein's formula predicted.&lt;ref&gt;See P. Clark 1976, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; But Einstein's predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaidesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein's theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory's account of the second law of [[thermodynamics]] as being an essentially statistical law.&lt;ref&gt;See P. Clark 1976 for this whole paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuitive metaphor==
Consider a large balloon of 100 metres in diameter. Imagine this large balloon in a football stadium. The balloon is so large that it lies on top of many members of the crowd. Because they are excited, these fans hit the balloon at different times and in different directions with the motions being completely random. In the end, the balloon is pushed in random directions, so it should not move on average. Consider now the force exerted at a certain time. We might have 20 supporters pushing right, and 21 other supporters pushing left, where each supporter is exerting equivalent amounts of force. In this case, the forces exerted towards the left and the right are imbalanced in favor of the left; the balloon will move slightly to the left. This type of imbalance exists at all times, and it causes random motion of the balloon. If we look at this situation from far above, so that we cannot see the supporters, we see the large balloon as a small object animated by erratic movement.

Consider the particles emitted by Brown's pollen grain moving randomly in water: we know that a water molecule is about 0.1 by 0.2&amp;nbsp;nm in size, whereas the particles which Brown observed were of the order of  a few [[micrometre]]s in size (these are not to be confused with the actual pollen particle which is about 100 micrometres). So a particle from the pollen may be likened to the balloon, and the water molecules to the fans, except that in this case the balloon is surrounded by fans. The Brownian motion of a particle in a liquid is thus due to the instantaneous imbalance in the combined forces exerted by collisions of the particle with the much smaller liquid molecules (which are in random [[temperature|thermal]] motion) surrounding it.

==Theory==
===Smoluchowski model===
[[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]]'s theory of Brownian motion&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smoluchowski |first=M. |year=1906 |journal=Bull. Int. de l'Acad. des Sci. de Cracovie|page 202}}&lt;/ref&gt; starts from the same premise as that of Einstein and derives the same probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\rho(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; for the displacement of a Brownian particle along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. He therefore gets the same expression for the mean square displacement: &lt;math&gt;\overline{(\Delta x)^2}&lt;/math&gt;. However, when he relates it to a particle of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; moving at a velocity &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; which is the result of a frictional force governed by Stokes's law, he finds
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{(\Delta x)^2}=2Dt=t\frac{32}{81}\frac{mu^2}{\pi\mu a}=t\frac{64}{27}\frac{mu^2/2}{3\pi\mu a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the particle. Associating the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;mu^2/2&lt;/math&gt; with the thermal energy &lt;math&gt;RT/N&lt;/math&gt;, the expression for the mean square displacement is 64/27 times that found by Einstein. The fraction 27/64 was commented on by Arnold Sommerfeld in his necrology on Smoluckowski: &quot;The numerical coefficient of Einstein, which differs from Smoluchowski by 27/64 can only be put in doubt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sommerfeld |first=A. |year=15/11/1917|journal=Phys. Zeit.|page= 535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoluchowski&lt;ref&gt; loc. cite p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to answer the question of why a Brownian particle should be displaced by bombardments of smaller particles when the probabilities for striking it in the forward and rear directions are equal. In order to do so, he uses, unknowingly, the [[ballot theorem]], first proved by W.A. Whitworth in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Whithworth |first= W. A.|year=1965 |title=Choice and Chance|publisher=Hafner Pub. Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot theorem states that if a candidate A scores &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; votes and candidate B scores &lt;math&gt;n-m&lt;/math&gt; that the probability throughout the counting that A will have more votes than B is &lt;math&gt;[m-(n-m)]/[m+n-m],&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(2m-n)/n&lt;/math&gt;, no matter how large the total number of votes &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; may be. In other words, if one candidate has an edge on the other candidate he will tend to keep that edge even though there is nothing favoring either candidate on a ballot extraction.

If the probability of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; gains and &lt;math&gt;n-m&lt;/math&gt; losses follows a [[binomial distribution]],
:&lt;math&gt;P_{m,n}=\binom{n}{m}2^{-n},&lt;/math&gt;
with equal ''a priori'' probabilities of &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, the mean total gain is
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{2m-n}=\sum_{m=n/2}^n (2m-n)P_{m,n}=\frac{n n!}{2^n[(n/2)!]^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large enough so that Stirling's approximation can be used in the form
:&lt;math&gt;n!\approx\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n\sqrt{2\pi n},&lt;/math&gt;
then the expected total gain will be
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{2m-n}\approx\sqrt{\frac{2n}{\pi}},&lt;/math&gt;
showing that it increases as the square root of the total population.

Suppose that a Brownian particle of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is surrounded by lighter particles of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; which are traveling at a speed &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be &lt;math&gt;mu/M&lt;/math&gt;. This ratio is of the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; cm/sec. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than &lt;math&gt;10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be &lt;math&gt;10^{20}&lt;/math&gt; collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{8}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 to a 1000 cm/sec. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.

These orders of magnitude are not exact because they don't take into consideration the velocity of the Brownian particle, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. Could a such a process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, &lt;math&gt;MU^2/2&lt;/math&gt;, will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, &lt;math&gt;mu^2/2&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1906 Smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smoluchowski |first=M. |year=1906 |title=Zur kinetischen Theorie der Brownschen Molekularbewegung und der Suspensionen |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=326 |issue=14 |pages=756–780 |doi=10.1002/andp.19063261405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes collisions with ''M''&amp;nbsp;{{Unicode|≫}}&amp;nbsp;''m'' where ''M'' is the test particle's mass and ''m'' the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid. It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right. It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt; is the number of collisions from the right and &lt;math&gt;N_L&lt;/math&gt; the number of collisions from the left then after ''N'' collisions the particle's velocity will have changed by &lt;math&gt;\Delta V(2N_R-N)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] is then simply given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N!}{N_R!(N-N_R)!}&lt;/math&gt;

and the total number of possible states is given by &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the probability of the particle being hit from the right &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt; times is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_N(N_R)=\frac{N!}{2^NN_R!(N-N_R)!}&lt;/math&gt;

As a result of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively describe Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid many of the assumptions cannot be made. For example, the assumption that on average there occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;s instead of always just one in a realistic situation.

==Modeling using differential equations==
The equations governing Brownian motion relate slightly differently to each of the two definitions of ''Brownian motion'' given at the start of this article.

===Mathematics===
{{Main|Wiener process}}
[[File:2D Random Walk 400x400.ogv|thumb|right|300px|An animated example of a Brownian motion-like [[random walk]] on a [[torus]]. In the [[scaling limit]], random walk approaches the Wiener process according to [[Donsker's theorem]].]]
In [[mathematics]], Brownian motion is described by the '''Wiener process'''; a continuous-time [[stochastic process]] named in honor of [[Norbert Wiener]]. It is one of the best known [[Lévy process]]es ([[càdlàg]] stochastic processes with [[stationary process|stationary]] [[statistical independence|independent]] increments) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, [[economy|economics]] and [[physics]].

The Wiener process &lt;math&gt;W_t&lt;/math&gt; is characterised by three facts:
#&lt;math&gt;\ W_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\ W_t&lt;/math&gt; is [[almost surely]] continuous
#&lt;math&gt;\ W_t&lt;/math&gt; has independent increments with distribution &lt;math&gt;W_t-W_s\sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s)&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq s \le t&lt;/math&gt;).
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[normal distribution]] with [[expected value]] ''μ'' and [[variance]] ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The condition that it has independent increments means that if &lt;math&gt;0 \leq s_1 \leq t_1 \leq s_2 \leq t_2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;W_{t_1}-W_{s_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_{t_2}-W_{s_2}&lt;/math&gt; are independent random variables.

An alternative characterisation of the Wiener process is the so-called ''Lévy characterisation'' that says that the Wiener process is an almost surely continuous [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] with &lt;math&gt;W_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and [[quadratic variation]] &lt;math&gt;[W_t, W_t] = t&lt;/math&gt;.

A third characterisation is that the Wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; random variables.  This representation can be obtained using the [[Karhunen&amp;ndash;Loève theorem]].

The Wiener process can be constructed as the [[scaling limit]] of a [[random walk]], or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as [[Donsker's theorem]]. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is [[scale invariance|scale invariant]].

The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself can be described approximately by a [[Langevin equation]], an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the [[thermal fluctuations]] of the solvent on the Brownian particle. On long timescales, the mathematical Brownian motion is well described by a Langevin equation. On small timescales, [[inertia]]l effects are prevalent in the Langevin equation.  However the mathematical ''Brownian motion'' is exempt of such inertial effects. Note that inertial effects have to be considered in the Langevin equation, otherwise the equation becomes singular{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}, so that simply removing the [[inertia]] term from this equation would not yield an exact description, but rather a singular behavior in which the particle doesn't move at all{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}.

===Physics===
The [[diffusion equation]] yields an approximation of the time evolution of the [[probability density function]] associated to the position of the particle going under a Brownian movement under the physical definition. The approximation is valid on [[Langevin equation|short]] timescales.

The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself is best described using [[Langevin equation]], an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the [[thermal fluctuations]] of the solvent on the particle.

The displacement of a particle undergoing Brownian motion is obtained by solving the [[diffusion equation]] under appropriate boundary conditions and finding the [[root mean square|rms]] of the solution. This shows that the displacement varies as the square root of the time (not linearly), which explains why previous experimental results concerning the velocity of Brownian particles gave nonsensical results. A linear time dependence was incorrectly assumed.

The Brownian motion can be modeled by a random walk.&lt;ref&gt;

==Lévy characterisation==
The French [[mathematician]] [[Paul Pierre Lévy|Paul Lévy]] proved the following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-valued stochastic process ''X'' to actually be ''n''-dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, Lévy's condition can actually be used as an alternative definition of Brownian motion.

Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a continuous stochastic process on a [[probability space]] (Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;'''P''') taking values in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the following are equivalent:

# ''X'' is a Brownian motion with respect to '''P''', i.e., the law of ''X'' with respect to '''P''' is the same as the law of an ''n''-dimensional Brownian motion, i.e., the [[push-forward measure]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;('''P''') is [[classical Wiener measure]] on ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;+∞);&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).
# both
## ''X'' is a [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] with respect to '''P''' (and its own [[natural filtration]]); and
## for all 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;''t'' is a martingale with respect to '''P''' (and its own [[natural filtration]]), where ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[Kronecker delta]].

==Riemannian manifold==
[[Image:BMonSphere.jpg|thumb|Brownian motion on a 2-sphere.]]

The [[Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|infinitesimal generator]] (and hence characteristic operator) of a Brownian motion on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is easily calculated to be ½Δ, where Δ denotes the [[Laplace operator]]. This observation is useful in defining Brownian motion on an ''m''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g''): a '''Brownian motion on''' ''M'' is defined to be a diffusion on ''M'' whose characteristic operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; in local coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''m'', is given by ½Δ&lt;sub&gt;LB&lt;/sub&gt;, where Δ&lt;sub&gt;LB&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] given in local coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\mathrm{LB}} = \frac1{\sqrt{\det(g)}} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}} \left( \sqrt{\det(g)} \sum_{j = 1}^{m} g^{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where [''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt;]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the sense of [[Invertible matrix|the inverse of a square matrix]].

==Gravitational motion==

In [[stellar dynamics]], a massive body (star, [[black hole]], etc.) can experience Brownian motion as it responds to [[gravitational|gravitational forces]] from surrounding stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merritt&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Merritt  | first = D. | author-link = David Merritt | last2 = Berczik | first2 = P. | last3 = Laun | first3 = F. | title = Brownian motion of black holes in dense nuclei | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 133| issue = 2| pages = 553–563 | date = February 2007 | bibcode = 2007AJ....133..553M | doi = 10.1086/510294}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rms velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of the massive object, of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the rms velocity &lt;math&gt;v_\star&lt;/math&gt; of the background stars by
:&lt;math&gt;
MV^2 \approx m v_\star^2
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m\ll M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the background stars. The gravitational force from the massive object causes nearby stars to move faster than they otherwise would, increasing both &lt;math&gt;v_\star&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt; The Brownian velocity of [[Sagittarius A*|Sgr A*]], the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of the [[Milky Way galaxy]], is predicted from this formula to be less than 1&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Reid  | first = M.

==Popular culture==
Science fiction author [[Douglas Adams]] raised the visibility of Brownian Motion in popular culture when he included it in his description of a Finite Improbability Generator in his work ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Said generator required a source of truly random motion and this was provided by an atomic vector plotter suspended in &quot;a fresh cup of really hot tea&quot;.

'''Barcelona''' ({{IPA-ca|bərsəˈɫonə|lang}}&lt;small&gt;,&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-es|barθeˈlona|lang}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] and the most populous city of [[Catalonia]] and the second largest city in [[Spain]], after [[Madrid]], with a population of 1,621,537 within its administrative limits on a land area of {{convert|101.4|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.

It is the main component of a union of adjacent cities and municipalities named the [[Àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona]] (''AMB'') with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636&amp;nbsp;km² (density 5,060 hab/km²). It is located on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast between the mouths of the rivers [[Llobregat]] and [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] and is bounded to the west by the [[Serra de Collserola]] ridge ({{convert|512|m|ft|0|disp=/|abbr=on}}).

Barcelona is today one of the world's leading [[tourism|tourist]], [[economy|economic]] and [[culture|cultural]] centres, and its influences in [[commerce]], [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[mass media|media]], [[fashion]], [[science]], and the [[arts]] all contribute to its status as one of the [[global city|world's major global cities]].&lt;ref name=GAWC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2008 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network, [[Loughborough University]] |accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Inventory of World Cities |publisher=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network |accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it is a major economic centre and a growing financial centre ([[Diagonal Mar]] area); one of Europe's principal [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] [[port]]s can be found here as well as [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona international airport]], which handles about 30 million passengers per year. It also boasts an extensive motorway network and is a hub of [[high-speed rail]], particularly that which will link [[France]] with Spain and later [[Portugal]]. Barcelona was the 12th-most-visited city in the world and 4th most visited in [[Europe]] after Paris, London, and Rome. It is in addition the most popular tourist destination in Spain (receiving over 5 million tourists every year).&lt;ref name=&quot;Caroline Bremner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euromonitor.com/_Euromonitor_Internationals_Top_City_Destinations_Ranking|title=Euromonitor International's Top City Destinations Ranking |publisher=[[Euromonitor International]] |first= Caroline |last=Bremner |date=12 December 2008|accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona is the [[World's most livable cities#Most Liveable Cities Index|16th most &quot;livable city&quot; in the world]] according to lifestyle magazine [[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Magazine-Articles/The-Worlds-top-25-most-liveable-cities/ |title=Monocle, Issue June 2009 |publisher=Monocle.com |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on ''Innovation Cities™ Global 256 Index''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovation-cities.com/2thinknow-innovation-cities-global-256-index/|title=Independent city analysis and rankings for innovation in 2009| accessdate=2009-08-01| publisher=2thinknow}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[List of cities by GDP|4th richest city by GDP]] in the [[European Union]] and 35th in the world with an output amounting to €177 billion, a figure nonetheless smaller than alternative estimates.&lt;ref name=&quot;pricewater&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=3421&amp;NewsAreaID=2|title=Global city GDP rankings 2008–2025|publisher=Pricewaterhouse Coopers|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, its GDP per capita output stands at €35,975 – some 44% higher than the European Union average.

Founded as a Roman city, Barcelona became the capital of the [[Counts of Barcelona]]. After merging with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], it became one of the most important cities of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Besieged several times during its history, Barcelona is today an important cultural centre and a major [[tourist destination]] and has a rich [[cultural heritage]]. Particularly renowned are architectural works of [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] that have been designated [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. The city is well known in recent times for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. The headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] is located in Barcelona.

As the capital of [[Catalonia]], Barcelona houses the seat of the Catalan government, known as the [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat de Catalunya]]; of particular note are the [[Government of Catalonia|executive branch]], the [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]], and the [[Supreme Court]] of [[Catalonia]]. The city is also the capital of the [[Province of Barcelona]] and the [[Barcelonès]] [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] (shire).

==Names==
The name ''Barcelona'' comes from the ancient Iberian [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''Barkeno'', attested in an ancient coin inscription in [[Iberian scripts|Iberian script]] as [[File:Barkeno.png|34px|Barkeno in Levantine Iberian script]],&lt;ref&gt;''Emerita: Revista de Lingüística y Filología clasica'' 11 (1943), p.468&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ancient Greek]] sources as {{polytonic|Βαρκινών}}, ''Barkinṓn'';&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy]], ii. 6. §&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Latin]] as ''Barcino''{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, ''Barcilonum''&lt;ref&gt;[[Rufus Festus Avienus]] ''Ora Maritima'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/avienus.ora.html « et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium. » v514]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Barceno''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], the city was variously known as ''Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelona'', and ''Barchenona''.

Some sources say that the city could have been named after the Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]], who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Barcelona |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Barcelona}}
The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological [[Hercules]] 400&amp;nbsp;years before the building of [[Rome]]. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of [[Hannibal]], who named the city ''Barcino'' after his family, in the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Oros. vii. 143; Miñano, ''Diccion.'' vol.&amp;nbsp;i. p.&amp;nbsp;391; Auson. ''Epist.'' xxiv. 68, 69, ''Punica Barcino''.&lt;/ref&gt;

About [[15 BC|15&amp;nbsp;BC]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] redrew the town as a ''[[castra|castrum]]'' (Roman military camp) centred on the &quot;''Mons Taber''&quot;, a little hill near the contemporary city hall ([[Plaça de Sant Jaume]]). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of ''Faventia'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] iii. 3. s.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; or, in full, ''Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino''&lt;ref&gt;Inscr. ap. Gruter, p. 426, nos. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino''. [[Mela]]&lt;ref&gt;ii. 6&lt;/ref&gt; mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour ''[[Tarragona|Tarraco]]'' (modern [[Tarragona]]); but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Avien. ''Ora Maritima.'' 520: &quot;Et Barcilonum amoena sedes ditium.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.&lt;ref&gt;Paul. Dig. 1. tit. 15, de Cens.&lt;/ref&gt; The city minted its own coins; some from the era of [[Galba]] survive.

Some important Roman ruins are exposed under the [[Plaça del Rei]], entrance by the city museum ([[Museu d'Història de la Ciutat]]), and the typically Roman grid-planning is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (&quot;Gothic Quarter&quot;). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/spain/barcelona/walls/walls.html |title=Roman walls, Barcelona |publisher=Bluffton.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral, also known as basilica ''La Seu'', is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] in the early 5th century becoming for a few years the capital of the whole [[Hispania]]. Afterwards by the [[Arabs]] in the early 8th century, reconquered in 801 by [[Charlemagne]]'s son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]] who made Barcelona the seat of Carolingian &quot;[[Marca Hispanica|Spanish Marches]]&quot; (''Marca Hispanica''), a [[buffer zone]] ruled by the [[Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]].

The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of [[Catalonia]]. In 1137, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Counts of Barcelona|County of Barcelona]] merged by [[dynastic union]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bisson_31&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The medieval Crown of Aragon.

His territories were later to be known as the [[Crown of Aragon]] which conquered many overseas possessions, ruling the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] with outlying territories [[Naples|in Naples]] and Sicily and as far as [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] in the 13th century. The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline.

[[File:Monjuic's castle in Barcelona.jpg|thumb|300px|The fortress at Montjuïc that was the most southerly point from which measurements were made when constructing the prototype metre]]
The marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 united the two royal lines. The centre of political power became [[Madrid]] and the colonisation of the [[Americas]] reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was always the stronghold of Catalan separatism and was the center of the [[Catalan Revolt]] (1640–52) against [[Philip IV of Spain]]. The [[Black Death|great plague]] of 1650–1654 had halved the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm Chapter 15: A History of Spain and Portugal], Stanley G. Payne&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic wars]] left the province ravaged, but the postwar period saw the start of industrialization.

In the eighteenth centurty a fortres was built at [[Montjuïc]] that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomers [[Pierre Méchain|Pierre François André Méchain]] for observations relating to a survey stretching to [[Dunkirk]] that provided the basis of the [[metre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn = 0-349-11507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799.

The resistance of Barcelona to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of [[Catalonia]] were abolished&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 1938-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of the [[Catalan language]] in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly [[Andalucia]], [[Murcia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation. Barcelona hosted the [[Olympic Games]] in 1992, which helped revitalize the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53030/Barcelona Barcelona (Spain)]&quot;.

Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], facing the [[Mediterranean Sea]], on a plateau approximately {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide limited by the mountain range of [[Serra de Collserola|Collserola]], the [[Llobregat]] river to the southwest and the [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]] river to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;gec_3&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana | title = Barcelona  | year = 1971 | month = July | publisher = Edicions 62 | volume = 3 | location = Barcelona | pages = 193–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This plateau has {{convert|170|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;gec_3&quot; /&gt; of which 101&amp;nbsp;km² (38.9&amp;nbsp;[[Square mile|sq&amp;nbsp;mi]])&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/inf/guies/bcn.pdf |title=11 Barcelona.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; are occupied by the city itself. It is 160&amp;nbsp;km (100&amp;nbsp;mi) south of the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Catalonia]]n border with [[France]].

[[Tibidabo]], {{convert|512|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, offers striking views over the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panoramas.dk/fullscreen/fullscreen33.html |title=Barcelona Spain Tibidabo Sagrat Cor Church. Full Screen QTVR panoramic image |publisher=Panoramas.dk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is topped by the {{convert|288.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} [[Torre de Collserola]], a [[Radio masts and towers|telecommunications tower]] that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized and that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as [[El Carmel|Carmel]] (267&amp;nbsp;m), [[Putxet]] (181&amp;nbsp;m) and Rovira (261&amp;nbsp;m). The escarpment of [[Montjuïc]] (173&amp;nbsp;m), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by [[Montjuïc castle]], a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.

The city borders are the municipalities of [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]] to the north; the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east; [[El Prat de Llobregat]] and [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]] to the south; and [[Sant Feliu de Llobregat]], [[Sant Just Desvern]], [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]], and [[Montcada i Reixac]] to the west.

===Climate===
Barcelona has a [[Mediterranean climate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.cat/mediamb_xemec/servmet/index.html |title=Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya |publisher=Meteo.cat |date= |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/
| title=World Map of Köppen−Geiger Climate Classification}}&lt;/ref&gt; with mild, humid winters and warm, dry summers. Barcelona is located on the eastern coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], so Atlantic west winds often arrive in Barcelona with low humidity, producing no rain. The proximity of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], its [[latitude]], and the [[relief]], are the reasons why the summers are not as dry as in most other [[Mediterranean Basin]] locations. Lows (not surface lows but high-atmospheric &quot;cold invasions&quot;) can easily affect the area of Barcelona (and Catalonia), causing storms, particularly in August. Some years, the beginning of June is still cool and rainy, like April and May. Together with August, September, October and November these months are the wettest of the year. The driest are February, March, June and July. As in many parts of Catalonia, the annual weather pattern varies greatly from year to year. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Its average annual temperature is {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|11|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. Average annual temperature of sea is about {{convert|18|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In the coldest month – January, the typically temperature ranges from {{convert|8|to|17|C|F}} during the day, {{convert|2|to|10|C|F}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=weather2travel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/spain/barcelona.php|title=Weather2Travel.com: Barcelona Climate Guide|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the warmest month – August, the typically temperature ranges from {{convert|25|to|31|C|F}} during the day, about {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night and the average sea temperature is {{convert|25|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=weather2travel /&gt; Generally – summer's season, lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional, sometimes temperature exceeds {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with average temperature of {{convert|17|-|18|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|8|-|9|C|F}} at night. December, January, February, and March are the coldest months, with average temperatures over {{convert|14.5|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|5.5|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in summer months. Sunshine hours is 2,524 per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine / day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine / day) in July. Average [[relative humidity]] is 72%, from 69% in July to 75% in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meteorología&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/elclima/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=0076&amp;k=cat |title=Valores Climatológicos Normales.

The highest temperature recorded in the city centre was {{convert|39.9|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 27 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/826286/catalunya/Lonada-de-calor-deixa-temperatures-historiques-a-Barcelona-i-Tarragona |title=L'onada de calor deixa temperatures històriques a Barcelona i Tarragona |publisher=3cat24.cat |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coldest temperature recorded was {{convert|-6.7|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 11 February 1956 and {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1985. However, in the 19th century {{convert|-9.6|°C|1|abbr=on}} was recorded in January 1896. At the [[Fabra Observatory]], situated on the [[Tibidabo]] hill, {{convert|412|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} above the [[sea level]], the record summer temperature is {{convert|39.8|°C|0|abbr=on}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jgiro2002/clima.html |title=Grup dels Sis: Climatologia de Catalunya |publisher=Oocities.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027044907/http://geocities.com/jgiro2002/clima.html|archivedate=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 July 1982, and the lowest temperature ever registered, {{convert|-10.0|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 11 February 1956.

[[Snow]]falls are rare, seldom causing any disruption to traffic, but frost at night is common on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tethys.cat/ |title=TETHYS |publisher=Tethys.cat |date= |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acam.cat/node/90 |title=Barcelona es, o no, ciudad de nieves &amp;#124; Associació Catalana de Meteorologia |publisher=Acam.cat |date= |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the city has experienced its share of heavy snowfalls, as for example at Christmas 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acam.cat/?q=taxonomy/term/18&amp;page=3 |title=Situacions extraodinaries &amp;#124; Associació Catalana de Meteorologia |publisher=Acam.cat |date=1962-12-27 |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a true blizzard affected the city, with {{convert|50|cm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of snow falling within the city and at least 1 metre on the hills. But, according to old news sources, the greatest snowfall took place in 1887, with over {{convert|50|cm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. The third heaviest snowfall was in December 1933, with {{convert|30|cm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} on [[Montjuïc]] hill.
The most recent ones took place on 8 March 2010, 6 January 2009, 27 January 2006, 28 February 2005, 29 February 2004, 18 February 2003, 14 December 2001 and the 21st November 1999 (the earliest snowfall for at least three centuries).

[[Thunderstorm]]s, which occasionally reach severe limits, are common from mid August until November. The most recent major summer storm was on the 31 July 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/hangar/3283/Montgat.html |title=Montgat |publisher=Geocities.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-22|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/hangar/3283/Montgat.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+20:55:00|archivedate=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; when over {{convert|200|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of rain were recorded at some observatories.

Though Barcelona is normally not a windy city, it is affected by sea breezes from May/June to September and winds from the west and northwest in winter. Eastern gales sometimes cause floods on the coastline. East and northeast winds can exceed {{convert|100|km/h|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. In winter Barcelona is sometimes affected by the [[tramontane|tramontana]] or [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] winds, like other places in the Northwestern Mediterranean Basin.

Barcelona is generally a sunny city, however, some days of [[fog]] and spells of cloudy days are not rare. Sea fog is frequent in early spring, when the first warm African [[air mass]]es come in over the cold [[Seawater|sea water]]. Cloudy days are most frequent from April to October/November.

==Main sites==
[[File:Sagradafamilia-overview.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sagrada Família|La Sagrada Família]] church, [[Antoni Gaudí|Gaudi]]'s masterpiece]]
[[File:HospitaldeSantPau.jpg|thumb|[[Hospital de Sant Pau]]]]
The ''[[El Gòtic|Barri Gòtic]]'' (&quot;Gothic Quarter&quot; in Catalan) is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan ''[[modernisme]]'' architecture (often known as [[Art Nouveau]] in the rest of Europe), developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. A great number of these buildings are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect [[Antoni Gaudí]], which can be seen throughout the city. His best known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the [[Sagrada Família]], which has been under construction since 1882, and is still financed by private donations. As of 2007, completion is planned for 2026.

Barcelona was also home to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Barcelona Pavilion]]. Designed in 1929 for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|International Exposition]] for Germany, it is an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms &quot;less is more&quot; and &quot;God is in the details.&quot; The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] for its architecture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080227000034/http://www.architecture.com/fileLibrary/pdf/Royal_Gold_Medallists_at_09112006.pdf RIBA Royal Gold Medallists]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first (and as of 2009, only) time that the winner has been a city, and not an individual architect.

===Museums===
{{Main|List of museums in Barcelona}}
Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|National Museum of Art of Catalonia]] possesses a well-known collection of [[Romanesque art]] while the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]] focuses on [[Post-war|post-1945]] Catalan and [[Spanish art]]. The [[Fundació Joan Miró]], [[Museu Picasso|Picasso Museum]] and [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies]] hold important collections of these world-renowned artists.

Several museums cover the fields of history and archeology, like the City History Museum, the Museum of the [[History of Catalonia]], the [[Archaeology Museum of Catalonia|Archeology Museum of Catalonia]], the Barcelona [[Maritime museum|Maritime Museum]] and the private-owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while Cosmocaixa is a [[science museum]] that received the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in 2006.

===Parks===
[[File:Parcguell.jpg|thumb|right||The entrance to Gaudí's &quot;[[Park Güell|Parc Güell]]&quot;.]]
Barcelona contains 68 municipal parks, divided into 12&amp;nbsp;historic parks, 5&amp;nbsp;thematic (botanical) parks, 45&amp;nbsp;[[urban park]]s and 6&amp;nbsp;forest parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal |url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_mapa.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins &gt; Els Parcs &gt; Els Parcs de Barcelona |publisher=Bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city ({{convert|549.7|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on|lk=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot; /&gt; The total park surface grows about {{convert|10|ha|acre|0|abbr=on|}} per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal |url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_ciu.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins &gt; Els Parcs &gt; Història &gt; La ciutat i el verd |publisher=Bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a proportion of {{convert|18.1|m2|sqft|0}} of park area per inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal |url=http://www.bcn.es/parcsijardins/cat/parcs/pa_his_demo.htm |title=Parcs i Jardins &gt; Els Parcs &gt; Història &gt; La democràcia |publisher=Bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Barcelona's parks, [[Montjuïc]] is the largest, with 203&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] located on the mountain of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot; /&gt; It is followed by [[Parc de la Ciutadella]] (situated in the place of the old military [[citadel]] and which houses the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Parliament]] building, the [[zoo]] and several museums; {{convert|31|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}} including the zoo), the [[Guinardó Park]] ({{convert|19|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}), [[Park Güell]] (designed by [[Antoni Gaudí]]; {{convert|17.2|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}), [[Oreneta Castle Park]] (also {{convert|17.2|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}), [[Diagonal Mar Park]] ({{convert|13.3|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}, inaugurated in 2002), [[Nou Barris Central Park]] ({{convert|13.2|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}), [[Can Dragó Sports Park]] and [[Poblenou Park]] (both {{convert|11.9|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}) and the [[Labyrinth Park]] ({{convert|9.10|ha|acre|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}), named after the garden maze it contains.&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot; /&gt; A part of the Collserolla Park is also within the city limits.

===Beaches===
[[File:050529 Barcelona 059.jpg|right|thumb|Barceloneta beach]]
Barcelona is listed first among the Top 10 Beach Cities in the world by ''[[National Geographic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/#/beach-barcelona-spain_21757_600x450.jpg|title=Top 10 Beach Cities|accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5&amp;nbsp;km (2.8&amp;nbsp;mi) of coastline. [[Sant Sebastià]] and [[La Barceloneta, Barcelona|Barceloneta]] beaches, both {{convert|1100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in length,&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot; /&gt; are the largest, oldest and the most frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic port separates them from the other city beaches: [[Nova Icària]], [[Bogatell]], [[Mar Bella]], [[Nova Mar Bella]] and [[Llevant]]. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640&amp;nbsp;m/1,300 to 2,100&amp;nbsp;ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is replenished from quarries given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Barceloneta beach gained status as the best urban beach in the World and total third best beach in the World, according the documentary film &quot;Worlds Best Beaches&quot; produced by [[Discovery Channel]] in 2005.

===Other===
[[File:Torre Palau Reial.jpg|thumb|The Mirador of King Martin, in the [[Palau Reial Major]].]]
[[File:Catalunya Barcelona1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Plaça Catalunya]]
The area around the [[Plaça de Catalunya, Barcelona|Plaça Catalunya]] makes up the city's historical centre and, alongside the upper half of [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Avinguda Diagonal]], is the main commercial area of the city. Barcelona has several commercial complexes, like [[L'Illa]] in the higher part of the Diagonal avenue and [[Diagonal Mar i Front Marítim del Poblenou|Diagonal Mar]] in the lowest, [[La Maquinista]], [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, Barcelona|Glòries]] in the place of the same name and the [[Maremagnum]] by the port.

Barcelona has several skyscrapers, the tallest being the [[Hotel Arts]] and its twin the [[Torre Mapfre]], both {{convert|154|m|ft|0|abbr=on|}} high, followed by the newest, [[Torre Agbar]] {{convert|144|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Barcelona is conveniently situated at just 125&amp;nbsp;km from the ski resorts of the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenées]]. The skyline of the city is decorated in winter by the summit ({{convert|1712|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} high) of the [[Montseny]] mountain, normally covered by snow.

==Demographics==
[[File:Demografía Barcelona (España).PNG|right|300px|thumb|Demographic evolution, 1900–2007, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística]]
According to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1 June 2006 was

Of the 13.9% from other countries, a proportion which has more than tripled since 2001 when it was 3.9%,&lt;ref name=&quot;guies_estadistiques&quot; /&gt; the majority come from (in order) [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Morocco]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]], [[Pakistan]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201090.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221131647/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201090.htm |archivedate=2007-12-21 |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Estadística: Nacionalitat per sexe. 2005 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the national language, Spanish is understood almost universally in Barcelona. 95% of the population understand Catalonia's native [[Catalan language]], while 74.6% can speak it, 75% can read it, and 47.1% can write it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0202050.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221140520/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0202050.htm |archivedate=2007-12-21 |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Estadística: Coneixement de la llengua catalana per grans grups d'edat. 2001 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to the linguistic immersion [[education|educational system]]. While most of the population state they are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] (208&amp;nbsp;churches), there are also a number of other groups, including [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (71&amp;nbsp;locations, mostly professed by [[Romani people in Spain|Roma]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (21&amp;nbsp;[[Kingdom Hall]]s) and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (13&amp;nbsp;locations),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/ab/asia/equipament/controller/0,2317,1653_71890_3,00.html?accio=llista_eq&amp;primera_busqueda=true&amp;temaOriginal=&amp;tema=0040101011_Religion&amp;que=&amp;opcio2=&amp;opcio=districte&amp;districte=&amp;zona=&amp;carrer=&amp;numero=&amp;al= |title=Barcelona: Directory: Theme: Religion |publisher=W3.bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of [[Muslim]]s due to [[immigration]].

In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people,&lt;ref name=&quot;gec_3&quot; /&gt; which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher [[quality of life]] in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071221131641/http://www.bcn.es/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/cap02/C0201010.htm |archivedate=2007-12-21 |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Estadística: Evolució de la població. 1900–2005 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population density===
Note: ''This text is entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city council.''

Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,628,090 living in the 102.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre.

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited [[Zona Franca (Barcelona)|Zona Franca]] industrial area and [[Montjuïc]] forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 square kilometres at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22,7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of [[Sagrada Família, Barcelona|la Sagrada Família]] where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.

==Economy==
[[File:Barcelona Finanse Center (skyline).jpg|thumb|Barcelona Business Centre.]]
[[File:BCN-ParcForum-4923.jpg|thumb|right|[[Diagonal Mar]] area in 2004, yet during the expansion.]]
The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people in one of the richest regions in [[Southern Europe]] – Catalonia, with a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] per capita amounting to [[euro|€]]30,700 [[Economy of the European Union#Richest &amp; Poorest NUTS Regions (GDP PPP 2007)|European Union's GDP PPP per capita]]). Furthermore, the Barcelona metropolitan area has a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting €177 billion]] what is equivalent to €35,975 in per capita terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pricewater&quot;/&gt;

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the region was one of the earliest to begin industrialization in [[continental Europe]], beginning with textile related works from the mid 1780s but really gathering momentum in the mid 19th century, when it became a major centre for the production of textiles and machinery. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. The traditional importance in textiles is reflected in Barcelona's repeated attempts to become a major fashion centre. In summer 2000, the city became a host for the prestigious [[Bread &amp; Butter]] urban fashion fair until 2009 when it was announced that it would be held again on Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;bread&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Bread &amp; Butter Barcelona.

As in other modern cities, the [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]] has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries today are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, telecommunications and [[information technology]] services. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Drawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is nowadays also known for its award-winning [[industrial design]]. It also has several congress halls, notably [[Fira de Barcelona]] (Trade Fair), that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year, which had also meant the opening of new hotels each year. However, the economic crisis and deep cuts in business travel are affecting the Council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negocios.com/negocios/01-02-2009+crisis_pone_jaque_proyectos_nuevos_hoteles_barcelona_madrid,noticia_1img,28,28,46013 La crisis pone en jaque los proyectos de nuevos hoteles en Barcelona y Madrid]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[Recession|economic downturn]], the recent mafia-style killing of the director of the city's International Convention Centre may only worsen matters. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Government and administrative divisions==
{{See also|Municipal elections in Barcelona|List of mayors of Barcelona}}

Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councilors, [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|elected]] for a four-year term by [[universal suffrage]]. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the ''Carta Municipal'' (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley 1/2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=2006/04583 |title=BOE – LEY 1/2006, de 13 de marzo, por la que se regula el Régimen Especial del municipio de Barcelona |publisher=Boe.es |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councilors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,2687,200713899_200720868_1,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona &gt; Ajuntament &gt; El Govern de la Ciutat |publisher=W3.bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.cat/catala/laciutat/barcelona/organitzacio.htm |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona: Organització política |publisher=Bcn.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, [[road traffic safety|road safety]] and [[public safety]]. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a [[veto]] in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley 1/2006&quot; /&gt;

The ''Comissió de Govern'' (Government Commission) is the [[executive (government)|executive]] branch, formed by 24 councilors, led by the [[List of mayors of Barcelona|Mayor]], with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councilors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councilors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,4358,200713899_200720894_3,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona &gt; Council&gt; The city government&gt; Council Executive |publisher=W3.bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plenary, formed by the 41 city councilors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,4358,200713899_200720876_3,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona &gt; Council&gt; The city government&gt; Plenary |publisher=W3.bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six ''Commissions del Consell Municipal'' (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councilors proportional to the number of councilors each political party has in the plenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,4358,200713899_200720890_3,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona &gt; Council&gt; The city government&gt; Committees of the Municipal Council |publisher=W3.bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of [[Urban planning|city planning]], transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the ''[[Guàrdia Urbana de Barcelona|Guàrdia Urbana]]'' (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on.), culture, sports, youth and [[welfare|social welfare]]. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central [[Government of Spain|Spanish government]].

The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two tipes: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V61/Home/V61HomeLinkPl/0,4358,200713899_200722250_3,00.html |title=Ajuntament de Barcelona &gt; Council&gt; The municipal administration |publisher=W3.bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|coming of the Spanish democracy]], Barcelona [[Municipal elections in Barcelona|had been governed]] by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|PSC]], first with an [[absolute majority]] and later in coalition with [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens|ICV]. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on [[22 May]] [[2011]], [[Convergence and Union|CiU]] gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

===Districts===
Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10&amp;nbsp;administrative districts (''districtes'' in Catalan, ''distritos'' in Spanish), each one with its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions. Several of the city's districts are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. The official names of these districts are in the Catalan language.

Barcelona has a well-developed [[higher education]] system of [[public university|public universities]]. Most prominent among these is the [[University of Barcelona]], a world-renowned research and teaching institution with [[campus]]es around the city. Barcelona is also home to the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], and, in the private sector, the newer [[Pompeu Fabra University]] and the [[IESE|IESE Business School]], as well as the largest private educational institution, the [[Ramon Llull University]], which encompasses internationally-prestigious schools and institutes such as the [[ESADE]] Business School.

The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of the city council (though the student subjects are the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Like other cities in Spain, Barcelona now faces the integration of a large number of immigrant children from [[Latin America]], Africa and Asia. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Barcelona}}
[[File:Liceu.jpg|thumb|upright|The façade of the Liceu, viewed from La Rambla]]

Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. To a greater extent than the rest of Catalonia, where Catalonia's native [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is more dominant, Barcelona is a bilingual city: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are both [[official language]]s and widely spoken. The Catalan spoken in Barcelona, [[Central Catalan]], is the one closest to standard Catalan. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|arrival of democracy]], the Catalan culture (very much repressed during the [[Spanish State|dictatorship of Franco]]) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a [[global city|world-class city]] by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title = Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network – Inventory of World Cities |accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Port of Barcelona}}
[[File:BarcelonaHarbour.jpg|thumb|[[Port of Barcelona]]]]
The [[Port of Barcelona]] has a 2000-year old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest [[containerization|container]] port, with a trade volume of 2.57 million TEU's in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/Statistics/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%2020081.pdf |title=AAPA World Port Rankings 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its {{convert|7.86|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the Old Port), the commercial port and the logistics port ([[Barcelona Free Port]]). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the [[Llobregat]] river 2&amp;nbsp;km (1¼&amp;nbsp;mi) to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apb.es/wps/portal/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hgz2DDIFNLYwMLfzcDAyNjQy9vLwNTV38LM_1wkA6zeH_nIEcnJ0NHAwNfUxegCh8XA2-nUCMDdzOIvAEO4Gig7-eRn5uqX5CdneboqKgIAAeNRE8!/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfU0lTMVI1OTMwOE9GMDAyMzFKS0owNUVPODY!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/ExtranetAnglesLib/El%20Port%20de%20Barcelona/el+port/historia+del+port/cami+cap+el+futur/ |title=Port de Barcelona |language={{es icon}} |publisher=Apb.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Port Vell]] area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the [[IMAX]] Port Vell and Europe's largest aquarium, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 6 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, due to being situated a designated tourist zone, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.

===Public transport===
{{Main|Autoritat del Transport Metropolità}}
[[File:Barcelona Tram 01.jpg|thumb|Tram in Barcelona.]]
Barcelona is served by a comprehensive local [[public transport]] network that includes a [[rapid transit|metro]], a [[bus]] network, two separate modern [[tram]] networks, a separate historic tram line, and several funiculars and [[aerial tramway|aerial cable cars]]. The [[Barcelona Metro]] network comprises nine lines, identified by an &quot;L&quot; followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. Most of the network is operated by the [[Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona]] (TMB), but three lines are FGC commuter lines that run through the city. When finished, the L9 will be the second longest underground metro line in Europe with 42.6&amp;nbsp;km; only shorter than London's 76&amp;nbsp;km Central Line.

The [[Estació del Nord]] (Northern Station), a former [[Train station|railway station]] that was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.
[[File:2007-02-05-barcelona-by-RalfR-26.jpg|thumb|left|Barcelona taxi]]
Another company, [[TRAMMET]], operates the city's two modern tram networks, known as [[Trambaix]] and [[Trambesòs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.bcn.es/V01/Serveis/Noticies/V01NoticiesLlistatNoticiesCtl/0,2138,1653_35144087_1_573780100,00.html?accio=detall&amp;home=HomeBCN&amp;nomtipusMCM=Noticia |title=News related with the council plans for the tram network union |publisher=W3.bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic tram line, the [[Tramvia Blau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmb.net/en_US/barcelona/moute/planols/planotramviablau.jsp |title=Information of Tramvia Blau |publisher=Tmb.net |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; connects the metro to the [[Funicular del Tibidabo]] (both operated by TMB). The Funicular de Tibidabo climbs the Tibidabo hill, as does the [[Funicular de Vallvidrera]] (FGC). The [[Funicular de Montjuïc]] (TMB) climbs the [[Montjuïc]] hill. The city has two [[aerial tramway|aerial cable cars]]: one to the Montjuïc castle and [[Port Vell Aerial Tramway]] that runs via [[Torre Jaume I]] and [[Torre Sant Sebastia|Torre Sant Sebastià]] over the port.

Barcelona has a [[taxicab|metered taxi]] fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of [[Self-employment|self-employed]] drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcnweb2.bcn.es:8885/taxi/infocorp/informacio.html L'Administració i la gestió del Taxi de Barcelona]&lt;/ref&gt; With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted.

On 22 March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicing.com/noticias/detalle_noticia.php?TU5fTk9USUNJQVM%3D&amp;Ng%3D%3D&amp;MQ%3D%3D |title=Noticies: Data d'inici 22 de març a les 14:00 h.

Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the 100 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicing.com/modulos/modulos.php?TU5fSU5GT1JNQUNJT04%3D&amp;NA%3D%3D&amp;Nw%3D%3D |title=Què és |publisher=Bicing |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicing.com/noticias/detalle_noticia.php?TU5fTk9USUNJQVM%3D&amp;Ng%3D%3D&amp;MzA%3D |title=Notícies: El Bicing ja té més de 50.000 abonats |publisher=Bicing |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railway===
[[File:Siemens Velaro high speed.jpg|thumb|Siemens Velaro at Barcelona-Sants AVE station.]]
Barcelona is a major hub for [[RENFE]], the Spanish state railway network, and its main [[Inter-city rail|intercity train]] station is [[Barcelona Sants railway station|Barcelona-Sants]] station. The [[AVE]] [[high-speed rail]] system – designed for speeds of 300&amp;nbsp;km/h (186&amp;nbsp;mph) – was recently{{when|date=May 2011}} extended from [[Madrid]] to Barcelona ([[Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]). Generally, Barcelona has high-speed rail links with major cities of Spain. A high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and [[France]] – [[LGV Perpignan–Figueres]] will be launched in 2012. [[Rodalies]] and the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC) run Barcelona's widespread [[commuter rail|commuter train]] service.

===Roads and highways===
Barcelona is circled by three half [[Beltway|ring roads]] or bypasses, [[B20 motorway (Spain)|Ronda de Dalt]] (on the mountain side), [[Ronda del Litoral]] (along the coast) and [[Ronda del Mig]] (separated into two parts: [[Travessera de Dalt]] in the north and the [[Gran Via de Carles III]]), two partially covered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/turisme/english/turisme/rutes/rondes_fr.htm |title=The covered Rondes (by-pass) |publisher=Bcn.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city's main arteries include [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Diagonal Avenue]], which crosses the city diagonally, [[Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona|Meridiana Avenue]] which leads to [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, Barcelona|Glòries]] and connects with Diagonal Avenue and [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, Barcelona|Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]], which crosses the city from east to west, passing through the centre of the city.

'''Bandy''', also known as '''Russian hockey''', is a team [[winter sport]] played on [[ice]], in which skaters use sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal.&lt;ref&gt;Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYyN8q44mX8&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the game have many similarities to those of [[association football]]: the game is played on a rectangle of ice the same size as a football field. Each team has 11 players, one of whom is a [[goalkeeper]]. A standard bandy match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. The [[Offside (sport)|offside]] rule is also similar to that observed in [[association football]].

==Game==

[[Image:Sollentunavallen Helenelund-AIK.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Match between [[AIK Bandy|AIK]] and Helenelund at Sollentunavallen in 2006]]
Bandy is played on ice, using a single round ball. Two teams of 11 players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal using sticks, thereby scoring a goal. Analogous to [[soccer]], a goal cannot be scored from a stroke-off, stroke-in or goal throw, and unlike soccer, a goal cannot be scored directly from a corner stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuzilogik.com/index.php/Bandy/Bandy-Glossary.html Bandy Glossary]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to soccer, however, all free strokes are “direct” and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then the game is a draw. There are exceptions to this rule, however.

The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner. Heading the ball will result in a five-minute penalty.

In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the [[referee]]. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.

The rules do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of player specialisations have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards; players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further differentiated by which side of the field the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in these positions in any combination (for example, there may be three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards), and the number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders would create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse would create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players may spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the team's ''formation'', and defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager(s).

==Rules==
===Overview===

There are eight rules in the official bandy rules. The same rules are designed to apply to all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors or women are permitted. The rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The rules can be found on the official website of the [[Federation of International Bandy]] website.&lt;ref name=&quot;official_rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Players and officials===

[[Image:Bandystick.gif|thumb|right|A bandy stick and ball]]
[[Image:Bandybollar.jpg|thumb|right|The making of a historic bandy ball, from the original cork to the left to the final ball painted red. To the far right is a modern bandy ball]]
Each team consists of a maximum of 11 players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. A team of fewer than eight players may not start a game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, but they are only allowed to do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the rules of the game.

Any number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, if the substitute enters the ice before his teammate has left it, this will result in a 5 minute ban. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game and one of these is likely to be an extra goalkeeper.

A game is officiated by a referee, the authority to enforce the rules, and whose decisions are final. The referee may be assisted by one or two assistant referees.

===Equipment===

The basic equipment players are required to wear includes a pair of [[Ice skate|skates]], a [[helmet]], a mouth guard and, in the case of the goalkeeper, a face guard. The teams must wear uniforms that make it easy to distinguish the two teams. The [[Ice skate|skates]], sticks and any tape on the stick must be of another colour than the ball.
In addition to the aforementioned equipment, various protections are used to protect knees, elbows, genitals and throat. The pants and gloves may contain padding.

===Field===

[[Image:Bandy pitch metric.svg|510px|thumb|center|Standard field measurements]]
The size of a bandy field is in the range 4,050 - 7,150 square metres (45-65 by 90–110 metres), about the same size as a [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] and considerably larger than an [[ice hockey]] rink. Along the sidelines a {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} high border (vant, sarg, wand, wall) is placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, to glide upon collisions, and should end 1–3 metres away from the corners.

Centered at each shortline is a 3.5 m wide and 2.1 m high goal cage and in front of the cage is a half-circular penalty area with a 17 m radius. A penalty spot is located 12 metres in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a 5 m circle.

A centre spot denotes the center of the field and a circle of radius 5 m is centered at it. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot and parallel with the shortlines.

At each of the corners, a 1 m radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and five metres away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a half-metre long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, five metres from the shortline.

===Duration and tie-breaking measures===

A standard adult bandy match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play; the referee can, however, make allowance for time lost through significant stoppages as described below. There is usually a 15-minute &quot;half-time&quot; break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.

The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', and must be reported to the match secretary and the two captains. The referee alone signals the end of the match.

In league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be replayed. As an alternative, the extra two times 15-minutes may be played as &quot;Golden goal&quot; which means that the first team that scores during the extra-time wins the game. If both extra periods are played without a scored goal, a penalty shootout will settle the game. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.

===Ball in and out of play===

Under the rules, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each playing period with a stroke-off (a set strike from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight &lt;!-- only six methods are listed; is number or listing incorrect? --&gt; restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

[[Image:Bandy corner.jpg|thumb|[[Allsvenskan and Elitserien (bandy)|Elitserien]] 2007 in [[Sweden]]. A corner is about to be executed during the game [[Västerås SK Bandy|Västerås SK]]-[[Edsbyns IF]].]]

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Method
!Description
|-
|Stroke-off
|Following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.
|-
|Goal-throw
|When the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a member of the attacking team; awarded to the defending team.
|-
|Corner stroke
|When the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a member of the defending team; awarded to attacking team. The defending team must locate themselves behind goal line and the attacking team must be situated outside the penalty area with everyone but the executor no closer to the shortline than 5 m. As soon as the corner is shot, the attackers may enter the penalty area and the defenders may rush to try to stop the ball.
|-
|Free-stroke
|Awarded to fouled team following certain listed offences, or to the opposing team upon a team causing the ball to leave the field over the side-line.
|-
|Penalty shot
|Awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a free-shot but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.
|-
|Face-off
|Occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason (for example,, a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective). This restart is uncommon in adult games.
|}

If the time runs out while a team is preparing for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, but it must be executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put the ball in play.

===Free-strokes and penalty shots===

Free-strokes can be awarded to a team if a player of the opposite team offends any rule, for example, by hitting with the stick against the opponent's stick or skates. Free-strokes can also be awarded upon incorrect execution of corner-strikes, free-strikes, goal-throws, and so on. or the use of incorrect equipment, such as a broken stick.

Rather than stopping play, the [[referee]] may allow play to continue when its continuation will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as &quot;playing an advantage&quot;. The referee may &quot;call back&quot; play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised because the referee plays an advantage, the offender may still be sanctioned (see below) for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.

If a defender violently attacks an opponent within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain other offences, when carried out within the penalty area, result in a penalty shot provided there is a goal situation. These offences include a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on. Also, the defenders (with the exception of the goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lay on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent's stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head above the shoulders. If any of these actions is carried out in a non-goal situation, they shall be awarded with a free-stroke from one of the free-stroke spots at the penalty area line. A penalty shot should always be accompanied by a 5 or 10 minutes penalty (see below). If the penalty results in a goal, the penalty should be considered personal meaning that a substitute can be sent in for the penalised player. This does not apply in the event of a red card (see below).

===Warnings and penalties===

{{double image|left|Blue card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Blue: 10 minutes penalty, red: match penalty.}}

A ten minutes penalty is indicated through the use of a blue card and can be caused by protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.

The third time a player receives a penalty, it will be a personal penalty meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after five or ten minutes. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted for the remainder of the game. A match penalty is indicated through the use of a red card.

===Offside===

The offside rule effectively limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line. This rule is in effect just like [[Offside (football)|that of football]].

==International==

[[Image:BandyCountries.svg|thumb|270px|World map showing the 27 members of the [[Federation of International Bandy]]]]

===World Championships===
The [[Bandy World Championships]] for men were first held in 1957 and then every two years starting in 1961, and every year since 2003. Currently there are 13 (WCS 2008) countries participating in the world championships. The participating countries vary from year to year. Finland won the 2004 world championship in [[Västerås]]. All other championships have been won by the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]], or [[Sweden]].

In February 2004, Sweden won the first World Championship for women, hosted in Finland. The second women's World Championships were held in [[Roseville, Minnesota]] at the [[Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval]] in the USA in 2006 and once again Sweden won, defeating Russia in the final (3-1).

===World Cup===

The World Championships should not be confused with the annual [[Bandy World Cup|World Cup]] in [[Ljusdal Municipality|Ljusdal]], Sweden, which is the biggest bandy tournament for club teams on elite level. With matches played day and night, the tournament is played in four days in late October. The winner in 2008 was [[Edsbyns IF]], the dominant team in Swedish bandy who had won five straight Swedish championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=672&amp;a=844771|title=Isen smälte - då vann Edsbyn hemma|last=Fransson|first=Martin|date=2008-10-26|work=Dagens Nyheter|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, that run of success came to an end in 2009 when [[Västerås SK Bandy]] won their 18th Swedish championship title.

===Champions Cup===

Another club tournament is the [[FIB Champions Cup|Champions Cup]]. It is a [[Season (sports)|pre-season]] tournament held in [[Edsbyn]], [[Sweden]] and features clubs from [[Russian Bandy League|Russia]] and [[Elitserien (bandy)|Sweden]].

===International federation===

The [[Federation of International Bandy]] (FIB), has 27 members (2010). Formed in 1955, the name was changed from ''International Bandy Federation'' in 2001 after the [[International Olympic Committee]] approved it as a &quot;recognized sport&quot;. &quot;IBF&quot; was already occupied. In 2004, FIB was fully accepted by IOC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbandy.com/viewNavMenu.do?menuID=4 |title=Federation of International Bandy-Olympic |publisher=Internationalbandy.com |date=2004-08-12 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Olympic rings.svg|thumb|150px|[[Federation of International Bandy|FIB]], fully accepted by [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]]]

===Olympic Games===

Although bandy was the [[demonstration sport]] at the [[VI Olympic Winter Games]] in 1952 ([[Oslo]], Norway), and is IOC accepted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalbandy.com/viewNavMenu.do?menuID=4 |title=Federation of International Bandy-Olympic |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has not become an official [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]]. Only three teams played [[bandy at the 1952 Winter Olympics]]: Finland, Norway and Sweden. The [[IOC]] President [[Jacques Rogge]] is impressed by the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandyvideo.net/razor/bandy/img_5440.htm |title=Illustraded History Bandy |publisher=Bandyvideo.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Skating Union]] in 2007 got the right to within 3 years add another discipline to the Olympic programme in 2014, and that discipline might be bandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://infox.ru/sport/hockey/2010/06/04/FHR_nye_pomozhyet_by.phtml&amp;ei=lORvTOvQNIrJ4gbF87DfCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://infox.ru/sport/hockey/2010/06/04/FHR_nye_pomozhyet_by.phtml%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISU and FIB already have an agreement to share the same arenas.

===Asian Winter Games===

At the 2011 [[Bandy at the 2011 Asian Winter Games|Asian Winter Games]], open to members of the [[Olympic Council of Asia]], bandy for men was included for the first time.

==History==

Games that are accepted as direct predecessors to bandy have been recorded in Russian monastery records dating back to the 10th to 11th centuries. A game that could be recognized as essentially modern bandy was played in Russia by the early 1700s, although the rules used differed from those that were invented in England at a much later date. All the way through modern times, Russia has kept a top position in the Bandy area, being one of the founding nations of the International Federation, as well as the most successful team in the World Championships. Russians see themselves as the creators of the sport, which is reflected by the unofficial title for bandy, &quot;Russian hockey,&quot; or &quot;русский хоккей.&quot;

In the western world, Britain has played an important role in the development of bandy. A game similar to bandy was known in [[Wales]] as [[Bando (sport)|Bando]]. It was played throughout the country in varying forms and is still to be found in some areas. The earliest example of the [[Welsh language]] term ''bando'' occurs in a dictionary by John Walters published in 1770–94. It was particularly popular in the [[Cynffig]]-[[Margam]] district of the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] where wide stretches of sandy beaches afforded ample room for play. As a winter sport, British bandy originated in [[the Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] where large expanses of ice formed on flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters, and skating was a tradition. Members of the [[Fen skating#Bandy|Bury Fen Bandy Club]] published rules of the game in 1882, and introduced it into other countries. The first international match was played between Bury Fen and [[Haarlem]] from the Netherlands.

Bandy is now played in a few nations, including [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Australia]], [[Belarus]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[England]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mongolia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ukraine]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bandy_federation_members&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Countries==
===Britain===

The first recorded games of bandy on ice took place in [[The Fens]] during the great frost of 1813-1814, although it is probable that the game had been played there in the previous century. [[Fen skating#Bandy|Bury Fen Bandy Club]] from [[Bluntisham|Bluntisham-cum-Earith]], near [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]], was the most successful team, remaining unbeaten until the winter of 1890-1891. Charles G Tebbutt of the Bury Fen bandy club was responsible for the first published rules of bandy in 1882, and also for introducing the game into the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as elsewhere in England where it became popular with cricket, rowing and hockey clubs. Tebbutt's home-made bandy stick can be seen in the Norris Museum in St Ives.

England won the [[European Bandy Championships]] in 1913, but that turned out to be the grand finale, and bandy is now virtually unknown in England. In March 2004, Norwegian ex-player Edgar Malman invited two big clubs to play a rink bandy exhibition game in Streatham, London. Russian
Champions and World Cup Winner [[Vodnik]] met Swedish Champions [[Edsbyns IF]] in a match that ended 10-10. In 2010 England became a [[Federation of International Bandy]] member.

===Russia===

In Russia bandy is known as hockey with a ball or simply Russian hockey. The game became popular among nobility in early 1700s, with the royal court of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I the Great]] playing bandy on [[Saint Petersburg]]'s frozen [[Neva]] river. Russians played bandy with sticks made out of juniper wood, later adopting skates. By the second half of the 19th century the game also became popular among the masses throughout the [[Russian Empire]]. Traditionally the Russians used a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they would find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than a hockey skate, and the &quot;Russian skate&quot; even longer.

When the Federation of International Bandy was formed in 1955, with the Soviet Union as one of its founding members, the Russians adopted the international rules of the game developed in England in the 19th century.

===Sweden===

Bandy was introduced to Sweden in 1895. The Swedish royal family, barons and diplomats were the first players. Swedish championships for men have been played annually since 1907. In the 1920s students played the game and it became a largely middle class sport. After [[Slottsbrons IF]] won the Swedish championship in 1934 it became popular amongst workers in the smaller industrial towns and villages. Bandy remains the main winter sport in many of these places.

Bandy in Sweden is famous for its &quot;culture&quot; - both playing bandy and being a spectator requires great fortitude and dedication. A &quot;bandy briefcase&quot; is the classic accessory for spectating - it is typically made of brown leather, well worn and contain a warm drink in a thermos and/or a bottle of liquor.&lt;ref name=&quot;briefcase&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Bandy is most often played at outdoor arenas during winter time, so the need for spectators to carry flask or thermoses of 'warming' liquid is a natural effect.

A notable tradition is &quot;Annandagsbandy&quot;, bandy on the day after [[Christmas Day]], which formerly marked the start of the bandy season and always draw bigger crowds than usual. Matches traditionally begin at 1.15 PM.&lt;ref name=&quot;annandagsbandy&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The play-off match for the Swedish Championship is played every year on the third Sunday of March at Studenternas Idrottsplats in [[Uppsala]], drawing crowds in excess of 20,000.

Sweden is the current world champion in 2010.

===Finland===

Bandy was introduced to Finland from Russia in the 1890s. The first Finnish national championships were held in 1908. The top national league is called [[Bandyliiga]].

===Norway===

Bandy was introduced to Norway in the 1910s. The Swedes contributed largely, and clubs sprang up around the capital of Oslo. In 1912 the Norwegians played their first National Championship, which was played annually up to 1940. During WWII, illegal bandy was played in hidden places in forests, on ponds and lakes. In 1943, -44 and -45, illegal championships were held. In 1946 legal play resumed and goes on still.

After WWII the number of teams rose, but mild winters in the 1970s and 80s shrunk the league, and in 2003 only 5 clubs (teams) fought out the 1st division. Later, the number of artificially frozen pitches has risen, and the number of clubs has started a slight increase.

From 1912 to 1928 the game was played 7-a-side and [[IF Ready|Ready]] ([[Oslo]]) won 13 titles. Since 1928 the sport has been played 11-a-side, and [[Drafn]] ([[Drammen]]) have won 19 titles (including one from the 7-man game).

During the 1960s crowd attendance could be anything from 200 to 4000, but these days only a handful visitors cheer their side. Big games though, can still attract 2000 people.

==Names==

Old names for bandy are '''hockey on the ice''' or '''hockey on ice'''. Since the mid-20th century the term bandy is usually preferred to prevent confusion with [[ice hockey]]. The sport is known by this name in many countries though there are a few notable exceptions. In Russian bandy is called &quot;Russian hockey&quot; (русский хоккей) or more frequently &quot;hockey with a ball&quot; (xоккей с мячом) while ice hockey is called &quot;hockey with a puck&quot; (xоккей с шайбой) or more frequently just &quot;hockey&quot;. In Belarussian and Ukrainian it is also called &quot;hockey with a ball&quot; (хакей з мячам and хокей з м'ячем, respectively). In Kazakh bandy is known as &quot;ball hockey&quot; (допты хоккей). In Finnish the two sports are distinguished as &quot;ice ball&quot; (jääpallo) and &quot;ice puck&quot; (jääkiekko). In Estonian and Hungarian, bandy is also called &quot;ice ball&quot; (jääpall and jéglabda, respectively), although in Hungarian it is more often called &quot;bandy&quot; nowadays.

The '''Man Booker Prize for Fiction''' is a [[literary award|literary prize]] awarded each year for the best original full-length novel, written in the English language, by a citizen of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], Ireland, or [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/about/rules-and-entry Booker Prize: rules] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured of international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2008/10/booker-prize-british-literary'' The Booker's Big Bang'', New Statesman, 9 October 2008] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a mark of distinction for authors to be nominated for the Man Booker longlist or selected for inclusion in the [[Short list|shortlist]].

==History and administration==
The prize was originally known as the '''Booker-McConnell Prize,''' after the company [[Booker-McConnell]] began sponsoring the event in 1968; it became commonly known as the &quot;Booker Prize&quot; or simply &quot;the Booker.&quot; When administration of the prize was transferred to the Booker Prize Foundation in 2002, the title sponsor became the investment company [[Man Group]], which opted to retain &quot;Booker&quot; as part of the official title of the prize. The foundation is an independent registered charity funded by the entire profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd., of which  it  is the sole shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themanbookerprize.com/legal Booker Prize: legal information] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The prize money awarded with the Booker Prize was originally £21,000, and was subsequently raised to £50,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group.

The rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been awarded retrospectively to books published prior to the year in which the award was given. In 1971 the year of eligibility was changed to the same as the year of the award; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year. The Booker Prize Foundation announced in January 2010 the creation of a special award called the &quot;[[Lost Man Booker Prize]],&quot; with the winner chosen from a longlist of 22 novels published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1317 The Lost Man Booker Prize announced] Retrieved 31 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

2001 was the first year in which the longlist was revealed to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Emma. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/aug/15/bookerprize2001.thebookerprize Booker Prize longlist announced for first time]. ''The Guardian''. 15 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging==
The selection process for the winner of the prize commences with the formation of an advisory committee which includes an author, two publishers, a literary agent, a bookseller, a librarian, and a chairperson appointed by the Booker Prize Foundation. The advisory committee then selects the judging panel, the membership of which changes each year, although on rare occasions a judge may be selected a second time. Judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and notable public figures.

The winner is usually announced at a ceremony in London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], usually in early October.

==Winners==
{{see also|List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize for Fiction}}
In 1993, the ''Booker of Bookers Prize'' was awarded to [[Salman Rushdie]] for ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (the 1981 winner), as the best novel to win the award in the first 25 years of its existence. A similar prize known as [[The Best of the Booker]] was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the prize – this was also won by ''Midnight's Children''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2258500,00.html ''Best of the Booker'', The Guardian, 21 February 2008] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499495.stm ''Rushdie wins Best of Booker prize'', BBC News, 10 July 2008] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} In 1971, the nature of the Prize was changed so that it was awarded to novels published in that year instead of in the previous year; therefore, no novel published in 1970 could win the Booker Prize. This was rectified in 2010 by the awarding of the &quot;[[Lost Man Booker Prize]]&quot; to J. G. Farrell's ''Troubles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvern |first=Jack|title=J G Farrell wins Booker prize for 1970, 30 year after his death|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article7131357.ece|accessdate=23 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=May 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts and statistics==
*Each publisher's imprint may submit two titles. In addition, previous winners of the prize and those who have been shortlisted in the previous five years are automatically considered. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.{{fact}}--&gt;

==Related awards==
A separate prize for which any living author in the world may qualify, the [[Man Booker International Prize]], was inaugurated in 2005 and is awarded biennially. A Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the [[Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize]], also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group Plc and the Hong Kong Literary Festival Ltd established the [[Man Asian Literary Prize]], an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.

==Cheltenham Booker Prize==
As part of [[The Times]]'s Literature Festival in [[Cheltenham]], a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker, authors from outside the Commonwealth are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was [[Alan Paton]]'s ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'', beating [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'', [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' and [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[The Loved One]]''.

The '''Book of Joel''' is part of the [[Hebrew Bible]].  Joel is part of a group of twelve prophetic books known as the Minor Prophets or simply as The Twelve; the distinction 'minor' indicates the short length of the text in relation to the larger prophetic texts known as the &quot;Major Prophets&quot;.

==Content==
After a superscription ascribing the prophecy to [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]] (son of Pethuel), the book may be broken down into the following sections:
* Lament over a great [[locust]] plague and a severe drought (1:1–2:17)
** The effects of these events on agriculture, farmers, and on the supply of agricultural offerings for the [[Jerusalem temple]], interspersed with a call to national lament. (1:1–20)
** A more [[apocalyptic]] passage comparing the locusts to an army, and revealing that they are God’s army. (2:1–11)
** A call to national repentance in the face of God’s judgment. (2:12–17)
* Promise of future blessings (2:18–32)
** Banishment of the locusts and restoration of agricultural productivity as a divine response to national penitence. (2:18–27)
** Future prophetic gifts to all God’s people, and the safety of God’s people in the face of cosmic cataclysm. (2:28–32)
* Coming judgment on God’s ([[Israel|Israel’s]]) enemies and the vindication of Israel. (3:1–21)


==Historical context==
[[Image:Joel (Michelangelo).jpg|right|thumb|The Prophet Joel as imagined by [[Michelangelo]] ([[Fresco]], [[Sistine Chapel]] Ceiling, 1508–1512)]]
As there are no explicit references in the book to datable persons or events, scholars have assigned a wide range of dates to the book. The main positions are:&lt;ref&gt;Outlined by Allen (pp. 19-25), who himself favours the third position.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ninth century BC, particularly in the reign of [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] - a position especially popular among nineteenth-century scholars (making Joel one of the earliest [[Literary prophets|writing prophets]])
* c.630–587 BC, in the last decades of the kingdom of Judah (contemporary with [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Habakkuk]])
* c.520–500 BC, contemporary with the return of the exiles and the careers of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and [[Haggai]].
* The decades around 400 BC, during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period (making him one of the latest writing prophets)

Evidence produced for these positions are allusions in the book to the wider world, similarities with other prophets, and linguistic details. Other commentators, such as [[John Calvin]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Allen, p.19, although Calvin did lean toward a later dating&lt;/ref&gt; attach no great importance to the predating aids.

==History of interpretation==
The preservation of the book of Joel indicates that it was accorded special status by its contemporaries as “the word of the Lord” (1:1). Its history as part of the Jewish and Christian canons followed that of the entire scroll of the [[Minor Prophets]].

The [[Masoretic text]] places Joel between [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (the order inherited by the Tanakh and Old Testament), while the [[Septuagint]] order is Hosea–Amos–[[Book of Micah|Micah]]–Joel–[[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]]–[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]]. The Hebrew text of Joel seems to have suffered little from [[Textual criticism|scribal transmission]], but is at a few points supplemented by the Septuagint, [[Peshitta|Syriac]], and [[Vulgate]] versions, or by [[conjectural emendation]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen 36&lt;/ref&gt;
While the book purports to describe a plague of locusts, some ancient Jewish opinion saw the locusts as [[allegory|allegorical]] interpretations of Israel's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Targum]] at 2:25; also margin of [[Septuagint|LXX]] manuscript Q, mid-6th century AD&lt;/ref&gt; This allegorical interpretation was applied to the church by many [[church fathers]]. Calvin took a literal interpretation of ch.1, but allegorical view of chapter 2, a position echoed by some modern interpreters. Most modern interpreters, however, see Joel speaking of a literal locust plague given a prophetic/ [[apocalyptic]] interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;See Allen 29-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional ascription of the whole book to the prophet Joel was challenged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by a theory of a three stage process of composition: 1:1–2:27 were from the hand of Joel, and dealt with a contemporary issue; 2:28–3:21 were ascribed to a continuator with an apocalyptic outlook. Mentions in the first half of the book to the [[day of the Lord]] were also ascribed to this continuator. 3:4–8 could be seen as even later. Details of exact ascriptions differed between scholars.

This splitting of the book’s composition began to be challenged in the mid-twentieth century, with scholars defending the unity of the book, the plausibility of the prophet combining a contemporary and apocalyptic outlook, and later additions by the prophet.  The authenticity of 3:4–8 has presented more challenges, although a number of scholars still defend it.&lt;ref&gt;See Allen 25–29 for details and arguments.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical quotes and allusions==
There are many parallels of language between Joel and other Old Testament prophets. They may represent Joel’s literary use of other prophets, or vice versa.

In the [[New Testament]], his prophecy of the outpouring of God′s [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Holy Spirit]] upon all people was notably quoted by the [[apostle Peter]] in his [[Pentecost]] sermon ({{bibleref|Acts|2|NIV}}).

The table below represents some of the more explicit quotes and allusions between specific passages in Joel and passages from the Old and New Testaments.

The '''Book of Hosea''' is one of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. It stands first in order among what are known as the twelve [[Minor Prophets]].

==Background and Content==
[[Hosea]] ({{lang|he|הושֵעַ}}) prophesied during a dark and melancholic era of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]]'s history, the period of the Northern Kingdom's decline and fall in the [[8th century BC]]. The [[apostasy]] of the people was rampant, having turned away from God in order to serve the calves of [[Jeroboam II]], {{Bibleref|Hosea|8:4-6|JPS}} and [[Baal]], a [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] god.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cook, Stephen L. 1989&quot;&gt;Cook, Stephen L., Harper Collins Study Bible; New Revised Standard Version ''With the Apocryphal?Deuterocanonical Books Student Edition'' (San Francisco: Harper Collins Publishers, Meeks, Wayne A. ed.,  (1989), pg. 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Books of the Old Testament}}
During Hosea's lifetime, the kings of the Northern Kingdom, their aristocratic supporters, and the priests had led the people away from the Law of God, as given in the [[Pentateuch]].  Forsaking the worship of God, they worshiped other gods, especially Baal, the Canaanite fertility god.  Other sins followed, including homicide, perjury, theft, and sexual sin {{Bibleref|Hosea|4:1-2|JPS}}.  Hosea declares that unless they repent of these sins, God will allow their nation to be destroyed, and the people will be taken into captivity by Assyria {{Bibleref|Hosea|9:3|JPS}}, the greatest nation of the time.

The prophecy of Hosea centers around God's unending love towards a sinful Israel. In this text, God's agony is expressed over the betrayal of Israel {{Bibleref|Hosea|3:1|JPS}},{{Bibleref|Hosea|11:1|JPS}},{{Bibleref|Hosea|14:4|JPS}}. Stephen Cook asserts that the prophetic efforts of this book can be summed up in this passage &quot;I have been the Lord your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior&quot; {{Bibleref|Hosea|13:4|JPS}} Hosea's job was to speak these words during a time when that had been essentially forgotten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cook, Stephen L. 1989&quot;/&gt;

==Summary==

First, Hosea was directed by God to marry a promiscuous woman of ill-repute, and he did so.  Marriage here is symbolic of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.  However, Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments which are the terms of the covenant, hence Israel is symbolized by a harlot who violates the obligations of marriage to her husband.

Second, Hosea and his wife, [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]], have a son.  God commands that the son be named Jezreel.  This name refers to a [[Jezreel Valley|valley]] in which much blood had been shed in Israel's history, especially by the kings of the Northern Kingdom. (See I Kings 21 and II Kings 9:21-35).  The naming of this son was to stand as a prophecy against the reigning house of the Northern Kingdom, that they would pay for that bloodshed. Jezreel's name means God Sows.

Third, the couple have a daughter.  God commands that she be named [[Lo-ruhamah]]; Unloved, or, Pity or Pitied On to show Israel that, although God will still have pity on the [[Kingdom of Judah|Southern Kingdom]], God will no longer have pity on the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Kingdom]]; its destruction is imminent.  In the NIV translation, the omitting of the word 'him' leads to speculation as to whether Lo-Ruhamah was the daughter of Hosea or one of Gomer's lovers. James Mays, however, says that the failure to mention Hosea's paternity this is &quot;hardly an implication&quot; of Gomer's adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mays|first=James L|title=Hosea|year=1969|publisher=SCM|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth, a son is born to Gomer.  It is questionable whether this child was Hosea's, for God commands that his name be [[Lo-ammi]]; Not My People, or more simply, Not Mine.  The child bore this name of shame to show that the Northern Kingdom would also be shamed, for its people would no longer be known as God's People. Also God says that &quot;I am not your [[I Am that I Am|I am]]&quot;; in other words, God changes His own name in connection with his current relationship with Israel.

===Outline===
A brief outline of the concepts presented in the Book of Hosea exist below
* Chapters 1-2; Account of Hosea's marriage with  [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]] biographically which is a metaphor for the relationship with Yahweh and Israel.
* Chapter 3; Account of Hosea's marriage autobiographically.  This is possibly a marriage to different women
* Chapters 4-14:9; Oracle judging Israel, Ephraim in particular, for not living up to the [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]].
No further breakdown of ideas is clear in 4-14:9&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament. Oxford University Press, 2009. pg 262-263&lt;/ref&gt;
Following this, the prophecy is made that someday this will all be changed, that God will indeed have pity on Israel.

Chapter two describes a divorce.  This divorce seems to be the end of the covenant between God and the Northern Kingdom.  However, it is probable that this was again a symbolic act, in which Hosea divorced Gomer for infidelity, and used the occasion to preach the message of God's rejection of the Northern Kingdom.  He ends this prophecy with the declaration that God will one day renew the covenant, and will take Israel back in love.

In Chapter three, at God's command, Hosea seeks out [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]] once more.  Either she has sold herself into slavery for debt, or she is with a lover who demands money in order to give her up, because Hosea has to buy her back.  He takes her home, but refrains from sexual intimacy with her for many days, to symbolize the fact that Israel will be without a king for many years, but that God will take Israel back, even at a cost to Himself.

Chapters 4-14 spell out the allegory at length. Chapters 1-3 speaks of Hosea's family, and the issues with Gomer. Chapters 4-1650 contain a series of oracles, or prophetic sermons, showing exactly why God is rejecting the Northern Kingdom (what the grounds are for the divorce).  Chapter 11 is God's lament over the necessity of giving up the Northern Kingdom, which is a large part of the people of Israel, whom God loves.  God promises not to give them up entirely. Then, in Chapter 12, the prophet pleads for Israel's repentance.  Chapter 13 foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of [[Assyria]], because there has been no repentance.  In Chapter 14, the prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging the utmost fidelity to God.

Matthew 2:13 cites Hosea's prophecy in {{Bibleverse||Hosea|11:1|HE}} that God would call His Son out of [[Egypt]] as foretelling the [[flight into Egypt]] and return to Israel of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], and the infant [[Jesus Christ]].

The capital of the Northern Kingdom, in 722 BC.  All the members of the upper classes and many of the ordinary people were taken captive and carried off to live as prisoners of war.

==Interpretation and Context: Hosea 2 Marriage Metaphor==

While most modern scholars suggest the marriage metaphor presented in Hosea describes the relationship between Israel and Yahweh, the metaphor itself remains controversial in its meaning and interpretation in modernity. This is particularly true among feminist Biblical scholarship. In Hosea 2, the woman in the marriage metaphor is Hosea’s wife  [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]]. Gomer is not portrayed in a positive light, and since Gomer represents the role of the wife in a marriage covenant, women themselves are not portrayed in a positive light. This is reflected throughout the beginning of Hosea 2. “I will strip her naked and expose her as in the day she was born” (Hosea 2:3). “Upon her children I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom” (Hosea 2:4). “For she said, I will go after my lovers...” (Hosea 2:5).

Biblical scholar Ehud Ben Zvi reminds readers of the socio-historical context in which Hosea was composed. In his article Observations on the marital metaphor of YHWH and Israel in its ancient Israelite context: general considerations and particular images in Hosea 1.2, Ben Zvi describes the role of the Gomer in the marriage metaphor as one of the “central attributes of the ideological image of a human marriage that was shared by the male authorship and the primary and intended male readership as building blocks for their imagining of the relationship.” &lt;ref&gt;Ben Zvi, Ehud. 2004. &quot;Observations on the marital metaphor of YHWH and Israel in its ancient Israelite context: general considerations and particular images in Hosea 1.2.&quot; Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 28, no. 3: 363-384.&lt;/ref&gt; This is important to consider when reading and interpreting the text in that the author was writing in a particular time during which the role of women in marriage was to be submissive and respect the authority of their husbands.

Feminist Biblical scholar Tristanne J. Connolly makes a similar observation, stating that the husband-wife motif reflects marriage as it was understood at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Tristanne J. 1998. &quot;Metaphor and Abuse in Hosea.&quot; Feminist Theology no. 18: 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Connolly also suggests that in context the marriage metaphor was necessary in that it truly exemplified the unequal interaction between Yahweh and the people Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Tristanne J. 1998. &quot;Metaphor and Abuse in Hosea.&quot; Feminist Theology no. 18: 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan makes an interesting point regarding genre that can also lend a hand to the interpretation of this metaphor. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. Hosea falls under a unique genre called “covenant lawsuit” where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God’s disappointment towards Israel is therefore expressed through the broken marriage covenant made between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution==
Hosea is believed to be the first prophet to use marriage as a metaphor of the covenant between God and Israel, and he influenced latter prophets such as Jeremiah. He is among the first writing prophets, and the last chapter of Hosea has a format similar to [[wisdom literature]].

==Feminist perspective==
According to Kirsten Abbott, feminist interpretation regards the story of Hosea and his relations with his wife Gomer as a metaphor for the conflict between a [[Covenant Theology]] (Israel violating the covenant relationship with YHWH) and a Creation Theology (YHWH will undo the fertility of the earth in response to Israel following other fertility gods).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsrt.net.au/seachanges/volume5/html/abbott.html Kirsten Abbott &quot;Creation Motifs in Hosea&quot;, Sea Changes Journal, December 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The relationship between husband and wife was one of unequal power, in which the husband initiated both marriage and divorce&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009. pg 264&quot;&gt;Coogan, Michael. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament. Oxford University Press, 2009. pg 264&lt;/ref&gt; As always, the historical context of the writer is key to understanding this book of the Bible.  For the writer of the Book of Hosea, this idea of marriage is not far from the truth, but it is a &quot;male perspective&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009. pg 264&quot;/&gt; that is being endorsed here.

{{Tanakh OT}}
:''For the attributed author of the '''Book of Obadiah''', see [[Obadiah]].''

The canonical Book of Obadiah is an ''oracle'' concerning the divine judgment of [[Edom]] and the restoration of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M.“A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press, New York (2009) p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson's Compact Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1978, p. 191, ISBN 0840756364&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], its authorship is attributed to a [[prophet]] who lived in the ''[[Assyria]]n Period'', [[Obadiah]], whose name means “''servant'' or ''worshipper'' of Yahweh”. 

In Christianity, the book of Obadiah is classified as a [[minor prophet]] of the [[Old Testament]], due to its short length. 

In Judaism, Obadiah is considered a “later prophet” and this [[Masoretic Text]] is chronologically placed in the [[Tanakh]] under the section [[Nevi'im]] in the last category called ''The Twelve Prophets''.

== Content ==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
The book of Obadiah is based on a prophetic vision concerning the fall of [[Edom]],{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:1,4,18|NKJ|v.1,4,18}} a mountain dwelling nation{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:8,9,19,21|NKJV|v.8,9,19,21}} whose ''Founding Father'' was [[Esau]].{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:6|NKJ|v.6}}
Obadiah describes an encounter with [[Yahweh|God]] who addresses Edom’s arrogance and charges them for their violent actions against their brother nation, the House of [[Jacob]].{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:10|NKJ|v.10}}
 
The vision then embraces the fall of [[Jerusalem]] to the hands of foreign invaders and God’s anger against Edom for taking advantage of the [[Jew]]s of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] during their plight, thus sealing their doom.{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:10-14|NKJ|v.10-14}}

In the final aspect of the vision, [[Israel]]’s restoration, as a holy place, is declared in contrast to the Edomite lineage that shall end. Obadiah’s prophecy also includes a reminder that God’s judgment will be upon all nations. “For the day of the Lord upon all the nations is near… But on [[Mount Zion]] there shall be deliverance” {{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:15,17|NKJV|NKJ v.15, 17}}

==Scholarly Issues==
===Dating Obadiah===
The date of composition is disputed among scholars and is difficult to determine due to the lack of personal information about Obadiah, his family, and his historical milieux. The date of composition must therefore be determined based on the prophecy itself. [[Edom]] is to be destroyed due to its lack of defense for its brother nation, Israel, when it was under attack. There are two major historical contexts within which the Edomites could have committed such an act. These are during 853 – 841 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was invaded by Philistines and Arabs during the reign of Jehoram (recorded in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 8:20-22 and [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 21:8-20 in the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]]) and 605 – 586 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was attacked by [[Nebuchadrezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzer]] of [[Babylon]], which led to the Babylonian exile of [[Israel]] (recorded in [[Psalm]] 137). The earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Elisha]], and the latter would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], both of whom were prophets in the respective time periods. The later period appears to be the scholarly consensus as Obadiah 1-9 parallels [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 49:7-22. The passage in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BC), and therefore Obadiah 11-14 seems to refer to the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzer]] (586 BC). It is more likely that Obadiah and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us than [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source. There is also much material found in Obadiah 10-21 which [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably. Despite everything, however, there are a number of scholars who support both dates and even some who support dates other than the two major possibilities presented. Therefore, any date for the composition of Obadiah must be held tentatively.

===Contrast to Amos===
In verse eighteen, it says that once judgment has been carried out, “There will be no survivors from the house of Esau” (NIV). So, according to Obadiah there will not remain even a remnant after [[Edom]]’s judgment; This is in contrast to [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 9:12, where Amos refers to such a remnant, however, it is stated that their possession will be given to [[Israel]]. Some scholars have suggested that [[Book of Amos|Amos]]’s reference to [[Edom]] is symbolic of all nations who were once enemies of [[Israel]] and not meant to literally mean Edomites in the flesh. This is certainly the perspective of [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] as he recites the passage from [[Book of Amos|Amos]] in [[Book of Acts|Acts]] 15:17. [[Edom]] is symbolic of the remnant of men and Gentiles who will eventually bear God’s name. Moreover, Frederick A. Tatford in ''Prophet of [[Edom]]’s Doom'' says that Obadiah’s prophecy is fulfilled today as there is currently no trace of anyone who may be identified as an Edomite.

===Sepharad===
''See main article: [[Sepharad]]''

The identity of the land of '''Sepharad''', mentioned only here in this verse in the bible, {{Bibleref2|Obadiah|1:20|NIV|Obadiah 1:20}}, is currently unknown. It is also unknown whether or not Sepharad is a city, district or territory. The only clues for its possible existence are [[Persia]]n inscriptions that refer to two places called &quot;[[Saparda]]&quot;: one area in [[Medes|Media]] and another in [[Asia Minor]], debated to be [[Sardis]].

===Zarepath===
The land of '''Zarephath''', also mentioned in verse twenty, is speculated to be [[Sarepta]]. It is interesting to note that in Rabbinical and modern Hebrew, the name Zarepath is used to refer to [[France]]. There is some debate over the application of this name to a European land, because of Rabbinic literature identifying Edom with the [[Roman Empire]]. However, there is no historical evidence to even suggest the existence of any Jewish colonies or captives, in that European region, during the Assyrian Period of Obadiah's day.

==Scriptural Parallels==
The exact expression &quot;the Day of the Lord”, from Obadiah 1:15, has been used by other authors throughout the ''Old'' and ''New Testaments'', as follows:

'''[[Old Testament]]:'''
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 2, 13, 34, 58, [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 46:10, [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:22, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 13:5, [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 1, 2, 3, [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 5:18, 20, [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 1, 2, [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 14:1, [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] 4:5

'''[[New Testament]]:'''
* 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 2 Peter 3:10, Acts 2:20, 1 Corinthians 5:5, 2 Corinthians 1:14

For other parallels, compare Obadiah 1:1-8 with [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 49:7-16.

==Christian View==
The overwhelming theme found in Obadiah is the destruction of enemies of God’s people. Unlike some other prophets, Obadiah does not present a “turn or burn” message, simply a message of inevitable doom as a consequence of previous actions. A [[Christian]] with a knowledge of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] would say that although God’s grace and forgiveness abound in situations, there are consequences which result from bad decisions. Even more than all this, Obadiah shows that judgment falls even within the family of God, as [[Israel]] and [[Edom]] descended from twin brothers, Jacob and Esau. One can therefore expect that Obadiah's purpose was to make it known that according to his God, if members of the same family were to treat each other in the same manner as [[Edom]] treated the Israelites, they too may be subject to the wrath of God.

There is a second theme which lies under the surface of Obadiah's writing which may be relevant for [[Christian]]s as a faith group. Just as there is perpetual conflict between the two nations of [[Israel]] and [[Edom]] who once struggled together within a single womb, Christians may understand from [[New Testament]] teaching that there is a similar conflict found within their very lives. Paul’s [[Epistle to Galatians|Epistle to the Galatians]] in the [[New Testament]] presents the idea that the spirit of God and the flesh are in a continual struggle within a person (''cf. {{bibleref|Romans|8:6-9|47}}, {{bibleref|Colossians|3:5|47}}''), just like the two nations in Obadiah’s prophecy. Either the spirit or the flesh will ultimately overcome and the other will fail (just as Israel overcame and Edom failed). It is the [[Christian]] perspective that the spirit will ultimately prevail in the resurrection of the dead (''e.g. {{bibleref|Romans|8:23|47}}'') with the coming of a renewed heavens and earth ( ''e.g. {{bibleref|2Peter|3:13|47}}'').

In relating to theme of [[Obadiah]], it is important to underscore the “punishment” theme this book outlines against Edom. W.J. Deane and J.R. Thomson write this valid conclusion, “The Book of Obadiah is occupied with one subject – the punishment of Edom for its cruel and unbrotherly love conduct towards Judah...” &lt;ref&gt;Deane, W.J. &amp; Thomson, J.R., The Book of Obadiah, The Pulpit Commentary, Vol. 14 Amos - Malachi. Eds. Spence, H.D.M. &amp; Exell, Joseph S., Eerdmans: Grand Rapids (1981). p.1&lt;/ref&gt; One can link this idea of punishment to one of the major prophets “[[Ezekiel]]” who “...interprets the exile to Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalem as deserved punishments for the sins of those who themselves committed them.” &lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M.“A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press, New York (2009) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  Verses 3-7 [http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Obadiah+1] in Obadiah explain to the reader the reason for the punishment theme, “Confidence in one’s power, intelligence, allies, or the topographical features of one’s territory is often mentioned as an attribute of those who foolishly confront the Lord and are consequently punished.” &lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, R.A. (revised by Zvi, Ehud Ben), The HarperCollins Study Bible. Ed. Attridge, H.W., HarperOne; New York. p. 1230&lt;/ref&gt; Although destruction is vital to understanding Obadiah, it is of note to understand the destruction being a consequence of action.

The '''Book of Jonah''' (Hebrew: ''Sefer Yonah'') is a book in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. It tells the story of a Hebrew prophet named [[Jonah]] ben Amittai who is sent by God to prophesy the destruction of [[Nineveh]] but tries to escape the divine mission.&lt;ref&gt;II Kings 14:25&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the reign of [[Jeroboam II]] (786-746 BCE), it was probably written in the post-exilic period, sometime between the late fifth to early fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20book%20belongs%20to%20the%20late%20fifth%20or%20early%20fourth%20centuries%20b.c.e.%22&amp;f=false Mercer Bible Dictionary, &quot;Book of Jonah&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The story has an interesting interpretive history (see below) and has become well-known through popular children’s stories. In [[Judaism]] it is the [[Haftarah]] for the afternoon of [[Yom Kippur]] due to its story of God's willingness to forgive those who repent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ujc.org/page.aspx?id=32951] United Jewish Communities (UJC), &quot;Jonah's Path and the Message of Yom Kippur.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of book==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
The primary theme of the Book of Jonah is God's compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham J. Heschel, ''The Prophets'' (Peabody, Mass: Prince Press, 2004), 131&lt;/ref&gt; It can be divided into four sections, roughly divided by each chapter: (1) God's sovereignty, (2) God’s deliverance, (3) God's mercy, and (4) God's righteousness. It may also be outlined in the following manner:

* God's first commission and Jonah’s rebellion
** God's deliverance toward Jonah and Jonah’s prayer of thanksgiving
* God's second commission and Jonah’s obedience
** God's deliverance toward Nineveh and Jonah’s complaint of ingratitude
*** God is good!

In the first half of the book, God's deliverance is demonstrated through His sovereignty. In the second half, God's deliverance is demonstrated through His mercy. Finally, God declares His righteousness.

As mentioned above, the book of Jonah is not written like the other books of the prophets. Jonah is almost entirely narrative with the exception of the psalm in chapter 2. The actual prophetic word against Nineveh is only given in passing through the narrative. As with any good narrative, the story of Jonah has a setting, characters, a plot, and themes. It also relies heavily on such literary devices as irony.

===Setting===
The story of Jonah is set against the background of Ancient Israel in the 8th-7th centuries BCE but deals with the religious and social issues of the late 6th-4th centuries BCE, coinciding with the views of latter chapters of the [[book of Isaiah]] (Third Isaiah), where Israel is given a prominent place in the expansion of God's kingdom to the Gentiles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Jonah mentioned in II Kings 14:25 lived during the reign of Jeroboam II (786-746 BCE) and was from the city of Gath-hepher. This city, modern el-Meshed, located only several miles from [[Nazareth]] in what would have been known as [[Israel]] in the post-exilic period (as distinct from the southern kingdom, known as [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]) and [[Galilee]] around the time of [[Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Nineveh]] was the capital of the ancient [[Assyria]]n empire, which fell to the [[Medes]] in [[612 BCE]]. The book itself calls Nineveh a “great city,” probably referring to its affluence, but perhaps to its size as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (That the story assumes the city’s existence and deliverance from judgment may indeed reflect an older tradition dating back to the eighth-7th century BCE) Assyria often opposed Israel and eventually took the Israelites captive in 722-721 BCE (see [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]). The Assyrian oppression against the Israelites can be seen in the bitter prophecies of [[Nahum]].

===Characters===
The story of Jonah is a drama between a passive man and an active God. [[Jonah]], whose name literally means &quot;dove,&quot; is introduced to the reader in the very first verse. The name is decisive. While most prophets had heroic names{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (e.g., Isaiah means &quot;God has saved&quot;), Jonah's name carries with it an element of passivity.

Jonah's passive character then is contrasted with the other main character: [[Yahweh]] (lit. &quot;I will be what I will be&quot;). God's character is altogether active. While Jonah flees, God pursues. While Jonah falls, God lifts up. The character of God in the story is progressively revealed through the use of irony. In the first part of the book, God is depicted as relentless and wrathful; in the second part of the book, He is revealed to be truly loving and merciful.

The other characters of the story include the sailors in chapter 1 and the people of Nineveh in chapter 3. These characters are also contrasted to Jonah's passivity. While Jonah sleeps in the hull, the sailors pray and try to save the ship from the storm (1:4-6). While Jonah passively finds himself forced to act under the Divine Will, the people of Nineveh actively petition God to change His mind.

===Plot===
The plot centers on a conflict between Jonah and God. God calls Jonah to proclaim judgment to Nineveh, but Jonah resists and attempts to flee. He goes to [[Jaffa|Joppa]] and boards a ship bound for [[Tarshish]]. God calls up a great storm at sea, and the ship's crew cast Jonah overboard in an attempt to appease God. A great [[sea creature]] (the Book of Jonah says it is a [[fish]] but the [[New Testament]] reference in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|12:38-41|KJV}} says it to be a [[whale]]) sent by God, swallows Jonah. For three days and three nights Jonah languishes inside the fish's belly. He says a prayer in which he repents for his disobedience and thanks God for His mercy. God speaks to the fish, which vomits out Jonah safely on dry land. After his rescue, Jonah obeys the call to prophesy against Nineveh, and they repent and God forgives them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, withering it, and he tells God that it would be better if he were dead. God then points out: &quot;Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night. And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?&quot;


Ironically, the relentless God demonstrated in the first chapter becomes the merciful God in the last two chapters (see 3:10). In a parallel turnabout, Jonah becomes one of the most effective of all prophets, turning the entire population of Nineveh (about 120,000 people) to God.

==Interpretive history==

[[Image:Dore jonah whale.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Jonah Cast Forth By The Whale, by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

===Early Jewish interpretation===
The story of Jonah has numerous theological implications, and this has long been recognized. In early translations of the Hebrew Bible, Jewish translators tended to remove anthropomorphic imagery in order to prevent the reader from misunderstanding the ancient texts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This tendency is evidenced in both the Aramaic translations (i.e. the [[Targum]]) and the Greek translations (i.e. the [[Septuagint]]). As far as the Book of Jonah is concerned, Targum Jonah offers a good example of this.

====Targum Jonah====
In Jonah 1:6, the [[Masoretic Text]] (MT) reads, &quot;...perhaps God will pay heed to us....&quot; Targum Jonah translates this passage as: &quot;...perhaps there will be mercy from the Lord upon us....&quot; The captain's proposal is no longer an attempt to change the divine will; it is an attempt to appeal to divine mercy. Furthermore, in Jonah 3:9, the MT reads, &quot;Who knows, God may turn and relent [lit. repent]?&quot; Targum Jonah translates this as, &quot;Whoever knows that there are sins on his conscience let him repent of them and we will be pitied before the Lord.&quot; God does not change His mind; He shows pity.

====Dead Sea Scrolls====
Fragments of the book were found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (DSS), most of which followed the [[Masoretic Text]] closely and with Mur XII reproducing a large portion of the text.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Washburn, ''A Catalog of Biblical Passages in the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Brill, 2003), 146.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the non-canonical writings, the majority of references to biblical texts were made by ''argumentum ad verecundiam''. The Book of Jonah appears to have served less purpose in the Qumran community than other texts, as the writings make no references to it.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Vanderkam, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Today'' (Grand Rapids, Mich: Eerdmans, 1994), 151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Christian interpretation===
====New Testament====
The earliest Christian interpretations of Jonah are found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (see {{bibleref|Matthew|12:38-42}} and 16:1-4) and the [[Gospel of Luke]] (see Luke 11:29-32). Both Matthew and Luke record a tradition of Jesus’ interpretation of the story of Jonah (notably, Matthew includes two very similar traditions in chapters 12 and 16). As with most Old Testament interpretations found in the New Testament, Jesus’ interpretation is primarily “typological” (see [[Typology (theology)]]). Jonah becomes a “type” for Jesus. Jonah spent three days in the belly of the fish; Jesus will spend three days in the ground. Here, Jesus plays on the imagery of [[Sheol]] found in Jonah’s prayer. While Jonah metaphorically declared, “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,” Jesus will literally be in the belly of Sheol. Finally, Jesus compares his generation to the people of Nineveh. Jesus fulfills his role as a type of Jonah, however his generation fails to fulfill its role as a type of Nineveh. Nineveh repented but his generation, which has seen and heard one even greater than Jonah, fails to repent. Through his typological interpretation of the story of Jonah, Jesus has weighed his generation and found it wanting.

====Augustine of Hippo====
The debate over the credibility of the miracle of Jonah is not simply a modern one. The credibility of a human being surviving in the belly of a great fish has long been questioned. In c. 409 CE, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote to Deogratias concerning the challenge of some to the miracle recorded in the Book of Jonah. He writes:

{{quote|The last question proposed is concerning Jonah, and it is put as if it were not from Porphyry, but as being a standing subject of ridicule among the Pagans; for his words are:
“In the next place, what are we to believe concerning Jonah, who is said to have been three days in a whale’s belly? The thing is utterly improbable and incredible, that a man swallowed with his clothes on should have existed in the inside of a fish. If, however, the story is figurative, be pleased to explain it. Again, what is meant by the story that a gourd sprang up above the head of Jonah after he was vomited by the fish? What was the cause of this gourd’s growth?” Questions such as these I have seen discussed by Pagans amidst loud laughter, and with great scorn.|(Letter CII, Section 30)}}

Augustine responds that if one is to question one miracle, then one should question all miracles as well (section 31). Nevertheless, despite his apologetic, Augustine views the story of Jonah as a figure for Christ. For example, he writes: &quot;As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly of the [[whale]], so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those who are tossed on the waves of this world.&quot; Augustine credits his allegorical interpretation to the interpretation of Christ himself (Matt. 12:39,40), and he allows for other interpretations as long as they are in line with Christ's.

==Jonah and the whale==

The Hebrew text of Jonah {{bibleverse-nb||Jonah|2:1|HE}} (1:17 in English translation), reads ''dag gadol'' (Hebrew: דג גדול), which literally means &quot;great fish.&quot; The [[Septuagint]] translates this into Greek as ''ketos megas,'' (Greek: κητος μεγας), &quot;huge fish&quot;; in Greek mythology the term was closely associated with sea monsters.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Ketea.html for more information regarding Greek mythology and the [[Ketos]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Jerome]] later translated the Greek phrase as ''piscis granda'' in his [[Latin Vulgate]], and as ''cetus'' in {{bibleref|Matthew|12:40}}. At some point, ''cetus'' became synonymous with [[whale]] (c.f. cetyl alcohol, which is alcohol derived from whales). In his 1534 translation, [[William Tyndale]] translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as &quot;greate fyshe,&quot; and he translated the word ''ketos'' (Greek) or ''cetus'' (Latin) in {{bibleref|Matthew|12:40}} as &quot;[[whale]]&quot;. Tyndale's translation was later incorporated into the [[Authorized Version]] of 1611. Since then, the &quot;great fish&quot; in Jonah 2 has most often been translated as &quot;[[whale]]&quot;.

In the line 2:1 the book refers to the fish as ''dag gadol'', &quot;great fish&quot;, in the masculine. However, in the 2:2, it changes the gender to ''daga,'' meaning female fish. The verses therefore read: &quot;And the lord provided a great fish (''dag gadol'', masculine) for Jonah, and it swallowed him, and Jonah sat in the belly of the fish (still male) for three days and nights; then, from the belly of the (''daga'', female) fish, Jonah began to pray.&quot; The peculiarity of this change of gender led the later rabbis to reason that this means Jonah was comfortable in the roomy male fish, so he didn't pray, but that God then transferred him to a smaller, female fish, in which the prophet was uncomfortable, so that he prayed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Jonah's prayer==
Some biblical scholars believe Jonah's prayer ({{bibleverse|Jonah||2:2-9|9}}) to be a later addition to the story (see [[source criticism]] for more information on how such conclusions are drawn). Despite questions of its source, the prayer carries out an important function in the narrative as a whole. The prayer is a psalm of thanksgiving, serving to interpret Jonah's swallowing by the fish as an act of Divine salvation. God has lifted Jonah out of Sheol and set him on the path to carry out His will. The story of descent (from Israel, to Tarshish, to the sea, to under the sea) becomes the story of ascent (from the belly of the fish, to land, to the city of Nineveh). Thus, the use of a psalm creates an important theological point. In the popular understanding of Jonah, the fish is interpreted to be the low point of the story. Yet even the fish is an instrument of God's sovereignty and salvation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Tanakh OT}}The '''Book of Micah''' is the sixth book of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets|twelve minor prophets]] in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] and [[Bible|Christian Bible]].

==Authorship==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
[[Micah (prophet)|Micah of Moresheth]] (most likely the same city as Moresheth-Gath, mentioned in Micah) prophesied during the days of King [[Hezekiah]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. This paraphrase of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 26:18 contains practically everything we know of the Prophet himself. Moresheth-Gath was most likely a small town in southwestern Judah {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.
	Some scholars{{Who|date=September 2010}} argue over how much of the '''book of Micah''' can be attributed to Micah himself. There is general consensus{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} that the majority of chapters 1&amp;ndash;3 are in fact Micah’s own (excluding 2:12&amp;ndash;13). The remaining passages are seen by some{{Who|date=September 2010}} as redactions.

However some Old Testament scholars, for example Dr [[Bruce Waltke]] in [[Inter-Varsity Press|IVP]]`s 'New Bible Commentary', defend Micah's authorship of the entire book.

==Date of composition==
Micah was active in Judah from before the fall of Samaria (1:2&amp;ndash;7) in 722 BC; he lived under king Ahaz (735&amp;ndash;715 BC) and king Hezekiah (715&amp;ndash;687), and (apparently) experienced the devastation brought on by Senacherib’s invasion of Judah (701 BC). The heading of the book (1:1) also adds the name of king Jotham (742&amp;ndash;735 BC). This would make Micah active from 742 (at earliest) to 701 (at latest) BC.
The message in [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Micah#1:2|Micah 1:2–9]] was given before the destruction of Samaria in 721. The appeal of [[Jeremiah]]'s supporters to the [[prophecy]] of Micah confirms his connection with Hezekiah: &quot;And some of the land arose and said to all the assembled people, Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the days of Hezekiah king of Judah&quot; ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Jeremiah#26:17|Jeremiah 26:17]]).

==Setting==
During the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam II, king of Israel, a period of relative peace and prosperity began to wane. This was in part due to the rise of the nation of [[Assyria]], who, after a period of quiescence, became a potent political force in the Near East. With the rise of Assyria came a rise in military pressure upon the kingdoms of Judah and Israel.

At the same time that trade and commerce was flourishing, rich landowners were bribing Judges to look favorably upon illicit land acquisitions resulting in a rapid disappearance of small farmers. Those who were dispossessed drifted from the countryside to the cities, which led to overcrowding in the major population centers. Micah outspokenly refuted practices that infringed upon the rights of small farmers resulting in economic gains for rich landowners.

Micah, and the other minor prophets, also speak out against the lack of obedience to the Covenantal stipulations. Many aspects of the covenant had been abandoned in favor of Baal-worship and other Pagan practices. In this light, Samaria, one of the leaders in this apostasy, is condemned to destruction.

Micah’s period of activity also overlaps that of Isaiah’s, and it is possible that the two contemporaries were often mistaken for one another. Jeremaiah 26:18&amp;ndash;20 speaks of Micah’s effect on the king, and that he and the king not only were able to meet, but also that Micah’s message was able to bring the king to repentance. However, some scholars view that it may be more probable that Isaiah was the one who caused the king’s repentance, as he, having access to the king, was much more likely to influence the king’s decisions.

==Content==

While the book of Micah is relatively short, it contains a number of genres and presents a wide variety of content. This includes &quot;lament (1.8-16; 7.8-10), theophany (1.3-4), and hymnic prayer of petition and confidence (7.14-20). &quot; &lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David. ''A Brief INtroduction to the Old testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context.'' New Your: Oxford University Press, 2009. Page 284&lt;/ref&gt; 

Micah also includes an example of &quot;covenant lawsuit&quot; (6.1-8). &quot;''Covenant Lawsuit''&quot; is a distinct genre, &quot;in which, Yahweh sues Israel for breach of contract, that is, for violation of the Sinai covenant&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David. ''A Brief INtroduction to the Old testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context.'' New Your: Oxford University Press, 2009. Page 265&lt;/ref&gt; This section concludes with &quot;what does the Lord require of you? But to do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with your God&quot;; this scripture is an example seen throughout prophetic literature attacking empty rituals and for sincere sacrifice of self to God. Micah shares this content feature with the prophetic books of [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]] and [[Hosea]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David. ''A Brief INtroduction to the Old testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context.'' New Your: Oxford University Press, 2009. Page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poetic Ideas of Micah, according the Anchor Bible Dictionary:'''

* '''The Heading (1:1)''': As is typical of prophetic books, an anonymous editor has supplied the name of the prophet, an indication of his time of activity, and an identification of his speech as the “word of Yahweh.” Samaria and Jerusalem are given prominence as the foci of the prophet’s attention.
* '''Punishment of Samaria (1:2&amp;ndash;7):''' Drawing upon ancient traditions for depicting a theophany, the prophet depicts the coming of Yahweh to punish the idolatrous city.
* '''A transitional Lament (1:8&amp;ndash;9):''' depicting the prophet’s own grief at the calamity leading to the new subject: the doom of Judah and Jerusalem.
* '''A Taunt or Lament over Judah (1:10&amp;ndash;16):''' describes the destruction of the lesser towns of Judah, either as already suffered or as to come (this latter point evidently referring to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib, 701 BC). N.B. For these passages of doom that will befall the various cities, the device paronomasia is used. Paronomasia is a literary device which 'plays' on the sound of each word for literary effect. For example, the inhabitants of Beth-le-aphrah (“house of dust”) are told to “roll yourselves in the dust.” 1:14. Though most of the Paronomasia is lost in translation, it is the equivalent of ‘Ashdod shall be but ashes,’ where the fate of the city matches its name.
* '''Two Successive Doom speeches (2:1&amp;ndash;5, 6&amp;ndash;11)''': introduce themes characteristic of the prophet Micah as champion of the oppressed small landholder. These speeches warn of the impending doom that will befall those who accumulate land from the sacred community.
* '''The Divine Shepherd King (2:12&amp;ndash;13):''' is pictured as gathering and leading a dispersed people. Though all agree that this passage is not connected to its immediate textual context, there is still debate over whether this is actually Micah’s own words.
* '''Speech against the courts (3:1&amp;ndash;4):''' which focuses on the judges who are allowing illicit land acquisition.
* '''Speech against the prophets (3:5&amp;ndash;8):''' that depicts the prophets who were members of the prophetic guilds at that time as venal and blind.
* '''Climactic Speech about Zion (3:9&amp;ndash;12)''' resumes the indictment of judges and prophets, adds a line against priests and culminates in the famous saying, “Zion shall be plowed as a field.”
* '''The Coming Kingdom of God (4:1&amp;ndash;5)''' centered at the sacred mountain, Zion, this passage shares themes with Isaiah (2:2&amp;ndash;4), preaching universal justice, peace, and security. The remainder of the chapter is made up of poems that focus on the glorious future:
* '''The Kingdom of the Gathered Exiles (4:6&amp;ndash;7)'''
* '''Zion’s Rule Restored (4:8)'''
* '''Deliverance from Distress in Babylon (4:9&amp;ndash;10)'''
* '''The Threshing of Enemies (4:11&amp;ndash;13)'''
* '''The Humiliation of the King (4:14):''' Some scholars consider this a fragment that is incomplete, though it still serves its purpose to introduce the theme of the royal Messiah.
* '''The Return of the Great Ruler from Bethlehem (5:1&amp;ndash;4):''' this foretold king is very influential among the book’s Christian interpreters. Among Christians, it is interpreted to foretell the coming of Christ (&quot;ruler in Israel&quot;) who is eternal (&quot;whose origins are from the old, from the ancient of times&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;The New International Version (NIV) [http://www.biblegateway.com/ Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;The remainder of this chapter’s poems are focused on expounding on the coming peace
* '''Assyria Eliminated (5:4&amp;ndash;5)'''
* '''The Irresistible Might of Jacob (5:6&amp;ndash;8)'''
* '''The Purified Nation (5:9&amp;ndash;14):''' Alien elements that offend Yahweh are removed
* '''A Covenant lawsuit (6:1&amp;ndash;5):''' that represents God as indicting his people for breach of their covenant.
* '''Torah Liturgy (6:6&amp;ndash;8):''' which begins with [[Micah (Prophet)|Micah]] speaking on behalf of the community asking what they should do in order to get back on God's good side. Micah then responds in V. 8 by showing what is God requires: &quot;to Do Justice, and to Love Kindness, and to Walk Humbly with your God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NRSV Micah 6:8b&lt;/ref&gt; Thus declaring that the burnt offering of both animals and humans (which may have been practiced in Judah under Kings [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaz]] and [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]) is not necessary for God.&lt;ref&gt;King, Phillip J., ''Harper Collins Study Bible: Micah''; '''NRSV'''; pg. 1246-1247; Revised by Carol J. Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The City as a Cheat (6:9&amp;ndash;16):''' It is unsure whether it is Jerusalem or Samaria, but the city is reprimanded for its dishonest trade practices.
* '''A Disintegrated Society (7:1&amp;ndash;7):''' gives a grim picture of the loss of trust due to the dishonesty of the society.
* '''A Prophetic Liturgy (7:8&amp;ndash;20):''' has been known by this designation since the studies of H. Gunkel (in 1924). It is a ‘liturgy’ due to the alteration of speakers, the combination of themes, and the progression of mood.

The '''book of Nahum''' is a book in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. It stands seventh in order among what are known as the twelve [[Minor Prophets]].

== Author and Context ==

[[Nahum]] prophesied, according to some, in the beginning of the reign of [[Ahaz]] ([[740s BC]]). Others, however, think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the reign of [[Hezekiah]] ([[700s BC]]). Probably the book was written in [[Jerusalem]], where he witnessed the invasion of [[Sennacherib]] and the destruction of his host ([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 19:35). And still others support the idea that the &quot;book of vision&quot; was written shortly before the fall of Nineveh&lt;ref&gt;Kent H. Richards, Nahum Introduction: The Harper Collins Study Bible,(New York: Harper Collins, 2006)1250&lt;/ref&gt; at the hands of the Medes and Babylonians &lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 297&lt;/ref&gt;(612 BCE). This theory is evidenced by the fact that the oracles must be dated after the Assyrian destruction of Thebes in 663 BCE as this event is mentioned in Nah 3:8.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent H. Richards 2006&quot;&gt;Kent H. Richards, Nahum Introduction: The Harper Collins Study Bible, (New York: Harper Collins, 2006) 1250&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of this prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of [[Nineveh]], the capital of the great and at that time flourishing [[Assyria|Assyrian empire]]. [[Assur-bani-pal]] was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the center of the civilization and commerce of the world, a &quot;bloody city all full of lies and robbery&quot; (Nahum 3:1), for it had robbed and plundered all the neighboring nations. It was strongly fortified on every side, bidding defiance to every enemy.  One popular verse is 3:5, &quot;Behold, I am against thee, saith [[YHWH]] of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.&quot; This is very symbolic showing that Nineveh was known for being a city full of prostitutes.

[[Jonah]] had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by [[Zephaniah]], who also predicted ([[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 2:4-15) the destruction of the city, predictions which were remarkably fulfilled ([[625 BC]]) when Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia.

== Theme ==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
From its opening, Nahum shows God to be slow to anger but also one who will by no means clear the guilty but will bring his vengeance and wrath to pass.  The opening passage (Nahum 1:2-3) states:  &quot;God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.  The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked&quot;.  God is strong and will use means, but a mighty God doesn't need anyone else to carry out vengeance and wrath for him.

Nahum’s theme carries a particular warning to the Ninevites of coming events, although he is partly in favor of the destruction.&lt;ref name = &quot;abp&quot;&gt;[http://www.aboutbibleprophecy.com/p52.htm Nahum] at [http://www.aboutbibleprophecy.com aboutbibleprophecy.com]&lt;/ref&gt; One might even say that the book of Nahum is &quot;a celebration of the fall of Assyria.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009)
&lt;/ref&gt; And this is not just a warning or speaking positively of the destruction of Ninevah, it is also a positive encouragement and &quot;message of comfort for Israel, Judah, and others who had experienced the &quot;endless cruelty&quot; (3:19) of the Assyrians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 298&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet [[Jonah]] shows us where God shows concern for the people of Nineveh, while Nahum’s writing testifies to his belief in the righteousness/justice of God&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/nahum.html Nahum] at [http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com earlyjewishwritings.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and how God dealt with those Assyrians in punishment according to &quot;their cruelty&quot; (Nahum 3:19). The Assyrians had been used as God's &quot;rod of [...] anger, and the staff in their hand [as] indignation.&quot; (Isaiah 10:5)

== Contents ==
Chapters 1:1-2:2 show the majesty and might of God the LORD in goodness and severity.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{bibleverse||Romans|11:22|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chapters 2:3-3:19 describe the fall of Nineveh in 612 BCE. Nineveh is compared to [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], the Egyptian city that Assyria itself had destroyed in 663 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent H. Richards 2006&quot;/&gt; Nahum describes the siege and frenzied activity of Nineveh’s troops as they try in vain to halt the invaders. Poetically, he becomes a participant in the battle, and with subtle irony, barks battle commands to the defenders. Nahum uses numerous similes and metaphors. Nineveh is ironically compared with a lion, in reference to the lion as an Assyrian symbol of power; Nineveh is the lion of strength that has a den full of dead prey but will become weak like the lion hiding in its den. It comes to conclusion with a taunt song and funeral dirge of the impending destruction of Nineveh and the &quot;sleep&quot; or death of the Assyrian people and demise of the once great Assyrian conqueror-rulers.

==Present Day Significance==
God's judgement on Ninevah is &quot;all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.&quot; (Nahum 3:4 NIV).  Sexual infidelity, according to the prophets, related to spiritual unfaithfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Centre Column Reference Bible, (Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1994) 1262&lt;/ref&gt; For example: ''the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD.''(Hosea 1:2 NIV)  The apostle John used a similar analogy in Revelation chapter 17.

The '''Book of Haggai''' is a book of the [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Tanak]], and has its place within the [[Minor Prophets]] or the &quot;[[Book of the Twelve]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament.'' Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a short book, consisting of only two chapters. The historical setting dates around 520 BCE before the Temple has been rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. &quot;A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament.&quot; Oxford University Press, 2009. o. 346.~~~~&lt;/ref&gt; [[520 BCE]] falls between the start of the Persian empire in [[539 BCE]] and [[520 BCE]] a period that saw major kings such as [[Zerubbabel]] helped lead the Jews in their return to the land.

== Authorship ==
The '''Book of Haggai''' is named after its presumed author, the prophet [[Haggai]]. There is no biographical information given about the prophet in the Book of Haggai, so we know no personal information about him.  Haggai's name is derived from the Hebrew verbal root ''hgg'', which means &quot;to make a pilgrimage.&quot;  W. Sibley Towner suggests that Haggai's name might come &quot;from his single-minded effort to bring about the reconstruction of that destination of ancient Judean pilgrims, the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Towner, W. Sibley. ''The Harper Collins Study Bible''. HarperCollins Publishers. 2006. p. 1265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
The ''Book of Haggai'' was written in [[520 BCE]] some 18 years after [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] had conquered [[Babylon]] and issued a decree in [[538 BCE]] allowing the captive Jews to return to Judea. Cyrus saw the restoration of the temple as necessary for the restoration of the religious practices and a sense of peoplehood after a long exile.

==Synopsis==
Haggai's message is filled with an urgency for the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the [[Second Temple|second Jerusalem temple]]. Haggai attributes a recent drought to the peoples' refusal to rebuild the temple, which he sees as key to [[Jerusalem]]’s glory.  The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one [[Zerubbabel]], governor of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], as the Lord’s chosen leader. The language here is not as finely wrought as in some other books of the [[minor prophets]], yet the intent seems straightforward.

==A Closer Look==

The first chapter contains the first address (2-11) and its effects (12-15). 

The second chapter contains:
#The second prophecy (1-9), which was delivered a month after the first
#The third prophecy (10-19), delivered two months and three days after the second; and
#The fourth prophecy (20-23), delivered on the same day as the third

These discourses are referred to in [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 5:1 and 6:14. (Compare Haggai 2:7, 8 and 22)

Haggai reports that three weeks after his first prophecy, the rebuilding of the Temple began on September 7 521 BCE. &quot;They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]].(Haggai 1:14-15) and the Book of Ezra indicates that it was finished on February 25 516 BCE &quot;The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.&quot; (Ezra 6:15)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Tanakh OT}}
'''Malachi''' (or '''Malachias''', {{lang-he|מַלְאָכִי}}, Malʾaḫi, Mál'akhî) is a book of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the last of the [[twelve minor prophets]] (canonically) and the final book of the [[Neviim]].  In the Christian ordering, the grouping of the Prophetic Books is the last section of the [[Old Testament]], making Malachi the last book before the [[New Testament]].

The book is commonly attributed to a prophet by the name of Malachi. Although the appellation Malachi has frequently been understood as a proper name, its [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] meaning is simply &quot;My [i.e., God's] messenger&quot; (or 'His messenger' in the [[Septuagint]]) and may not be the author's name at all. The sobriquet occurs in the superscription at 1:1 and in 3:1, although it is highly unlikely that the word refers to the same character in both of these references. Thus, there is substantial debate regarding the identity of the book's author. The Jewish [[Targum]] identifies [[Ezra]] (or Esdras) as the author of Malachi. [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] suggests this may be because Ezra is seen as an intermediary between the prophets and the 'great synagogue'. There is, however, no historical evidence yet to support this claim. 

Some scholars note affinities between [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9-14 and the book of Malachi. Zechariah 9, Zechariah 12, and Malachi 1 are all introduced as &quot;Oracle, the word of Yahweh.&quot; Many scholars argue that this collection originally consisted of three independent and anonymous prophecies, two of which were subsequently appended to the book of Zechariah (as what scholars refer to as Deutero-Zechariah) with the third becoming the book of Malachi. As a result, most scholars consider the book of Malachi to be the work of a single author who may or may not have been identified by the title Malachi. The present division of the oracles results in a total of twelve books of minor prophets—a number parallelling the sons of [[Jacob]] who became the heads of the twelve [[Israelite|tribes of Israel]]. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] asserts that &quot;We are no doubt in presence of an abbreviation of the name Mál'akhîyah, that is 'Messenger of Yah'&quot;.

==The author==
Nothing is known of the biography of the author of the book of Malachi although it has been suggested that he may have been Levitical (which is curious, considering that Ezra was a priest.) The books of Zechariah and Haggai were written during the lifetime of Ezra (see 5:1), perhaps this may explain the similarities in style. Although the Ezra theory is disputed, no other authorship theories are dominant.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

According to the editors of the 1897 [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], some scholars believe the name &quot;Malachi&quot; is not a [[proper noun]] but rather an abbreviation of &quot;messenger of YHWH&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easton&quot;&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Malachi Malachi]'' at the [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; This reading could be based on Malachi 3:1, &quot;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/tsk_b/Mal/3/1.html#MainTop Behold, I will send ''my messenger''...]&quot;, if ''my messenger'' is taken literally as the name ''Malachi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malachi&quot;/&gt; Several scholars consider the book to be anonymous, with verse 1:1 being a later addition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malachi&quot;&gt;Carl Heinrich Cornill states that Zechariah 9-14 and Malachi are anonymous and were therefore placed at the end of the [[Book of the Twelve]].{{fact|date=February 2011}} [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], [[Abraham Kuenen]], and Wilhelm Gustav Hermann Nowack argue that Malachi 1:1 is a late addition, pointing to [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9:1 and 12:1.{{fact|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars, including the editors of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', argue that the grammatical evidence leads us to conclude that Malachi is in fact a name.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathMalachi&quot;/&gt;
    
Another interpretation of the authorship comes from the [[Septuagint]] [[superscription]], ὲν χειρὶ ἀγγήλου αὐτοῦ, which can be read as either &quot;by the hand of his messenger&quot; or as &quot;by the hand of his angel&quot;. The &quot;angel&quot; reading found an echo among the ancient [[Fathers of the Church]] and ecclesiastical writers, and even gave rise to the &quot;strangest fancies&quot;, especially among the disciples of [[Origen of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CathMalachi&quot;&gt;A. VAN HOONACKER, [http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Malachias &quot;Malachias&quot;], ''The Original Catholic Encyclopedia'', retrieved 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerome&quot;&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.vii.iv.xii.html#vii.iv.xii-p32 Prefaces to the Commentaries on the Minor Prophets.]'', [[Jerome]], 406: ''[[Origen of Alexandria|Origen]] and his followers believe that (according to his name) he was an angel. But we reject this view altogether, lest we be compelled to accept the doctrine of the fall of souls from heaven.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period==
There are very few historical details in the book of Malachi. The greatest clue as to its dating may lie in the fact that the Persian-era term for governor (pehâ) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because of the use of the Persian period term and because [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515 BCE. Malachi was apparently known to the author of [[Sirach|Ecclesiasticus]] early in the 2nd century BCE. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position between [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]] and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], slightly before [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] came to [[Jerusalem]] in 445 BCE.

==Aim==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
The book of Malachi was written to correct the lax religious and social behavior of the [[Israelite]]s &amp;ndash; particularly the priests &amp;ndash; in post-exilic [[Jerusalem]]. Although the prophets urged the people of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Israel]] to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with [[Yahweh]], it was not long after they had been restored to the land and to [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] worship that the people's commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was in this context that the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy. 

In 1:2, Malachi has the people of Israel question God's love for them. This introduction to the book illustrates the severity of the situation which Malachi addresses. The graveness of the situation is also indicated by the dialectical style with which Malachi confronts his audience. Malachi proceeds to accuse his audience of failing to respect God as God deserves. One way in which this disrespect is made manifest is through the substandard sacrifices which Malachi claims are being offered by the priests. While [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] demands animals that are &quot;without blemish&quot; ([[Leviticus]] 1:3, NRSV), the priests, who were &quot;to determine whether the animal was acceptable&quot; (Mason 143), were offering blind, lame and sick animals for sacrifice because they thought nobody would notice.

In 2:10, Malachi addresses the issue of divorce. On this topic, Malachi deals with divorce both as a social problem (&quot;Why then are we faithless to one another ... ?&quot; 2:10) and as a religious problem (&quot;Judah ... has married the daughter of a foreign god&quot; 2:11). In contrast to the book of [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] (or not - see section below), Malachi urges each to remain steadfast to the wife of their youth.

Malachi also criticizes his audience for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting them to be faithful as they await that justice. Malachi quickly goes on to point out that the people have not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so the people have been neglecting to offer their full [[tithe]] to the Lord. The result of these shortcomings is that the people come to believe that no good comes out of serving God.

Malachi assures the faithful among his audience that in the [[eschatology|eschaton]], the differences between those who served God faithfully and those who did not will become clear. The book concludes by calling upon the teachings of [[Moses]] and by promising that [[Elijah]] will return prior to the [[Last Judgement|Day of the Lord]].

==Interpretations==
The book of Malachi is divided into three chapters in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Septuagint|Greek Septuagint]] and four chapters in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The fourth chapter in the Vulgate consists of the remainder of the third chapter starting at verse 3:19.

The majority of scholars consider the book to be made up of six distinct oracles. According to this scheme, the book of Malachi consists of a series of disputes between [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] and the various groups within the [[Israelite]] community. In the course of the book's three or four chapters, [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] is vindicated while those who do not adhere to the law of [[Moses]] are condemned. Some scholars have suggested that the book, as a whole, is structured along the lines of a judicial trial, a suzerain treaty or a covenant &amp;ndash; one of the major themes throughout the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]]. Implicit in the prophet's condemnation of Israel's religious practices is a call to keep [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s statutes.

The book of Malachi draws upon various themes found in other books of the Bible. Malachi appeals to the story of the rivalry between [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] and of [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s preference for Jacob contained in [[Book of Genesis]] 25-28. Malachi reminds his audience that, as descendants of Jacob ([[Israel]]), they have been and continue to be favoured by God as God's chosen people. In the second dispute, Malachi draws upon the Levitical Code (e.g. [[Leviticus]] 1:3) in condemning the priest for offering unacceptable sacrifices.

In the third dispute (concerning divorce), the author of the book of Malachi likely intends his argument to be understood on two levels. Malachi appears to be attacking either the practice of divorcing Jewish wives in favour of foreign ones (a practice which [[Ezra]] vehemently condemns) or, alternatively, Malachi could be condemning the practice of divorcing foreign wives in favour of [[Jew]]ish wives (a practice which [[Ezra]] promoted). Malachi appears adamant that nationality is not a valid reason to terminate a marriage, &quot;For I hate divorce, says the Lord . . .&quot; (2:16).

In many places throughout the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]] &amp;ndash; particularly the book of [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] &amp;ndash; [[Israel]] is figured as [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce may also be understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi could very well be urging his audience not to break faith with [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] (the God of [[Israel]]) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] were questioning [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the [[messiah|messianic age]] which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.
[[File:Gustave Doré Malachiáš 3.1.jpg|thumb|220px|Illustration of the coming of God's Messenger in 3:1, by [[Franciszek Żmurko]].]]
Indeed, the fourth dispute asserts that judgment is coming in the form of a messenger who &quot;is like refiner's fire and like fullers' soap . . .&quot; (3:2). Following this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute &amp;ndash; that is, failing to offer full tithes. In this discussion, Malachi has [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] request the people to &quot;Bring the full tithe . . . [and] see if I will not  open the windows of heaven for you and pour down on you an overflowing blessing&quot; (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord's statutes will not only allow the people to avoid God's wrath, but will also lead to God's blessing. In the sixth dispute, the people of [[Israel]] illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. Malachi has them say &quot;'It is vain to serve God . . . Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape'&quot; (3:14-15). Once again, Malachi has [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] assure the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.

In the light of what Malachi understands to be an imminent judgment, he exhorts his audience to &quot;Remember the teaching of my servant [[Moses]], that statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]] for all [[Israel]]&quot; (4:4; 3:22, MT). Before the [[Last Judgment|Day of the Lord]], Malachi declares that [[Elijah]] (who &quot;ascended in a whirlwind into heaven . . . [,]&quot; 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 2:11) will return to earth in order that people might follow in God's ways.

Primarily because of its [[messiah|messianic]] promise, the book of Malachi is frequently referred to in the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]]. What follows is a brief comparison between the book of Malachi and the [[New Testament]] texts which refer to it (as suggested in Hill 84-88).

Although many Christians believe that the [[messiah|messianic]] prophecies of the book of Malachi have been fulfilled in the life, ministry, death and resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]], most Jews continue to await the coming of the prophet [[Elijah]] who will prepare the way for the Lord. The Latter-day Saints differ significantly in this regard as noted below.

===Mormon Beliefs about Malachi and Elijah===

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that the prophet [[Elijah]] appeared to Joseph Smith on April 3, 1836 ([[Passover]]) and restored important &quot;keys&quot; (Priesthood authority) related to temple work and family history/genealogical record-keeping. ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110 Doctrine and Covenants Section 110]) This is in direct fulfillment of Malachi's prophesy at the end of chapter 4. As recorded in [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1 Joseph Smith's history], [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]] appeared to Joseph in the year 1823 and told him that parts of Malachi chapter 3 and all of chapter 4 had not yet been fulfilled but soon would be. Malachi's teachings on the blessings of [[tithe|tithing]] are also considered very important in LDS doctrine, and were repeated by the resurrected Savior in the [[Book of Mormon]] ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/24 3 Nephi 24,25]).

The '''Book of Zechariah''' is the penultimate book of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets|twelve minor prophets]] in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] and [[Bible|Christian Bible]], attributed to the [[prophet]] [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]].

==Historical context==
Zechariah’s ministry took place during the reign of [[Darius the Great]] ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|1:1|HE}}), and was contemporary with [[Haggai]] in a post-[[Babylonian captivity|exilic]] world after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in 586/7 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Carol L. Myers and Eric M. Myers, ''Haggai, Zechariah 1-8: The Anchor Bible''. Garden City, Doubleday and Company Inc., 1987. ISBN 978-0385144827. Page 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ezekiel]] and [[Jeremiah]] wrote prior to the fall of Jerusalem, while continuing to prophesy in the earlier exile period.  Scholars believe Ezekiel, with his blending of ceremony and vision, heavily influenced the visionary works of Zechariah 1-8.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zechariah is specific about dating his writing (520-518 BCE).  

During the Exile many [[Jews]] were taken to [[Babylon]], where the prophets told them to make their homes ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|29|HE}}), suggesting they would spend a long period of time there.  Eventually freedom did come to many Israelites, when [[Cyrus the Great]] overtook the Babylonians in 539 BCE.  In 538 BCE, the famous [[Cyrus in the Judeo-Christian tradition|Edict of Cyrus]] was released, and the first return took place under Sheshbazzar.  After the death of Cyrus in 530 BCE, [[Darius]] consolidated power and took office in 522 BCE.  His system divided the different colonies of the empire into easily manageable districts overseen by governors.  [[Zerubbabel]] comes into the story, appointed by Darius as governor over the district of Yehud (Judah).  

Under the reign of Darius, Zechariah also emerged, centering around the rebuilding of the temple.  Unlike the Babylonians, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] went to great lengths to keep “cordial relations” between vassal and lord.  The rebuilding of the temple was encouraged by the leaders of the empire in hopes that it would strengthen the authorities in local contexts.  This policy was good politics on the part of the Persians, and the Jews viewed it as a blessing from God.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, pp. 31-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The prophet==
{{main|Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)}}
[[Zechariah (given name)|His name]] means &quot;God has remembered.&quot; Not much is known about Zechariah’s life other than what may be inferred from the book. It has been speculated that his ancestor [[Iddo]] was the head of a priestly family who returned with [[Zerubbabel]] ({{bibleverse||Nehemiah|12:4|HE}}), and that Zechariah may himself have been a [[priest]] as well as a [[prophet]]. This is supported by Zechariah's interest in the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] and the priesthood, and from Iddo's preaching in the [[Books of Chronicles]].

==Authorship==
Some scholars accept the book as the writings of one individual.  For example, George Livingstone Robinson's dissertation on chapters 9-14&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures'', Vol. 12, No. 1/2 (Oct 1895 - Jan 1896), pp. 1-92.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that those chapters had their origin in the period between 518 and 516 BCE and stand in close relation to chapters 1-8, having most probably been composed by Zechariah himself. However, most modern scholars believe the book of Zechariah was written by at least two different people.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context''. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Zechariah 1-8, sometimes referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context.'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Zechariah 9-14, often called Second Zechariah, contains within the text no datable references to specific events or individuals but most scholars will give the text a date in the fifth century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context''. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears to make use of the books of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], the Deuteronomistic History, and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Eric. &quot;Zechariah Introduction.&quot; ''The New Interpreter's Study Bible''. (Abingdon Press: Nashville, 2003), p. 1338.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some scholars who go even further and divide Second Zechariah into a Second Zechariah (9-11) and Third Zechariah (12-14) since each begins with a heading oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context.'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
{{details|Babylonian captivity}}
The return from exile is the theological premise of prophet's visions in chapters 1-6. Chapters 7–8 address the [[quality of life]] God wants his renewed people to enjoy, containing many encouraging promises to them. Chapters 9-14 comprise two &quot;[[oracle]]s&quot; of the future.   
[[Image:Gustave Doré (1832-1883) - The Bible (1865) - Zechariah 6-5.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Zechariah's vision of the four horsemen ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|6:1-8|HE}}), [[engraving]] by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

===Chapters 1 to 6===
The book begins with a preface ({{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|1:1-6|HE}}), which recalls the nation's past history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions ({{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|1:7-6:8|HE}}), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolic action, the crowning of [[Joshua the High Priest|Joshua]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|6:9-15|HE}}), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's [[Messiah]].

===Chapters 7 and 8===
Chapters {{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|7|HE}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|8|HE}}, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be kept any longer, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing.

===Chapters 9 to 14===
This section consists of two &quot;oracles&quot; or &quot;burdens&quot;: 
*The first oracle (ch. {{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|9-11|HE}}) gives an outline of the course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time of the coming of the Messiah.
*The second oracle (ch. {{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|12-14|HE}}) points out the glories that await Israel in &quot;the latter day&quot;, the final conflict and triumph of God's kingdom.

==Themes==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
The purpose of this book is not strictly historical but [[theological]] and [[pastoral]]. The main emphasis is that God is at work and plans to live again with His people in Jerusalem.  He will save them from their enemies and cleanse them from sin. 

Zechariah's concern for purity is apparent in the temple, priesthood and all areas of life as the prophecy gradually eliminates the influence of the governor in favour of the high priest, and the sanctuary becomes ever more clearly the centre of messianic fulfillment. The prominence of prophecy is quite apparent in Zechariah, but it is also true that Zechariah (along with Haggai) allows prophecy to yield to the priesthood; this is particularly apparent in comparing Zechariah to &quot;Third Isaiah&quot; (chapters 55–66 of the [[Book of Isaiah]]), whose author was active sometime after the first return from exile.

Most Christian commentators read the series of predictions in chapters 7 to 14 as [[Claimed Messianic prophecies of Jesus|Messianic prophecies]], either directly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Petterson, A. R., ''Behold Your King: The Hope for the House of David in the Book of Zechariah'' (LHBOTS 513; London: T&amp;T Clark, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; These chapters helped the writers of the [[Gospel]]s understand Jesus’ suffering, death and resurrection, which they quoted as they wrote of Jesus’ final days.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see allusion to Zechariah 9:9 in Matthew 21:5; also Zechariah 12:10 in John 19:37.  These and other references between Zechariah and the [[New Testament]] are described in {{Citation
| last = Gill    | first = John   | author-link = John_Gill_(theologian)   | title = Exposition of the Entire Bible: Introduction to Zechariah   | url = http://www.freegrace.net/gill/Zechariah/Zechariah_1.htm  | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[Book of Revelation]], which narrates the denouement of history, is also colored by images in Zechariah.

===Apocalyptic Literature===
One reason why the [[Book of Revelation]] is colored by images in Zechariah is because Chapters 9-14 of Book of Zechariah is an early example of [[Apocalyptic literature]]. Though not as fully developed as the apocalyptic visions described in the [[Book of Daniel]], the &quot;oracles&quot;, as they are titled in Zechariah 9-14 contain apocalyptic elements. One theme these oracles contain is descriptions of the [[Day of the Lord]], when &quot;the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle&quot; (Zechariah 14:3). These chapters also contain &quot;pessimism about the present, but optimism for the future based on the expectation of an ultimate divine victory and the subsequent transformation of the cosmos&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. Pg. 353&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the description of the Lord ordering &quot;Strike the shepherd so that the sheep may be scattered&quot; (Zechariah 13:7), implying that not only will God judge the other nations, but he will judge the leaders of Israel. There is also imagery that is surreal, mythical imagery, rather than real images, as in Zechariah 11:1-2 &quot;Open your doors, O Lebanon,/so that fire may devour your cedars!/Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, for the glorious trees are ruined!/Ail, oaks of Bashan,/ for the thick forest has been felled!&quot; The final word in Zechariah proclaims that on the Day of the Lord &quot;There will be no Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts on that day&quot; (14:21), proclaiming the need for purity in the temple, which would come when God judges at the end of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Tanakh OT}}
The superscription of the '''Book of Zephaniah''' attributes its authorship to “Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of [[Hezekiah]], in the days of King [[Josiah]] son of [[Amon of Judah|Amon]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]” (1:1, [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]). All that is known of [[Zephaniah]] comes from the text. The superscription of the book is lengthier than most and contains two features. The name Cushi, Zephaniah’s father, means ‘[[Ethiopia]]n’. In a society where genealogy was considered extremely important because of [[Tetragrammaton|God's]] covenant with [[Abraham]] and his descendants, the author may have felt compelled to establish his [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] lineage. In fact, this lineage is traced back to [[Hezekiah]], who was king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. The author of Zephaniah does not shrink from condemning the Cushites or Ethiopians. Chapter 2:12 contains a succinct but unequivocal message: “You also, O Ethiopians, / Shall be killed by my sword.” Zephaniah’s family connection with King [[Hezekiah]] may have also legitimized his harsh indictment of the royal city in 3:1-7.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

As with many of the other prophets, there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah. Some scholars believe that much of the material does not date from the days of King [[Josiah]] (ca. 640-609 BC), but is actually post-monarchic. Three general possibilities are that a person, possibly named Zephaniah, prophesied the words of the book of Zephaniah; the general message of a Josianic prophet is conveyed through the book of Zephaniah; or the name could have been employed, either during the monarchic or post-monarchic period, as a ‘speaking voice’, possibly for rhetorical purposes. Although it is possible that a post-monarchic author assumed the persona of a monarchic prophet to add credibility to his message, there is no evidence to support such a claim.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The prophetic book of the Bible attributed to Zephaniah occurs ninth among the twelve [[minor prophet]]s, preceded by [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] and followed by [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]]. Zephaniah (or Tzfanya, Sophonias, צפניה, Ẓəfanya, Ṣəp̄anyāh) means 'the Lord conceals',or 'the Lord protects'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==When it was written==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
If the superscription of the book of Zephaniah is a reliable indicator of the time that the bulk of the book was composed, then Zephaniah was a contemporary of the prophet [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] (or Jeremias). King [[Josiah]] ruled over [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] from approximately 640-609 BC. Some scholars believe that the picture of [[Jerusalem]] which Zephaniah gives indicates that he was active prior to the religious reforms of King Josiah which are described in 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 23. These reforms took place in 622 BC.  Scholars{{Who|date=May 2011}} also cite the reference to “the officials and the king’s sons . . .” in 1:8 as evidence that the kingdom was still ruled by a regent for Josiah. The portrait of foreign nations in chapter 2 also indicates the late seventh century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Probably the first prophet following the prophecies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and the violent reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]. Both Zephaniah and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] urged King [[Josiah]] to enact religious reforms, which he eventually did.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Other scholars{{Who|date=September 2007}} have presented evidence pointing to a post-monarchic date (as late as 200 BC) based on language and theme, although the book might still have been based on an earlier composition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Why it was written==
There are two possible reasons for the creation of the book of Zephaniah. Either way, the primary purpose of the book’s composition was to alter the behaviour (particularly religious behaviour) of the author’s contemporary Jerusalemites.{{OR|date=May 2011}}

If the book of Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, the author of the book of Zephaniah attempts to accomplish this change in behaviour through the threat of future calamity for “those who have turned back from following the Lord, / who have not sought the Lord or inquired of him” (1:6). The author conceives of a date in the future – the ‘great day of the Lord’ – when [[Tetragrammaton|the Lord]] will judge all the people of the earth. This coming judgment will affect all of the nations, including the author’s own nation of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] where God is understood to reside. The threats made against [[Jerusalem]], however, are much more specific than the oracles concerning foreign nations. This strengthened the belief that the Israelites, who understood themselves to be God’s chosen people, were even more culpable than other peoples for not living up to God’s statutes because they were to be a ‘light unto the nations’. The book concludes by extending a promise of deliverance to the remnant of [[Israel]] which remains. The fulfilment of this prophecy is commonly understood to have taken place when Judah was captured by the nation of [[Babylon]] and many of its inhabitants were exiled in an event known as the [[Babylonian captivity]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--Citation needed for the whole paragraph --&gt; 

If the book gained most of its present form in post-monarchic period, then the author likely intended to draw upon an understanding of the [[Babylonian captivity]] as a punishment from the Lord, urging his own contemporaries not to repeat the mistakes of the past. It is not known whether the religious syncretism, alluded to in chapter one (as in verse 5), was a significant issue in post-exilic [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--Citation needed for the whole paragraph --&gt; 

==Themes==
The book of Zephaniah consists of three chapters in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic Text]]. In English versions, the book is also divided into three chapters. The [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible supplies headings for the book as follows:{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

It is important to note that there are a number of different sub-divisions in use for the text with no clear consensus.{{OR||date=May 2011}}

Despite its relatively short length, the book of Zephaniah incorporates a number of common prophetic themes. Zephaniah includes one of the most vivid descriptions in the prophetic literature of God’s wrath. Yet, it is also unequivocal in its proclamation of a restoration for those who survive the ‘[[Last Judgement|Great Day of the Lord']].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The book of Zephaniah incorporates a good deal of phrases and terminology which are found in other books of the Bible. This suggests that the author of Zephaniah was familiar with and drew upon earlier Israelite religious tradition and also that later biblical writers regarded the book of Zephaniah as an authoritative (or at least respectable) work in the prophetic corpus.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The book of Zephaniah draws upon several themes from the book of [[Book of Genesis]] and reverses them. The opening verses of the book of Zephaniah are reminiscent both of the creation and of [[Noah]]’s flood. Chapter 1:2-3 declare that “I will sweep away everything / from the face of the earth says the Lord. / I will sweep away humans and animals; I will sweep away the birds of the air / and the fish of the sea.” The order of the creatures to be destroyed in Zephaniah is the opposite of the order in which they are created in Genesis 1:20-27. It is also worth noting that in both Noah’s flood and Zephaniah’s [[Last Judgement|Day of the Lord]], a ‘remnant’ survives God’s wrath.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

It is also not surprising that the book of Zephaniah bears marked similarities to the book of [[Deuteronomy]] and the Deuteronomistic history. Similarities might be expected to each of these works because the Deuteronomistic history covers an overlapping period of time and because the issues which are dealt with in the book of Zephaniah go straight to the heart of the covenant which is reaffirmed in the book of Deuteronomy before Israel enters into the [[Promised Land]] of [[Canaan]]. The first 3-4 of the [[Ten Commandments]] (or Ten Words, Decalogue) contained in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:1-22 directly concern Israel’s relationship with [[Yahweh]]. It is this integral component of the covenant between [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] and [[Israel]] which is threatened by the practices to which the author of the book of Zephaniah refers in 1:4-6. In this manner, Zephaniah invokes one of the most common themes, not only in prophetic literature, but in the whole of the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Zephaniah also draws upon the emerging idea that [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] is quite different from the regional or tribal gods of the surrounding nations. Rather, [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] is beginning to be understood as the only God and the God who rules over all nations. It was an apparently unique belief in the ancient [[Middle East]] that a god could send a foreign nation to execute that god’s judgment (as the Israelites believed [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] did with [[Babylon]]). In the book of Zephaniah, all nations are portrayed as being subject to [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]’s divine judgment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The book of Zephaniah also interacts with the prophetic tradition – both borrowing from and contributing to the corpus in terms of language and images.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The '''Book of Habakkuk''' is the eighth book of the 12 [[minor prophets]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross&quot;&gt;Cross 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is attributed to the prophet [[Habakkuk]], and was probably composed in the late 7th century BCE.  A copy of chapters 1 and 2 (of 3)  is included in the [[Habakkuk Commentary]], found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

Chapters 1-2 are a Dialog between [[Yahweh]] and the prophet. The central message, that &quot;the just shall live by his faith&quot; (2:4), plays an important role in [[Christian]] thought. It is used in the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 1:17, [[Galatians]] 3:11, and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] 10:38 as the starting point of the concept of [[faith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross&quot;/&gt;  Chapter 3 may be an independent addition, now recognized as a liturgical piece, but was possibly written by the same author as chapters 1 and 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
The prophet Habakkuk is generally believed to have written his book in the mid to late 7th century BCE, not long before the Babylonians' siege and capture of [[Jerusalem]].

===Author===
{{Main|Habakkuk}}
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
Habakkuk identifies himself as a [[prophet]] in the opening verse. Due to the liturgical nature of the book of Habakkuk, there have been some scholars who think that the author may have been a temple prophet. Temple prophets are described in [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 25:1 as using [[lyre]]s, [[harp]]s and [[cymbal]]s. Some feel that this is echoed in Habakkuk 3:19b, and that Habakkuk may have been a [[Levite]] and [[singing|singer]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber 1985:15&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no biographical information on the prophet Habakkuk; in fact less is known about him than any other writer of the Bible. The only canonical information we have comes from the book that is named for him.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow 1961:440&lt;/ref&gt;  His name comes either from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word [[wikt:חבק|חבק]] (''khavak'') meaning &quot;embrace&quot; or else from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''hambakuku'' for a kind of plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehrman 211&quot;&gt;Lehrman 1948:211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buttrick 1962:503&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although his name does not appear in any other part of the Jewish Bible, [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic tradition]] holds Habakkuk to be the Shunammite woman's son, who was restored to life by [[Elisha]] in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 4:16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehrman 211&quot;/&gt; The prophet Habakkuk is also mentioned in the tale of [[Bel and the Dragon]], part of the [[deuterocanonical]]  [[Additions to Daniel|additions]] to [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] in a late section of that book. In the superscription of the Old Greek version, Habakkuk is called the son of Joshua of the tribe of Levi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehrman 211&quot;/&gt; In this book Habakkuk is lifted by an angel to Babylon to provide Daniel with some food while he is in the lion's den.

===Historical context===
[[Image:Chaldean-empire-600BCE.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldean Empire]] around 600 [[Common era|BCE]].]]
It is unknown when Habakkuk lived and preached, but the reference to the rise and advance of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldeans]] in 1:6-11 places him in the middle to last quarter of the [[7th century BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffman 1982:61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hailey 1972:271–272&lt;/ref&gt; One possible period might be during the reign of [[Jehoiakim]], from [[609 BC|609]]-[[598 BC]]. The reasoning for this date is that during his reign that the Babylonians were growing in power. The Babylonians marched against Jerusalem in 598. Jehoiakim died while the Babylonians were marching towards Jerusalem and Jehoiakim's eight-year-old son [[Jehoiachin]] assumed the throne. Upon the Babylonians' arrival, Jehoiachin and his advisors surrendered Jerusalem after a short time.  With the transition of rulers and the young age and inexperience of Jehoiachin, they were not able to stand against Chaldean forces. There is a sense of an intimate knowledge of the Babylonian brutality in 1:12-17.

==Overview==
The book of Habakkuk is a book of Hebrew Bible (the [[Old Testament]]) and stands eighth in a section known as the 12 Minor Prophets in the Masoretic and Greek texts. It follows Nahum and precedes Zephaniah, who are considered to be his contemporaries.

The book consists of three chapters and the book is neatly divided into three different genres:

*A discussion between God and Habakkuk
*An Oracle of Woe
*A Psalm

A breakdown of the book's structure looks this way:&lt;br&gt;
I. Title (1:1) &lt;br&gt;
II. The Problem of Unpunished wickedness (1:2 – 4)&lt;br&gt;
III. God's first response (1:5 – 11)&lt;br&gt;
IV. The problem of excessive punishment (1:12 – 17)&lt;br&gt;
V. Awaiting an Answer (2:1)&lt;br&gt;
VI. God’s second response  (2:2 – 20)&lt;br&gt;
:A. A vision (2:2 -5)
::i. Announcement (2:2 -3)
::ii. Life and Death (2:4 -5)
:B. Taunting woes (2:6 – 20)
::i. The pillager (2: 6 -8)
::ii. The plotter (2:9 – 11)
::iii. The promoter of violence (2:12 -14)
::iv. The debaucher (2:15 -17)
::v. The pagan idolator (2:18 -20)
VII. Habakkuk’s Psalm (3:1 -19)&lt;br&gt;
:A. Musical notes (3:1, 19b)
:B. Petition (3:2)
:C. God’s powerful presence in history (3:3 – 15)
::i. God’s coming (3:3 -7)
::ii. God’s combat (3:8 – 15)
:D. Fear and Faith (3:16 – 19a)

==Themes==
The major theme of Habakkuk is trying to grow from a faith of perplexity and doubt to the height of absolute trust in God. Habakkuk addresses his concerns over the fact that the punishment for Judah's sins is going to be executed by what was thought to be a sinful nation in Habakkuk's eyes.

Habakkuk is unique among the prophets in that he openly questions the wisdom of God. In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action. ''&quot;1:2 Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you “Violence!” and will you not save?&quot; - World English Bible.'' 

In the middle part of Chapter 1, God explains that he will send the Chaldeans to punish his people. ''1:5 “Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you. 1:6 For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs. (World English Bible)''

One of the &quot;Eighteen Emendations to the Hebrew Scriptures&quot; appears at 1:12. (Actually there were more than eighteen.) According to the professional Jewish scribes, the Sopherim, the text of 1:12 was changed from &quot;You [God] do not die&quot; to &quot;We shall not die.&quot; The Sopherim considered it disrespectful of God to say &quot;''You'' do not die.&quot;

In the final part of the first chapter, the prophet expresses shock at God's choice of instrument for judgment. ''1:13 You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he, (World English Bible [http://www.ebible.org/web/Habakkuk.htm])'' 

In Chapter 2, he awaits God's response to his challenge. God explains that He will also judge the Chaldeans, and much more harshly. ''2:8 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it. 2:9 Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, (World English Bible [http://www.ebible.org/web/Habakkuk.htm])''

Finally, in Chapter 3, Habakkuk expresses his ultimate faith in God, even if he doesn't fully understand. 
''3:17 For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish, nor fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food; the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls: 3:18 yet I will rejoice in Yahweh. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation! (World English Bible [http://www.ebible.org/web/Habakkuk.htm])'' 

Because of the final chapter of his book, which is a poetic praise of God, it has been assumed that Habakkuk was likely a member of the Levitical choir in the Temple. Contemporary scholars point out, however, that this chapter is missing from the [[Dead sea scrolls|Dead Sea Scrolls]] and has some similarities with texts found in the [[Book of Daniel]]. They therefore suggest that it is a later interpolation which influenced the authors of Daniel, and that it is impossible to make the assumption of Habakkuk's background based on it.

==Importance==
The book is accepted as scriptual by adherents of the Jewish and Christian faiths.

===Canonicity===
[[Image:PaulT.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th century painting.]]
The Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the Twelve Prophets of the [[Hebrew Bible]], or of the &quot;[[minor prophet]]s&quot; of the Christian Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross&quot;/&gt; It appears among the texts of the [[Septuagint]].  A copy of chapters 1 and 2 (of 3)  is included in the [[Habakkuk Commentary]], found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

The second half of Habakkuk 2:4&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...but the righteous shall live by his faith.&quot; This translation is both that of the [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Habakkuk|ASV]] and that of the Jewish Publication Scoiety of America. (Lehrman 1948:219)&lt;/ref&gt; is quoted by some of the earliest [[Christian]] writers.  Although this passage is only three words in the original Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;Barber 1985:38; The [[s:he:חבקוק ניקוד|Hebrew text]] is וְצַדִּיק בֶּאֱמוּנָתוֹ יִחְיֶה .&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]] quotes this verse twice in his [[epistles]], in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:17 and again in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 3:11.  In doing so, Paul extends Habakkuk's original concept of righteous living at the present time into a future life.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1969:85&lt;/ref&gt;  The same verse is quoted in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 10:37-38, where Habakkuk's vision is tied to [[Christ]] and used to comfort the church during a period of persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Achtemeier 1993:266&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3 may be an independent addition, according to some scholars, now recognized as a liturgical piece. The first two chapters are regarded by many as the work of a cult prophet attached to the Jerusalem Temple, possibly also the author of chapter 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross&quot;/&gt;

===Cultural influence===
The Christian [[hymn]] &quot;[[commons:Image:Lord is in his holy temple.ogg|The Lord is in His Holy Temple]]&quot;, written in 1900 by [[William J. Kirkpatrick]], is based on verse 2:20.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegland 1992:685&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hymn by William Cowper &quot;Sometimes a Light Surprises&quot; quotes Hab 3:17-18.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
In the context of [[telecommunications]] and [[computing]], a device or technology is said to be '''backward''' or '''downward compatible''' if it can work with input generated by an older device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/computer/backward-compatible|title=backward compatible - Computer definition|publisher=yourdictionary.com|accessdate=2009-10-18|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kcaFJC8g|archivedate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; If products designed for the new standard can receive, read, view or play older standards or formats, then the product is said to be backward-compatible; examples of such a standard include data formats and [[Communications protocol|communication protocols]].

The reverse is [[forward compatibility]], which implies that old devices allow (or are expected to allow) data formats generated by new (or future) devices, perhaps without supporting all new features. A standard supports forward compatibility if older product versions can receive, read, view, or play the new standard.

For example, the introduction of FM stereo transmission allowed backward compatibility since new FM radio receivers could receive [[monaural]] signals generated by old transmitters. It also allowed forward compatibility, since old monaural FM radio receivers still could receive a signal from a new transmitter.

In programming languages, backward compatibility refers to the ability of a compiler for version ''N'' of the language to accept programs or data that worked under version ''N'' - 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Vzy8ap4YYW8C&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=forward+compatibility&amp;lr=&amp;hl=sv Michael Kay, ''XSLT 2.0 Programmer's Reference'', Wiley Default, 2004 ISBN 0764569090, 9780764569098]&lt;/ref&gt;  (By this definition, if previous versions (''N'' - 1, ''N'' - 2, etc.) were also backward compatible, which is often the case, then, by induction, version ''N'' will also accept input that worked under any prior version after, and including, the latest one that was not backward compatible. However, in practice, features are often [[deprecated]] and support is dropped in a later release, which is yet thought of as backward compatible.)

In other contexts, a product or a technology is said to be '''backward compatible''' when it is able to fully take the place of an older product, by inter-operating with products that were designed for the older product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCPWYFoWaMIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=compatibility&amp;hl=sv#PPA33,M1 {{cite book|title=Designing with Web Standards|author=Jeffrey Zeldman|year=2006|publisher=Peachpit Press|isbn=0321385551}}]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Request quotation|date=December 2008}}

A data format is also said to be backwards compatible with its predecessor if every message or file that is valid under the old format is also valid, and retains its meaning, under the new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/DesignGuide/compatibility.html|title=&quot;Backwards Compatibility|author=Bert Bos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Backward compatibility is a relationship between two components, rather than being an attribute of just one of them. More generally, a new component is said to be backward compatible if it provides all of the functionality of the old component.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

''Backward'' compatibility is the special case of compatibility in which the new component has a direct historical ancestral relationship with the old component. If this special relationship does not exist then it not usually spoken of as &quot;backward&quot; compatibility but is instead just &quot;compatible&quot;&amp;mdash;a consistent interface allowing [[interoperability]] between components and products that were each developed separately.

In the case of a program that creates document files, a new version of that program (&quot;v2&quot;) is said to be backward compatible with the old version of the program (&quot;v1&quot;) when it can both read and write documents that work with v1. Everything that v1 could do must also be possible with v2, including saving documents that can be read by v1 (which is something that v1 could do.)

If a newer software version cannot save files that can be read by the older version, it is not backward compatible with the older version, although it may provide an irreversible [[upgrade]] capability for the old files. This situation has often been used strategically by software vendors to force customers to purchase upgrades since, over time, the number of data files usable by an old version diminishes at a rate proportional to the number of other customers that have upgraded (assuming that all customers generate files at the same the average rate.)

Levels of compatibility vary. In software, ''[[Binary code compatibility|binary compatibility]]'' and ''[[Source code compatibility|source compatibility]]'' are distinguishable. Binary compatibility means that programs can work correctly with the new version of this library without requiring [[compiler|recompilation]]. Source compatibility requires recompilation but no changes to the source code.

Many platforms rely on [[Emulator|emulation]], the simulation of an older platform in software, to achieve backward compatibility.

==Examples==
* The [[NTSC]] color broadcast system was engineered by [[RCA]] to be backward compatible with [[black-and-white]] NTSC television sets.
* Most [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray disc drives]] are able to play standard [[CD]] and [[DVD]] discs and most [[DVD|DVD drives]] are able to play standard [[CD]]s.
* Numerous video game consoles are backward compatible and are able to play the games created for predecessor consoles:
** The [[Atari 7800]] is backward compatible with almost all [[Atari 2600]] games.
** The [[Game Boy Advance]] line (except the [[Game Boy Micro]]) is backward compatible with previous [[Game Boy line|Game Boy systems]], meaning all [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] titles are playable on this system.
** The [[Nintendo DS]] and the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] are backward compatible with all Game Boy Advance games.
** The [[Nintendo 3DS]] is backward compatible with the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo DSi]] software.
** The [[PlayStation 2]] is backward compatible with most of the original [[PlayStation]] library. Additionally, the initial [[PlayStation 3]] model is backward compatible with most PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games. This is provided by the inclusion of the original [[Emotion Engine]] chip that is built inside the PS2. However, subsequent models removed this and the &quot;Graphics Synthesizer&quot; GPU, thus removing support for PS2 titles, but still able to play most PSX games.
** The [[Xbox 360]] is backward compatible with some [[Xbox]] games via software emulation.
** The [[Wii]] is backward compatible with all games from the previous [[Nintendo]] system, the [[Nintendo GameCube]], due to it being based on the [[PowerPC]], the same base as the latter.
* [[Microsoft Windows]] contains application compatibility [[shim (computing)|shims]] to make the platform compatible with most software from earlier 32-bit and 16-bit versions (e.g. ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' (circa 1991, designed for [[Windows 3.0]]) running on Windows Vista).
* [[Microsoft Word]] 2000 was backward compatible with Word 97 because it could read and write files in Word 97 format, with the understanding that features unique to Word 2000 would not appear in Word 97.
* Several computer [[operating system]]s have various methods of running software originally designed for older versions or other OSs:
** [[Windows NT]] and successors have various subsystems to run legacy applications. [[MS-DOS]] and [[Win16]] subsystems (only on i386) can run some applications for those platforms, and it has an [[OS/2]] subsystem for running CLI OS/2 applications.
** With the introduction of Windows 7 (Business, Ultimate, or Enterprise editions), Windows XP Mode enables full compatibility with older programs supported under Windows XP via Microsoft Virtual PC.
* The modern [[Nikon F Mount]] SLR camera lenses from the late 1970s - present (its design dates back to 1959) can function on the newer Nikon DSLR cameras with some limitations.
* [[PCI Express]] 2.0 is backward compatible with PCI Express 1.1.
* The [[IBM 7080]] [[transistor]]ized computer was backward compatible with all models of the [[IBM 705]] [[vacuum tube]] computer.

'''Bacterial conjugation''' is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells.&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book | author = Holmes RK, Jobling MG | title = Genetics: Conjugation.

Bacterial conjugation is often incorrectly regarded as the [[bacteria]]l equivalent of [[sexual reproduction]] or [[mating]] since it involves the exchange of genetic material. During conjugation the ''donor'' cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a [[plasmid]] or [[transposon]].&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages = 60–4 | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0838585299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Russi&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/pla|author= Russi et al.|year=2008|chapter=Molecular Machinery for DNA Translocation in Bacterial Conjugation|title=Plasmids: Current Research and Future Trends|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/pla ISBN 978-1-904455-35-6]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the ''recipient'' cell does not already contain a similar element.

The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient. Benefits may include [[antibiotic resistance]], [[xenobiotic]] tolerance or the ability to use new [[metabolites]].&lt;ref name=Baron2&gt;{{cite book | author = Holmes RK, Jobling MG | title = Genetics: Exchange of Genetic Information. ''in:'' Baron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=conjugation&amp;rid=mmed.section.468 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial [[endosymbionts]]. Other elements, however, may be viewed as bacterial [[parasitism|parasites]] and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread.

== Mechanism ==
[[image:Conjugation.svg|right|thumb|350px|Schematic drawing of bacterial conjugation. '''

'''Conjugation diagram'''
'''1-''' Donor cell produces [[pilus]]. '''2-''' Pilus attaches to recipient cell and brings the two cells together. '''3-''' The mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of DNA is then transferred to the recipient cell. '''4-''' Both cells synthesize a complementary strand to produce a double stranded circular plasmid and also reproduce pili; both cells are now viable donors.]]

The [[prototypical]] conjugative plasmid is the '''[[F-plasmid]]''', or F-factor.&lt;ref name=Baron /&gt; The F-plasmid is an [[episome]] (a plasmid that can integrate itself into the bacterial [[chromosome]] by [[Homologous_recombination#In_bacteria|homologous recombination]]) with a length of about 100 [[kilo-base pair|kb]]. It carries its own [[origin of replication]], the ''oriV'', and an origin of transfer, or ''oriT''.&lt;ref name=Sherris /&gt; There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium, either free or integrated, and bacterium that possess a copy are called ''F-positive'' or ''F-plus'' (denoted F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Cells that lack F plasmids are called ''F-negative'' or ''F-minus'' (F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and as such can function as recipient cells.

Among other genetic information the F-plasmid carries a ''tra'' and ''trb'' [[locus (genetics)|locus]], which together are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 [[gene]]s. The ''tra'' locus includes the ''pilin'' gene and regulatory genes, which together form [[pilus|pili]] on the cell surface.  The locus also includes the genes for the [[protein]]s that attach themselves to the surface of F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria and initiate conjugation. Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are not the structures through which DNA exchange occurs. This has been shown in experiments where the pilus are allowed to make contact, but then are denatured with SDS and yet DNA transformation still proceeds. Several proteins coded for in the ''tra'' or ''trb'' locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme, located at the base of the pilus, initiates membrane fusion.

When conjugation is initiated by a signal the '''relaxase''' enzyme creates a [[nick (DNA)|nick]] in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the ''oriT''.  Relaxase may work alone or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a '''relaxosome'''. In the F-plasmid system the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI, TraY, TraM and the integrated host factor IHF. The nicked strand, or ''T-strand'', is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5'-terminus to 3'-terminus direction. The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action (vegetative replication beginning at the ''oriV'') or in concert with conjugation (conjugative replication similar to the [[rolling circle]] replication of [[lambda phage]]). Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur. A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lujan SA, Guogas LM, Ragonese H, Matson SW, Redinbo MR | title = Disrupting antibiotic resistance propagation by inhibiting the conjugative DNA relaxase | journal = PNAS | year = 2007 | volume = 104 | pages = 12282–7 |pmc=1916486 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0702760104 | jstor=25436291 | issue = 30 | pmid=17630285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the F-plasmid that is transferred has previously been integrated into the donor’s genome some of the donor’s chromosomal DNA may also be transferred with the plasmid DNA.&lt;ref name=Griffiths_1999 /&gt; The amount of chromosomal DNA that is transferred depends on how long the two conjugating bacteria remain in contact.  In common laboratory strains of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' the transfer of the entire bacterial chromosome takes about 100 minutes. The transferred DNA can then be integrated into the recipient genome via homologous recombination.

A cell culture that contains in its population cells with non-integrated F-plasmids usually also contains a few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids. It is these cells that are responsible for the low-frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures. Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F-plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture. Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called '''[[Hfr cell|Hfr]]''' ('''h'''igh '''f'''requency of '''r'''ecombination). The ''E. coli'' [[genome]] was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various Hfr cells in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes (initially using a Waring blender).  The genes that were transferred were then investigated.

==Inter-kingdom transfer==
The [[diazotroph|nitrogen fixing]] ''[[Rhizobia]]'' are an interesting case of inter-[[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] conjugation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pan SQ, Jin S, Boulton MI, Hawes M, Gordon MP, Nester EW |title=An Agrobacterium virulence factor encoded by a Ti plasmid gene or a chromosomal gene is required for T-DNA transfer into plants |journal=Mol. Microbiol. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=259–69 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7494475 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.mmi_17020259.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' and the root-tumor inducing (Ri) plasmid of ''A. rhizogenes'' contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells.  The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into [[opines|opine]]-producing factories.  Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy. Infected cells form [[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|crown gall]] or [[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|root tumors]], respectively. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus [[endosymbiont]]s of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids can also be transferred between bacteria using a system (the ''tra'', or transfer, operon) that is different and independent of the system used for inter-kingdom transfer (the ''vir'', or [[virulence]], operon). Such transfers create virulent strains from previously avirulent strains.

== Genetic Engineering Applications ==
Conjugation is a convenient means for [[genetic engineering|transferring genetic material]] to a variety of targets. In laboratories successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heinemann JA, Sprague GF |title=Bacterial conjugative plasmids mobilize DNA transfer between bacteria and yeast |journal=Nature |volume=340 |issue=6230 |pages=205–9 |year=1989 |month=July |pmid=2666856 |doi=10.1038/340205a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plants, mammalian cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kunik T, Tzfira T, Kapulnik Y, Gafni Y, Dingwall C, Citovsky V |title=Genetic transformation of HeLa cells by Agrobacterium |journal=Proc.

In plant engineering, ''Agrobacterium''-like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV). While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[dicot]]s. ''Agrobacterium''-like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots, but [[monocot]] recipients are not uncommon.

The '''Blue Crane''' (''Anthropoides paradiseus''), also known as the '''Stanley Crane''' and the '''Paradise Crane''', is the national bird of [[South Africa]]. It is a tall, ground-dwelling bird, but is fairly small by the standards of the [[crane (bird)|crane]] family. It is 100–120&amp;nbsp;cm (40–47&amp;nbsp;in) tall and weighs from 4 to 6.2&amp;nbsp;kg (8.8-13.6&amp;nbsp;lbs). This crane is pale blue-gray in colour with a white crown, a pink [[beak|bill]], and long, dark gray wingtip [[feather]]s which trail to the ground.

== Habitat ==

Blue Cranes are birds of the dry, grassy uplands which feed on [[seed]]s and insects and spend little time in [[wetland]]s. They are altitudinal migrants, generally nesting in the upper grasslands and moving down to lower altitudes for winter. Many occupy agricultural areas.

Of the 15 species of crane, the Blue Crane has the most restricted distribution of all.

== Decline ==

While it remains common in parts of its historic range, and approx. 25,700 individuals remain, it began a sudden population decline from around [[1980]] and is now classified as vulnerable. 

In the last two decades, the Blue Crane has largely disappeared from the [[Eastern Cape Province|Eastern Cape]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Swaziland]]. The population in the northern [[Free State Province|Free State]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Limpopo Province|Limpopo]], [[Gauteng Province|Gauteng]], [[Mpumalanga Province|Mpumalanga]] and [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]] has declined by up to 90%. The majority of the remaining population is in eastern and southern South Africa, with a small and separate population in the [[Etosha Pan]] of northern [[Namibia]]. Occasionally, isolated breeding pairs are found in five neighboring countries.

The primary causes of the sudden decline of the Blue Crane are human population growth, the conversion of grasslands into commercial tree plantations, and poisoning: deliberate (to protect crops) or accidental (baits intended for other species, and as a side-effect of [[crop dusting]]). 

The South African government has stepped up legal protection for the Blue Crane. Other conservation measures are focusing on research, habitat management, education, and recruiting the help of private landowners.

== Cultural references ==

The Blue Crane is a bird very special to the [[amaXhosa]], who call it indwe. When a man distinguished himself by deeds of valour, or any form of meritorious conduct, he was often decorated by a chief by being presented with the feathers of this bird. After a battle, the chief would organise a ceremony called ukundzabela – a ceremony for the heroes, at which feathers would be presented. Men so honoured – they wore the feathers sticking out of their hair – were known as men of ugaba (trouble) - the implication being that if trouble arose, these men would reinstate peace and order.

The Blue Crane is one of the species to which the ''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds'' ([[AEWA]]) applies.

{{History of Afghanistan}}
'''Babrak Karmal''' (6 January 1929 – 1 or 3 December 1996) was the third President of [[Afghanistan]] (1979–1986) during the period of the communist [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. He is the best known{{cn|date=May 2011}} of the [[Marxist]] leadership.

Having been restored to power with the support of the [[Soviet Union]], he was unable to consolidate his power and, in 1986, he was replaced by Dr. [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. He left [[Afghanistan]] for [[Moscow]], where he died in 1996.

==Early years==
The son of an [[Afghan National Army|army]] general and governor (Muhammad Hussein Hashimi), although born into a wealthy family in the village of Kamari (east of [[Kabul]]), Babrak Karmal lived in hardship following the death of his mother. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was [[Tajik people|Tajik]] who represented himself as a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] but others claim that he descended from [[Hindu]] ancestors of [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982 |last1=Kakar |first1=M. Hassan |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=|isbn=0520208935|page=66|pages=392|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an indifferent student in high school and in the law school of [[Kabul University]], quickly gained a reputation as an orator and activist in the university’s student union in 1951. He became involved in Marxist political activities while a student at [[Kabul University]], and was imprisoned for five years as a result.

In prison, Karmal was befriended by a fellow inmate, [[Mir Akbar Khyber]]. A third inmate, Mier Mohammad Siddiq Farhang, initiated both to pro-Moscow leftist views. After graduation he entered the Ministry of Planning, keeping in close touch with those who had special knowledge on communism, among them Mier Mohammad Siddiq Farhang and Ali Mohammad Zahma, a professor at Kabul University.

==Political career==
On 1 January 1965 the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) was founded in Kabul, with Karmal serving as one of its 28 founding members in its founding congress. Karmal was appointed its Secretary. As a result, he was elected and served in the quasi-democratic National Assembly of Afghanistan from 1965 until 1973 during the constitutional monarchy of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Zahir Shah]]. Karmal is known for his revolutionary and open speeches in the parliament against the ruling classes. In most of his parliamentary speeches, Karmal urged the people of Afghanistan to unite and stand up against the ruling classes and fight the status quo. Karmal and a few of his other comrades in the National Assembly, represented the only leftist group at the time.

In 1967, when the party split into the [[Khalq]] and the [[Parcham]] factions, Karmal became the leader of the more moderate Parcham faction. When [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] overthrew the [[monarchy]] and instituted the Republic, Karmal was asked by President Daoud to share power with him. Karmal replied that he needed to consult his with comrades on this issue and inform Daoud later. However, he never returned and did not serve in Daoud's government, though some of the people who did serve eventually assumed important positions in Karmal's government.

The factions reunited in 1977, and in April 1978 seized control of Afghanistan through a military coup. Karmal was initially Deputy Prime Minister but, following the rise of the rival Khalq faction, he and other important members of the Parcham faction such as Mohammed Najibullah, Noor Ahmad Noor, [[Anahita Ratebzad]], and Mahmood Baryalai, were essentially exiled by being appointed ambassadors to other countries, while others, such as [[Sultan Ali Keshtmand]], were put in jail.

Note may be taken of the fact that Karmal and his Parcham faction, arguing that the country was not yet ready for the socialist transformation of society, opposed any move that would result in the seizure of state power by the PDPA and did not support the military coup that resulted in the overthrow of Daoud's government. Keshtmand, one of the founding members of PDPA, emphasized this in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Keshtmand, Sultan Ali (2002) ''Yaad daashthaaye Syaasi wa Rooyidaadhaaye Taarikhi'' (''Political Notes and Historical Events'') unknown publication place, unknown publisher, unknown ISBN ; [http://keshtmand.org/ http://keshtmand.org/] site not found 20 January 2008&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|[Publication information needed]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the initiative of the coup was taken by Hafizullah Amin himself without the knowledge of the top PDPA leadership. The &quot;order&quot; for the launching of the coup against the Daoud regime was delivered by Amin's son to Amin's military group in the army.

The PDPA attempted to modernize the country in line with socialist programs, but there was major unrest. In December 1979 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and Soviet commandos killed the then leader [[Hafizullah Amin]]. The Soviets brought Karmal back to be President of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Babrak Karmal, exiled leader of the Parcham faction of the PDPA was installed by the Soviets as Afghanistan's new head of government.

==President of the Republic==

This redesigned flag was a departure from the red flags of the previous two years,reflecting a more &quot;Islamic&quot; and popular design and restoring the historical colors that were common in flags between 1928 and 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=Borjian|first=Habib|editor-last=Yarshater|editor-first=Ehsan|editor-link=Ehsan Yarshater|contribution=Flags of Afghanistan|contribution-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v10f1/v10f103b.html|year=2001}}, retrieved on 9 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In his first radio broadcasts (Listen to the radio broadcast at http://www.afghanland.com/history/karmal.html) Karmal gave hopeful promises. He said that henceforth there would be no [[Execution (legal)|executions]] and that a new [[constitution]] would be drawn up providing for the [[Democracy|democratic]] election of national and local assemblies. He also promised that political parties would function freely and that both personal property and individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] would be safeguarded. In particular, he stressed that soon a government representing a united national front would be set up and that it would not pursue socialism.

He managed to fulfill some of his promises: the release of some political prisoners; the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]; the change of the red, Soviet-style banner of the [[Khalq]] period to the more orthodox one of black, red, and green; the granting of concessions to religious leaders; and the conditional restoration of confiscated property.

However, from the beginning, his government did not enjoy international support. The [[United Nations]] General Assembly voted by 104 to 18 with 18 abstentions for a resolution which &quot;strongly deplored&quot; the &quot;recent armed intervention&quot; in [[Afghanistan]] and called for the &quot;total withdrawal of foreign troops&quot; from the country.

There were also immediate problems within the party. Karmal was the chosen man of the [[Kremlin]], and no one within the party could openly oppose him. No attempt was made to televise the process by which the official party and the Revolutionary Council elected him head of the party and of the state.

Karmal’s poor performance in interviews with foreign journalists also failed to help his public image. In the first and last televised interview of his life, held before a large number of foreign and Afghan journalists after he was raised to power, Karmal divided the journalists on the basis of the [[Cold War]] line distinguishing between the Western bloc and the socialist bloc countries.

Thus, the civil war in Afghanistan started. This was a different type of war, however, since it involved guerrilla warfare and a war of attrition between the PDPA-Communist controlled regime and the [[Mujahideen]]; it cost both sides a great deal. Many Afghans, perhaps as many as five million, or one-quarter of the country's population, fled to [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] where they organized into guerrilla groups to strike Soviet and government forces inside Afghanistan.

Others remained in Afghanistan and also formed fighting groups. These various groups were supplied with funds to purchase arms, principally from the [[United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Egypt]].

==Fall from power==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Karmal01.jpg|thumb|right|President Karmal with Afghan troops in the frontline. The Afghan Army and Airforce became powerful tools against the insurgency.]] --&gt;

The regime ruled only the city of Kabul, the provincial capitals, and those strategic areas where the Soviets and the Afghan Military had stationed military contingents and militia units, which were mainly in the north of the country. Despite high casualties on both sides, pressure continued to mount on the [[Soviet Union]], especially after the [[United States]] brought in [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] [[anti-aircraft]] missiles which severely reduced the effectiveness of Soviet air cover.

[[Moscow]] came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal’s inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], then General Secretary of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], said, &quot;The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.&quot;

Additionally, some Afghan troops who had fought for the Communist Government began to defect. In May 1986 he was replaced as party leader by [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. Despite his failures as a leader, in order to prevent a power struggle or revealing the decaying state of Afghan politics (more specifically, that the leaders were &quot;puppets&quot;), he was not killed like his predecessor rather, in November 1986, under increasing pressure from Moscow, he stepped down from the presidency saying that he had heart trouble.&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit&gt;{{Citation|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Babrak Karmal, Afghanistan's Ex-President, Dies at 67|author=Eric Pace|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/06/world/babrak-karmal-afghanistan-s-ex-president-dies-at-67.html|date=6 December 1996|accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then moved to Moscow, reportedly for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=WPostObit&gt;{{Citation|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 December 1996 Final Edition|title=Ex-Afghan Communist Leader Babrak Karmal Dies at Age 67|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/10491977.html?dids=10491977:10491977&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=CITE:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Dec+6,+1996&amp;author=&amp;desc=Ex-Afghan+Communist+Leader+Babrak+Karmal+Dies+at+Age+67|accessdate=9 June 2009}}.

He eventually died in Moscow in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/afghanistan/story/2004/12/041220_aa_mdanesh.shtml BBC Persian] Interviews with Babrak Karmal&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In early December 1996, Karmal died in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]]. The date of his death was reported by some sources as 1 December&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit/&gt; and by others as December 3.&lt;ref name=WPostObit/&gt; On 5 December about 200 members of the Afghan community in Moscow attended a memorial service at the Hospital. Most of those in attendance had served in Karmal's Afghan government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Karmal's body was flown the following day from Moscow to [[Termez]], a city in Uzbekistan that borders Afghanistan. From there it was carried in an ambulance via the &quot;[[Friendship Bridge]]&quot; to [[Hayratan]], the border city on the Afghan side near Termez. Nearly a thousand people from different parts of Afghanistan and from different walks of life were waiting in a very long line to welcome Karmal's body back to Afghanistan. His body was first taken to Hayratan General Hospital where it was put on display for hundreds of people who came to pay their last respects to the man who once was their President. Karmal's body was buried in the Hayratan common graveyard beside the grave of his life-long comrade Imtiaz Hassan, who had earlier died in Moscow and was buried in the Hayratan Graveyard. Films of Karmal's funeral and burial are available.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

When the [[Taliban]] captured Hayratan for a second time in August 1998, Babrak Karmal's body was exhumed from his grave but was soon re-buried in the same grave in presence of some residents (one of whom was a loyal member of Karmal's Parcham faction of the PDPA) of Hayratan contrary to the false belief that his body was thrown into Amu Darya. After the Taliban re-buried Babrak Karmal, some of his comrades residing in Hayratan city went to his grave, opened it and made sure he was there, and then closed it again. Pictures are available.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

'''Buddhist philosophy''' deals extensively with problems in [[metaphysics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], and [[epistemology]].

Some scholars assert that early Buddhist philosophy did not engage in [[ontology|ontological]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation, but was based instead on [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence gained by the sense organs (''[[ayatana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha is said to have assumed an unsympathetic attitude toward speculative thought in general.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Skirbekk, Nils Gilje, ''A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century.'' 7th edition published by Routledge, 2001, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; A basic idea of the Buddha is that the world must be thought of in procedural terms, not in terms of things or substances.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Skirbekk, Nils Gilje, ''A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century.'' 7th edition published by Routledge, 2001, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha advised viewing reality as consisting of [[dependent origination|dependently originated]] [[phenomena]]; Buddhists view this approach to experience as avoiding the two extremes of [[reification (fallacy)|reification]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Buddhist scholars have addressed ontological and metaphysical issues subsequently.

Particular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different [[schools of Buddhism]]. While theory for its own sake is not valued in Buddhism, theory pursued in the interest of enlightenment is consistent with Buddhist values and ethics.

== Philosophy==
=== Historical context ===

Early Buddhism displays a strong streak of skepticism; the Buddha cautioned his followers to stay aloof from intellectual disputation for its own sake, saying that this is fruitless and distracts from the practices leading to enlightenment. However, the Buddha's doctrine did have an important philosophical component: it negated the major claims of rival positions while building upon them at a new philosophical and religious level.

In a skeptical vein, he asserted the [[anatta|insubstantiality of the ego]], and in doing so countered those [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] sages who sought knowledge of an unchanging [[Atman (Hinduism)|ultimate self]]. The Buddha created a new position in opposition to their theories, and held that attachment to a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering and the main obstacle to liberation. The same skeptical approach negates the existence of any high god or essential substance, and undercuts both traditional and iconoclastic spiritual goals. He broke new ground by going on to explain the source for the apparent ego: it is merely the result of the aggregates (''[[skandhas]]'') which make up experience.

In this breaking down into constituent elements, the Buddha was heir to earlier element philosophies which had sought to characterize existing things as made up of a set of basic elements. The Buddha, however, eliminated mythological rhetoric, systematized world components into five groups, and used this approach not to characterize a substantial object, but to explain a delusion. He coordinated material components with psychological ones. The Buddha criticized the Brahmins' theories of an [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] as yet another [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], instead giving a [[Noble Eightfold Path|path]] to self-perfection as a means of transcending the world of [[Namarupa|name and form]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, page 202. [http://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA202,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemology ===
Decisive in distinguishing Buddhism from what is commonly called [[Hinduism]] is the issue of [[epistemology|epistemological]] justification. All schools of [[Indian logic]] recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge, or ''[[pramana|pramāṇa]]'' – Buddhism recognizes a set that is smaller than the others'. All accept [[perception]] and inference, for example, but for some schools of Hinduism and Buddhism the received textual tradition is an epistemological category equal to perception and inference (although this is not necessarily true for some other schools).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Theravada|Theravāda]] commentary, ascribed to [[Dhammapala]], on the ''[[Nettipakarana|Nettipakaraṇa]]'', says (Pāli ''pamāṇa'' is equivalent to Sanskrit ''pramāṇa''): &quot;''na hi pāḷito aññaṃ pamāṇataraṃ atthi'' (quoted in [[Pali Text Society]] edition of the Nettipakaraṇa, 1902, page XI) which Nanamoli translates as: &quot;for there is no other criterion beyond a text&quot; (''The Guide'', Pali Text Society, 1962, page xi).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the Hindu schools, if a claim was made that could not be substantiated by appeal to the textual canon, it would be considered as ridiculous as a claim that the sky was green and, conversely, a claim which could not be substantiated via conventional means might still be justified through textual reference, differentiating this from the epistemology of [[scientific method|hard science]].

Some schools of Buddhism, on the other hand, rejected an inflexible reverence of accepted doctrine. As the Buddha said, according to the canonical scriptures:&lt;ref&gt;Kalama Sutta, [[Anguttara Nikaya]] III.65, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to welfare &amp; to happiness' — then you should enter &amp; remain in them.}}

Early Buddhist philosophers and exegetes of one particular [[Early Buddhist schools|early school]] (as opposed to [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]), the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādins]], created a [[Pluralism (philosophy of mind)|pluralist]] metaphysical and phenomenological system, in which all experiences of people, things and events can be broken down into smaller and smaller perceptual or perceptual-[[ontology|ontological]] units called &quot;''[[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]]''&quot;. Other schools incorporated some parts of this theory and criticized others. The [[Sautrantika|Sautrāntikas]], another early school, and the [[Theravada|Theravādins]], now the only modern survivor of the early Buddhist schools, criticized the [[Philosophical realism|realist]] standpoint of the Sarvāstivādins.

The Mahāyānist [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], one of the most influential Buddhist thinkers, promoted classical Buddhist emphasis on [[phenomena]] and attacked Sarvāstivāda realism and Sautrāntika [[nominalism]] in his magnum opus, ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way]]'' (''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speculation versus direct experience====
According to the [[Pali Canon|scriptures]], during his lifetime the Buddha remained silent when asked several [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[Fourteen unanswerable questions|questions]]. These regarded issues such as whether the universe is eternal or non-eternal (or whether it is finite or infinite), the unity or separation of the body and the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]], the complete inexistence of a person after Nirvana and death, and others. One explanation for this silence is that such questions distract from activity that is practical to realizing [[bodhi|enlightenment]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 72 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997)]. For further discussion of the context in which these statements was made, see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html Thanissaro (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt; and bring about the danger of substituting the experience of liberation by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Experience is ... the path most elaborated in early Buddhism. The doctrine on the other hand was kept low. The Buddha avoided doctrinal formulations concerning the final reality as much as possible in order to prevent his followers from resting content with minor achievements on the path in which the absence of the final experience could be substituted by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith, a situation which sometimes occurs, in both varieties, in the context of [[Hindu]] systems of doctrine&quot;, Karel Werner, ''Mysticism and Indian Spirituality.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic''. Curzon Press, 1989: p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that both affirmative and negative positions regarding these questions are based on attachment to and misunderstanding of the [[skandhas|aggregates]] and senses. That is, when one sees these things for what they are, the idea of forming positions on such metaphysical questions simply does not occur to one.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html &quot;Introduction to the Avyakata Samyutta&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another closely related explanation is that reality is devoid of designations, or empty, and therefore language itself is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagao&quot;&gt;Gadjin M. Nagao, ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Buddha's silence does not indicate [[misology]] or disdain for philosophy. Rather, it indicates that he viewed these questions as not leading to true knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagao&quot;/&gt; Dependent arising provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind. This informs and supports the Buddhist approach to liberation via the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Buddha of the earliest Buddhists texts describes Dharma (in the sense of &quot;truth&quot;) as &quot;beyond reasoning&quot; or &quot;transcending logic&quot;, in the sense that reasoning is a subjectively introduced aspect of the way humans perceive things, and the conceptual framework which underpins it is a part of the cognitive process, rather than a feature of things as they really are. Being &quot;beyond reasoning&quot; means in this context penetrating the nature of reasoning from the inside, and removing the causes for experiencing any future stress as a result of it, rather than functioning outside of the system as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism''. Routledge, 2000, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Buddhists agree that, to a greater or lesser extent, words are inadequate to describe the goal of the Buddhist path, but concerning the usefulness of words in the path itself, schools differ radically.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy East and West''. Vol. 26, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Mahayana ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]'', the Buddha insists that while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from liberation and the [[Buddha-nature]]. The Tibetan [[tantra]] entitled the &quot;All-Creating King&quot; (''[[Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra]]'') also emphasizes how Buddhist truth lies beyond the range of discursive/verbal thought and is ultimately mysterious. Samantabhadra, states there: &quot;The mind of perfect purity ... is beyond thinking and inexplicable...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sovereign All-Creating Mind'' tr. by E. K. Neumaier-Dargyay, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Also later, the famous Indian Buddhist practitioner and teacher, [[mahasiddha]] [[Tilopa]] discouraged any intellectual activity in his [[Tilopa#Six Words of Advice|six words of advice]].

Professor C. D. Sebastian describes the nature of enlightenment according to one Mahayana text:&lt;ref&gt;Professor C. D. Sebastian, ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism'', Sri Satguru Publications, Delhi, 2005, p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Bodhi'' is the final goal of a [[Bodhisattva]]'s career and it is indicated by such words as ''buddha-jnana'' (knowledge of Buddha), ''sarvjnata'' (omniscience), ''sarvakarajnata'' (the quality of knowing things as they are), ... and ''acintyam jnanam'' (inconceivable knowledge) ... ''Bodhi'' is pure universal and immediate knowledge, which extends over all time, all universes, all beings and elements, conditioned and unconditioned. It is absolute and identical with Reality and thus it is ''[[Tathata]].'' ''Bodhi'' is immaculate and non-conceptual, and it, being not an outer object, cannot be understood by discursive thought. It has neither beginning, nor middle nor end and it is indivisbile. It is non-dual (''advayam'')... The only possible way to comprehend it is through ''[[samadhi]]'' by the yogin}}

The early texts, in contrast, contain explicit repudiations of attributing [[omniscience]] to the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. K. Warder]], ''Indian Buddhism.'' Third edition published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000, pages 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. Kalupahana]], ''A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities.'' University of Hawaii Press, 1992, page 43: [http://books.google.com/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=inauthor:Kalupahana+omniscience].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the non-duality ascribed to the nature of enlightenment in the early texts is not ontological.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. 2007, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahayana often adopts a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic concept of truth]]:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, 1989, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; doctrines are &quot;true&quot; in the sense of being spiritually beneficial. In modern [[Chinese Buddhism]], all doctrinal traditions are regarded as equally valid.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, ''Practice of Chinese Buddhism'', Harvard, 1967, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada promotes the concept of [[vibhajjavada]] (Pāli, literally &quot;Teaching of Analysis&quot;) to non-Buddhists. This doctrine says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. As the Buddha said according to the canonical scriptures:&lt;ref&gt;''Kalama Sutta'', [[Anguttara Nikaya]] III.65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Do not accept anything by mere tradition ... Do not accept anything just because it accords with your scriptures ... Do not accept anything merely because it agrees with your pre-conceived notions ... But when you know for yourselves—these things are moral, these things are blameless, these things are praised by the wise, these things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to well-being and happiness—then do you live acting accordingly.}}

====Dependent origination====
{{main|Dependent origination}}
What some consider the original positive Buddhist contribution to the field of metaphysics is [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]] (''pratītyasamutpāda''). It states that events are not [[Predestination|predetermined]], nor are they [[random]], and it rejects notions of direct causation, which are necessarily undergirded by a substantialist metaphysics. Instead, it posits the arising of events under certain conditions which are inextricable, such that the processes in question at no time, are considered to be entities.

Dependent origination goes on to posit that certain specific events, concepts, or realities are always dependent on other specific things. Craving, for example, is always dependent on, and caused by, emotion. Emotion is always dependent on contact with our surroundings. This chain of causation purports to show that the cessation of decay, death, and sorrow is indirectly dependent on the cessation of craving.

[[Nagarjuna|{{nagarjuna}}]] asserted a direct connection between, even identity of, dependent origination, selflessness (''anatta''), and emptiness (''śūnyatā''). He pointed out that implicit in the early Buddhist concept of dependent origination is the lack of any substantial being (''anatta'') underlying the participants in origination, so that they have no independent existence, a state identified as emptiness (''śūnyatā''), or emptiness of a nature or essence (''svabhāva'').

===Interpenetration===
The doctrine of &quot;interpenetration&quot; or &quot;coalescence&quot; (Wylie: ''zung-'jug''; Sanskrit: ''yuganaddha''; Chinese: 通達)&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/neville.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/zung_'jug&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'', a Mahāyāna scripture, and its associated schools. It holds that all phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[dharmas]]'') are intimately connected (and mutually arising). Two images are used to convey this idea. The first is known as [[Indra's net]]. The net is set with jewels which have the extraordinary property that they reflect all of the other jewels. The second image is that of the world text. This image portrays the world as consisting of an enormous text which is as large as the universe itself. The words of the text are composed of the phenomena that make up the world. However, every atom of the world contains the whole text within it. It is the work of a Buddha to let out the text so that beings can be liberated from suffering. The  doctrine of interpenetration influenced the Japanese monk [[Kūkai]], who founded the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] school of Buddhism. It is iconographically represented by ''[[yab-yum]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}
Interpenetration and [[Essence-Function|essence-function]] are mutually informing in the East Asian Buddhist traditions, especially the [[Korean Buddhist]] tradition.

===Ethics===
{{main|Buddhist ethics}}

Although there are many ethical tenets in Buddhism that differ depending on whether one is a monk or a layman, and depending on individual schools, the Buddhist system of ethics can be summed up in the [[Eightfold Path|eightfold path]].

{{quote|And this, monks, is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering -- precisely this Noble Eightfold Path – right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samyutta Nikaya]] LVI.11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The purpose of living an ethical life is to escape the suffering inherent in [[samsara]]. Skillful actions condition the mind in a positive way and lead to future happiness, while the opposite is true for unskillful actions. Ethical discipline also provides the mental stability and freedom to embark upon mental cultivation via [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]].

== History==
=== Early development ===
Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught something of the kind:&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, ''Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2002, page 34 and table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[three marks of existence]]
* the [[Skandha|five aggregates]]
* [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent arising]]
* [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]
* the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]]
* the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold path]]
* [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]]

Some scholars disagree, and have proposed many other theories.&lt;ref&gt;Skorupski, ''Buddhist Forum'', vol I, Heritage, Delhi/SOAS, London, 1990, page 5; ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'', vol 21 (1998), part 1, pages 4, 11
&lt;/ref&gt; According to such scholars, there was something they variously call &quot;[[earliest Buddhism]]&quot;, &quot;original Buddhism&quot; or &quot;pre-canonical Buddhism&quot;. The Buddha rejected certain precepts of [[Indian philosophy]] that were prominent during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Thanissaro Bhikkhu's commentary on the Mulapariyaya Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, the philosophical outlook of earliest Buddhism was primarily negative, in the sense that it focused on what doctrines to ''reject'' more than on what doctrines to ''accept''. This dimension is also found in the [[Madhyamaka]] school. It includes critical rejections of all [[View (Buddhism)|views]], which is a form of philosophy, but it is reluctant to posit its own.

Only knowledge that is useful in achieving [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] is valued. According to this theory, the cycle of philosophical upheavals that in part drove the diversification of Buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once Buddhists began attempting to make explicit the implicit philosophy of the Buddha and the early suttas. Other scholars reject this theory. After the death of the Buddha, attempts were made to gather his teachings and transmit them in a commonly agreed form, first orally, then also in writing (the ''[[Tripitaka|Tripiṭaka]]'').

===Later developments===
The main Buddhist philosophical schools are the ''[[Abhidharma]]'' schools, (particularly [[Theravada|Theravāda]] and [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]]), and the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] schools
(the latter including the [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], and [[Tiantai]] schools).

====Cataphatic presentations====
The ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgathagarbha]]'' (or [[Buddha-nature]]) doctrine of some schools of [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahāyāna Buddhism]], the [[Theravada|Theravāda]] doctrine of ''[[bhavanga|bhavaṅga]]'', and the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] [[store consciousness]] were all identified at some point with the [[luminous mind]] of the Nikāyas.

The ''tathāgatagarbha'' sutras, in a departure from mainstream Buddhist language, insist that the true self lies at the very heart of the Buddha himself and of [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]], as well as being concealed within the mass of mental and moral contaminants that blight all beings. Such doctrines saw a shift from a largely apophatic (negative) philosophical trend within Buddhism to a decidedly more [[cataphatic]] (positive) modus. The ''tathāgatagarbha'' does not, according to some scholars, represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language expression of [[sunyata|emptiness]] and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this interpretation, the intention of the teaching of ''tathāgatagarbha'' is [[soteriology|soteriological]] rather than theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Heng-Ching Shih, &quot;The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' –
A Positive Expression Of 'Sunyata.'&quot; http://zencomp.com/greatwisdom/ebud/ebdha191.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nanzan-u.ac.jp&quot;&gt;Sallie B. King, ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'', http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf )&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;self&quot; (''atman'') is used in a way idiosyncratic to these sutras; the &quot;true self&quot; is described as the perfection of the wisdom of [[anatta|not-self]] in the ''Buddha-Nature Treatise'', for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanzan-u.ac.jp&quot; /&gt; Language that had previously been used by essentialist non-Buddhist philosophers was now adopted, with new definitions, by Buddhists to promote orthodox teachings.

Prior to the period of these scriptures, Mahāyāna [[metaphysics]] had been dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]] in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the ''tathāgatagarbha'' genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King, ''The Doctrine of Buddha-Nature is impeccably Buddhist.'' [http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf], pages 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other philosophies ==
[[Baruch Spinoza]], though he argued for the existence of a permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered &quot;by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting.&quot; Buddhism teaches that such a quest is bound to fail. [[David Hume]], after a relentless analysis of the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states. Hume's [[Bundle theory]] is a very similar concept to the Buddhist ''[[skandhas]]'', though his denial of causation lead him to opposite conclusions in other areas. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy had some parallels in Buddhism.

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s &quot;word games&quot; map closely to the warning of intellectual speculation as a [[Ignoratio elenchi#Red herring|red herring]] to understanding, in a similar fashion as the Buddhist ''[[Parable of the Poison Arrow]]''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], although himself dismissive of Buddhism as yet another nihilism, developed his philosophy of accepting life-as-it-exists and self-cultivation, which is extremely similar to Buddhism as better understood in the West. [[Heidegger]]'s ideas on being and nothingness have been held by some to be similar to Buddhism today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol1/god_is_dead.html God Is Dead: What Next&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach to the comparison of Buddhist thought with Western philosophy is to use the concept of the [[Middle Way]] in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way Western philosophies can be classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view all philosophies are to be  considered non-essential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity''(Ph.D. thesis)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thornton gained early recognition as a cast member on the CBS sitcom ''[[Hearts Afire]]'' and in several early 1990s films including ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''. In the mid-1990s, after writing, directing, and starring in the [[independent film]] ''[[Sling Blade]]'', he won an [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. He appeared in several major film roles following ''Sling Blade'' 's success, including 1998's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and ''[[A Simple Plan (film)|A Simple Plan]].'' During the late 1990s, Thornton began a career as a singer-songwriter. He has released three albums and was the singer of a [[blues rock]] band.

== Early life ==
Thornton was born in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; the son of Virginia Roberta (née Faulkner), a [[psychic]], and William Raymond &quot;Billy Ray&quot; Thornton (November 1929–August 1974), a high school history teacher and basketball coach who passed away when Thornton was 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; He has two younger brothers, Jimmy Don (April 1958–October 1988), who died abruptly of a heart attack at 30, and John David (born 1969), who resides in California. Jimmy Don Thornton wrote a number of songs, two of which--&quot;Island Avenue&quot; and &quot;Emily&quot;--Thornton has recorded on his solo albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com |title=Social Security Death Index |publisher=Ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, Thornton lived in both [[Alpine, Arkansas]], and [[Malvern, Arkansas]]. He was raised a [[Methodist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/212/story_21242.html |title=Billy Bob Thornton, Astronaut Farmer |publisher=BeliefNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an extended family in a shack that had neither electricity nor plumbing. Thornton graduated from high school in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2174 |title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture |publisher=Encyclopediaofarkansas.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good high school [[baseball]] player, he tried out for the [[Kansas City Royals]], but was let go after an injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;driving&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/article2503490.ece |title=On the Move: Billy Bob Thornton |work=The Times |date=September 23, 2007 | location=London | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | first=Gill | last=Pringle}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short period laying asphalt for the [[Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department|Arkansas State Transportation Department]], he attended [[Henderson State University]] to pursue studies in psychology, but he dropped out after two semesters.

In the mid 1980s, Thornton settled in Los Angeles, to pursue his career as an actor, with future writing partner Tom Epperson.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; Thornton initially had a difficult time succeeding as an actor, and worked in [[telemarketing]], [[offshore construction|offshore]] [[wind farm]]ing,&lt;ref name=&quot;driving&quot; /&gt; and [[fast food]] management between auditioning for acting jobs. He also played drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer. While Thornton worked as a waiter for an industry event, he served film director and screenwriter [[Billy Wilder]], who is famous for films such as ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. Thornton struck up a conversation with Wilder, who advised Thornton to consider a career as a screenwriter.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

== Career ==
===Film===
One of Thornton's early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom ''[[Hearts Afire]]'' with [[John Ritter]] and [[Markie Post]]. His role as the villain in 1992's ''[[One False Move]]'', which he also co-wrote, brought him to the attention of critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; He also had small roles in the early 1990s films ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'', ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', ''[[Bound by Honor]]'', ''Grey Knight'', and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''. Thornton put Wilder's advice to good use, and went on to write, direct and star in the [[independent film]] ''[[Sling Blade]]'', which was released in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; The film, an expansion of a short film titled ''[[Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade]]'', introduced the story of Karl Childers, a mentally handicapped man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder. ''Sling Blade'' garnered international acclaim.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; Thornton's screenplay earned him an [[Academy Award]] for Best Adapted Screenplay, a [[Writers Guild of America Award]], and an [[Edgar Award]], while his performance received Oscar and [[Screen Actors Guild]] nominations for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

In 1998, he portrayed the [[James Carville|James-Carville]]-like Richard Jemmons in ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]''. Thornton adapted the book ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' into a 2000 [[All the Pretty Horses (film)|film with the same name]], starring [[Matt Damon]] and [[Penélope Cruz]]. The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour) led to his decision to never direct another film (a subsequent release, ''[[Daddy and Them]]'', had been filmed earlier). Also in 2000, an early script which he and Tom Epperson wrote together was made into ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'' which starred [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Hilary Swank]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Greg Kinnear]], and [[Giovanni Ribisi]].

Thornton's screen persona has been described by the press as that of a &quot;tattooed, [[hirsutism|hirsute]] man's man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jamshowbiz&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=JAM!

In 2001, he directed ''[[Daddy and Them]]'', while also securing starring roles in three hollywood pictures, ''[[Monster's Ball]]'', ''[[Bandits]]'' and ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There]]'', for which he received many awards. He played a malicious mall [[Santa Claus]] in 2003's [[Bad Santa]], a [[black comedy]] that performed well at the box office and established Thornton as a leading comic actor, and in the same year, portrayed a womanizing President of the United States in the British romantic comedy ''[[Love Actually]]''. Thornton has stated that, following ''Bad Santa'''s success, audiences &quot;like to watch [him] play that kind of guy,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jamshowbiz&quot; /&gt; and &quot;they [casting directors] call [him] up when they need an asshole.

He will next star in the drama ''[[Peace Like a River]]''.
